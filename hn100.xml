<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been working on Keygen for coming up on 8 years now (May 22nd, to <a href="https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-api/commit/84e8ccc35ea4accaf45d8bf529ba554650465644">be exact</a>).
In that time, it's an understatement to say that I've learned a lot. One of the things I've
learned is that a lot of founders, myself included, ignore some pretty crucial business
metrics. One of those metrics that we'll be talking about today is <strong>time-to-convert</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first started Keygen, I did what everybody probably does and set up a 14-day free
trial. What I quickly found is that it's very hard for a potential customer to integrate
a software licensing API into their entire stack within a 14 days timeframe.</p>
<p>So I started offering free trial extensions. I'd push this on my pricing page, in onboarding
emails, in follow up emails, etc. I wanted to make potentional customers aware that
<em>they had more time.</em></p>
<p>What I found over the next couple years was that the majority of converting customers had
asked for a free trial extension. And out those that <em>did</em> and those that <em>didn't</em>, my
conversion rate was higher when they <em>did</em> ask for one.</p>
<p>Was there a reason <em>why</em> this was the case? Possibly!</p>
<p>When I extended a trial, I would require the potential customer to put a card on file
before I extended their trial. So we go from free trial without a card, to free trial
with a card. Much better.</p>
<p>You may be thinking — what does this have to do with time-to-convert?</p>
<p>We'll get there.</p>
<p>Anyways — after discovering that free trial extensions increase conversion rate, I started
personally sending emails to potentional customers that were nearing their trial's end to
offer a trial extension. This was a pretty big success.</p>
<p>So much of a success, actually, that I stopped being so strict about requiring a card be
put on file — mainly out of laziness — because it was such an annoying back-and-forth
step to do before extending a potential customer's trial.</p>
<p>Unintuitively to what I learned prior, this didn't hurt conversion rate (so that potential
reason for a higher conversion rate was moot).</p>
<p>I chugged along manually extending trials for a couple more years.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://keygen.sh/blog/how-i-replaced-baremetrics-and-chartmogul-with-rake/">I got fed up with limited metrics from Baremetrics and replaced it with a Rake task</a>.
I no longer use that Rake task (it didn't scale as my Stripe customer count grew), but through
that, I learned about my <strong>time-to-convert</strong>, which is a crucial business metric that remains
unknown to many, many founders (myself included at the time).</p>
<p>What is time-to-convert? It's the time it takes from a customer signing up to a customer
paying you. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>(For brevity, I'll refer to this metric as <strong>TTC</strong>.)</p>
<p>So why was this such a big deal?</p>
<p>Well, because my 14-day free trial didn't line up with the time it takes a customer to realize
value from Keygen — to get to that fork in the road where they can decide "is this worth
my money?"</p>
<p>I gave them 14 days to get to that fork.</p>
<p>But my p50 TTC is <em>41 days.</em> My p90, 130 days; p95, 198; p99, 290.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I realized that what I was <em>really doing</em> was asking people to sign up
<em>now</em> and complete a proof-of-concept integration <em>in 14 days.</em> This includes reading
documentation, onboarding, and planning and executing a proof-of-concept (PoC).</p>
<p>But my median TTC is 41 days!</p>
<p>That just doesn't work.</p>
<p>Understanding and integrating a new API can be a lot. On top of other projects, it can
end up being impossible to do in 14 days, from first discovery to being integrated
(or at least with a PoC in-hand).</p>
<p>What I was really asking potential customers to do was <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>Wait until they're ready to start understanding the API.</p>
<p>Wait until they're ready to go through onboarding.</p>
<p>Wait until the PoC is planned.</p>
<p>Wait until dev is freed up.</p>
<p>Wait. Wait. Wait.</p>
<p>What ends up happening is that people get busy and they end up seeing that 14 day
deadline, determine that they're not ready yet, so they bounce until they <em>are</em>
ready, but then <em>they never come back.</em></p>
<p>I decided that I needed to remove that friction. I wanted to capture these leads
as soon as they decide Keygen may be the solution for them. So ultimately, I can
start nurturing these leads.</p>
<p>So I did what every bootstrapper tells you to never do…</p>
<p>I added an unlimited trial, a.k.a. <em>a free tier.</em></p>
<p>What happened next?</p>
<p>Overall sign ups increased, of course, as it always does with a free tier. But by
segmenting out users that stay on the free tier, I found paid sign ups also increased,
with conversion rate staying steady, but now with no manual work. I say that's a
win-win.</p>
<p>So, what's your TTC?</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>

	<p><span><span>W</span></span>ASHINGTON – Two New York University professors collaborated directly with executives of the vaping company Juul without disclosing those relationships to academic journals or Congress, a STAT investigation reveals.</p>
<p>At the height of the youth vaping crisis, when many public health experts were calling for sweeping action that could upend the entire industry, David Abrams and Ray Niaura emerged as two authoritative voices willing to defend vaping — despite its growing popularity among youth — as an effective public health strategy to help adults cut back or quit smoking.</p>
<p>Abrams, a frequent commentator about vaping in the news media, including CBS This Morning, CNN, and The New Yorker, coordinated extensively with Juul on public messaging in 2017 and 2018, according to company emails. Abrams asked Juul officials for talking points, allowed company executives to review an academic article prior to publishing, and attended Juul scientific advisory board meetings, all without disclosing those connections to journal publishers or the public.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm sure you agree that it has become impossible to ignore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">Generative AI</a> (GenAI), as we are constantly bombarded with mainstream news about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs). Very likely you have tried <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, maybe even keep it open all the time as an assistant.</p>
<p>A basic question I think a lot of people have about the GenAI revolution is where does the apparent intelligence these models have come from. In this article, I'm going to attempt to explain in simple terms and without using advanced math how generative text models work, to help you think about them as computer algorithms and not as magic.</p>
<h2>What Does An LLM Do?</h2>
<p>I'll begin by clearing a big misunderstanding people have regarding how Large Language Models work. The assumption that most people make is that these models can answer questions or chat with you, but in reality all they can do is take some text you provide as input and guess what the next word (or more accurately, the next <em>token</em>) is going to be. Let's start to unravel the mystery of LLMs from the tokens.</p>
<h3>Tokens</h3>
<p>A token is the basic unit of text understood by the LLM. It is convenient to think of tokens as words, but for the LLM the goal is to encode text as efficiently as possible, so in many cases tokens represent sequences of characters that are shorter or longer than whole words. Punctuation symbols and spaces are also represented as tokens, either individually or grouped with other characters.</p>
<p>The complete list of tokens used by an LLM are said to be the LLM's <em>vocabulary</em>, since it can be used to express any possible text. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding">byte pair encoding (BPE)</a> algorithm is commonly used by LLMs to generate a token vocabulary given an input dataset. Just so that you have some rough idea of scale, the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-2">GPT-2</a> language model, which is open source and can be studied in detail, uses a vocabulary of 50,257 tokens.</p>
<p>Each token in an LLM's vocabulary is given a unique identifier, usually a number. The LLM uses a <em>tokenizer</em> to convert between regular text given as a string and an equivalent sequence of tokens, given as a list of token numbers. If you are familiar with Python and want to play with tokens, you can install the <code>tiktoken</code> package from OpenAI:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install tiktoken
</code></pre>
<p>Then try this in a Python prompt:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import tiktoken
&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-2")

&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.encode("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
[464, 2068, 7586, 21831, 18045, 625, 262, 16931, 3290, 13]

&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.decode([464, 2068, 7586, 21831, 18045, 625, 262, 16931, 3290, 13])
'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'

&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.decode([464])
'The'
&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.decode([2068])
' quick'
&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.decode([13])
'.'
</code></pre>
<p>You can see in this experiment that for the GPT-2 language model token 464 represents the word "The", and token 2068 represents the word " quick", including a leading space. This model uses token 13 for the period.</p>
<p>Because tokens are determined algorithmically, you may find strange things, such as these three variants of the word "the", all encoded as different tokens by GPT-2:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.encode('The')
[464]
&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.encode('the')
[1169]
&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.encode(' the')
[262]
</code></pre>
<p>The BPE algorithm doesn't always map entire words to tokens. In fact, words that are less frequently used do not get to be their own token and have to be encoded with multiple tokens. Here is an example of a word that this model encodes with two tokens:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.encode("Payment")
[19197, 434]

&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding.decode([19197])

<h3>Next Token Predictions</h3>
<p>Given some text, a language model maked predictions about what token will follow right after. If it helps to see this with Python pseudo-code, here is how you could run one of these models to get predictions for the next token:</p>
<pre><code>predictions = get_token_predictions(['The', ' quick', ' brown', ' fox'])
</code></pre>
<p>The function gets a list of input tokens, which are encoded from the <em>prompt</em> provided by the user. In this example I'm assuming words are all individual tokens. To keep things simple I'm using the textual representation of each token, but as you've seen before in reality each token will be passed to the model as a number.</p>
<p>The returned value of this function is a data structure that assigns each token in the vocabulary a probability to follow the input text. If this was based on GPT-2, the return value of the function would be a list of 50,257 floating point numbers, each predicting a probability that the corresponding token will come next.</p>
<p>In the example above you could imagine that a well trained language model will give the token "jumps" a high probability to follow the partial phrase "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog">The quick brown fox</a>" that I used as prompt. Once again assuming a model trained appropriately, you could also imagine that the probability of a random word such as "potato" continuing this phrase is going to be much lower and close to 0.</p>
<p>To be able to produce reasonable predictions, the language model has to go through a <em>training</em> process. During training, it is presented with lots and lots of text to learn from. At the end of the training, the model is able to calculate next token probabilities for a given token sequence using data structures that it has built using all the text that it saw in training.</p>
<p>Is this different from what you expected? I hope this is starting to look less magical now.</p>
<h3>Generating Long Text Sequences</h3>
<p>Since the model can only predict what the next token is going to be, the only way to make it generate complete sentences is to run the model multiple times in a loop. With each loop iteration a new token is generated, chosen from the returned probabilities. This token is then added to the input that is given to the model on the next iteration of the loop, and this continues until sufficient text has been generated.</p>
<p>Let's look at a more complete Python pseudo-code showing how this would work:</p>
<pre><code>def generate_text(prompt, num_tokens, hyperparameters):
    tokens = tokenize(prompt)
    for i in range(num_tokens):
        predictions = get_token_predictions(tokens)
        next_token = select_next_token(predictions, hyperparameters)
        tokens.append(next_token)
    return ''.join(tokens)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>generate_text()</code> function takes a user prompt as an argument. This could be, for example, a question.</p>
<p>The <code>tokenize()</code> helper function converts the prompt to an equivalent list of tokens, using <code>tiktoken</code> or a similar library. Inside the for-loop, the <code>get_token_predictions()</code> function is where the AI model is called to get the probabilitles for the next token, as in the previous example.</p>
<p>The job of the <code>select_next_token()</code> function is to take the next token probabilities (or predictions) and pick the best token to continue the input sequence. The function could just pick the token with the highest probability, which in machine learning is called a <em>greedy selection</em>. Better yet, it can pick a token using a random number generator that honors the probabilities returned by the model, and in that way add some variety to the generated text. This will also make the model produce different responses if given the same prompt multiple times.</p>
<p>To make the token selection process even more flexible, the probabilities returned by the LLM can be modified using <em>hyperparameters</em>, which are passed to the text generation function as arguments. The hyperparameters allow you to control the "greediness" of the token selection process. If you have used LLMs, you are likely familiar with the <code>temperature</code> hyperparameter. With a higher temperature, the token probabilities are flattened out, and this augments the chances of less likely tokens to be selected, with the end result of making the generated text look more creative or unusual. You may have also used two other hyperparameters called <code>top_p</code> and <code>top_k</code>, which control how many of the highest probable tokens are considered for selection.</p>
<p>Once a token has been selected, the loop iterates and now the model is given an input that includes the new token at the end, and one more token is generated to follow it. The <code>num_tokens</code> argument controls how many iterations to run the loop for, or in other words, how much text to generate. The generated text can (and often does) end mid-sentence, because the LLM has no concept of sentences or paragraphs, since it just works on one token at a time. To prevent the generated text from ending in the middle of a sentence, we could consider the <code>num_tokens</code> argument as a maximum instead of an exact number of tokens to generate, and in that case we could stop the loop when a period token is generated.</p>
<p>If you've reached this point and understood everything then congratulations, you now know how LLMs work at a high level. Are you interested in more details? In the next section I'll get a bit more technical, while still doing my best to avoid referencing the math that supports this technology, which is quite advanced.</p>
<h2>Model Training</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, discussing how a model is trained is actually difficult without using math. What I'm going to do is start by showing you a very simple training approach.</p>
<p>Given that the task is to predict tokens that follow other tokens, a simple way to train a model is to get all the pairs of consecutive tokens that appear in the training dataset and build a table of probabilities with them.</p>
<p>Let's do this with a short vocabulary and dataset. Let's say the model's vocabulary has the following five tokens:</p>
<pre><code>['I', 'you', 'like', 'apples', 'bananas']
</code></pre>
<p>To keep this example short and simple, I'm not going to consider spaces or punctuation symbols as tokens.</p>
<p>Let's use a training dataset that is composed of three sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like apples</li>
<li>I like bananas</li>
<li>you like bananas</li>
</ul>
<p>We can build a 5x5 table and in each cell write how many times the token representing the row of the cell is followed by the token representing the column. Here is the table built from the three sentences in the dataset:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>-</th>
<th>I</th>
<th>you</th>
<th>like</th>
<th>apples</th>
<th>bananas</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>2</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>you</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>like</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>apples</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bananas</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hopefully this is clear. The dataset has two instances of "I like", one instance of "you like", one instance of "like apples" and two of "like bananas".</p>
<p>Now that we know how many times each pair of tokens appeared in the training dataset, we can calculate the probabilities of each token following each other. To do this, we convert the numbers in each row to probabilities. For example, token "like" in the middle row of the table was followed once by "apples" and twice by "bananas". That means that "apples" follows "like" 33.3% of the time, and "bananas" follows it the remaining 66.7%.</p>
<p>Here is the complete table with all the probabilities calculated. Empty cells have a probability of 0%.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>-</th>
<th>I</th>
<th>you</th>
<th>like</th>
<th>apples</th>
<th>bananas</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>100%</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>you</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>100%</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>like</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>33.3%</td>
<td>66.7%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>apples</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td></td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bananas</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The rows for "I", "you" and "like" are easy to calculate, but "apples" and "bananas" present a problem because they have no data at all, since the dataset does not have any examples with these tokens being followed by other tokens. Here we have a "hole" in our training, so to make sure that the model produces a prediction even when lacking training, I have decided to split the probabilities for a follow-up token for "apples" and "bananas" evenly across the other four possible tokens, which could obviously generate strange results, but at least the model will not get stuck when it reaches one of these two tokens.</p>
<p>The problem of holes in training data is actually important. In real LLMs the training datasets are very large, so you would not find training holes that are so obvious as in my tiny example above. But smaller, more difficult to detect holes due to low coverage in the training data do exist and are fairly common. The quality of the token predictions the LLM makes in these poorly trained areas can be bad, but often in ways that are difficult to perceive. This is one of the reasons LLMs can sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">hallucinate</a>, which happens when the generated text reads well, but contains factual errors or inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Using the probabilities table above, you may now imagine how an implementation of the <code>get_token_predictions()</code> function would work. In Python pseudo-code it would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def get_token_predictions(input_tokens):
    last_token = input_tokens[-1]
    return probabilities_table[last_token]
</code></pre>
<p>Simpler than expected, right? The function accepts a sequence of tokens, which come from the user prompt. It takes the last token in the sequence, and returns the row in the probabilities table that corresponds to that token.</p>
<p>If you were to call this function with <code>['you', 'like']</code> as input tokens, for example, the function would return the row for "like", which gives the token "apples" a 33.3% chance of continuing the sentence, and the token "bananas" the other 66.7%. With these probabilities, the <code>select_next_token()</code> function shown above should choose "apples" one out of three times.</p>
<p>When the "apples" token is selected as a continuation of "you like", the sentence "you like apples" will be formed. This is an original sentence that did not exist in the training dataset, yet it is perfectly reasonable. Hopefully you are starting to get an idea of how these models can come up with what appears to be original ideas or concepts, just by reusing patterns and stitching together different bits of what they learned in training.</p>
<h3>The Context Window</h3>
<p>The approach I took in the previous section to train my mini-language model is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>. </p>
<p>An issue with this technique is that only one token (the last of the input) is used to make a prediction. Any text that appears before that last token doesn't have any influence when choosing how to continue, so we can say that the <em>context window</em> of this solution is equal to one token, which is very small. With such a small context window the model constantly "forgets" its line of thought and jumps from one word to the next without much consistency.</p>
<p>To improve the model's predictions a larger probabilities table can be constructed. To use a context window of two tokens, additional table rows would have to be added with rows that represent all possible sequences of two tokens. With the five tokens I used in the example there would be 25 new rows in the probabilities table each for a pair of tokens, added to the 5 single-token rows that are already there. The model would have to be trained again, this time looking at groups of three tokens in addition to the pairs. Then in each loop iteration of the <code>get_token_predictions()</code> function the last two tokens from the input would be used when available, to find the corresponding row in the larger probabilities table.</p>
<p>But a context window of 2 tokens is still insufficient. For the generated text to be consistent with itself and make at least some basic sense, a much larger context window is needed. Without a large enough context it is impossible for newly generated tokens to relate to concepts or ideas expressed in previous tokens. So what can we do? Increasing the context window to 3 tokens would add 125 additional rows to the probabilities table, and the quality would still be very poor. How large do we need to make the context window?</p>
<p>The open source GPT-2 model from OpenAI uses a context window of 1024 tokens. To be able to implement a context window of this size using Markov chains, each row of the probabilities table would have to represent a sequence that is between 1 and 1024 tokens long. Using the above example vocabulary of 5 tokens, there are 5<sup>1024</sup> possible sequences that are 1024 tokens long. How many table rows are required to represent this? I did the calculation in a Python session (scroll to the right to see the complete number):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pow(5, 1024)
55626846462680034577255817933310101605480399511558295763833185422180110870347954896357078975312775514101683493275895275128810854038836502721400309634442970528269449838300058261990253686064590901798039126173562593355209381270166265416453973718012279499214790991212515897719252957621869994522193843748736289511290126272884996414561770466127838448395124802899527144151299810833802858809753719892490239782222290074816037776586657834841586939662825734294051183140794537141608771803070715941051121170285190347786926570042246331102750604036185540464179153763503857127117918822547579033069472418242684328083352174724579376695971173152319349449321466491373527284227385153411689217559966957882267024615430273115634918212890625
</code></pre>
<p>That is a lot of rows! And this is only a portion of the table, since we would also need sequences that are 1023 tokens long, 1022, etc., all the way to 1, since we want to make sure shorter sequences can also be handled when not enough tokens are available in the input. Markov chains are fun to work with, but they do have a big scalability problem.</p>
<p>And a context window of 1024 tokens isn't even that great anymore. With GPT-3, the context window was increased to 2048 tokens, then increased to 4096 in GPT-3.5. GPT-4 started with 8192 tokens, later got increased to 32K, and then again to 128K (that's right, 128,000 tokens!). Models with 1M or larger context windows are starting to appear now, allowing models to have much better consistency and recall when they make token predictions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Markov chains allow us to think about the problem of text generation in the right way, but they have big issues that prevent us from considering them as a viable solution.</p>
<h3>From Markov Chains to Neural Networks</h3>
<p>Obviously we have to forget the idea of having a table of probabilities, since a table for a reasonable context window would require an impossibly large amount of RAM. What we can do is replace the table with a function that returns an approximation of what the token probabilities would be, generated algorithmically instead of stored as a big table. This is actually something that <em>neural networks</em> can do well.</p>
<p>A neural network is a special type of function that takes some inputs, performs some calculations on them, and returns an output. For a language model the inputs are the tokens that represent the prompt, and the output is the list of predicted probabilities for the next token.</p>
<p>I said neural networks are "special" functions. What makes them special is that in addition to the function logic, the calculations they perform on the inputs are controlled by a number of externally defined <em>parameters</em>. Initially, the parameters of the network are not known, and as a result, the function produces and output that is completely useless. The training process for the neural network consists in finding the parameters that make the function perform the best when evaluated on the data from the training dataset, with the assumption that if the function works well with the training data it will work comparably well with other data.</p>
<p>During the training process, the parameters are iteratively adjusted in small increments using an algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation</a> which is heavy on math, so I won't discuss in this article. With each adjustment, the predictions of the neural network are expected to become a tiny bit better. The updated network is evaluated again against the training dataset, and the results inform the next round of adjustments. This process continues until the function performs good next token predictions on the training dataset.</p>
<p>To help you have an idea of the scale at which neural networks work, consider that the GPT-2 model has about 1.5 billion parameters, and GPT-3 increased the parameter count to 175 billion. GPT-4 is said to have about 1.76 trillion parameters. Training neural networks at this scale with current generation hardware takes a very long time, usually weeks or months.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that because there are so many parameters, all calculated through a lengthy iterative process without human assistance, it is difficult to understand how a model works. A trained LLM is like a black box that is extremely difficult to debug, because most of the "thinking" of the model is hidden in the parameters. Even those who trained it have trouble explaining its inner workings.</p>
<h3>Layers, Transformers and Attention</h3>
<p>You may be curious to know what mysterious calculations happen inside the neural network function that can, with the help of well tuned parameters, take a list of input tokens and somehow output reasonable probabilities for the token that follows.</p>
<p>A neural network is configured to perform a chain of operations, each called a <em>layer</em>. The first layer receives the inputs, and performs some type of transformation on them. The transformed inputs enter the next layer and are transformed once again. This continues until the data reaches the final layer and is transformed one last time, generating the output, or prediction.</p>
<p>Machine learning experts come up with different types of layers that perform mathematical transformations on the input data, and they also figure out ways to organize layers in ways that achieve a desired result. Some layers are of a general purpose, while others are designed to work on a specific type of input data, such as images or as in the case of LLMs, on tokenized text.</p>
<p>The neural network architecture that is the most popular today for text generation in large language models is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)">Transformer</a>. LLMs that use this design are said to be GPTs, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer">Generative Pre-Trained Transformers</a>.</p>
<p>The distinctive characteristic of transformer models is a layer calculation they perform called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)">Attention</a>, that allows them to derive relationships and patterns between tokens that are in the context window, which are then reflected in the resulting probabilities for the next token.</p>
<p>The Attention mechanism was initially used in language translators, as a way to find which tokens in an input sequence are the most important to extract its meaning. This mechanism gives modern translators the ability to "understand" a sentence at a basic level, by focusing (or driving "attention") to the important words or tokens.</p>
<h2>Do LLMs Have Intelligence?</h2>
<p>By now you may be starting to form an opinion on wether LLMs show some form of intelligence in the way they generate text. </p>
<p>I personally do not see LLMs as having an ability to reason or come up with original thoughts, but that does not mean to say they're useless. Thanks to the clever calculations they perform on the tokens that are in the context window, LLMs are able to pick up on patterns that exist in the user prompt and match them to similar patterns learned during training. The text they generate is formed from bits and pieces of training data for the most part, but the way in which they stitch words (tokens, really) together is highly sophisticated, in many cases producing results that feel original and useful.</p>
<p>On the other side, given the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate, I wouldn't trust any workflow in which the LLM produces output that goes straight to end users without verification by a human.</p>
<p>Will the larger LLMs that are going to appear in the following months or years achieve anything that resembles true intelligence? I feel this isn't going to happen with the GPT architecture due to its many limitations, but who knows, maybe with some future innovations we'll get there.</p>
<h2>The End</h2>
<p>Thank you for staying with me until the end! I hope I have picked your interested enough for you to decide to continue learning, and eventually facing all that scary math that you cannot avoid if you want to understand every detail. In that case, I can't recommend Andrej Karpathy's <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">Neural Networks: Zero to Hero</a> video series enough.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                            <p>The depths of the river Thames in London hold many unexpected stories, gleaned from the recovery of prehistoric tools, Roman pottery, medieval jewelry, and much more besides. Yet the tale of the lost (and since recovered) Doves typeface is surely one of the most peculiar.</p>
<p>A little over a century ago, the printer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-James-Cobden-Sanderson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T.J. Cobden-Sanderson</a> took it upon himself to surreptitiously dump every piece of this carefully honed metal letterpress type into the river. It was an act of retribution against his business partner, <a href="https://www.cheltenhammuseum.org.uk/collection/the-private-press-movement-emery-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emery Walker</a>, whom he believed was attempting to swindle him.</p>
<p>The pair had conceived this idiosyncratic Arts and Crafts typeface when they founded the <a href="https://www.emerywalker.org.uk/doves-press" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doves Press</a> in the London’s Hammersmith neighborhood, in 1900. They worked with draftsman Percy Tiffin and master punch-cutter Edward Prince to faithfully recall the Renaissance clarity of 15th-century Venetian fonts, designed by the revolutionary master typographer Nicolas Jensen.</p>

<p>With its extra-wide capital letters, diamond shaped punctuation and unique off-kilter dots on the letter “i,” Doves Type became the press’s hallmark, surpassing fussier typographic attempts by their friend and sometime collaborator, William Morris.</p>
<p>The letterforms only existed as a unique 16pt edition, meaning that when Cobden-Sanderson decided to “bequeath” every single piece of molded lead to the Thames, he effectively destroyed any prospect of the typeface ever being printed again. That might well have been the case, were it not for several individuals and a particularly tenacious graphic designer.</p>
<p>Robert Green first became fascinated with Doves Type in the mid-2000s, scouring printed editions and online facsimiles, to try and faithfully redraw and digitize every line. In 2013, he released the first downloadable version on <a href="https://typespec.co.uk/doves-type-revival/">typespec</a>, but remained dissatisfied. In October 2014, he decided to take to the river to see if he could find any of the original pieces.</p>

<p>Using historical accounts and Cobden-Sanderson’s <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/hirshhorn-video-diaries-artists-isolation-1843464" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diaries</a>, he pinpointed the exact spot where the printer had offloaded his wares, from a shadowy spot on Hammersmith bridge. “I’d only been down there 20 minutes and I found three pieces,” he said. “So, I got in touch with the Port of London Authority and they came down to search in a meticulous spiral.” The team of scuba divers used the rather low-tech tools of a bucket and a sieve to sift through the riverbed.</p>
<p>Green managed to recover a total of 151 sorts (the name for individual pieces of type) out of a possible 500,000. “It’s a tiny fraction, but when I was down by the river on my own, for one second it all felt very cosmic,” he said. “It was like Cobden-Sanderson had dropped the type from the bridge and straight into my hands. Time just collapsed.”</p>
<p>The finds have enabled him to further develop his digitized version and has also connected him with official <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/an-amateur-metal-detectorist-makes-a-one-in-a-billion-find-2430194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mudlarks</a> (people who search riverbanks for lost treasures, with special permits issued) who have uncovered even more of the type.</p>

<p>Jason Sandy, an architect, author and member of the Society of Thames Mudlarks, found 12 pieces, which he has donated to <a href="https://www.emerywalker.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emery Walker’s House</a> at 7 Hammersmith Terrace. This private museum was once home to both business partners, and retains its stunning domestic Arts and Crafts interior.</p>
<p>Much like Green, Sandy was captivated by the Doves Type story, and mounted an exhibition at the house that displays hundreds of these salvaged pieces, including those discovered by Green, as well as mudlarks Lucasz Orlinski and Angus McArthur. The show was supplemented by a whole host of Sandy’s other finds, including jewelry and tools. An extant copy of the Doves English Bible is also on display.</p>

<p>“It is not that unusual to find pieces of type in the river,” Sandy said. “Particularly around Fleet Street, where newspaper typesetters would throw pieces in the water when they couldn’t be bothered to put them back in their cases. But this is a legendary story and we mudlarks love a good challenge.” The community is naturally secretive about exactly where and how things are found. For example, Orlinski has worked under the cover of night with a head torch, to search for treasures at his own mysterious spot on the riverbank.</p>
<p>For Sandy, the thrill comes from the discovery of both rare and everyday artifacts, which can lead to an entirely new line of inquiry: “The Thames is very democratic. It gives you a clear picture of what people have been wearing or using over thousands of years. And it’s not carefully curated by a museum. The river gives up these objects randomly, and you experience these amazing stories of ordinary Londoners. It creates a very tangible connection to the past. Every object leads you down a rabbit hole.”</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>kNumber_Of_Channels</code> is used to set the number of channels. Be careful when specifying high channel counts. Although BlackHole is designed to be extremely efficient at higher channel counts it's possible that your computer might not be able to keep up. Sample rates play a roll as well. Don't use high sample rates with a high number of channels. Some applications don't know how to handle high channel counts. Proceed with caution.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>kLatency_Frame_Size</code> is how much time in frames that the driver has to process incoming and outgoing audio. It can be used to delay the audio inside of BlackHole up to a maximum of 65536 frames. This may be helpful if using BlackHole with a high channel count.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>kSampleRates</code> set the sample rate or sample rates of the audio device. If using multiple sample rates separate each with a comma (<code>,</code>). For example: <code>kSampleRates='44100,48000'</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">When all are set to true a 2nd BlackHole will show up that works exactly the same. The inputs and outputs are mirrored so the outputs from both devices go to the inputs of both devices.</p>

							  		              <h2><a href="https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/x_org_on_netbsd_the">X.Org on NetBSD - the state of things</a></h2>
<p>May 04, 2024 posted by <i>Nia Alarie</i></p>

  <p>
A few years ago, I wrote a "state of things" blog post about
<a href="https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/wayland_on_netbsd_trials_and">Wayland on NetBSD</a>.
It's only natural that I should do one about X11, which
is used by far more people to get a graphical environment on NetBSD.
</p>

<p><img src="https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/nia/glxgears.png" alt="Spinning glxgears, a classic X.Org program."></p><p>
There are a lot of differences from how NetBSD and the typical distributor
ship X.Org. For one, we ship it as an optional monolithic package rather than
separate individual packages. This means every driver is included on every system,
rather than as an optional module. Sometimes, this means we need
to fine-tune driver selection to ensure the correct drivers are loaded
on the correct hardware, since multiple conflicting drivers can
claim a video output. We also want sensible fallbacks, since if you're
using a GPU from the future with an old OS version, you probably
want X to seamlessly fall back to a regular framebuffer.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, the way our "xsrc" repository is set up, it's effectively
functioning as a fork of X.Org that regularly pulls from upstream
freedesktop.org (but does not push back). This allows X development
to happen as part of NetBSD.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, we use our own build system based purely on BSD makefiles,
not X.Org's based on GNU autotools. This fits well with our build.sh
cross-compilation system.
</p>

<p>
We have a number of drivers which have not made their way upstream.
Perhaps the most ubiquitous of these is xf86-input-ws, a driver which
came from OpenBSD, targets an API from NetBSD, and continues to be
developed in both. This is a generic input driver that can
support any pointing device that the kernel supports.  Unlike
xf86-input-mouse, it doesn't assume the device is a mouse, and
can support advanced touchpad and touchscreen features.
Other NetBSD exclusives include xf86-video-pnozz,
xf86-video-mgx, and xf86-video-crime.
While these all share the "xf86" name inherited from the historical
XFree86 distribution, none of them are exclusively for x86.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of drivers that are accelerated when used
in NetBSD, but the acceleration support is missing upstream.
This is mostly due to the work of macallan@, who has diligently
worked on drivers for accelerators found on SPARC and PowerPC hardware.
</p>

<p>
X.Org has historically supported two 2D acceleration modes,
<a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/Performance/">XAA and EXA</a>.
XAA seems complicated - according to the X.Org Foundation it
supports accelerating "patterned fills and Bresenham lines" (eh?).
XAA was removed from the X.Org server in 2012, and many old drivers
were not updated to support the newer and simpler EXA model,
except in NetBSD, over a time period of several years.
</p>

<p>
Did you know that Nvidia
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/380704/">used to have</a> an open source graphics
driver? It supported 2D acceleration for a range of cards.
In NetBSD, it's retained for platforms that included embedded
Nvidia chips and aren't capable of (or predate, or don't want)
the modern novueau driver. Six years ago, it was updated in NetBSD
to support EXA acceleration.
</p>

<p>
There are a few ways our X integration could be improved.
While lots of attention has been paid to the server, less
has been paid to clients (programs).  Did you know that X
includes a
<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-10.0/xedit.1">text editor,</a>
and that text editor supports syntax
highlighting and spell checking?
</p>

<p><img src="https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/nia/xedit.png" alt="xedit, the standard editor"></p><p>
NetBSD includes its own command-line spell checker and associated
dictionaries, <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-10.0/spell.1">spell(1)</a>,
inherited from the BSD UNIX of yore.
It's pretty basic, and only supports
variations of English. To get spell checking to work in xedit, you need
to install ispell (another command-line spell checker) from pkgsrc, install
a dictionary, then set some Xresources (or create symlinks) to make
sure xedit finds ispell. This could surely be streamlined
by teaching xedit about spell.
</p>

<p>
We also ship every program that has been included with
historical X.Org distributions. This includes well-known
things like
<a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/">xterm</a>, slightly less well-known things like 
<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/xbiff.1">xbiff(1)</a>, and obscurities like
<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-10.0/bitmap.1">bitmap(1)</a>
(apparently a 1-bit-per-pixel alternative to MS Paint).
A while ago, we removed some libraries which are no longer used by the modern
X server, and maybe we should evaluate whether we need
all of these programs too.
<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-10.0/xmh.1">xmh(1)</a>
is a frontend for a mail system that isn't included in base.
Together, bitmap and xmh are around 300 kilobytes.
</p>

<p>
We include fonts, bitmaps and scalable, for a wide range of
computing devices. In the latest versions of NetBSD, the font size
will automatically scale with the screen size to support HiDPI displays
as well as small mobile devices.
However, we don't ship a scalable cursor theme at the moment.
We're also missing high-resolution fonts for Japanese,
a shame considering the popularity of NetBSD in Japan.
<a href="https://koruri.github.io/">Koruri</a> looks interesting
and is suitably small, maybe we should import it.
</p>

<p>
While we have many useful simple programs by default (a clock,
a calculator, an editor, a window manager, a compositor,
a terminal emulator...), we're notably missing a screen locking
program for X in the default install,
although we have <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/lock.1">lock(1) for the tty.</a>
</p>

<p>
The big question - does all this have a future?
The good news is that all new hardware has generic support in X.
Someone writes either a modesetting kernel driver or a classical wsdisplay
kernel driver and they will be automatically supported by the associated
drivers in X.
The bad news is that to have applications running we require access to
a larger open source ecosystem, and that ecosystem has a lot of churn
and is easily distracted by shiny new squirrels.
The process of upstreaming stuff to X.Org is an ongoing process, but
it's likely we'll run into things that will never be suitable for upstream.
</p>

<p>
Of course, on NetBSD, you also have the option of trying vanilla
modular X.Org from pkgsrc, or using
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4igLujPyK0M">something else entirely</a>.

<p>In a new scientific paper funded by an Ames Space Biology grant, Principal Investigator Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory strains of the bacterial species <em>Enterobacter bugandensis</em> isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were studied. Thirteen strains of <em>E. bugandensis, </em>a bacterium notorious for being multi-drug resistant, were isolated from the ISS. Study findings indicate under stress, the ISS isolated strains were mutated and became genetically and functionally distinct compared to their Earth counterparts. The strains were able to viably persist in the ISS over time with a significant abundance. <em>E. bugandensis </em>coexisted with multiple other microorganisms, and in some cases could have helped those organisms survive. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Publication Impact: </strong>Closed human-built environments, such as the ISS, are unique areas that provide an extreme environment subject to microgravity, radiation, and elevated carbon dioxide levels. Any microorganisms introduced to these areas must adapt to thrive. By delving into microbial dynamics in extreme environments, this research opens doors to effective preventative measure for astronaut health.</p>

<p>The what and the why in a single image:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/bollard.jpg" alt="bollard"></p>

<p>A bollard is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>any sort of physical barricade strong enough, shaped in such a way, that if a vehicle tries to overlap with the bollard in location, intentional or not, the vehicle cannot cross. Sometimes they’re built into the physical environment, sometimes not. They can be movable or not. Large and intrusive, or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/smol_bollard.jpg" alt="smol_bollard"></p>

<p><em>source: <a href="https://twitter.com/WorldBollard/status/1785595490358247717">@worldbollard twitter account</a></em></p>

<p>In the words of a local city engineer’<sup id="fnref:will-not-be-named" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:will-not-be-named" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, <em>as he was explaining why a bollard placed near where pedestrians congregate to cross a large roadway would be innapropriate</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barriers (bollards, guardrail, etc.) are considered for installation if the result of a vehicle striking the barrier will be less severe than hitting the unshielded object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a placement like this makes intuitive sense:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/pencil_bollard.jpg" alt="pencil_bollard"></p>

<p><em>source: <a href="https://twitter.com/WorldBollard/status/1656022438507946014">@worldbollard twitter account</a></em></p>

<p>You’ll never unsee this:</p>

<p>https://www.urbanismspeakeasy.com/p/take-another-look-at-where-they-put</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But public works and transportation departments routinely install guardrails <em>on the outside of a sidewalk</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, please stop evaluating local transportation administrations as competent. I’ve hung out with these people, gone on walks with them, driven around with them, listened to them get excited about a new pedestrian affordence they’ve installed, and the lack of awareness and closemindedness (which is obviously necessary to sustain a shitty system creaking into it’s 100th year of existance) is stunning.</p>

<p>To interact with local transportation administrations <em>requires</em> that you 1) self-abandon, and 2) maintain performative allegience to a pseudo-scientific view of the world.</p>
      <h2 id="what-are-not-bollards">
        
        
          What are <em>not</em> bollards? <a href="#what-are-not-bollards">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p><em>It’s tricky to hit the right emotional tone of why bollards matter. Sometimes it seems academic and dry, sometimes its very visceral and raw.</em></p>

<p>Where there are not bollards, there are careening, speeding vehicles, and often enough death and destruction.</p>

<p>To park a vehicle, one needs to press the correct pedel. When people are driving unfamilar vehicles, or rushed, or whatever, sometimes the wrong peddle gets pushed. Would you suggest that this small error should result in death of people and the elimination of businesses and buildings?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>vehicle operator makes error when parking</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1cfs0np/why_cars_should_be_restricted"><img src="https://josh.works/images/car_in_store.png" alt="car_in_store"></a></p>

<p>When there are not bollards, in areas where people are promised safety, even if everyone behaves correctly, there are still failures. For example…</p>

<p>Once, a widely respected member of a local software development community and their partner (also a widely respected member of the same community) were walking on a sidewalk in California one night a few years ago. Far from them, a speeding car struck another car of course careened through the sidewalk. Both friends were hit by the car. She was killed instantly, he was knocked unconcious, woke up days later to find out the news. <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/29-year-old-woman-identified-as-victim-in-S-F-16189585.php">The lanugage in the article is full of ‘this was an unavoidable tragedy’</a>, though i think it’s obvious a local city engineer ought to be held criminally liable for their neglect.</p>

<p>Because not only was it entirely preventable, it was also statistically inevitable. Not putting bollards where they need to be is like not only <em>not wearing a seatbelt</em> when driving, but arguing that <em>seatbelts should not be available in cars because usually they’re not needed</em>.</p>

<p>A bollard is just a seatbelt for someone outside of the vehicle.</p>

<p>So… this is the sort of devestation done to a community that everyone would obviously want to prevent. And this exact pattern plays out many times a day.</p>

<p>So, when there’s <em>not</em> bollards, often enough, there are cars.</p>

<p>Here’s another example - even souless corporate entities understand bollards and appreciate that they have a duty of responsibility to people who are using their spaces:</p>

<p><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/2/8/23591381/7-eleven-storefront-crash-settles-lawsuit-bensenville">7-Eleven to pay $91 million to suburban man who lost both legs because they didn’t install bollards at <em>that</em> location.</a></p>

<p>It’s a normal occurrance. Notice down below how often this kind of thing happens. I hope there’s bollards at every 7/11 now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 57-year-old suburban man who became a double amputee after a car pinned his legs against the front of a Bensenville 7-Eleven will receive a $91 million payout from the convenience store chain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a moment, you’ll see the kinds of vehicle-strikes-building results this refers to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The case was the first in which attorneys had access to some 15 years of reports from 7- Eleven, which identified some 6,253 storefront crashes at 7-Eleven stores across the country, Power said. Data from a previous lawsuit against the company identified another 1,525 crashes between 1991 and 1996.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who in the story do you think uttered the following?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important to note that this unfortunate accident was caused by a reckless driver who pled guilty, and this store followed all local building codes and ordinances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the legal representation of 7/11, but you can also hear the local city manager or city engineer saying ‘it was not my fault either!’. (“followed all local buildiong codes and ordinances”)</p>

<p>Maybe it would feel poetic if he was also a car-user, having his life destroyed by a car, but he didn’t even have a car.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Carl was a frequent customer of the Bensenville store, and most days would walk a few blocks from an apartment he shared with his three sons to buy his morning coffee…</p>

  <p>[the morning of this tragic-yet-statistically-inevitable systemic failure] Carl’s ride was running late, and a man pulling into a parking space in front of the store stepped on his car’s accelerator instead of the brake. The car lurched over the curb, across a sidewalk and pinned Carl against the storefront, causing injuries that would require the amputation of both his legs above the knees. Another driver had crashed into the front of the same store 16 months earlier, Power said.</p>
</blockquote>

          What does not bollards look like <a href="#what-does-not-bollards-look-like">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>In the context of ‘bollards as protecting store-fronts from cars’, sort of akin to a physical insurance policy, here’s what moving vehicles, through stores, can look like.</p>

<p>I wonder what losses the involved parties were able to recoup. Presumably insurance would make partial financial repairs, but it would all be at great opportunity cost, hassle, sadness, anger.</p>

<p>Even a <em>rock</em>, obtained functionally for free, could have fully prevented this. Again, no one’s fault, but it hurts to see damage accrue.</p>

<p>👉 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1cfs0np/why_cars_should_be_restricted/">driver presses wrong peddle when parking outside store</a></p>

<p>I dislike the caption. It says “woman forgets…” which feels like it’s possibly playing into the mysogentistic sentiment that some people are, for reasons of fundamental inferiority, unable to develop a certain skill.</p>

<p>It should say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>vehicle operator makes error when parking</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1cfs0np/why_cars_should_be_restricted"><img src="https://josh.works/images/car_in_store.png" alt="car_in_store"></a></p>

<p>This sort of incident would be perfectly prevented by bollards like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/tiny_bollards.jpg" alt="tiny_bollards"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/WorldBollard/status/1729592943927767072">source: @worldbollard</a></em></p><hr>

<p>I live in the Cheesman park area in Denver, there’s already plenty of bollards and bollard-passing objects (trees, light poles, boulders) and I’d love for there to be many more, following similar-enough patterns of what is already placed, with some reasonable, obvious iteration.</p>

<p>Bollards are like iceburgs. Some bollards are not placed deep into the ground or very strong, and might deform under a vehicle impact. Some bollards are quite firmly placed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><i>XZ Utils cyberattack likely not an isolated incident</i></h2>
<p>By Robin Bender Ginn, Executive Director, OpenJS Foundation; and Omkhar Arasaratnam, General Manager, Open Source Security Foundation</p>
<p><span>The recent attempted </span><a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2024/03/30/xz-backdoor-cve-2024-3094/"><span>XZ Utils backdoor</span></a><span> (</span><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3094"><span>CVE-2024-3094</span></a><span>) may not be an isolated incident as evidenced by a similar credible takeover attempt intercepted by the <a href="https://openjsf.org/">OpenJS Foundation</a>, home to JavaScript projects used by billions of websites worldwide. The Open Source Security (OpenSSF) and OpenJS Foundations are calling all open source maintainers to be alert for social engineering takeover attempts, to recognize the early threat patterns emerging, and to take steps to protect their open source projects.</span></p>
<h2><b>Failed Credible Takeover Attempt</b></h2>
<p><span>The OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council received a suspicious series of emails with similar messages, bearing different names and overlapping GitHub-associated emails. These emails implored OpenJS to take action to update one of its popular JavaScript projects to “address any critical vulnerabilities,” yet cited no specifics. The email author(s) wanted OpenJS to designate them as a new maintainer of the project despite having little prior involvement. This approach bears strong resemblance to the manner in which “Jia Tan” positioned themselves in the XZ/liblzma backdoor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>None of these individuals have been given privileged access to the OpenJS-hosted project. The project has security policies in place, including those outlined by the </span><a href="https://github.com/openjs-foundation/security-collab-space"><span>Foundation’s security working group</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The OpenJS team also recognized a similar suspicious pattern in two other popular JavaScript projects not hosted by its Foundation, and immediately flagged the potential security concerns to respective OpenJS leaders, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</span></p>
<p><span>Open source projects always welcome contributions from anyone, anywhere, yet granting someone administrative access to the source code as a maintainer requires a higher level of earned trust, and it is not given away as a “quick fix” to any problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Together with the Linux Foundation, we want to raise awareness of this ongoing threat to all open source maintainers, and offer practical guidance and resources from our broad community of experts in security and open source.</span></p>
<h2><b>Suspicious patterns in social engineering takeovers:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Friendly yet aggressive and persistent pursuit of maintainer or their hosted entity (foundation or company) by relatively unknown members of the community.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Request to be elevated to maintainer status by new or unknown persons.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Endorsement coming from other unknown members of the community who may also be using false identities, also known as “sock puppets.”</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>PRs containing blobs as artifacts.</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>For example, the XZ backdoor was a cleverly crafted file as part of the test suite that wasn’t human readable, as opposed to source code.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Intentionally obfuscated or difficult to understand source code.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Gradually escalating security issues.</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>For example, the XZ issue started off with a relatively innocuous replacement of safe_fprintf() with fprintf() to see who would notice.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Deviation from typical project compile, build, and deployment practices that could allow the insertion of external malicious payloads into blobs, zips, or other binary artifacts.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A false sense of urgency, especially if the implied urgency forces a maintainer to reduce the thoroughness of a review or bypass a control.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>These social engineering attacks are exploiting the sense of duty that maintainers have with their project and community in order to manipulate them. Pay attention to how interactions make you feel. Interactions that create self-doubt, feelings of inadequacy, of not doing enough for the project, etc. might be part of a social engineering attack.</span></p>
<p><span>Social engineering attacks like the ones we have witnessed with XZ/liblzma were successfully averted by the OpenJS community. These types of attacks are difficult to detect or protect against programmatically as they prey on a violation of trust through social engineering. In the short term, clearly and transparently sharing suspicious activity like those we mentioned above will help other communities stay vigilant. Ensuring our maintainers are well supported is the primary deterrent we have against these social engineering attacks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Steps to help secure your open source project:</b></h2>
<p><span>In addition to these recommendations, there are a number of security best practices that can improve the security properties of our projects. While these recommendations will not thwart a persistent social engineering attack, they may help improve your overall security posture of your project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Consider following industry-standard security best practices such as </span><a href="https://openssf.org/resources/guides/"><span>OpenSSF Guides</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use strong authentication.</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or Multifactor Authentication (MFA).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Use a secure password manager.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Preserve your recovery codes in a safe, preferably offline place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Do not reuse credentials/passwords across different services.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Have a security policy including a </span><a href="https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide"><span>“coordinated disclosure”</span></a><span> process for reports.</span></li>

<h2><b>Steps for industry and government to help secure critical open source infrastructure:</b></h2>
<p><span>The pressure to sustain a stable and secure open source project creates pressure on maintainers. For example,</span> <span>many projects in the</span> <span>JavaScript ecosystem are maintained by small teams or single developers who are overwhelmed by commercial companies who depend on these community-led projects yet contribute very little back.</span></p>
<p><span>To solve a problem of this scale, we need vast resources and public/private international coordination. There is already great work underway by the following organizations:</span></p>
<h2><b>Open source foundations</b><span>: </span></h2>
<p><span>The Linux Foundation family of foundations and other similar organizations like ours can help provide a safety net for open source projects. Maintainers often lack the time, people and expertise in areas such as security. Neutral foundations help support the business, marketing, legal and operations behind hundreds of open source projects that so many rely upon. Our goal is to remove any friction outside of coding to support our maintainers and help their projects grow. As vendor-neutral nonprofits, we are uniquely positioned to offer expertise garnered from multiple stakeholders represented in our organizations.</span></p>
<p><span>On security, our open source foundations have found that an effective best approach is to provide technical assistance and direct support to open source projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alpha-Omega is an associated project of the OpenSSF, funded by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, funds critical projects and ecosystems. The project aims to build a world where critical open source projects are secure and where security vulnerabilities are found and fixed quickly.&nbsp; The OpenJS Foundation has experienced how funding developers for security has had a proven impact through Alpha-Omega investments in Node.js and jQuery.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sovereign Tech Fund: </b><span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The Sovereign Tech Fund, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, is providing the OpenJS Foundation and more open source organizations significant funding to strengthen infrastructure and security.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They have built a model with detailed reporting and accountability of resources, yet at the same time, have technical expertise on staff to customize security proposals for the variety of open source projects they fund.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s encouraging to see the German government taking this initiative to improve the lives of citizens by investing in critical open source infrastructure through the Sovereign Tech Fund.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We are advocating for more global public investment in initiatives like the Sovereign Tech Fund to invest in open source global that society depends on, complimentary to private funding. We recommend that public institutions learn from, adapt and coordinate with Germany’s Sovereign Tech Fund to support our interconnected open source projects and shared digital economies.</p>
<h2><b>About OpenJS Foundation</b></h2>
<p><span>The OpenJS Foundation is committed to supporting the healthy growth of the JavaScript ecosystem and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities for the benefit of the community at large. The OpenJS Foundation is made up of 35 open source JavaScript projects including Appium, Electron, Jest, jQuery, Node.js, and webpack and is supported by corporate and end-user members, including GoDaddy, Google, HeroDevs, IBM, Joyent, Microsoft, and the Sovereign Tech Fund. These members recognize the interconnected nature of the JavaScript ecosystem and the importance of providing a central home for projects which represent significant shared value.</span></p>
<h2><b>About the OpenSSF</b></h2>
<p><span>The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) is a cross-industry initiative by the Linux Foundation that brings together the industry’s most important open source security initiatives and the individuals and companies that support them. The OpenSSF is committed to collaboration and working both upstream and with existing communities to advance open source security for all.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                

<p><img src="https://alnvdl.github.io/assets/img/squareplanner_screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the squareplanner web-based furniture design tool">
<em>Live example: <a href="https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/">https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/</a></em></p>

<p>At one point during the construction of my house, we needed designs for the kitchen and bathroom cabinets and a bedroom wardrobe.</p>

<p>In my country, this type of furniture is usually mounted under countertops or onto the bedroom walls using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-density_fibreboard">MDF</a> boards. This type of material lends itself to a lot of customization.</p>

<p>People usually pay specialized professionals (or companies) to design and build this kind of MDF furniture for their houses, and it can go from very cheap to very expensive depending on one’s choices of materials and finishing. These designers use specialized software (usually a 3D CAD), and the output is not only the design, but a detailed bill of materials. This output then gets sent to a factory, which cuts, finishes and delivers the boards and related materials directly to the destination, where it’s usually assembled by people working for the company that designed the furniture.</p>

<p>As we did with the house blueprint, we wanted full control over every part of the design. We found it’s much easier to make the designs ourselves, rather than imposing vetoes and “suggestions” on a designer’s work, which can be annoying for both the designer and for ourselves.</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to learn a bespoke 3D CAD software just for this. But I still needed a way to clearly communicate my ideas to the person designing and overseeing the manufacturing of our furniture. 2D was enough, as the depth of the furniture depends on where it gets placed.</p>

<p>My wife started drawing her ideas in Adobe Illustrator, but it was hard work. So you just noticed you need to add a new drawer? Now you have to redraw and move the other pieces around. Did you just realize that your stand mixer won’t fit in a module that is only 35cm tall? You may need to rethink the whole cabinet… My wife and I would discuss an idea, and then it’d take her some manual work to redraw the whole thing. Repeat that a few times, and we were spending a lot of time on this.</p>

<p>One important realization struck me when looking at her designs though: most of the time, it’s basically rectangles fitted together in a delimited area. And when designing it, if we changed our minds, these rectangles should respond to changes according to certain rules. For example, I might want that drawer to be 38cm wide, but I don’t care about the size of the doors next to it.</p>

<p>At first I thought of writing a Python script that would take a text description, calculate a few things and output measurements in text. But that would not be very visual, so it was hard to grasp for both ourselves and the furniture designers. Plus, I’d have to write some code that fits rectangles. I was losing motivation, as it would require some non-trivial work, and the end result would not look nice anyway. Was there any software I knew that did at least some of this work for me?</p>

<p><strong>What if I could be lazy and reuse an existing calculation engine, while at the same time getting a nice graphical output?</strong> Of course, I later realized that instead of writing a calculator I ended up having to write a transpiler, but by then I was too involved to give up.</p>

<p>It turns out that fitting rectangles if basically what modern web browers do. Web developers and designers have been fitting rectangles in complex ways for a while now with concepts such as the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox">flexbox</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout">grid</a> layouts. Professionally, I’m mostly a backend developer, but I venture myself in web development from time to time, and I had read great things about the CSS grid layout, so I decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>After studying the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">CSS grid layout on MDN</a>, I realized it was the perfect fit. I could tell the browser:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>this column is 78px tall, and I want 4 rows that are 38px wide in it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or in other words:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>this module is 78cm tall, and I want 4 drawers that are 38cm wide in it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I was not going to write HTML and CSS by hand, as that is not much better than dragging boxes in Illustrator. What about the input format for that stillborn Python script? At first, I came up with something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>cabinet 200cm x 95cm top 3cm bottom 14cm scale 5
    38cm
*   drawer
*   drawer
*   drawer
*   drawer
</code></pre></div>

<p>In other words: my cabinet should be 200cm wide and 95cm tall. There will be a countertop taking 3cm at the top, and a base mount taking 14 cm at the bottom. I want a module that is 38cm wide, and I want 4 drawers in it, and I don’t care about their height as long at they fit. The word <code>drawer</code> doesn’t have any special meaning, and any word can be used to identify the rectangles.</p>

<p>As I kept on adding things, I needed more expressiveness to do the things I wanted:</p>
<div><pre><code>cabinet 200cm x 95cm top 3cm bottom 14cm scale 5
    38cm     *      *      *        38cm
*   drawer   door   door   drawer   drawer:red
*   drawer   ^      ^      drawer   &lt;
*   drawer   ^      ^      drawer   &lt;
*   drawer   ^      ^      drawer   &lt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example we can see a few new things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>*</code> means “I don’t care, make it fit for me”;</li>
  <li>A number followed by <code>cm</code> is a required width or height (in centimeters);</li>
  <li><code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>^</code> are saying “continue whatever is to the left/right or above”;</li>
  <li>Adding <code>:red</code>, <code>:green</code> or <code>:blue</code> after the name of a rectangle makes it have that color;</li>
  <li>The <code>scale</code> is mostly a hacky way of hinting how big things should be so that labels fit into rectangles;</li>

<p>Of course, I didn’t develop this little language beforehand, as I mostly didn’t know what I was doing at first. I was basically discovering new things I needed to express when designing new parts, and I then extended the code until it did everything I wanted.</p>

<p>It turns out this little language was enough to describe everything I needed, including my ridiculously over-engineered wardrobe <a href="https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/#lock: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">external</a> and <a href="https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/#lock: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">internal</a> designs.</p>

<p>Originally, input was hardcoded in the file. Then I moved it into an editable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea"><code>textarea</code></a>, so that I could easily tweak it in the browser and see the results in realtime.</p>

<p>I also needed a way to easily share this with the person designing the furniture in the 3D CAD. I definitely didn’t want to host this anywhere (I’m cheap). But I needed an easy and safe way to share this relatively complex data. There’s a trick I have used in several projects before: store information in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hash">URL hash</a>. JavaScript code can both write the hash it and read it. There’s a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers">limitation of 2048 characters in URLs</a>, but if I couldn’t describe my furniture in 2048 characters, I probably wouldn’t be able to afford it anyway :)</p>

<p>When sharing a design, I didn’t want people opening the page and accidentally pressing keys in the editor, breaking my carefully laid out rectangles and then delivering me a cabinet with giant drawers. If you press <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>L</code> on the page, it will lock the text area to prevent editing, and persist that lock state into the URL so it can be safely shared.</p>

<p>Ah, and I also realized it would be useful to have comments for myself and for the people reading the designs. So I added comments to the mini language (lines beginning with <code>#</code>). And colors too, as I needed to highlight a few things in the diagram so people could relate them to the comments (for example, <code>drawer:red</code> will make a red drawer).</p>

<p>And I’d need to print and export this to PDF, to carry with me, make notes and adaptations as I decided on the designs. So there’s a bit of CSS for adapting the page for nicer print output, and the browser then takes care of printing to PDF.</p>

<p>Finally, it was getting really annoying coding in that language, full of whitespaces and columns and rows. By this point, it had become a pet project, so why not just add code formatting? Pressing <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>F</code> in the editable <code>textarea</code> will cause the code to be formatted in columns.</p>

<p>And that’s it. I spent around 5 evenings working on this. I think I would actually have spent more time dragging rectangles with my wife in Illustrator, given how slow we were (and how much we were arguing over every decision). At least with this tool, it became extremely cheap to prototype weird cabinet designs together, only to realize they were actually not that bad.</p>

<p><strong>You can play with this tool yourself: <a href="https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/">https://alnvdl.github.io/squareplanner/</a></strong></p>

<p>There is no server-side code, just static HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and it is hosted as a static page.</p>

<p>It’s not written using any frameworks, if you push it too hard it will draw weird things, it’s not unit- or integration-tested, and it does not follow a particularly academic or professional approach to the transpilation process. I guess making it more “serious” would have been possible, but in this case I just wanted to get my furniture designed fast, and keeping the code simple and small helped in that. At the time I designed this, I had dozens of other problems to solve in the construction. Looking at the end result, it’s amazing to to see all the complexity supported by modern browsers, which enable an application like this to be written in just ~550 non-minified LOC (or ~18KB).</p>

<p>In the end, the person designing the furniture in the 3D CAD had very few questions and was able to do their work. This design was also used by the company making the countertops, and we also used it throughout the construction process to help define where to place power outlets and pipes behind the cabinets (yes, we took the whole “design the house of your dreams” thing a bit too seriously).</p>

<p>And the end result was exactly as we wanted. I’m sharing this in the hope that it can be useful for someone else in the same situation as I was, or maybe help someone who is learning about the CSS grid layout.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <h2><a href="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/">are-we-flying</a></h2>
      

      

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/masthead.png" alt="masthead image of a cockpit with browsers loaded in the cockpit screens"></p>

<p>To allay any concerns: this is not about running JavaScript software to control an actual aircraft.</p>

<p><strong><em>That would kill people</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Instead, we’re writing a web page that can control an autopilot running in JS that, in turn, controls a little virtual aeroplane. And by “little” I actually mean “most aeroplanes in <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</a>” because as it turns out, MSFS comes with an API that can be used to both query <em>*and set*</em> values ranging from anything as simple as cockpit lights to something as complex as spawning a fleet of aircraft and making them fly in formation while making their smoke pattern spell out the works of Chaucer in its original middle English.</p>

<p>While we’re not doing that (…today?), we <em>*are*</em> going to write an autopilot for planes that don’t have one, as well as planes that do have one but that are just a 1950’s chore to work with, while also tacking on some functionality that just straight up doesn’t exist in modern autopilots. The thing that lets us perform this trick is that MSFS comes with something called <a href="https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Programming_Tools/SimConnect/SimConnect_SDK.htm">SimConnect</a>, which is an SDK that lets people write addons for the game using C, C++, or languages with .NET support… and so, of course, folks have been writing connectors to “port” the SimConnect function calls to officially unsupported languages like Go, Node, Python, etc.</p>

<p>Which means that we could, say, write a web page that allows us to see what’s going on in the game. And toggle in-game settings. And –and this is the one that’s the most fun– <em>fly the plane</em> from a web page. And once we’re done “it’ll be that easy” but the road to get there is going to take a little bit of prep work… some of it tedious, some of it weird, but all of it’s going to set us up for just doing absolutely ridiculous things and at the end of it, we’ll have a fully functional autopilot <em>with auto-takeoff and flight planning that’s as easy as using google maps</em> and whatever’s missing, you can probably bolt on yourself!</p>

<p>Before we get there though, let’s start at the start. If the idea is to interface with MSFS from a webpage, and webpages use JS, then your first thought might be “Cool, can I write an <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> server that connects to MSFS?” to which the answer is: yes! There is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-simconnect">node-simconnect</a> package for <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a>, which implements full access to the SimConnect DLL file, but it’s very true to the original C++ SDK, meaning it’s a bit like “programming C++ in JavaScript”. Now, you might like that (I don’t know your background) but JS has its own set of conventions that don’t really line up with the C++ way of doing things, and because I know my way around programming and I like writing JS, I created a somewhat more “JavaScripty” API on top of node-simconnect called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper">msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper</a> (I am <em>*great*</em> at naming things) which lets me (and you!) write code that can talk to MSFS in a way that looks and feels much more like standard JavaScript, so… let’s use that!</p>

<p>Also, because we want to talk “from the browser to a game”, we don’t really want to have to rely on HTML GET and POST requests, because they’re both slow, and unidirectional: the game will never be able to talk to us unless it’s to answer a question we sent it. That’s not great, especially not if we want to register event handlers, so instead we’ll use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">web sockets</a>, which let us set up a persistent bidirectional data connection And to make that a trivial task, we’re going to use a library called <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/socketless">“socketless”</a>, which lets us write client/server code as if everything is just local code, and it magically makes things work over the network.</p>

<p>If that sounds cool: you can check out the complete project over on the <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/are-we-flying">“Are we flying?”</a> Github repository, and you can just clone that and run the project with a simple <code>run.bat</code>, but if you want to actually learn something… let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="the-structure-of-this-tutorial">The structure of this “tutorial”</h2>

<p>We’ll be tackling this whole thing in six parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the first part we’ll cover the prep work we need to do in order to set up a working combination of MSFS, a SimConnect API server for communicating to and from MSFS, and a web server that hosts a webpage and takes care of communicating to and from the API server.</li>
  <li>In the the second part we’ll cover the “web page pages”, where we’re going to visualize everything we can visualize relating to our flights in MSFS, including graphs that plot the various control values over time (altitude, speed, heading, trim values, etc.) to get a better insight into how our aeroplane(s) responds to control inputs.</li>
  <li>In the third part we’ll cover the thing you came here for: writing our own autopilot (in several stages of complexity) and making our computer fly planes all on its own!</li>
  <li>In the fourth part, we’re going to cover the “flight path” part of a modern autopilot, but rather than programming specific radio beacons and airports, we’re going the google maps route, where you just place markers on the map and then the plane flies the path through those markers.</li>
  <li>Part five is dedicated to running test flights and rewriting some of our code based on the flight behaviour of a variety of in-game planes ranging from ultra light to commercial jet airliners.</li>
  <li>In the sixth part, we’re going to cover the thing you didn’t even realize you came here for: literally making JavaScript fly our plane for us, where we spawn a plane on the runway, click “take off” in the browser and have the plane just… start flying in MSFS with us along for the ride, following our flight path with automatic elevation detection, and then when we click “land”, having the autopilot find a nearby airport, figure out an approach, and then land the plane for us. <em>Because we can</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And along the way we’re going to learn a few developer tricks like hot reloading ES modules, mocking SimConnect, and other such fun things.</p>

<p>By the time we’re done, we’ll have a web page that looks a little bit like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/sim-view-on-map.png" alt="sim view on the map"></p>

<p>While the in game view looking like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/in-game-sim-view.png" alt="in-game sim view"></p>

<p>or this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/in-game-sim-view-outside.png" alt="in-game sim view outside"></p>

<p>If that sounds (and looks) good to you, then read on!</p>

<h2 id="part-1-the-prep-work">Part 1: The prep work</h2>

<p>As mentioned, we’re going to have to do a bit of prep work before we can start writing the fun stuff, so let’s get this done. We’re going to implement three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An API server that talks directly to MSFS, and accepts web socket connections that can be used by API clients to interact with MSFS,</li>
  <li>a web server that serves a webpage, and accepts web socket connections from the webpage, which it can forward to the API server, and</li>
  <li>a web page with some code that connects it to the API (as far as it knows) using a web socket and can show the various aspects of a flight.</li>
</ol>

<p>In high fidelity image media, we’ll be implementing this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/server/server-diagram.png"></p>

<p>And as mentioned, to make our lives a little easier we’re going to be using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/socketless">socketless</a> library to take care of the actual client/server management, so we can just focus on writing the code that’s going to let us show a user interface based on talking to MSFS. The nice thing about this library is that it does some magic that lets clients and servers call functions on each other “without knowing there’s a network”. If the server has a function called <code>test</code> then the client can just call <code>const testResult = await this.server.test()</code> and done, as far as the client knows, the server is just a local variable. Similarly, if the client has a function called <code>test</code> then server can call that with a <code>const testResult = await this.clients[...].test()</code> and again, as far as the server knows it’s just working with a local variable.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-our-project">Setting up our project</h2>

<p>Let’s start by creating a new dir somewher called <code>are-we-flying</code> and initialising it as a Node project:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>mkdir </span>are-we-flying
<span>&gt;</span> <span>cd </span>are-we-flying
are-we-flying&gt; npm init <span>-y</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>after which we can install the dependencies that we’ll need: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv">dotenv</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/open">open</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/socketless">socketless</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper">msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> npm i dotenv open socketless msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, we want to make sure to tell Node that we we’ll be writing normal, modern JS with JS modules, rather than Node’s legacy module system: open <code>package.json</code> and add the key/value pair <code>"type": "module"</code> .</p>

<h2 id="an-env-file">An .env file</h2>

<p>Next up, we’ll create a file called <code>.env</code> that will house a few variables that we want to be using across all our code:</p>

<pre><code>WEB_PORT=3000
API_PORT=8080
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing fancy, just two port numbers for now.</p>

<h2 id="a-socketless-api-and-web-servers">A “socketless” API, and web servers</h2>

<p>Before we look at the “real” code we want to write, let’s quickly run through the “boilerplate” code we need to run our API server, which we’ll put in <code>api-server.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// First we load our .env file:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>url</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:url</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>__dirname</span> <span>=</span> <span>url</span><span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url</span><span>));</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dotenv</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>dotenv</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>dotenv</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>({</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>__dirname</span><span>}</span><span>/.env`</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// And get our API server's port from that environment:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>API_PORT</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Then we set up socketless so it can do its thing:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>createServer</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>socketless</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>ServerClass</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./src/classes/index.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Where "its thing" is creating an API server instance:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>webserver</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>createServer</span><span>(</span><span>ServerClass</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Which we then run like you would any other Node server.</span>
<span>webserver</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>API_PORT</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Server listening on http://localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>API_PORT</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s all the code we need to set up a server (ignoring the actualy <code>ServerClass</code>, which we’ll look at in a bit). So next up is the code required to run the “web server” part of our above diagram, which we’ll put in <code>web-server.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We start the same was as above:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>url</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:url</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>__dirname</span> <span>=</span> <span>url</span><span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url</span><span>));</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dotenv</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>dotenv</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>dotenv</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>({</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>__dirname</span><span>}</span><span>/.env`</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// Instead of "just a server" our web server will act as a client</span>
<span>// to our API server, but as web server for browsers that try to</span>
<span>// connect. As such we need to know both the port for our API server</span>
<span>// as well as what port we should use for our own server:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>API_PORT</span><span>,</span> <span>WEB_PORT</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Then we set up a socketless client with "browser connection" functionality:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>ClientClass</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./src/classes/index.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>createWebClient</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>socketless</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Clients need to know which URL to find the server at:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>serverURL</span> <span>=</span> <span>`http://localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>API_PORT</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span>

<span>// And web clients need to know which directory/folder to serve static content from:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>dir</span> <span>=</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>__dirname</span><span>}</span><span>/public`</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Which means we can now create our "web-enabled client":</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>clientWebServer</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>createWebClient</span><span>(</span><span>ClientClass</span><span>,</span> <span>serverURL</span><span>,</span> <span>dir</span><span>);</span>

<span>// And then we run its web server the same way we ran the API server:</span>
<span>clientWebServer</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>WEB_PORT</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Server listening on http://localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>WEB_PORT</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>

  <span>// With an extra bit that automatically opens a browser for us:</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>argv</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>`--browser`</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>open</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>then</span><span>(({</span> <span>default</span><span>:</span> <span>open</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>`http://localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>WEB_PORT</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So a tiny bit more code, but that’s all we need to do in terms of setting up our “API server ↔ client ↔ browser” constellation. The <code>socketless</code> library takes care of all of that so we can focus on actually implementing the code we <em>care</em> about. And on that note, let’s look at that code because we have two classes to implement:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the server class, which will be our interface between MSFS and our clients, and</li>
  <li>the client class, which will be our interface between the server and the browser.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="but-first-some-testing">But first, some testing!</h3>

<p>Before we implement those though, let’s verify that the code we wrote even works by implementing some tiny client and server classes with just enough code to show connections and function calls to work. Let’s create a <code>src/classes/index.js</code> with “dummy” client and server classes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Our client class will announce its own connection, as well as browser connections:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>ClientClass</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// nothing special going on here, just a console log</span>
  <span>onConnect</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`[client] We connected to the server!`</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// and nothing special going on here either, just more console log</span>
  <span>onBrowserConnect</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`[client] A browser connected!`</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Our server class will also announce that it got client connections:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServerClass</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// still nothing special going on here...</span>
  <span>onConnect</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`[server] A client connected!`</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...but we do add a little test function that clients can call:</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`[server] test!`</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>"</span><span>success!</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, to add the browser into the mix, we’ll also create a quick <code>public/index.html</code> file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Let's test our connections!<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"js/index.js"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"module"</span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!-- we only need to look at the developer tools "console" tab for now --&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then a bare minimum amount of browser JS in <code>public/js/index.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We don't need to put a "socketless.js" in our public dir,</span>
<span>// this is a "magic import" that works when we're connected</span>
<span>// to a socketless web server:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>createBrowserClient</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../socketless.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Then we set up our browser client to announce its connections:</span>
<span>class</span> <span>BrowserClient</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`[browser] We're connected to our web client!`</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// And then as part of startup, we'll call the server's</span>
    <span>// test function, just to confirm that works:</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Calling test:`</span><span>,</span> <span>await</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>test</span><span>());</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Then the only thing left to do in the browser is to create a browser client instance:</span>
<span>createBrowserClient</span><span>(</span><span>BrowserClient</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s it, we just implemented a full server + client + browser constellation!</p>

<p>So let’s run <code>node api-server.js</code> in a terminal, and <code>node web-server.js --browser</code> in another. Doing so will show us the following text in the server terminal:</p>

<div><pre><code>...&gt; node api-server.js
Server listening on http://localhost:8080
[server] A client connected!
[server] test!
</code></pre></div>

<p>And will show us the following in the client terminal:</p>

<div><pre><code>...&gt; node web-server.js --browser
Server listening on http://localhost:3000
Opening a browser...
[client] We connected to the server!
[client] A browser connected!
</code></pre></div>

<p>And, because the <code>--browser</code> flag opened a browser, if we look at the browser’s developer tools’ <code>console</code> tab, we see:</p>

<div><pre><code>[browser] We're connected to our web client!                            index.js:9:17
Calling test: success!
</code></pre></div>

<p>Awesome, we have a complete API server + web server + browser thin client and “things just work™”, we didn’t have to write a single line of websocket or remote function calling code!</p>

<h2 id="our-api-server">Our API server</h2>

<p>Let’s finish up the basics.</p>

<p>Our server is where we “talk to MSFS”, and any functions that we expose on the server class will end up being a function that, as far as clients know, is just part of their local <code>this.server</code> object, so we’ll want to make sure to keep things that should not be directly accessible to clients either out of the serverclass (i.e. declare and initialize them in module scope instead) or mark them as private using the <code>#</code> character, so that they can’t be called by anyone else.</p>

<p>With that in mind, let’s write a <em>real</em> server clas, in its own <code>src/classes/server/server.js</code> file instead, so we’re not mixing client and server code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Load the environment:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>url</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:url</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>__dirname</span> <span>=</span> <span>url</span><span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url</span><span>));</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dotenv</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>dotenv</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>dotenv</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>({</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>__dirname</span><span>}</span><span>/../../../.env`</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// And get the "how frequentlu to poll" from theÏ environment.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>POLLING_INTERVAL</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>POLLING_INTERVAL</span> <span>??</span> <span>2500</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Then, an import for a setTimeout that ignores throws:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>runLater</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../../utils/utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// And two helper functions for setting up the API connection:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>connectServerToAPI</span><span>,</span> <span>registerWithAPI</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./helpers.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Plus a helper that we can expose as `this.api` for clients to work with:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>APIRouter</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./routers/api-router.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// And then the most important import: the MSFS connector</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>MSFS_API</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// In order to prevent clients from directly accessing the MSFS</span>
<span>// connector, we're going to make it a global (to our module):</span>
<span>let</span> <span>api</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Next up, our server class:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServerClass</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>clients</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// set up the API variable - note that because this is a global,</span>
    <span>// clients can't directly access the API. However, we'll be setting</span>
    <span>// up some API routing to make that a non-issue in a bit.</span>
    <span>api</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MSFS_API</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Set up call handling for API calls: this will be explained after we</span>
    <span>// finish writing this class. We bind it as `this.api` so that any</span>
    <span>// client will be able to call `this.server.api...` and have things work.</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>api</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>APIRouter</span><span>(</span><span>api</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Then wait for MSFS to come online</span>
    <span>connectServerToAPI</span><span>(</span><span>api</span><span>,</span> <span>async</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Connected to MSFS.`</span><span>);</span>

      <span>registerWithAPI</span><span>(</span><span>clients</span><span>,</span> <span>api</span><span>);</span>
      <span>clients</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>onMSFS</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>));</span>

      <span>// And when it's online and we're connected, start polling for when we're "in game".</span>
      <span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>poll</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// We'll look at what actually goes here once we have everything in place.</span>
        <span>// For now, we just schedule a poll</span>
        <span>runLater</span><span>(</span><span>poll</span><span>,</span> <span>POLLING_INTERVAL</span><span>);</span>
      <span>})();</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>/**
   * Then a minimum amount of code for When a client connects to us,
   * and MSFS is already connected.
   */</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>onConnect</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>api</span><span>?.</span><span>connected</span><span>)</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>onMSFS</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let’s look at those secondary imports: first, the simplest one, in <code>src/utils/utils.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>runLater</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>,</span> <span>timeoutInMillis</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// this is literally just setTimeout, but with a try/catch so</span>
  <span>// that if the function we're running throws an error, we</span>
  <span>// completely ignore that instead of crashing the server.</span>
  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>fn</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>},</span> <span>timeoutInMillis</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then those helper functions for working with the API in <code>src/classes/server/helpers.js</code></p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We'll grab the list of system events from the MSFS connector, so we can register for a few events:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>SystemEvents</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Then mostly for organizational purposes ("to keep the code clean")</span>
<span>// we house the actually MSFS API connection properties here.</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>connectServerToAPI</span><span>(</span><span>api</span><span>,</span> <span>onConnect</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>({</span>
    <span>autoReconnect</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
    <span>retries</span><span>:</span> <span>Infinity</span><span>,</span>
    <span>retryInterval</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
    <span>onConnect</span><span>,</span>
    <span>onRetry</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Can't connect to MSFS, retrying in </span><span>${</span><span>s</span><span>}</span><span> seconds`</span><span>),</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// And since this is basically a "run once" thing we also house the code</span>
<span>// that registers for pause and crash events here.</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>registerWithAPI</span><span>(</span><span>clients</span><span>,</span> <span>api</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`Registering API server to the general sim events.`</span><span>);</span>

  <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>SystemEvents</span><span>.</span><span>PAUSED</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>clients</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>pause</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>

  <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>SystemEvents</span><span>.</span><span>UNPAUSED</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>clients</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>unpause</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>

  <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>SystemEvents</span><span>.</span><span>CRASHED</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>clients</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>crashed</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>

  <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>SystemEvents</span><span>.</span><span>CRASH_RESET</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>clients</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>crashReset</span><span>());</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which leaves the code that lets clients call API functions through the server</p>

<h3 id="the-api-router">The API Router</h3>

<p>The <code>APIRouter</code> code lets clients interface “directly” with MSFS through the SimConnect driver, with five main functions that we can expose to clients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register: register as event listener for one of the (few) “subscription” based MSFS event.</li>
  <li>forget: the opposite of register.</li>
  <li>get: a way to get the current value(s) for SimConnect variable(s).</li>
  <li>set: a way to set variable(s) to specific value(s).</li>
  <li>trigger: a way to trigger one of the (<em>many</em>) sim events.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s look at how we expose those to the client in a file that we’ll call <code>src/classes/routes/api-router.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Obviously we'll need to load the list of events if we're going to let clients register for events:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>SystemEvents</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>eventTracker</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>

<span>// And in order to cache GET requests, we're going to hash requests based on</span>
<span>// the varname collection we get passed, which we'll do by hashing.</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>createHash</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:crypto</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>resultCache</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>

<span>// Since there is only one API instance, we can cache that</span>
<span>// at the module level, just like in the server class.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>api</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>APIRouter</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// And then we bind that variable using the constructor:</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>_api</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>api</span> <span>=</span> <span>_api</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Then, when clients call this.server.register(...), we:</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>register</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>eventNames</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>connected</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eventNames</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>eventName</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>#</span><span>registerEvent</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>eventName</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// With a private function for registering events on the API:</span>
  <span>#</span><span>registerEvent</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>eventName</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>tracker</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>eventTracker</span><span>[</span><span>eventName</span><span>]</span> <span>??=</span> <span>{</span> <span>listeners</span><span>:</span> <span>[]</span> <span>});</span>

    <span>// One that can response to custom "api server only" event requests:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>eventName</span> <span>===</span> <span>`MSFS`</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>onMSFS</span><span>(</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>connected</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// And has additional logic for making sure a client doesn't "double-register":</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>tracker</span><span>.</span><span>listeners</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>
        <span>`Ignoring </span><span>${</span><span>eventName</span><span>}</span><span> registration: client already registered. Current value: </span><span>${</span><span>tracker</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>
      <span>);</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// When a client registers for a sim event like "SIM" or "FLIGHT_LOADED",</span>
    <span>// we assume we can call them back with event information on function</span>
    <span>// names like onSim and onFlightLoaded:</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>eventHandlerName</span> <span>=</span>
      <span>`on`</span> <span>+</span>
      <span>eventName</span>
        <span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>`_`</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>v</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>].</span><span>toUpperCase</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>v</span><span>.</span><span>substring</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>toLowerCase</span><span>())</span>
        <span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>``</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// So: ask the API to register for this event, with an appropriate</span>
    <span>// bit of code to handle "what to do when SimConnect flags this event".</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>tracker</span><span>.</span><span>off</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>tracker</span><span>.</span><span>off</span> <span>=</span> <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>SystemEvents</span><span>[</span><span>eventName</span><span>],</span> <span>(...</span><span>result</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>tracker</span><span>.</span><span>listeners</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>

        <span>);</span>
      <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// And when clients call this.server.forget(...), we do the opposite:</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>forget</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>eventName</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>connected</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>eventTracker</span><span>[</span><span>eventName</span><span>].</span><span>listeners</span><span>.</span><span>findIndex</span><span>(</span>
      <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span> <span>===</span> <span>client</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// And when clients call this.server.get(...), we cache the set of simvars</span>
  <span>// that are being requested, so we don't ask SimConnect for the same data</span>

<p>Phew. That was a lot of code! But hopefully, it all made sense. Because we still have to look at our client class… which is going to be a <em>lot</em> less code =)</p>

<h2 id="our-browser-connection-accepting-client">Our browser-connection-accepting client</h2>

<p>In addition to our API server, we’re going to need a client that is also a web server, so that we can connect a browser and actually, you know, <em>use</em> all of this. This means we’ll have to define a client class such that <code>socketless</code> can take care of the rest. Thankfully, this is super easy: our client doesn’t need to “do” anything other than make sure that values make it from the server to the browser, and vice versa, so we’re going to essentially be writing a state-manager, where the client takes signals from the server and turns them into updates to its <code>this.state</code> variable, and then <code>socketless</code> will take care of the tedious “making sure the browser gets that” parts. So: client class time! (which we put in its own <code>src/classes/client.js</code>)</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, let’s move on to the browser.</p>

<h2 id="the-browser-code">The browser code</h2>

<p>In order for the browser to be able to “do something”, we’ll use the <code>index.html</code> we made earlier without any modifications, but we’ll update <code>index.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>createBrowserClient</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../socketless.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Let's import a class that's *actually* going to do all the work...</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Plane</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./js/plane.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// And then we update our browser client, whose sole responsibility</span>
<span>// is to hand off state updates to our new "Plane" object:</span>
<span>class</span> <span>BrowserClient</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>init</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>plane</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Plane</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>async</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>prevState</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// set a class on the HTML body based on our connection state...</span>
    <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>`connected`</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>serverConnection</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// And then, ather than "doing anything" here, we just pass the current</span>
    <span>// state on to the Plane. All we do in this file is wait for the next update.</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>plane</span><span>.</span><span>updateState</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>createBrowserClient</span><span>(</span><span>BrowserClient</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So that just leaves looking at our <code>Plane</code> code, which will minimal for now, andwe’ll put in <code>public/js/plane.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We'll be building this out throughout this document, but this</span>
<span>// will be our main entry point when it comes to what the browser</span>
<span>// shows in terms of both visualisation and interactivity.</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Plane</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>;</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>lastUpdate</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>lat</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
      <span>long</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
      <span>flying</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
      <span>crashed</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>async</span> <span>updateState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// ...nothing here yet, but we'll be filling this out in soon enough!</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>lastUpdate</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>time</span><span>:</span> <span>now</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>state</span> <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s it. There’s nothing “meaningful” in our plane class yet, but for the moment we’re done: we’ve set up a complete API server, web server, and browser system.</p>

<h2 id="adding-permission-control">Adding “permission control”</h2>

<p>That just leaves one last thing: making sure that only “we” get to talk to MSFS directly. We don’t want people to just spam MSFS with API requests or even set values or trigger MSFS event and mess with our flight, or worse!</p>

<p>In order to do that, we first add three new keys to our <code>.env</code> file to act as a security key:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>API_PORT</span><span>=</span>8080
<span>export </span><span>WEB_PORT</span><span>=</span>3000
<span>export </span><span>FLIGHT_OWNER_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>"dXNlcm5hbWVwYXNzd29yZA=="</span>
<span>export </span><span>FLIGHT_OWNER_USERNAME</span><span>=</span>username
<span>export </span><span>FLIGHT_OWNER_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>password
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> conversion of the string concatenation <code>"username" + "password"</code>… super secure! Of course, when we make our web page available, we’ll want to make triple-sure that we change this key to something a little more secret-appropriate =)</p>

<p>Then, let’s update our <code>server.js</code> class with a function that clients can call in order to authenticate:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>FLIGHT_OWNER_KEY</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServerClass</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>#</span><span>authenticatedClients</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>

    <span>// Set up call routing so that clients can call this.server.api.[...]</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>..</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, we can now make clients (and by extension, browsers) authenticate by having them call <code>this.server.authenticate(...)</code>, so let’s make that work by updating our <code>client.js</code> so it loads that key (if it has access to it) and calls the authentication function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Load in our environment variables now we have</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s our “authentication” added, so we have all the parts in place:</p>

<ol>
  <li>we can start up MSFS,</li>
  <li>we can start up our API server using <code>node api-server.js</code>,</li>
  <li>we can start up our web server using <code>node web-server.js --owner --browser</code></li>
  <li>we can have the browser open http://localhost:3000, and then</li>
  <li>we can use a UI that’s based on the current client state, with the option to get values from MSFS as well as set values and trigger events in MSFS as needed using the developer tools console.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="testing-our-code">Testing our code</h2>

<p>So, let’s run this code and <em>actually</em> talk to MSFS. First, let’s make sure we have direct access to our browser client by updating our <code>index.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>// Let's get a direct reference to our client so we can do some testing using our developer tools:</span>
<span>window</span><span>.</span><span>browserClient</span> <span>=</span> <span>createBrowserClient</span><span>(</span><span>BrowserClient</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see the <code>createBrowserClient</code> returns the actual instance it builds. There’s rarely a reason to capture that, but it can be <em>very</em> useful for testing, like now!</p>

<p>Let’s fire up MSFS and load up a plane on on a runway somewhere, run our API server, run our client with the <code>--browser</code> flag, and then let’s open the developer tools in the browser and get to the “console” tab. While there, let’s ask MSFS for some things:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>»</span> <span>await</span> <span>browserClient</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>

<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we had loaded up a De Havilland DHC-2 “Beaver”, we might get the following response:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>«</span> <span>▼</span> <span>Object</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, none of these things have units, but that’s what the <a href="https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Programming_Tools/SimVars/Simulation_Variables.htm">SimConnect documentation</a> is for: the Beaver is designed to cruise at 5000 feet, take off at 65 knots, it has a two wheels up front and a little wibble wheel at the back (i.e. it’s a “tail dragger”), it has one engine, which is a piston propeller (which we know by looking up the enum for engine type); it weighs 3955 pounds, has a wing span of 48 feet, and has a typical descent rate of 16.667 feet per second.</p>

<p>And of course, we can also ask for information that’s relevant to our flight <em>right now</em> rather than just asking about the plane in general. Say we actually took off and are cruising along, we can run:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>»</span> <span>await</span> <span>browserClient</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>And this might give us something like:</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This tells us our plane is flying over Vancouver Island at GPS coordinates -123.814803 longitude, 48.782971 latitude (both values reported in degrees radians by MSFS, not decimal degrees), with an air speed of about 140 knots (which is around 260kmh/161mph), flying at an altitude of almost 1000 feet (305m) above sea level, but really only about 573 feet (174m) above the ground. We can see that we’re flying fairly straight (our “bank” angle is basically 0), with a heading of 260 degrees on the compass (given in radians again), and we can see that we’re flying fairly straight in the vertical sense, too: the plane is currently moving up at about a third of a foot per second (so about 4”, or 10cm, per second), which is well within “flying straight” limits.</p>

<p>We can trigger events, too:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>»</span> <span>await</span> <span>browserClient</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>`TAILWHEEL_LOCK_ON`</span><span>);</span>
<span>»</span> <span>browserClient</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>trigger</span><span>(</span><span>`TOGGLE_TAILWHEEL_LOCK`</span><span>);</span>
<span>»</span> <span>await</span> <span>browserClient</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>`TAILWHEEL_LOCK_ON`</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which should result in:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>«</span> <span>▼</span> <span>Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>TAILWHEEL_LOCK_ON</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>«</span> <span>undefined</span>
<span>«</span> <span>▼</span> <span>Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>TAILWHEEL_LOCK_ON</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And of course, we can listen for events. For example, we can write this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>»</span> <span>browserClient</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>`CRASHED`</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`...we crashed!`</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now if we point our plane towards the ground and just let gravity do the rest (don’t worry, it’s just pixels, it’s perfectly safe), eventually our flight will come to an abrupt stop, the MSFS screen will go black, and we’ll get a little dialog telling us that we crashed… but if we look at the dev tools console for our web page, we’ll also see this little gem:</p>



<p>Which means our crash event listener worked. So this is promising, we have a full loop!</p>

<h2 id="hot-reloading-to-make-our-dev-lives-easier">Hot-reloading to make our dev lives easier</h2>

<p>Now, being able to write code is all well and good, but we’re going to be <em>working on that code</em> a lot, so it’d be nice if we don’t constantly have to stop and restart the server for every line we change, and instead just have code changes kick in automatically when we save files. And while there isn’t anything baked into JS to make that happen, with a bit of smart programming we can take advantage of filesystem watching, as we well as how <code>import</code> works, to make this happen for us. Anyway</p>

<p>We can, for instance, write a function that will selectively watch a single file for changes, and if it sees any, load the new code in, and then trigger an event handler for “whoever might need it” with the newly loaded code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We'll be using Node's own file watch mechanism for this:</span>

<span>// With some helpers for making sure we know where our files and modules live:</span>

<p>The thing that makes this work is usually considered a memory leak: modules are cached based on their URL, and URL query arguments count towards URL “uniqueness”, so by loading the module using a URL ending in <code>...?ts=${Date.now()}</code> we effectively load a separate, new module, thus bypassing the module caching mechanism.</p>

<p>That sounds great, but because there is no mechanism for “unloading” modules is modern JS, every save-and-reload will effectively cause a new file to be loaded in, without the old file getting unloaded, so we’re going to slowly fill up our memory… which would be a problem if our files weren’t tiny compared to how much memory modern computers (or even cell phones for that matter), have. So this is going to be a non-issue, but it’s still good to know about, and an <em>excellent</em> idea to make sure it doesn’t kick in for production code.</p>

<p>A more practical problem, though, is that we can no longer “just import something from a module”, because imports are considered constants, with <code>import { x } from Y</code> being equivalent to declarig a <code>const x = ...</code>, so we can’t “reimport” onto the same variable name. That would be a runtime error.</p>

<p>Instead, we need to be a little more clever about how we import code: we can use a top-level <code>await</code> to make the watcher load the module we want, and assign that to a mutable variable:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Get the url for "this script", since that's what relative imports will be relative to:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>url</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:url</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>__dirname</span> <span>=</span> <span>url</span><span>.</span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url</span><span>));</span>

<span>// Then import our watcher:</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>watch</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./reload-watcher.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Then, as mentioned above, we load our import as a mutable variable instead of "as an import":</span>

<p>And while that’s a bit more code, and requires an <code>await</code> (which is easy to forget!) now every time we edit <code>some-module.js</code> and save it, the watcher will reload that code for us and our <code>Something</code> variable will get updated. So that solved half of the reloading problem. The other half is making sure that if our module exports a class, that <em>instances</em> of that class get updated, too, by taking advantage of how prototype inheritance works in JS.</p>

<p>Since objects don’t have their type “baked in”, but simply follow a chain of prototype objects, we can change one of those prototype objects and basically change the identity of the object itself. Normally, this would be a bad idea(tm) but in this specific case, it’s exactly what we need to make sure that instances of any hot-reloadable classes we use get updated as part of the reload process:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We can set up our reload watcher to update not just the</span>
<span>// variable for our class, but also instances of that class:</span>
<span>let</span> <span>{</span> <span>Something</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>watch</span><span>(</span><span>__dirname</span><span>,</span> <span>`some-module.js`</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>lib</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Update our class binding:</span>
  <span>Something</span> <span>=</span> <span>lib</span><span>.</span><span>Something</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// And then update our class instance's prototype. This only works because</span>
  <span>// by the time this code runs, the "instance" variable will exist.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>instance</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>setPrototypeOf</span><span>(</span><span>instance</span><span>,</span> <span>Something</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// This swaps the old prototype for the new code, while leaving any</span>
    <span>// of the instance's own properties unaffected. Something that will be</span>
    <span>// particularly useful for changing autopilot code *while* we're flying!</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>let</span> <span>instance</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Something</span><span>();</span>

<h2 id="part-2-visualizing-flights">Part 2: visualizing flights</h2>

<p>Before we try to automate flight by writing an autopilot, it helps if we can know what “a flight” is. I mean, you and I know what a flight is, but computers not so much, especially when they can’t even see your game, so let’s figure out what information we need our code to know about before we can ask it to do the things we might want it to do.</p>

<h2 id="checking-the-game-data-what-do-we-want-to-know">Checking the game data: what do we want to know?</h2>

<p>There are two kinds of information that we’ll want our code to know about: “static” information like the name of the plane we’re flying, whether it has a tail wheel, how much it weighs, etc. and “dynamic information” like what lat/long the plane is current at, how fast it’s going, what its current pitch angle is, etc.</p>

<p>We can compile a list of properties that we’re likely going to need in order to write our autopilot, and then request all those values from MSFS at a regular interval using SimConnect, so that we can then forward that information to our autopilot code, as well as all clients, and consequently, any connected browser.</p>

<h3 id="getting-game-state-data">Getting game state data</h3>

<p>So let’s write some code that lets us relatively easily work with flight models and flight data. We’ll create a <code>src/utils/flight-values.js</code> file, and then start with the list flight model values we’ll want:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>FLIGHT_MODEL</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>

<p>Do we need all that data? Surprisingly: yes! Almost all of these will let us either bootstrap our autopilot parameters, or will let us show things we’re interested in on our web page.</p>

<p>This also looks like a lot of data, but we really do need every single one of these values if we’re going to implement an autopilot.</p>

<h3 id="converting-simconnect-values">Converting SimConnect values</h3>

<p>But: this does leave us with a problem: SimConnect isn’t really all that fussy about making sure every single value uses a unit that makes sense, or that collections of variables all use the same unit, so we’re in a situation where something like <code>PLANE_BANK_DEGREES</code>, which you would expect to be a number in degrees, is actually a number in radians. And <code>AIRSPEED_TRUE</code> is in knots, so surely <code>DESIGN_SPEED_CLIMB</code> is in knots, too, right? Nope, that’s in feet per second. Which means <code>DESIGN_SPEED_VS1</code> is in feet per second, too? Haha, no, that one <em>is</em> in knots, but “knots indicated”, so not a real speed, but what the dial in the cockpit shows on the speed gauge. Oh, and: boolean values aren’t true or false, they’re 1 or 0.</p>

<p>It’s all a bit of a mess, so let’s write some code to take of all this nonsense and make sure values are in units we can rely on, because if we don’t it’s just going to be a huge headache:</p>

<p>In this code, the contants that we import have the values 364000, 3.28084, and 1/1.68781, respectively, and the <code>exists</code> function is just a tiny function that checks whether a value is either <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>, because we want to overwrite a value if it exist, rather than if it doesn’t exist, and there is no opposite of the <code>??=</code> operator.</p>

<p>Which leaves one more thing: calming all those words down a little, because working with <code>PLANE_ALT_ABOVE_GROUND_MINUS_CG</code> or <code>AUTOPILOT_HEADING_LOCK_DIR</code> is something we <em>could</em> do, but it would be a heck of a lot nicer if those things had normal names that followed standard JS naming conventions.</p>

<p>And that’s us nearly here. However, SimConnect typically only serves up “values” and if we’re going to write an autopilot, we generally also care the <em>change</em> in certain values over time. For instance, just knowing our current vertical speed doesn’t tell us whether we’re ascending or descending, and just knowing that we’re turning at 3 degrees per second  <em>right now</em> doesn’t tell us anything about whether we’re about to spiral out of control or whether we’re about to stop turning entirely.</p>

<p>So we need a little bit of extra code to track the “delta” values for some of the flight properties we listed earlier:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Our list of "first derivatives", i.e. our deltas</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>DERIVATIVES</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>

  <span>`trueSpeed`</span><span>,</span>

<span>// And our single "second derivative":</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>SECOND_DERIVATIVES</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>`VS`</span><span>];</span>

<span>// And then an update to the `rebind` function:</span>

<p>Well that only took forever…</p>

<h3 id="our-flightinformation-object">Our <code>FlightInformation</code> object</h3>

<p>And we still need to write the actual code that actually pulls this data from SimConnect to keep us up to date. Thankfully, with all the above work completed, that part is nowhere near as much work. First, we write a <code>FlightInformation</code> object to wrap all those values and functions:</p>

<p>And then, as last step, we now need to make the server actually use this object, and make sure that clients can receive it. So, on the server side:</p>

<p>Well that only took forever, but we can finally get back to <em>&lt;checks notes&gt;</em> ticking a few HTML checkboxes?</p>

<h2 id="showing-the-game-data">Showing the game data</h2>

<p>We know when we’re connected to MSFS, so let’s write a few functions that let us cascade through the various stages of the game before we get to “actually controlling a plane”. Let’s start with what we want that to look like:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/questions.png" alt="so many questions"></p>

<p>Nothing particularly fancy (although we can pretty much use any amount of CSS to turn it <em>into</em> something fancy), but it lets us see where in the process of firing up MSFS, clicking through to the world map, and starting a flight we are. So let’s update our HTML file to include these questions, and then we can update our JS to start answering them:</p>

  (... did we crash? <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>disabled</span> <span>class=</span><span>"plane-crashed"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>)
<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Excellent: boring, but serviceable, so let’s add a parent for that in our <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Let's test our connections!<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"js/index.js"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"module"</span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>Are we flying?<span>&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
      Let's see if we're currently flying around in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020...
    <span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul</span> <span>id=</span><span>"questions"</span> <span>data-description=</span><span>"Templated from questions.html"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And create a little CSS file in <code>public/css/questions/css</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#questions</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>list-style</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>
  <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>1em</span><span>;</span>
  <span>padding</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>text-indent</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>#questions</span> <span>li</span> <span>{</span> <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>block</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>#questions</span> <span>li</span><span>:before</span> <span>{</span> <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>"-"</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then let’s move on to the JS side! First let’s write a little convenience file called <code>questions.js</code> that we’re going to use to (un)check these questions, based on the fact that we have access to the web client’s state:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>questions.html</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>());</span>

<span>// Let's create an object that's { serverOnline: span, msfsRunning: span, ... }</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Cool! Of course, this does nothing yet, so let’s plug it into our <code>plane.js</code> so that we can run through our sequence of “where in the game we are” as part of the update call:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Questions</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./questions.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Plane</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>async</span> <span>updateState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>now</span> <span>=</span> <span>Date</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>

    <span>// Update our questions:</span>
    <span>Questions</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>);</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>lastUpdate</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>time</span><span>:</span> <span>now</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>state</span> <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s the “game state” read-back sorted out! Easy-peasy!</p>

<h3 id="trying-our-question-list-out">Trying our question list out</h3>

<p>So: let’s tick some HTML checkboxes!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start MSFS,</li>
  <li>then up the server with <code>node api-server.js</code> and our client with <code>node web-server.js --browser</code> ,</li>
  <li>then look at what happens in the browser as MSFS finished starting up.</li>
  <li>Load up a plane on a runway somewhere, and see what happens.</li>
  <li>Load up a plane mid-flight and see what the checkboxes do! And of course,</li>
  <li>look at what happens when you shut down MSFS, and what happens when you shut down the API server <em>before</em> you shut down the web client.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, on the one hand: <em>that was a LOT of work just to check some boxes</em>! But the upside is that with all of that work out of the way, we’re done in terms of “making sure we have up to date information to work with”: all we need to do is call our flight information <code>update</code> function on the server side, and hook into our Plane’s <code>updateState</code> function on the browser side from now on, and that’s going to make things like running autopilot code and showing flight visualizations a lot easier.</p>

<p>And speaking of visualizations…</p>

<h2 id="putting-our-plane-on-the-map">Putting our plane on the map</h2>

<p>Even with all that work done, we’ve still only implemented page code that lets us answer a bunch of questions, but that’s hardly the only thing we’ll want to see on our page. Let’s add something that let’s us actually see something <em>cool</em> on our webpage: let’s set up a <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> map that we can put our plane on, so we can see ourselves flying around on a map.</p>

<p>Step one: update our <code>index.html</code> to make that work, including downloading Leaflet and putting it in <code>public/js/leaflet</code>. We <em>could</em> run it from CDN, using something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.9.4/leaflet.min.css"</span> <span>async</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.9.4/leaflet.min.js"</span> <span>defer</span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And I encourage you to give that a try, but if we do, Leaflet takes “forever” to load, as opposed to loading near instantly if we save and use a local copy, so: download the .js and .css files from the above CDN links, and put them in our own leaflet dir, and then lets add them to our <code>index.html</code> as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Let's test our connections!<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!-- we'll load Leaflet from CDN --&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"js/leaflet/leaflet.min.css"</span> <span>async</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"js/leaflet/leaflet.min.js"</span> <span>defer</span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!-- and then our own script --&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"js/index.js"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"module"</span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>Are we flying?<span>&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
      Let's see if we're currently flying around in Microsoft Flight Simulator
      2020...
    <span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul</span> <span>id=</span><span>"questions"</span> <span>data-description=</span><span>"Templated from questions.html"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"visualization"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;!-- Then we'll hook Leaflet into the following div: --&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map"</span> <span>style=</span><span>"width: 1200px; height: 800px"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then let’s write a <code>public/js/map.js</code> that we can import to take care of the map for us:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>waitFor</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>DUNCAN_AIRPORT</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>48.7566</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>123.71134</span><span>];</span>

<span>// Leaflet creates a global "L" object to work with, so use that to tie into the &lt;div id="map"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; we have sitting</span>
<span>// in our index.html. However, because independent page scripts can't be imported, we need to wait for it to be available:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>L</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>waitFor</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>L</span><span>);</span>

<span>// With our "L" object available, let's make a map, centered on Duncan airport:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>map</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>setView</span><span>(</span><span>DUNCAN_AIRPORT</span><span>,</span> <span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Of course, this won't *show* anything: we still need an actual map tile layer:</span>
<span>L</span><span>.</span><span>tileLayer</span><span>(</span><span>`https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>maxZoom</span><span>:</span> <span>19</span><span>,</span>
  <span>attribution</span><span>:</span> <span>`© &lt;a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;`</span><span>,</span>
<span>}).</span><span>addTo</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With a quick look at that <code>waitFor</code> function in <code>public/js/utils.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Return a promise that doesn't resolve until `fn()` returns a truthy value, or we run out of retries.</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>waitFor</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span> <span>=</span> <span>5000</span><span>,</span> <span>retries</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>,</span> <span>reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>--</span><span>retries</span> <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>reject</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>`max retries reached`</span><span>));</span>
      <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fn</span><span>();</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>run</span><span>,</span> <span>timeout</span><span>,</span> <span>retries</span><span>);</span>
        <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>reject</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>})();</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We use this because we don’t want to do any map work until Leaflet’s been loaded in, and as an external third party library, we have no idea when that might be, and the HTML stack does not have anything simple built in to check whether non-import scripts have finished loading. So this will have to do.</p>

<p>With that, though, we can update our <code>plane.js</code> to load our map code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>map</span> <span>as</span> <span>defaultMap</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./map.js</span><span>"</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Plane</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultMap</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>;</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>;</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And presto! Now our browser page actually has more than just text:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/page-overview.png" alt="A basic page overview with questions and map"></p>

<p>Which is pretty good, but it’s lacking something… our plane!</p>

<p>Let’s make a quick little plane icon and put that on the map, at the correct latitude and longitude, pointing in the right direction. We’ll start by making a <code>public/map-marker.html</code> file and putting some code in there:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"plane-icon"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"bounds"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"css/map-marker.css"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that <code>plane.png</code> being a simple little non-existent plane silhouette:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/public/planes/plane.png"></p>

<p>And then we add a bit of CSS here, because while we <em>could</em> rotate our plane and shadow using JavaScript, that’s a bit silly when CSS comes with <code>tranform: rotate(...)</code> built in. All we need to do is make sure that the CSS variable <code>--heading</code> is some plain number in degrees (which we can, because that’s one of our flight data values), and then CSS can do the rest. So:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#plane-icon</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/* --heading will be unitless, with a corresponding --degrees that's a "real" value */</span>
  <span>--heading</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

  <span>/* --altitude will be unitless, with a corresponding --alt-em that's a "real" value */</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Which just leaves adding this icon to our map. First, a little map helper file in <code>public/js/map-marker.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Load our .html "partial"</span>
<span>const</span> <span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>map-marker.html</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>());</span>

<span>const</span> <span>MapMarker</span> <span>=</span> <span>div</span><span>.</span><span>children</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>

<span>// Then create a little helper function that gets the HTML we need to</span>

<span>// And then just export that.</span>

<p>And through the magic of “the original web stack” we suddenly have a visualization that shows our plane somewhere in the air, and its shadow on the ground:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/basic-map.png" alt="A basic map with plane icon"></p>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p>That is to say, it’s nicer than not having a plane on the map, but this doesn’t really tell us much, does it? How high are we flying? What’s our airspeed? Which actual heading in degrees are we flying? I think we’re going to need some more HTML. And some SVG. And probably some CSS variables. And a smattering of JS.</p>

<h3 id="improving-our-visualization">Improving our visualization</h3>

<p>Let’s start by considering what we might want to visualize. We basically want all the information you’d get in a cockpit, but presented in marker form, so let’s go for the traditional navigation marker: a compass, with information arranged in and around that. What if we had a nice compass ring around our plane, with heading indication, current speed, and current altitude (both above the ground and “as far as the barometer can tell”). What about something like… this?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/plane-marker.png" alt="our map icon"></p>

<p>Oh yeah: we’re getting fancy. We’re not using a simple little pin with a text bubble, we’re cramming as much MSFS information into our marker as we can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Up top we have the current altitude above the ground in feet, with the altitude relative to sea level in parentheses.</li>
  <li>Down below, the speed in knots.</li>
  <li>In the center, we have the plane itself, offset vertically based on its altitude, with a picture that looks like the in-game plane.</li>
  <li>Below it, on the ground, we have the same plane but blurred and made translucent so it looks like a ground shadow.</li>
  <li>Also below the plane we have an altitude line connecting the plane to its GPS position on the map,</li>
  <li>as well as a line indicating both the current heading and speed of the plane.</li>
  <li>The outer compass ring represents the magnetic compass as we see it inside the plane,</li>
  <li>and the an inner compass ring represents the “true” north, based on GPS.</li>
  <li>The outer ring has a red “heading bug” that points in the direction that the plane should be going according to the autopilot,</li>
  <li>as well a green “current heading” marker so we don’t have to guess our heading based on the speed line.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do we build that? With HTML and SVG:</p>

<p>Now, I’m skipping over the SVG code here mostly because it’s just a <em>lot</em> of SVG for all those little lines in the compass rings, and really all you need is to copy-paste the code <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/are-we-flying/blob/main/public/map-marker.html">here</a> to keep following along. What’s more important is the updates we make to our CSS:</p>

  <span>/* and a bit of value magic that scales the text based on the size of the marker */</span>
  <span>--f</span><span>:</span> <span>250</span><span>;</span>
  <span>--dim</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--f</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>1px</span><span>);</span>

<p>Again, if you want to follow along grab the CSS <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/are-we-flying/blob/main/public/css/map-marker.css">here</a>, but the important part is those new CSS variables, which we can update on the JS side based on the values we get from MSFS:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>And the final bit of the puzzle, <code>airplane-src.js</code>, for which we’re going to want to create a directory called <code>public/planes</code> so that we can fill it with plane icons, like these:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/plane-icons.png" alt="so many planes!"></p>

<p>And then we can swap the correct icon in, based on the plane we’re flying:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>defaultPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>`plane.png`</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>getAirplaneSrc</span><span>(</span><span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>``</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>// let's find our plane!</span>

  <span>// And a quick check: is this the float plane variant?</span>

  <span>// Done, return the appropriate icon. Or just `plane.png` if we don't have this plane in our list.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>pic</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’ll do it. Let’s fire up MSFS, load a plane into the world, and let’s see what that looks like!</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/marker-on-map.png" alt="A map with our marker on it"></p>

<p>That’s looking pretty good!</p>

<p><strong>“Oh, yeah that looks cool! But hold up… why are there <em>two</em> compasses?”</strong> —you, hopefully (again)</p>

<p>Yeah, so, here’s a fun thing about our planet: you’d think magnetic lines run north to south, like those pictures of metal filings around a magnet… which they would, if the Earth was a bar-magnet-sized magnet. Instead, it’s an <em>absolutely huge</em> and highly imperfect magnet, so if we look at a picture of “how wrong a magnet wrt true north/south anywhere on the planet”, things look like this:</p>

<figure>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Magnetic_Declination_2015.pdf">
      <img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/declination.png">
    </a>
    <figcaption>A map of the magnetic declination on planet Earth</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The green lines are where a compass will <em>actually</em> point north, but everywhere else on the planet your compass will be off by various degrees. For example, it’s only a tiny bit off if you’re in Belgium, but at the south tip of the border between Alaska and Canada, your compass will be a pointing a whopping 20 degrees away from true north. When you’re flying a plane, you’d better be aware of that, and you better know which of your instruments use compass heading, and which of them use true heading, or you might not get to where you thought you were going.</p>

<h3 id="seeing-the-terrain">Seeing the terrain</h3>

<p>So… this looks good, but we’re missing one thing: terrain. Maps might be flat, but the world isn’t, and when we’re flying we’d like to know where the hills and mountains are so we can either avoid them, or plan accordingly. So let’s add a terrain layer to our map by updating our <code>maps.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>waitFor</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>DUNCAN_AIRPORT</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>48.7566</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>123.71134</span><span>];</span>

<span>// Leaflet creates a global "L" object to work with, so use that to tie into the &lt;div id="map"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; we have sitting</span>
<span>// in our index.html. However, because independent page scripts can't be imported, we need to wait for it to be available:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>L</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>waitFor</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>L</span><span>);</span>

<span>// With our "L" object available, let's make a map, centered on Duncan airport:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>map</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>setView</span><span>(</span><span>DUNCAN_AIRPORT</span><span>,</span> <span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Let's make our layers a little more "data driven" by first defining a list of sources:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>sources</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>`openStreetMap`</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>`https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`</span><span>,</span>
    <span>maxZoom</span><span>:</span> <span>19</span><span>,</span>
    <span>attribution</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>`http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright`</span><span>,</span>
      <span>label</span><span>:</span> <span>`OpenStreetMap`</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>`googleTerrain`</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>`http://{s}.google.com/vt/lyrs=p&amp;x={x}&amp;y={y}&amp;z={z}`</span><span>,</span>
    <span>subdomains</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>mt0</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>mt1</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>mt2</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>mt3</span><span>"</span><span>],</span>
    <span>maxZoom</span><span>:</span> <span>20</span><span>,</span>
    <span>attribution</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>`https://www.google.com/permissions/geoguidelines`</span><span>,</span>
      <span>label</span><span>:</span> <span>`Google Maps`</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>];</span>

<span>// and then converting those to map layers:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>mapLayers</span> <span>=</span> <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>fromEntries</span><span>(</span>
  <span>sources</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
    <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>tileLayer</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>subdomains</span><span>:</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>subdomains</span> <span>??</span> <span>[],</span>
      <span>maxZoom</span><span>:</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>maxZoom</span><span>,</span>
      <span>attribution</span><span>:</span> <span>`© &lt;a href="</span><span>${</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>attribution</span><span>.</span><span>url</span><span>}</span><span>"&gt;</span><span>${</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>attribution</span><span>.</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/a&gt;`</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}),</span>
  <span>])</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// We'll keep the openstreetmap layer as base layer:</span>
<span>mapLayers</span><span>.</span><span>openStreetMap</span><span>.</span><span>setOpacity</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>mapLayers</span><span>.</span><span>openStreetMap</span><span>.</span><span>addTo</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>);</span>

<span>// And then we'll add the terrain layer as 50% opacity overlay:</span>
<span>mapLayers</span><span>.</span><span>googleTerrain</span><span>.</span><span>setOpacity</span><span>(</span><span>0.5</span><span>);</span>
<span>mapLayers</span><span>.</span><span>googleTerrain</span><span>.</span><span>addTo</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now our map looks <strong><em>amazing</em></strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/map-with-terrain.png" alt="Our map, now with terrain!"></p>

<h3 id="adding-scale-to-our-map">Adding scale to our map</h3>

<p>One last thing: we have no idea what the scale of this map is, so normally that involves telling Leaflet to add the standard scale legend, but Leaflet only knows about standard miles, and kilometers, which is not super useful when you’re flying and everything’s measured in nautical miles. So I guess we’re writing our own scale code by creating a little Leaflet plugin called <code>public/js/leaflet/nautical.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Based on https://github.com/PowerPan/leaflet.nauticscale/blob/master/dist/leaflet.nauticscale.js</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>waitFor</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// We first need to wait for Leaflet...</span>
<span>const</span> <span>L</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>waitFor</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>L</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Then we can define a new Leaflet control that extends the base Leaflet scale visualization:</span>
<span>L</span><span>.</span><span>Control</span><span>.</span><span>ScaleNautical</span> <span>=</span> <span>L</span><span>.</span><span>Control</span><span>.</span><span>Scale</span><span>.</span><span>extend</span><span>({</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>How this code works isn’t super important, but what it does when we use it, is: if we update our <code>maps.js</code> file as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>waitFor</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>setMapScale</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./leaflet/nautical.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>// add our scale</span>
<span>setMapScale</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we refresh our browser, we now have a handy-dandy scale marker in the lower left corner:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/map-with-scale.png" alt="now with scale"></p>

<p>And now we know how long it’ll take us to get places, because as dumb as knots and miles may seem, their relation is extremely simple: a speed of 1 knot means you’re going 1 nautical mile per hour. If we’re going at 120 knots, then we’ll cover 120 nautical miles an hour, or 1 nautical mile every thirty seconds.</p>

<h2 id="recording-our-flight-path">Recording our flight path</h2>

<p>Seeing ourselves flying around on the map is pretty great, but right now we can only see “where we are”, instead of seeing where we’ve come from. As it turns out, Leaflet supports drawing polygons, so let’s also add some “flight tracking” to our web page (not in the least because it’s something that will be pretty important for debugging autopilot code later!).</p>

<p>First, we create a little <code>public/js/trail.js</code> class because you know how this works by now, new code gets its own file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Trail</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// The constructor isn't particularly interesting...</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>,</span> <span>pair</span><span>,</span> <span>color</span><span>,</span> <span>opts</span> <span>=</span> <span>{})</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Really all this does is wrap some of the administrative functionality for tracking position over time, so that we can just create a <code>Trail</code> instance, and add points to it and it’ll do the right thing. For instance, it’s not going to do anything until there are two points to draw a line with. That’s not code we want to constantly have to remember we need to write.</p>

<p>So with that class set up, let’s update <code>plane.js</code> some more:</p>

<p>A reasonably small bit of extra code, for a profound improvement:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/map-with-flightpath.png" alt="Now we know where we came from"></p>

<p>Now we don’t just know where we are, also also where we’ve been!</p>

<h2 id="planes-with-attitude">Planes with attitude</h2>

<p>There’s one thing our fancy marker isn’t showing though, which is the current roll and pitch, which would be really nice to be able to see. So… let’s build an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator">attitude indicator</a>, also sometimes called an “artificial horizon”:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/attitude.png" alt="now with attitude"></p>

<p>This is a way to visualize whether the plane is pitching up, down, or is flying level, as well as showing whether we’re turning left, right, or flying straight. It’s a critical part of the cockpit, and it would be very nice if we could see one at all times, too. So just like before, let’s whip up a bit of HTML, SVG, CSS, and JS to make that happen.</p>

<p>First an update to <code>index.html</code> so that there’s a place for the attitude indictor:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"visualization"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map"</span> <span>style=</span><span>"width: 1200px; height: 800px"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"attitude"</span> <span>data-description=</span><span>"Templated from attitude.html"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then the attitude indicator itself. Thankfully, this will be considerably less code than the airplane marker, so let’s create a <code>public/attitude.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"attitude"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"frame"</span><span>&gt;</span>

<p>With… okay, quite a <em>lot</em> of CSS, so have a look <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/are-we-flying/blob/main/public/css/attitude.css">here</a> if you’re following along, I’ll just highlight the important part here, which is (of course) the CSS variables section:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#attitude</span> <span>{</span>

<span>...</span>

<h2 id="doing-science-plotting-our-flight-telemetry">Doing science: plotting our flight telemetry</h2>

<p>Before we consider our page work done, though, let’s add one more thing: science.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/science/overview.png">
  <figcaption>Look at all that science!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we want to understand what our plane is doing, especially if we want to understand what our plane is doing in response to input changes (whether those are by a human or auto pilot), we need some way to see what happens over time. Which means we want graphs. Lots of graphs. And if we need graphs, we need some code that’ll do that graphing for us!</p>

<p>There’s quite a few ways to get some nice charts on a page, so instead of running you through the code that this project uses, let’s just say that you are spoiled for choice and the choice of whether to use an off-the-shelf library or rolling your own code is entirely up to you. In this specific case, I rolled us some custom code that you can find on the repo under <code>public/js/dashboard/</code>, mostly because I wanted something that generates plain SVG that I can just copy-paste from dev tools into a new file, save that as <code>.svg</code> and then be able to load it into any SVG viewer/editor. Something that’s particularly useful for autopilot debugging.</p>

<p>What matters most is that we can tell the code that we want to plot several graphs, and that each graph has some initial x and y interval that we can grow as needed (<code>x</code> representing time and <code>y</code> representing “whatever makes sense for the value we’re plotting”, since heading angle, speed in knots, altitude in feet, etc. all have rather different ranges), which we do with an initial setup:</p>

  <img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/big-science.png">
  <figcaption>That's some big science...</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>…Now that we’re some 15,000 words down the page…</p>

<p><em>So let’s finally do this.</em></p>

<h2 id="part-3-writing-an-autopilot">Part 3: writing an autopilot</h2>

<p>It’s time. Let’s write that autopilot you came here for.</p>

<p>And while we could do this in the browser, we’re going to be adding the main code to our API server, rather than our web page. Don’t get me wrong: we <em>totally could</em> write our autopilot in client-side JS, but we’d much rather not have to deal with the delay of network requests from the webpage (even if web sockets are must faster than GET/POST requests), and we definitely don’t want to accidentally turn off the autopilot just because we closed a tab… we might be flying a virtual plane, but it’d be nice to keep it in the air instead of just plummeting out of the sky when we accidentally close our browser!</p>

<h2 id="the-code-basics">The code basics</h2>

<p>In order to run an auto pilot, we’re going to need to set up some code that actually “runs” the auto pilot, and then expose some of that functionality over the network, which requires (unsurprisingly) some new files, and some updates to old files.</p>

<h3 id="the-server-side-of-our-autopilot">The server side of our autopilot</h3>

<p>Let’s start with the autopilot code itself, but without any specific piloting logic implemented quite yet, since we’ll be doing that in stages as we run through this chapter. We’ll start by creating a  <code>src/autopilot/autopilot.js</code>, which will be something that we’ll never expose to clients directly, so we can write “normal” code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>url</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:url</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<p>So this does nothing yet, except run the autopilot loop when the autopilot gets enabled, but it’s enough code that want to at least test this to see if we can turn the AP on and off, which means we’ll need to update a few more files before we can do our testing, starting with our <code>server.js</code>:</p>

<p>And of course, since our server code is calling <code>client.onAutoPilot(params)</code> we better make sure that exists in our <code>client.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

  <span>...</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>onAutoPilot</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>({</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>:</span> <span>params</span> <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And <code>socketless</code> will do the rest to make sure that the browser get that state update, too.</p>

<h4 id="ignoring-slew-mode">Ignoring slew mode</h4>

<p>Even MSFS knows that “flying somewhere just to get there” because you want to fly over some scenery that doesn’t have an airstrip nearby, or lining up a plane for some manoeuvre can be incredibly tedious, and so pressing <code>y</code> in game will hard-pause the flight and allow you to reposition the plane using wasd and the numpad, as well as using F1 through F4 to set the plane’s elevation. That’s super useful, but we don’t want the autopilot to keep running when we’re using that, so let’s bake in some “slew mode awareness”, starting with our <code>flight-values.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>FLIGHT_DATA</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>`IS_SLEW_ACTIVE`</span><span>,</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>];</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>BOOLEAN_VALUES</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>`IS_SLEW_ACTIVE`</span><span>,</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>];</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>NAME_MAPPING</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>IS_SLEW_ACTIVE</span><span>:</span> <span>`slewMode`</span><span>,</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>];</span>

<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that in place, we can skip the autopilot run at each iteration for as long as <code>slewMode</code> is true:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AutoPilot</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>async</span> <span>run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flightInfoUpdateHandler</span><span>(</span><span>await</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>flightInformation</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>());</span>

    <span>// Should we skip this round?</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>flightInformation</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>slewMode</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="the-client-side-of-our-autopilot">The client-side of our autopilot</h3>

<p>Of course, we want to be able to control this autopilot from the browser, so we’ll need an update to our browser code so that we can actually turn the autopilot on and off (even if that, right now, does nothing other than toggle a boolean value).</p>

<p>First, let’s create a little <code>public/autopilot.html</code> file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"/css/autopilot.css"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"MASTER"</span><span>&gt;</span>AP<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- we're going to add *so* many options here, later on! --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which we’ll tie into our <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    ...
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"autopilot"</span> <span>data-description=</span><span>"Templated from autopilot.html"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we’ll create a <code>public/css/autopilot.css</code> so we can see when our button has been pressed or not:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#autopilot</span> <span>button</span><span>.active</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>red</span><span>;</span>
  <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>white</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then, we’ll create a <code>public/js/autopilot.js</code> to load in this “partial” and hook up all the buttons… err… button. All the button.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We've seen this pattern before:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>autopilot.html</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>());</span>

<span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>innerHTML</span> <span>=</span> <span>content</span><span>;</span>

<span>// just in case we start a client before we start a server,</span>
<span>// make sure that we have default value to work with:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>AP_OPTIONS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// We're going to add more buttons later, so we'll write some code</span>
    <span>// that "does that for us" sp we add options to AP_OPTIONS without</span>
    <span>// having to write new code for every option we add.</span>
    <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>(</span><span>AP_OPTIONS</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>// We check to see if "this button" is active. If it is, then we</span>
        <span>// want to turn it off, and if it isn't, we want to turn it on.</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>contains</span><span>(</span><span>`active`</span><span>);</span>

      <span>});</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// And we'll need a function that, when we're passed the server's</span>
  <span>// current autopilot settings, makes sure all the buttons (all one of</span>
  <span>// them right now) are shown correctly:</span>
  <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>flightData</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>
		<span>// Again, we do this with code that "does that for us":</span>
    <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>])</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>e</span><span>?.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>`active`</span><span>,</span> <span>!!</span><span>value</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then finally, of course, we load that in with the rest of our code in <code>plane.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Autopilot</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./autopilot.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<p>Which means, we should now be able to test that we have a working “click button, enable/disable autopilot” setup.</p>

<h3 id="testing-our-autopilot-code">Testing our “autopilot” code</h3>

<p>Let’s confirm everything works.</p>

<ul>
  <li>start our API server with <code>node api-server</code>,</li>
  <li>start our client web server with <code>node web-server --owner --browser</code>,</li>
  <li>we won’t need to start MSFS for this one, as nothing we’re doing relies on having the game running (yet!)</li>
  <li>
    <p>our browser should open and we should see our page with the new autopilot button:<br><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/ap-button-off.png" alt="our AP button off..."></p>
  </li>
  <li>and if we click it, we should see it turn red, because it now has an <code>active</code> class:<br><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/ap-button-on.png" alt="And our AP button on"></li>
</ul>

<p>The important thing to realize is that the button doesn’t turn red “when we clicked it” because we didn’t write any code that adds an <code>active</code> class when we click a button. Instead <em>a lot more</em> happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>we press the AP master button,</li>
  <li><em>that does not update anything on the page</em> and instead calls <code>server.autopilot.update({ MASTER: true })</code>,</li>
  <li>which makes the server-side autopilot code update its <code>MASTER</code> value,</li>
  <li>which then triggers an autopilot “settings have changed” broadcast,</li>
  <li>which calls our client’s <code>onAutoPilot</code> with the new settings,</li>
  <li>which we use to update our client’s <code>state.autopilot</code> value,</li>
  <li>which automatically gets copied over to the browser,</li>
  <li>which forwards the state to our <code>Plane</code> code</li>
  <li>which passes it on to the <code>autopilot.update()</code> function,</li>
  <li>and <em>that</em>, finally, sets an <code>active</code> class on the button we pressed because it sees a <code>MASTER</code> property with value <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that all happened so fast that as far as you can tell, you just clicked a button and it changed color to show that it’s active: that’s a good sign! It looks like we’ll be able to control our autopilot through the browser without things feeling sluggish or laggy.</p>

<p>So let’s start adding some buttons that actually control our airplane. Which of course requires also writing the server-side code that does the controlling. Which requires knowing a bit about how an autopilot makes a plane do the things it needs to do.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-does-an-autopilot-actually-work">So how does an autopilot actually work?</h2>

<p>At its core, an autopilot is a system that lets a plane fly “where we want it to fly”, with the most basic form of automated flight being making the plane fly in a straight line. However, there are two kinds of “straight line” we need to think about, because we’re not driving a car on a road, or gliding a boat through water, we’re flying through the air:</p>

<ol>
  <li>we can fly in a straight line without turning left or right, and</li>
  <li>we can fly in a straight line without moving up or down.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first of these is achieved using, in autopilot parlance, a <strong>wing leveler</strong>, often found as the label <code>LVL</code> on autopilot controls, and the second of these is achieved using <strong>altitude hold</strong>, often found as <code>ALT</code> on autopilot controls. You can see where the names come from: the first keeps the plane’s wings level, keeping us pointing in (roughly) one compass direction, while the second keeps the plane (roughly) at some fixed altitude.</p>

<p>More fully featured autopilots extend these two modes by adding <strong>heading mode</strong>, which effectively runs the wing leveler such that we fly “a <em>*specific*</em> compass direction”, with additional logic to get us from pointing in one direction to pointing in another, and by adding <strong>altitude set and hold</strong>, which runs altitude hold “at a <em>*specific*</em> altitude”, with additional logic to get us from one altitude to another.</p>

<p>We start by observing that we <em>*could*</em> try to take all our aeroplane’s flight data, then run a bunch of maths on the numbers we get in order to predict when we need to perform which operations in order to make sure that our plane does the right thing in the future, but this will be a losing proposition: the weather, air density changes, random updrafts, terrain-induced wind, the tendency to “pull” in some direction, etc. are all going to interfere with any predictions we’d make.</p>

<p>So instead, we’re going to implement our autopilot as a <em>*reactionary*</em> system: it looks at what the current flight data is, what the flight data <em>should</em> be if we were already flying the way the AP is set, and then puts in single, small corrections that’ll push us away from the wrong direction. We repeat that process over and over and over, every time looking at the new flight data, and then saying which corrections to make. The trick to getting an autopilot working based on this approach is that if we can do this in a way that makes the corrections smaller and smaller every time we run, we will converge on the desired flight path, barely having to correct anything after a while. The plane will just be flying the way we want it to.</p>

<p>Of course, a real autopilot does this kind of monitoring and correcting on a near-continuous basis. Something we don’t really have the luxury of doing by using JavaScript: in order not to overload both Node.js and MSFS, and in order for us to be able to look at the flight log when we need to do console log debugging, we’re going to run our autopilot only twice per second. And that may sound dangerously low, but it’s actually plenty fast.</p>

<p>So how do we determine the size of corrections we need to put in? Enter the constrained mapping function:</p>

<h3 id="the-backbone-of-our-autopilot-code-constrain-mapping">The backbone of our autopilot code: constrain-mapping</h3>

<p>Before we do anything else, let’s first look at what is probably <em>the</em> single most important function in our autopilot: <code>constrainMap</code>. This function takes a value, relative to some interval <code>[a,b]</code>, and maps it to the corresponding value in a different interval <code>[c,d]</code>, such that <code>a</code> maps to <code>c</code>, <code>b</code> maps to <code>d</code>, and anything in between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> is some new value between <code>c</code> and <code>d</code>. This is nothing special, that’s just numerical mapping, but the critical part here is that in addition to the standard mapping, we also make sure that any value less than <code>a</code> <em>still maps to <code>c</code></em> and any value greater than <code>b</code> <em>still maps to <code>d</code></em>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/constrain_map.png" alt="Constrained mapping">
  <figcaption>Mapping interval [a,b] to [c,d]<br></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That last part is critically important: if we’re going to write an autopilot, we want to be able to effect proportional changes, but we want to “cap” those changes to some minimum and maximum value because just yanking the plane in some direction so hard that it stalls is the opposite of useful.</p>

<p>As such, let’s implement <code>map</code> and <code>constrain</code> functions (unfortunately missing from the standard Math library), and then compose them as <code>constrainMap</code> in our <code>src/utils/utils.js</code> file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// map a value relative to some range [a,b] to a new range [c,d]</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We’re going to rely on this function <em>a lot</em>, so now that we know what it does, and how it does it, let’s move on to actual autopilot code.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-cruise-control">Implementing cruise control</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the simplest bit of the autopilot: “cruise control”, which consists of just a wing leveler so we don’t turn left or right, and an altitude hold so we don’t fly up or down.</p>

<h3 id="lvl-level-mode">LVL: level mode</h3>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/fly-level/left-bank.png" alt="left bank"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/fly-level/level-flight.png" alt="flying straight"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/fly-level/right-bank.png" alt="right bank"></p>

<p>Implementing level mode is probably the easiest of all autopilot functions: we’re going to simply check “is the plane tilting left or right?” and if so, we move the <strong>aileron trim</strong>—a value that “biases” the plane to tilt left or right by adjusting the wing surfaces that tilt the plane—in the opposite direction. As long we do that a little bit at a time, and we do that for long enough, we’ll eventually have the plane flying level.</p>

<p>Let’s create an <code>api/autopilot/fly-level.js</code> file with some scaffolding:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>radians</span><span>,</span> <span>constrainMap</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils/utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Some initial constants: we want to level the wings, so we</span>
<span>// want a bank angle of zero degrees:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>DEFAULT_TARGET_BANK</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>// And we want to make sure not to turn more than 30 degrees (the</span>
<span>// universal "safe bank angle") when we're correcting the plane.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>DEFAULT_MAX_BANK</span> <span>=</span> <span>30</span><span>;</span>

<span>// And, importantly, we also don't want our bank to change by</span>
<span>// more than 3 degrees per second, or we might accellerate past</span>
<span>// zero or our max bank angle too fast.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>DEFAULT_MAX_TURN_RATE</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Now, we have no "additional features" yet, since this is going</span>
<span>// to be our first pass at writing the wing leveler, but we'll be</span>
<span>// adding a bunch of refinements later on, as we revisit this code,</span>
<span>// so we're going to tie those to "feature flags" that we can easily</span>
<span>// turn on or off to see the difference in-flight.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>FEATURES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>

<span>// Then, our actual "fly level" function, which  we're going to keep very "dumb":</span>
<span>// each time we call it, it gets to make a recommendation, without any kind of</span>
<span>// history tracking or future predictions. This keeps the code simple, and allows</span>
<span>// us to hot-reload the code without ever messing up some kind of "data tracking".</span>
<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>flyLevel</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// in order to make this work, we'll extend the autopilot with a "trim vector"</span>
  <span>// that lets us update pitch, roll, and yaw trim values on an ongoing basis.</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>trim</span><span>,</span> <span>api</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Get our current bank/roll information:</span>

  <span>// Then, since we're running this over and over, how big should</span>
  <span>// our corrections be at most this iteration? The faster we're going,</span>

  <span>// Then, let's figure out "how much are we off by". Right now our</span>
  <span>// target bank angle is zero, but eventually that value is going to</span>
  <span>// be a number that may change every iteration.</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>targetBank</span> <span>=</span> <span>DEFAULT_TARGET_BANK</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>diff</span> <span>=</span> <span>targetBank</span> <span>-</span> <span>bank</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Then, we determine a trim update, based on how much we're off by.</span>

  <span>// As our main correction, we're looking directly at our bank difference:</span>
  <span>// the more we're banking, the more we correct, although if we're banking</span>
  <span>// more than "max bank", correct based off the max bank value instead.</span>
  <span>// Also, we'll restrict how much that max bank is based on how fast we're</span>
  <span>// going. Because a hard bank at low speeds is a good way to crash a plane.</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>If we remove all the comments, we just implemented a wing leveler in about 20 lines of code. That’s pretty good! …but let’s run through it in text rather than just code anyway, so we understand what’s happening here:</p>

<p>We implement our wing leveling code by solving two problems at the same time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>we want to get to a situation where our <strong>bank angle</strong> (the angle of the wings with respect to level flight) is zero, and</li>
  <li>we want to get to a situation where our <strong>bank acceleration</strong> (how fast the bank angle changes per second) is also zero.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those two are at odds with each other, and so we want to prioritize getting the bank angle to zero over getting the bank acceleration to zero, so we start by getting our current bank and bank acceleration values, and defining our maximum allowed values for those. Then:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We correct our bank in our first <code>update -= ...</code>: if we’re banking a lot, we want to correct a lot, and if we’re banking a little, we want to correct just a little, and if we’re perfectly level, we don’t want to correct at all. Which is exactly what we wrote <code>constrainMap</code> to do for us.</li>
  <li>Then, we correct our bank acceleration in the next <code>update += ...</code>, by trimming in the opposite direction of our bank acceleration. This will undo some of our bank correction, but as long as we use a smaller step size for acceleration than for the main bank correction, the code will “prioritize” zeroing our bank angle over our bank acceleration. We do, however, allow for a much larger correction that would normally be necessary, in order to deal with momentary “way too much” values caused by wind, bumping the yoke/stick, etc.</li>
  <li>Finally, we update our trim (both in our code and in MSFS) and then we wait for the autopilot to retrigger this function during the next run, letting us run through the same procedure, but with (hopefully!) slightly less wrong values. Provided that this function runs enough times, we’ll converge on level flight, and that’s exactly what we want.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, this does require that <code>radians</code> exists, so let’s quickly add that to our <code>utils.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>radians</span><span>(</span><span>deg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>deg</span> <span>/</span> <span>180</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>PI</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>degrees</span><span>(</span><span>rad</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>rad</span> <span>/</span> <span>PI</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>180</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="adding-a-lvl-switch">Adding a LVL switch</h4>

<p>Of course, we do still need to update the autopilot code so that we can turn this feature on and off. First, we’ll define a constants file for housing things like autopilot modes in <code>autopilot/utils/constants.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>LEVEL_FLIGHT</span> <span>=</span> <span>`LVL`</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Big change, very exiting.</p>

<p>Then, we update the <code>autopilot.js</code> code to make use of this new constant, and we’ll add that <code>trim</code> vector for tracking how much we need to trim in each direction:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>url</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:url</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, let’s make sure the browser can flip that switch, too, in our <code>public/js/autopilot.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// This is the only thing we need to change:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>AP_OPTIONS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>LVL</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And in our HTML “partial”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"/css/autopilot.css"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"MASTER"</span><span>&gt;</span>AP<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"LVL"</span><span>&gt;</span>LVL<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s it, we have a switch for turning our wing leveler on and off!</p>

<p>Now, we could test this immediately, but we’ve only implemented half of a minimal autopilot solution, and it’s going to be hard to test a wing leveler if the plane is flying to the moon, or dropping into the ocean, so let’s first implement the other half before we do some actual, honest to goodness, in-game testing.</p>

<h3 id="alt-altitude-hold">ALT: altitude hold</h3>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/alt-hold/holding-altitude.png"></p>

<p>Next up: making the plane hold its vertical position. This requires updating the “pitch trim” (also known as elevator trim) rather than our aileron trim, by looking at the plane’s vertical speed and trying to keep it at zero. That is, we’re going to look at how fast the plane is moving up or down through the air, and then we’re going to try to get that value down to zero by pitching the plane a little in whichever direction counteracts the vertical movement.</p>

<p>Let’s add a new constant to our <code>constants.js</code> file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>LEVEL_FLIGHT</span> <span>=</span> <span>`LVL`</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>ALTITUDE_HOLD</span> <span>=</span> <span>`ALT`</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then let’s add this new mode to our autopilot, too:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>LEVEL_FLIGHT</span><span>,</span> <span>ALTITUDE_HOLD</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./utils/constants.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then of course the <code>altitudeHold</code> function itself, which we’ll put in  <code>autopilot/altitude-hold.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>constrainMap</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils/utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Also, we don't want our vertical speed to exceed 1000 feet per</span>
<span>// minute, although depending on what's happening that might change.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>DEFAULT_MAX_VS</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// And in order to make sure that in trying to reach that target</span>
<span>// from whatever our current vertical speed is, we limit by</span>
<span>// how much the vertical speed's allowed to change per iteration.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>DEFAULT_MAX_dVS</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Similar to the flyLevel code, we have no features yet, but we'll</span>

<span>// Then, our actual "hold altitude" function, which we're going to</span>

<span>// or future predictions. This keeps the code simple, and allows us</span>
<span>// to hot-reload the code.</span>
<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>altitudeHold</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>flightInformation</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>// And what should those parameters be instead, if want to maintain our altitude?</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>diff</span> <span>=</span> <span>targetVS</span> <span>-</span> <span>VS</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Just like in the flyLevel code, we first determine an update</span>
  <span>// to our trim, and then apply that only once we're done figuring out</span>
  <span>// all the increments and decrements that should involve:</span>

  <span>// Set our update to trim towards the correct vertical speed:</span>

  <span>// And if we're accelerating too much, counter-act that a little:</span>

  <span>update</span> <span>-=</span> <span>constrainMap</span><span>(</span><span>dVS</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>4</span> <span>*</span> <span>maxdVS</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span> <span>*</span> <span>maxdVS</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>trimStep</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>trimStep</span><span>);</span>

  <span>// Finally, apply the new trim value:</span>
  <span>trim</span><span>.</span><span>pitch</span> <span>+=</span> <span>update</span><span>;</span>
  <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>`ELEVATOR_TRIM_POSITION`</span><span>,</span> <span>trim</span><span>.</span><span>pitch</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// This function determines what our target vertical speed should</span>
<span>// be in order to reach our desired stable flight. For now, this</span>
<span>// function simply sets the target VS to zero, but that's going to</span>
<span>// change almost immediate after we test this code, because we'll</span>
<span>// discover that you can't really "hold an altitude" if you don't</span>
<span>// actually write down what altitude you should be holding =)</span>
<span>function</span> <span>getTargetVS</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// So: we'll be putting some more code here *very* soon.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span> <span>targetVS</span><span>:</span> <span>DEFAULT_TARGET_VS</span> <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So that’s a little more code than <code>flyLevel</code>, but not much more, still being less than 30 lines of code if we remove comments. So, let’s go over this code, too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Again, because we added a trim vector to our autopilot, we can use its <code>pitch</code> component for our up/down trimming.</li>
  <li>And again, because some planes have explicit aileron trim controls, we want to make sure we don’t “overwrite” any existing trim setting when we engage the autopilot, so we make sure to copy over the trim value into <code>trim.pitch</code> when the user turns altitude hold on.</li>
  <li>Again, we implement our altitude hold as solving two problems at the same time :
    <ol>
      <li>We want to get to a situation where our <strong>vertical speed</strong> (how much we’re flying up or down) is zero, and</li>
      <li>we want to get to a situation where our <strong>vertical acceleration</strong> is also zero.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Just like before we prioritize the former by giving the latter a smaller step, and we’re good to go, and just like before we’ll allow for a much larger correction based on vertical acceleration than we’d normally need, because even during regular flight a pocket of low density air will do a number on our altitude hold.</p>

<h3 id="testing-our-code-1">Testing our code</h3>

<p>Now that we have a working “fly level” and “hold altitude” implementation, let’s see how we’re doing! And spoilers: we’re going to discover we forgot something pretty important that’ll impact both how level we’re flying, and how well we’re holding our altitude. We’re going to write some more code, but first let’s do some science and actually see what happens with the code we wrote above in place.</p>

<p>We’ll update our <code>public/js/autopilot.js</code> to include the new mode:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// This is the only thing we need to change:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>AP_OPTIONS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>MASTER</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
  <span>LVL</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
  <span>ALT</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we’ll update our HTML partial to include the ALT switch:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"/css/autopilot.css"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"MASTER"</span><span>&gt;</span>AP<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"LVL"</span><span>&gt;</span>LVL<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"ALT"</span><span>&gt;</span>ALT<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, in order to see how well our code works, we’ll be flying around a bit in The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De%5FHavilland%5FCanada%5FDHC-2%5FBeaver">De Havilland DHC-2 “Beaver”</a>, a fun little piston engine bush plane:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/planes/beaver-shot.png" alt="The DeHavilland DHC-2 &quot;Beaver&quot;"></p>

<p>And our order of operations will be to spawn the plane at cruise altitude in above the middle of the pacific ocean in fair weather, have it stabilize itself on the in-game autopilot as a substitute for manually trimming the plane, and then switch to our own autopilot (which will turn off the in-game one) to see how well that holds up. And then we’re going to compare our “before” and “after” graphs to see what we can learn.</p>

<p>See if you can tell when we switched from the in-game autopilot to our own autopilot in the following science:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/initial-test.png" alt="Initial test"></p>

<p>So yeah, this should be relatively obvious: our autopilot is more aggressive than the in-game one, which means it won’t be as smooth of a ride, but the more important thing to notice is that our VS is not centered around zero, and our bank angle isn’t either, even if it’s hard to tell. We’ve left our in-game autopilot altitude of 1500 and ended up at about 1560 feet over the course of our own autopilot being active in these graphs, and we’ve also drifted to the left, starting at a heading of 341 degrees but slowly turning towards 338 by the end of the graph.</p>

<h2 id="improving-our-code">Improving our code</h2>

<p>If you look at the graph, our vertical speed is now perpetually “not actually zero”… it’s not off by a lot, but we’re definitely drifting, which isn’t <em>quite</em> the same as holding altitude. And the same is true for our wing leveler: we’re flying very nearly straight, but not <em>quite</em> straight. The obvious reason for this is that we can’t actually guarantee “straight” without some reference points: we don’t know what heading to fly, or which specific altitude to hold, so if there’s persistent wind, we’re going to get blown off course and we won’t even know.</p>

<p>This also has an extremely obvious solution: let’s make our autopilot capable of flying in a specific direction, at a specific altitude. And that’s going to be surprisingly easy!</p>

<p>Let’s start with our altitude hold: if we could just tell it <em>which</em> altitude to hold, that’d solve half the problem. And as it turns out, we can do this pretty easily with some pretty simple math: check the difference between the altitude we’re at, and the one we’re supposed to <em>be</em> at, and then pick a target VS that will help us cross that vertical distance. And while we’re at it, let’s also fix that aggressive trimming by reducing the amount we update by when we get close to our target:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<p>And then we can update our browser’s <code>autopilot.js</code> to work with that input field:</p>

          <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span> <span>===</span> <span>`ALT`</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>});</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>// We'll also add a change handler to our number field</span>
    <span>// so that if that changes, we can let the server know:</span>
    <span>document</span>
      <span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>`#autopilot .altitude`</span><span>)</span>
      <span>?.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>`change`</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>evt</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>evt</span><span>.</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>blur</span><span>();</span>
      <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// And then we also add some ALT-specific code to our update function:</span>
  <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>flightData</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>params</span><span>;</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>altitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>`#autopilot .altitude`</span><span>);</span>

    <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>])</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>// Because if the autopilot's altitude value changes without us having</span>
      <span>// done so, (e.g. the autopilot is running an automated flight) then we</span>
      <span>// want to make sure that the browser reflects that new value:</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>key</span> <span>===</span> <span>`ALT`</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// With one caveat: if our cursor is in the number field, then it's</span>
        <span>// safe to say we're trying to set a (new) number, and the autopilot</span>
        <span>// update should not suddenly change the input field value.</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>altitude</span> <span>||</span> <span>altitude</span> <span>===</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>activeElement</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>
        <span>altitude</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>parseFloat</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>).</span><span>toFixed</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>// And if we're not locked into flying a specific altitude, copy over</span>
    <span>// the current values so that when we click the button, we're just</span>
    <span>// telling the plane to "keep going" instead of immediately pushing</span>
    <span>// an altitude change through:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>`ALT`</span><span>])</span> <span>altitude</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>round</span><span>(</span><span>flightData</span><span>.</span><span>alt</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let’s save all that and then first set both our new <code>DAMPEN_CLOSE_TO_ZERO</code> and <code>TARGET_TO_HOLD</code> features to <code>false</code>,  so that we’re still flying “the same way we did before”. Then, after we’ve established that we’re autopiloting just as aggressively (because nothing changed in terms of the code running yet), we change them to <code>true</code>, and save, to see the immediately result…</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/alt-hold/target-altitude.png" alt="With target altitude"></p>

<p>We see that our VS is now actually centered around zero, so we’re <em>actually</em> holding altitude, with a calmer moment-to-moment dVS, too, meaning that when we do change VS, it’s less abrupt and we’re less likely to get airsick.</p>

<p>And for the eagle eyed: we’re also no longer drifting left, our bank angle has a slight bias to the right to keep us going steady and the aileron trimming is <em>far</em> calmer. Because I ran this with the <code>fly-level.js</code> file updated in the same way as our altitude hold code: let’s add <code>DAMPEN_CLOSE_TO_ZERO</code> and <code>FLY_SPECIFIC_HEADING</code> to our wing leveler:</p>

<h3 id="flying-straight-not-just-level">Flying straight, not just level</h3>

<p>We’ll start with the browser, adding a heading field and button in <code>autopilot.html</code></p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  ...
  <span>&lt;label&gt;</span>Target heading: <span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<p>And the associated update to the browser’s <code>autopilot.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>round</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>Math</span><span>;</span>

      <span>...</span>
      <span>// Just like we did for ALT, we turn HDG from a boolean into a number:</span>

  <span>// And then we also add some ALT-specific code to our update function:</span>

      <span>}</span>

      <span>// Then we also add the same input field update logic so that we don't</span>

<p>Then a minor update to the server’s <code>autopilot.js</code> code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>ALTITUDE_HOLD</span><span>,</span> <span>HEADING_MODE</span><span>,</span> <span>LEVEL_FLIGHT</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./utils/constants.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<p>Then, we can update <code>fly-level.js</code> to take heading and dampening-close-to-zero into account:</p>

<p>And we’re done, our wing leveler can now actually fly a heading and maintain that heading indefinitely!</p>

<h2 id="improving-altitude-hold-and-heading-mode">Improving altitude hold and heading mode</h2>

<p>Technically, we also just implemented “change logic”, because if we can set an altitude or heading, then we can also change those numbers and the plane will go “okay well that’s not what we’re doing here, let me put in corrections until we’re at that altitude/flying that heading”. But if we do that, we see that the transitions aren’t exactly smooth. If we change our altitude, and we look at the VS curve…</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/improvement-01.png" alt="image-20240112095149402"></p>

<p>That’s definitely choppy. Things get worse though, if we try to change our heading:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/improvement-02.png" alt="image-20240112095455585"></p>

<p>The heading change isn’t super smooth either, but what’s worse is that when we bank we’re going to drop (because that’s how physics works, we’ve traded lift for torque), and in order to compensate the autopilot will change the plane’s pitch, but then when we come out of our turn, that extra VS pushes us up, then the autopilot tries to correct for that, but it’s a bit too much, so we end up undershooting, then the autopilot tries to correct for a VS that’s already larger than it can cope with, so it adds as much as it can, and we overshoot. And now we’re in a situation where we’re <em>technically</em> in a “stable flight” configuration, but my goodness <em>would it ever be uncomfortable</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/improvement-03.png" alt="image-20240112095836943"></p>

<p>We might not be crashing, but we’re also not really “flying” anymore, we’re on a nightmare rollercoaster of death. So let’s fix that.</p>

<h3 id="emergency-altitude-intervention">Emergency altitude intervention</h3>

<p>Let’s fix our altitude hold code so that we can get out of the above situation, by adding some emergency trimming to stabilize our vertical speed, and some code to “snap” to our target heading instead of oscillating around that for a (short, but noticable) time. Time for more features!</p>

<p>And this seems to have tamed our rollercoaster well enough:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/alt-intervention/alt-intervention.png" alt="ALT intervention"></p>

<p>Putting it through its paces by running four 100 degree turns shows that we’re still not turning “perfectly level”, but that’s fine, at least we manage to make a turn and end up pointing in the right direction, at the right altitude after coming out of our turn, instead of things going horribly wrong.</p>

<p>In fact, let’s intentionally make things go horribly wrong by yanking on the stick and making the plane rocket upwards, as well as push down to induce a nose dive. Do we stabilize to a safe situation again?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/alt-intervention/alt-intervention%202.png" alt="ALT intervention"></p>

<p>We do! Sure, it won’t be comfortable, and it’ll be scary as heck, but we can just ride it out, instead of either getting stuck in a nightmare ride or our plane crashing.</p>

<h3 id="snapping-to-a-new-heading">Snapping to a new heading</h3>

<p>Another thing we’ll want to “fix” (in quotes because it’s not super terrible right now, but definitely a bit weird) is that when you change from one heading to another, we overshoot the new heading by a few degrees, and it takes a little while for the plane to correct for that overshoot. At which point it might overshoot <em>again</em> by a degree or so, before finally making it to pointing the heading we wanted. That’s… annoying. The reason for this is that we’re correcting based on a difference in bank angle, without regard for the difference in heading, so by the time we get to our target heading, the bank angle only just realized it should be 0 and the plane needs some time to fully catch up.</p>

<p>So let’s add a <code>SNAP_TO_HEADING</code> feature to our <code>fly-level.js</code> that checks how close we actually are to our target heading, and if we’re close, very close, or <em>super</em> close, boosts the update we need to force the bank angle to undershoot  a little, thus counteracting the overshoot:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>FEATURES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>// And then we add three rounds of boosting based on how</span>
  <span>// close to our intended target heading we are.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>FEATURES</span><span>.</span><span>SNAP_TO_HEADING</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
    <span>// This may be counteracted by DAMPEN_CLOSE_TO_ZERO, but that won't</span>

    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s look at the difference this makes, by temporarily changing the charting config for our <code>heading</code> value from “always show the full 0 through 360 degrees” to “dynamically zoom the graph as needed” (similar to how vertical speed gets plotted). First, changing course from 250 degrees to 300 degrees and back with <code>SNAP_TO_HEADING</code> turned off vs. with <code>SNAP_TO_HEADING</code> turned on:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/heading-snap/snap-to-heading.png" alt="Snap to heading"></p>

<p>Much better. The first two turns with our original code take “forever” to actually stabilize, overshooting, then again, and then <em>again</em>, whereas with snapping turned on we get to our target heading and then as the name implies we “snap to that heading” and now that’s the direction we’re going.</p>

<h2 id="edge-case-testing">Edge-case testing</h2>

<p>Now that we have pretty decent control of both the horizontal and the vertical, let’s see what happens when we throw this code at some fun edge cases: planes that don’t quite follow the same recipe as most other planes. Like….</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/planes/top-rudder-shot.png" alt="Top Rudder Solo 103"></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.toprudderaircraft.com/product-page/103solo-standard">Top Rudder Solo 103</a> - this type of plane was never meant to have an autopilot. Under no circumstances should you try to add one in real life. Not that you could if you wanted to, Which no sane person would want. So we will. <em>Because we can</em>.</p>

<p>That said, this is the least likely plane to succeed, mostly because it flies so close to its stall speed: when the stars align it’ll do 60 knots, but 50 is more typical, at 30 knots there’s a good chance that you’ll fall out of the sky when you even so much as thinking about tipping the wings because you’re on the edge of no longer having enough lift to maintain altitude, and at 25 knots it’s just a brick. Not a problem under normal operation, but when we slap on an autopilot… let’s just say things might get exciting!</p>

<p>So, let’s see what happens when we start a flight and turn on our autopilot. We’ll first see if it can hold an altitude, then set it to climb, see if it can do that, and then set it to descend, and see if it can do that.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/top-rudder-failure.png" alt="A Top Rudder failure..."></p>

<p>…We… uh… yeah, we may need to do something about that. Things start out alright, where we’re holding altitude perfectly fine, but once we start to climb, things start to go wrong, fast. See that “speed” graph? That’s showing us that as we’re climbing, we’re losing speed. Nothing unusual about that, but we’re losing <em>a lot</em> of speed. So much so, in fact, that we drop below the safe climbing speed of 30 knots, all the way down to below stall speed at 21 knots. And then it’s basically game over.</p>

<p>So let’s add “making sure we have enough speed to stay in the air” to our emergency handling in <code>altitude-hold.js</code>:</p>

<p>This code should be fairly self-explanatory (given the code comments): SimConnect gives us various design speeds, include the “safe climb speed” (V<sub>Y</sub>), cruise speed (V<sub>C</sub>), and stall speeds (V<sub>S<sub>0</sub></sub> for stall speed when set up to land, and V<sub>S<sub>1</sub></sub> for stall speed during regular flight) so we can use those to determine whether we’ve slowed down too much. We don’t actually want the plane below the climb speed (so we can ignore the stall speeds) so we can check whether we’ve dropped below “10 knots above the climb speed” (10 knots above, because if our speed’s already dropping, it’s goin got keep dropping while we try to correct for it, so we need that safety byffer), and if so we fairly aggressively reduce the target vertical speed calculated so far, to the point where if our speed ends up at climb speed, we just set it to zero. This might mean we climb a <em>lot</em> slower than we otherwise would, but on the upside we’re going to <em>keep</em> climbing instead of dropping out of the sky!</p>

<p>So we’re no longer at risk of the death spiral we were getting in before. In fact, we can now “comfortably” climb from 1500 feet up to 6000 feet, and back down to 1500, and then back up to 6000 etc. etc:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/top-rudder-success.png" alt="Top Rudder success!"></p>

<p>…insofar as flying up to that altitude can be called comfortable when piloting an ultralight, or course… I hope we’re wearing thermal pants! And can I just point out: <strong>we added an autopilot to an ultralight</strong>. That alone would be an amazing bit of open source to run alongside your game! And we’re only getting started!</p>

<p>Buuuuut just out of curiosity, what if we change altitude and heading at the same time? Let’s try a 500 foot climb with a 90 degree turn at the same time, and then a 500 foot descent with another 90 degree turn. Place your bets on what will happen… will we live?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/top-rudder-success-2.png" alt="Top Rudder success!"></p>

<p>We will! It’s certainly not confidence inspiring, it doesn’t look like a thing we’ll ever <em>actually</em> want to do, and even if we do, we’ll probably want our hands on the stick despite having an “autopilot”, but: we’ll live! Excellent!</p>

<p>(You may also notice that we seem to be far most stable going down than going up: turns out actually having enough air flowing over your control surfaces makes an aircraft easier to work with… who knew!)</p>

<p>So let’s try another edge-case. A normal plane, but one that doesn’t have aileron trim. How do we deal with that?</p>

<h2 id="planes-without-aileron-trim">Planes without aileron trim</h2>

<p>Not all planes have aileron trim, instead relying on setting a rudder trim to keep the plane straight, and the stick to do all the maneuvering, which means that our autopilot isn’t much use. We’d be able to maintain an altitude, since virtually all planes have pitch trim, but that alone won’t keep us in the air. You’d think that was something you could ask SimConnect about, but while there is an <code>AILERON_TRIM_DISABLED</code> variable, that only tells you whether it’s <em>disabled</em>, and does not tell you whether there <em>is</em> one or not. Instead, we’re left having to just “compile a list of planes, as we find them”, so… find, let’s do that, even though it’s quite dumb:</p>

<p>We’re partially “guessing” here, with an alternative step size based on “flying a bunch of planes and seeing what works”. The heading also isn’t held as strictly as the trim-based approach, but at least now we can <em>fly</em> planes without aileron trim, even if it’s going to be less precise. In fact, we’re probably going to drift, but again: we’ll take it. At least things “work”.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/planes/turbo-arrow-III-shot.png" alt="the Piper Turbo Arrow III"></p>

<p>Let’s use Just Flight’s <a href="https://www.justflight.com/product/pa-28r-turbo-arrow-iii-iv-microsoft-flight-simulator">PA28 Piper Turbo Arrow III</a> to demonstrate the effect of this code, setting it to a heading of 250 degrees, switching to 300, and then back to 250. It can’t strictly hold those, but it’s “close enough to probably be fine if we have a flight path”, which we’ll tackle in part 4.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/no-aileron-trim/level-on-stick.png" alt="Leveling using the stick"></p>

<p>The Piper settles a few degrees off from the actual heading it needs to fly (actually flying 253, 303, and 253) but given how few planes are “broken” in this way, we’re going to call that good enough. We could test a few more planes that don’t have aileron trim, and if they’re all off in the same way, we can always just “cheat” by updating <code>getTargetBankAndTurnRate</code> so that it uses a heading that’s 3 degrees less than what we specified or something. But that’s more of an “if there’s a plane we like to fly with this specific problem” rather than something that’s worth tackling now.</p>

<p>What other edge-cases might we have?</p>

<h2 id="controlling-acrobatic-planes">Controlling acrobatic planes</h2>

<p>Say we want to have some fun in our stunt plane, but it’s a boring flight to the practice “grounds” so we just turn on our autopilot to get us there.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/planes/pitts-special-shot.png" alt="the Pitts Special S1"></p>

<p>Will our current autopilot code actually get us there? As it turns out, no. No it won’t:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/acrobatic/bad-acrobatics.png" alt="image-20240115102153561"></p>

<p>That’s a hard crash. And adding our plane to the list of “trim on stick” planes won’t help either: the problem here is that these planes fly fundamentally differently from “regular” planes, with near-instant response to control inputs, and our autopilot simply can’t run fast enough to keep up. We can’t really speed up our autopilot (I mean, we can probably speed it up <em>a bit</em>, but we’re definitely not going to run it every frame: we only have so much CPU available, and MSFS famously wants all of it), but what we <em>can</em> do is make our autopilot give these kinds of planes much smaller corrections. This will make us turn slower, but on the upside: it makes the plane turn slower rather than immediately trying to do a roll.</p>

<p>Let’s add an <code>isAcrobatic</code> flag to our flight model, in <code>flight-information.js</code>, and reorganize it since we’re now working with multiple lists:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>// Yay, more hard-coded lists!</span>

    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And presto, we now have an <code>isAcrobatic</code> flag that we can check in our <code>fly-level.js</code> code:</p>

<p>There. Let’s see what that did for us:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/acrobatic/good-acrobatics.png" alt="image-20240115105424178"></p>

<p>Looking pretty great!</p>

<p>So, let’s try one more edge-case: planes that cruise very close to their “never exceed” (V<sub>NE</sub>) speed limit.</p>

<h2 id="auto-throttling">Auto-throttling</h2>

<p>Say we’re flying a bear:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/planes/kodiak-100-shot.png" alt="The Kodiak 100"></p>

<p>This is the Daher Kodiak 100. It’s fast! It’s famous! It’s also relatively easy to fly, but it has a really weird design quirk in MSFS… see if you can spot it:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/throttle/kodiak-problem.png" alt="The problem with the Kodiak 100..."></p>

<p>If we look at its supposed cruise speed as reported by MSFS, it likes to fly at 174 knots. And if we look at our cockpit dash, it says we’re going to die at 180 knots. That’s… not a lot of leeway between “merrily cruising along” and “tearing a two million dollar plane apart in mid-air”. So let’s start a flight at 1500 feet, at its cruise speed of 174 knots, and climb up to its “intended” cruise altitude of 12000, and then… come back down to 1500 feet. And you can probably guess where this is going.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/throttle/kodiak-climb.png" alt="Gettting to 12,000 feet is not a problem"></p>

<p>Going up: not a problem! With a cruise speed of 174 bit a minimum safe climb speed of 101 knots, the Kodiak has power <em>to spare</em>. We never even drop below 120 knots during our climb. And then we try to descend.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/throttle/kodiak-descent-death.png" alt="Descending 12,000 feet does not end well"></p>

<p>The first few thousand feet: not a problem!</p>

<p>But all the while our speed is slowly creeping up, and after a little over 4000 feet of descent, at an altitude of 7860.7 feet, we’re going too fast for the plane to handle and…</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/throttle/overstressed.png" alt="we overstressed the plane, which is a polite way to say we died"></p>

<p>Game over.</p>

<p>So how do we deal with this edge-case? If you remember when we needed emergency measures to deal with the plane being told to climb faster than its engine could sustain, our solution then was to decrease the target VS. However, a second option would have been to just throttle up so that the plane has the power it needs, with a reduced target VS only once we’re maxed out on the throttle.</p>

<p>Conversely, we can throttle <em>down</em> if we’re descending and we’re seeing the plane go faster than its intended cruise speed. So let’s write some “auto throttle” code  to help us keep our Kodiak 100 in one piece, starting with a new value to our <code>constants.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>const</span> <span>AUTO_THROTTLE</span> <span>=</span> <span>`ATT`</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then let’s make a <code>src/autopilot/auto-throttle.js</code> file and get to work:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>ALTITUDE_HOLD</span><span>,</span> <span>AUTO_THROTTLE</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils/constants.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<p>Effectively: “try to maintain cruise speed”. And with that in place, what does our Kodiak do when told to go from 12000 feet down to 1500 feet?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/combined/throttle/fixed.png" alt="A fixed Kodiak 100"></p>

<p>And once more: we live. You can see the auto-throttle keeping our speed around 174 knots (we go over a bit, we go under a bit) through pretty much the entire descent. And with that, we’ve exhausted the list of edge cases to look at. Which means our autopilot is done! Which means we can finally get down to writing the <em>real</em> autopilot! …<em>Wait, what?</em></p>
<h2 id="part-4-google-maps-for-planes">Part 4: Google maps for planes</h2>

<p>So far we’ve been looking at what we <em>call</em> an autopilot, but is it? Can we just get in the plane, and then tell it to pilot itself? In the real world: no, absolutely not, for very good reasons. But we’re not dealing with the real world, we’re dealing with a video game that we have near enough full control over, so why would we stop at “what you can do in the real world” when we can make things <em>so</em> much cooler by adding in the bits you won’t get in real life? We now have the basics in place for making the plane go where we want it to go, so let’s create a UI that lets use <em>tell it</em> where we want it to go, starting <em>and ending</em> on a runway. Because now we’re ready to tackle the  <em>really</em> interesting parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating a waypoint-based navigation system where you just put markers on the map to form a flight path, and have the plane figure out how to fly that path,</li>
  <li>adding terrain awareness so we don’t even need to care about setting the correct altitudes for each waypoint,</li>
  <li>adding auto-takeoff so we can start the plane on the runway, hit “take off!” and then have the plane just… do that, and finally,</li>
  <li>adding auto-landing, so that at the end of the flight, the plane just finds a nearby airport, figures out the approach, and then lands itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>If that sounds like too much work: it might be. And no one would blame you if you stopped here. But if that sounds <em>amazing</em>… we’re not at the bottom of this page yet, let’s implement some crazy shit!</p>

<h2 id="intermission-mocking-an-msfs">Intermission: Mocking an MSFS</h2>

<p>Not all the work we’re doing here strictly speaking “requires” MSFS: if we had something that could pretend to be MSFS and feed us SimConnect data that is identical to MSFS then that would let us do some dev work with a “game” that we can tailor to suit whatever work we want to do, so before we start doing that work, let’s mock ourselves a little MSFS, which requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mocking the list of SimConnect variables we work with,</li>
  <li>mocking a plane that works with those variables (basically creating the world’s worst flight simulator), and</li>
  <li>mocking a simconnect API so that calls go to our mocked variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s do that! First, let’s create a <code>src/classes/server/mocks</code> directory, and then create a file called <code>fake-flight-data.js</code>:</p>

<p>So how do we run this? Let’s update our <code>src/classes/server/server.js</code> to look for a <code>--mock</code> runtime argument and then use this mock rather than trying to use the real SimConnect API:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<p>And done: if we now run <code>node api-server --mock</code>, we see the following:</p>

<div><pre><code>

<p>And firing up <code>node web-server.js --owner --browser</code> will show us that a flight’s happening. As far as it knows, it’s visualizing MSFS:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240227091819795.png" alt="image-20240227091819795"></p>

<h2 id="adding-waypoint-navigation">Adding waypoint navigation</h2>

<p>Our goal is going to be able to give the autopilot a bunch of coordinates and then make it fly our plane towards waypoints, and then when it gets close, transition to flying towards the next waypoint, and so on, until we run out of waypoints. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/page/map-with-waypoints.png" alt="Doing some waypoint flying"></p>

<p>Flying towards a point is pretty easy, but transitioning in a way that “feels right” is a bit more work, so there might be a bit more code here than you’d expect. Plus, we want to place, move, and remove points using the map on our web page, but the actual waypoints themselves will live server-side, so there’s a bit of work to be done there, too.</p>

<p>As such, we’re going to need to break down waypoint logic as a few separate tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the server side will  be our authority on which waypoints exist and which one we’re flying towards, which:
    <ol>
      <li>requires having code that models individual waypoints,</li>
      <li>requires having a waypoint manager, and</li>
      <li>requires updating our heading and altitude hold modes to made the plane fly get their target heading and altitude from the waypoint manager.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>the client side is our UI for placing, editing, and removing waypoints, which:
    <ol>
      <li>requires code for showing waypoints as map markers, and</li>
      <li>Requires code for placing and editing waypoints.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This will be a little “trickier” in that the client will need to main a list of waypoints <em>in parallel</em> to the server’s list of waypoints, which we need to keep in sync with the list of waypoints we get as part of our regular server update. And of course, the client is <em>just</em> a UI, so if we -say- place a point, we don’t: we instead send an instruction to create a new waypoint to the server, and then on the next server update we’ll see that waypoint in the updated listed of waypoints. So it’s going to be a bit more code than you might have thought this would be.</p>

<p>So let’s get started!</p>

<h3 id="the-server-side">The server side</h3>

<p>We’ll model waypoints pretty plainly in their own <code>src/autopilot/waypoints/waypoint.js</code>, after a quick think about what we want our waypoints to model:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they need a lat/long GPS position, obviously,</li>
  <li>they need an optional elevation,</li>
  <li>they need a way to indicate whether we’ve passed them or not, so we can show that in our UI</li>
  <li>they need a way to indicate whether they are “our current waypoint”, so we can show that in our UI</li>
  <li>they need to know what “the next waypoint” is, so we can show that in our UI, and</li>
  <li>they need to know their distance from the previous waypoint, so we can show that in our UI</li>
</ol>

<p>And that last one seems obvious: it’s the first one in whatever list of waypoints we end up coding, but</p>

<p>Similarly, we’ll need ways to set and update all those values. So… let’s put all that in:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>getDistanceBetweenPoints</span><span>,</span>
  <span>getHeadingFromTo</span><span>,</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Waypoint</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// We'll use a silly little id function, because</span>

<p>That looks like a lot of code, but most of it’s pretty “boilerplate” in that we want this class to be able to do a few things, and each has an obvious implementation that mostly just makes the code take up more lines. The parts that are actually <em>interesting</em> are the <code>getHeading</code> and <code>getAltitude</code> functions, which don’t just “get” things, they actually update the autopilot to the appropriate heading and altitude respectively, and then return that new value. Both use fairly “naïve” approaches: <code>getHeading</code> simply returns the heading towards the next waypoint (which is a <em>terrible</em> flight policy, as we’ll see in a bit) and <code>getAltitude</code> returns either our current waypoint’s elevation, or the next elevation’s, depending on which is higher. Picking the highest (hopefully) prevents us from flying into a hill side.</p>

<p>This does mean we have a new functions in our <code>utils.js</code> file for getting the heading from one point to another:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>/**
 * Determine the heading from a point 1 to a point 2, using airplane
 * heading (a degree value between 0 and 360).

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So just a few steps left. First, we need to add a waypoint manager instance to our <code>src/autopilot/autopilot.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// We're not hot-reloading this one, but we could. The reason we don't</span>
<span>// is because we've pretty much covered everything we needed to already.</span>
<span>// There's one thing we'll be adding a bit later, but we don't need</span>
<span>// hot reloading for that.</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>WayPointManager</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./waypoints/waypoint-manager.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AutoPilot</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Add the manager in our constructor...</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>api</span><span>,</span> <span>onChange</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{})</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>waypoints</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WayPointManager</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// ...and then add the waypoint list to our autopilot parameter object:Ï</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>getParameters</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>...</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>modes</span><span>,</span>
      <span>waypoints</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>getWaypoints</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, we’ll need to update our <code>fly-level.js</code> and <code>altitude-hold.js</code> so they actually <em>use</em> the waypoint manager to get the heading and altitude we should be flying. Respectively:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>function</span> <span>getTargetBankAndTurnRate</span><span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>targetHeading</span> <span>=</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>waypoints</span><span>.</span><span>getHeading</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>heading</span><span>,</span> <span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>);</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>function</span> <span>getTargetVS</span><span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>targetAlt</span> <span>=</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>waypoints</span><span>.</span><span>getAltitude</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>alt</span><span>)</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And finally, we need to update our autopilot router, so that clients call things like <code>this.server.autopilot.addWaypoint(...)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>;</span>

<p>In order to work with waypoints, we’ll want the client-side equivalent of a waypoint manager, but since it won’t be “really” managing waypoints, let’s call it a waypoint overlay instead. It’ll be mirroring server-side waypoints on our map, so that feels an appropriate name.</p>

<p>Let’s first update our <code>public/js/plane.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>WaypointOverlay</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./waypoint-overlay.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Plane</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Step 1: bind a client-side waypoint manager</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultMap</span><span>,</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>DUNCAN_AIRPORT</span><span>,</span> <span>heading</span> <span>=</span> <span>135</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>waypointOverlay</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WaypointOverlay</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Step 2: give it the server-side waypoint data</span>
  <span>//         and let it sort out the rest!</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>updateState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>:</span> <span>params</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>;</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>flightData</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>);</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>waypointOverlay</span><span>.</span><span>manage</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>waypoints</span><span>);</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then it would help if we had an implementation for that waypoint overlay in <code>public/waypoint-overlay.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Trail</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./trail.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<p>And we’ll use a smattering of CSS to make the various waypoint states look differently, in  our <code>public/css/map-marker.css</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>#map {
  --flight-path-colour: grey;
}

...

.waypoint-div {
  &amp;::before {
    content: attr(data-alt);
    position: relative;
    width: 40px;
    display: inline-block;
    text-align: center;
    bottom: -40px;
    text-shadow:
      0px 0px 5px black,
      0px 0px 10px black,
      0px 0px 15px black;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  &amp;.active .waypoint-marker img {
    filter: hue-rotate(145deg) brightness(2);
  }

  &amp; .waypoint-marker {
    &amp; .pre {
      display: block;
      position: absolute;
      width: auto;
      white-space: nowrap;
      background: white;
      border: 1px solid lightgrey;
      border-radius: 5px;
      padding: 0 4px;
      top: calc(1em - 100%);
      left: -40%;
    }
    &amp; img {
      width: 40px !important;
      height: 40px !important;
      position: relative;
      top: -20px;
      left: 0;
    }
  }

  &amp;.completed .waypoint-marker {
    &amp; .pre {
      top: calc(1em - 50%);
      left: -40%;
    }
    &amp; img {
      width: 20px !important;
      height: 20px !important;
      filter: hue-rotate(-45deg);
      opacity: 1;
      top: 0px;
      left: 10px;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with that, we should be ready to do some testing!</p>

<h3 id="testing-waypoint-placement">Testing waypoint placement</h3>

<p>If we rerun our server with <code>node api-server.js --mock</code> and our client with <code>node web-server.js --owner --browser</code> , we can now run our “simulation” and place a bunch of waypoints by clicking the map, which will send a waypoint creation message to the server, which creates the <em>actual</em> waypoint, which we’re then told about because the waypoints are now part of the autopilot information that gets sent to the client every time the autopilot updates, and the plane will do something!</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/waypoints/placing-points.png" alt="Adding some waypoints to our map"></p>

<p>…but it’s a bit janky: the map keeps snapping to the plane, which makes placing points harder than it needs to be because we need to zoom out so we can place points, and then when we try to move them around the map keeps changing on us, not to mention that the plane is using an extremely poor waypoint policy that we can’t actually use in-game:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240128175409726.png" alt="image-20240128175409726"></p>

<p>Note that, at no point during this flight, are we actually properly on the flight path itself… And of course: while we can move points around, we don’t have a way to edit or remove them yet. Nor a way to mark a sequence of waypoints as repeating… let’s improve things a bit!</p>

<h2 id="quality-of-life-improvements">Quality of life improvements</h2>

<h3 id="dont-snap-the-map">Don’t snap the map</h3>

<p>When placing or moving waypoints, it would be <em>Extremely Useful <sup>(tm)</sup></em> if the map didn’t constantly snap to our plane. If you recall, the reason it does that is because we have a <code>map.setView()</code> call in our <code>plane.js</code> that explicitly keeps the map in lock-step with our plane, so let’s add a flag in the code, and a checkbox to our page, and tie those two together.</p>

<p>First, we’ll edit our <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    ...
    <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"css/index.css"</span> <span>async</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    ...
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map-controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"center-on-plane"</span><span>&gt;</span>Center map on plane<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;input</span> <span>id=</span><span>"center-on-plane"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>checked=</span><span>"checked"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"visualization"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      ...
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With a tiny <code>public/css/index.css</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fieldset</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>inline-block</span><span>;</span>
  <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>padding</span><span>:</span> <span>0.25em</span> <span>0.5em</span><span>;</span>
  <span>border</span><span>:</span> <span>1px</span> <span>solid</span> <span>black</span><span>;</span>
  <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> <span>0.5em</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>label</span><span>[</span><span>for</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>cursor</span><span>:</span> <span>pointer</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>button</span><span>.active</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>red</span><span>;</span>
  <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>white</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And if that last rule looks familiar: it used to live in our <code>autopilot.css</code> file, but we want it to apply page-wide now (so let’s remove it from our autopilot CSS file). Then, we want to hook this page element into our <code>plane.js</code> code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Plane</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>map</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultMap</span><span>,</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>DUNCAN_AIRPORT</span><span>,</span> <span>heading</span> <span>=</span> <span>135</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setupControls</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>setupControls</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>centerMapOnPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Link our checkbox to our new "centerMapOnPlane" flag</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>btn</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>centerButton</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>`center-on-plane`</span><span>));</span>
    <span>btn</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>`change`</span><span>,</span> <span>({</span> <span>target</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>centerMapOnPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>!!</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>checked</span><span>));</span>

    <span>// Then: if we drag the map around, turn off auto-centering</span>
    <span>map</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>`drag`</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>btn</span><span>.</span><span>checked</span><span>)</span> <span>btn</span><span>.</span><span>click</span><span>();</span> <span>});</span>

    <span>// And if we load the page without the checkbox checked</span>
    <span>// (e.g. we reload the page), get it checked.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>btn</span><span>.</span><span>checked</span><span>)</span> <span>btn</span><span>.</span><span>click</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>

  <span>// And of course: control the centering using our new flag!</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>updateMap</span><span>({</span> <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>flightModel</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>flightData</span><span>,</span> <span>general</span> <span>})</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>centerMapOnPlane</span><span>)</span> <span>map</span><span>.</span><span>setView</span><span>([</span><span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>]);</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>

<span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we’re done, if we reload our page and drag the map around, we no longer auto-center on our plane until we tick that checkbox again (or click its associated label, which counts as ticking the checkbox).</p>

<h3 id="toggle-label-visualization">Toggle label visualization</h3>

<p>Things can get a bit hard to see with a large flightpath with lots of labels, so let’s add a tiny bit more HTML and CSS to toggle waypoint labels. We’ll add a checkbox to our <code>index.html</code> similar to what we just did for centering the map on the plane:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map-controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"center-on-plane"</span><span>&gt;</span>Center map on plane<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;input</span> <span>id=</span><span>"center-on-plane"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>checked=</span><span>"checked"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"show-labels"</span><span>&gt;</span>Show waypoint labels<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;input</span> <span>id=</span><span>"show-labels"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>checked</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then we’ll update our <code>index.css</code>, with a bit of clever CSS that toggles visibility of our waypoint labels based on whether or not our checkbox is checked or unchecked:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>&amp;:has(#</span><span>show-labels</span><span>:</span><span>not</span><span>(:</span><span>checked</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#</span><span>map</span> <span>.</span><span>waypoint-div</span> <span>.</span><span>waypoint-marker</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>&amp;</span> <span>.</span><span>pre</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>.</span><span>post</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What we’ve done here is created a conditional bit of CSS for <code>#map .waypoint-div .waypoint-marker</code> that will only kick in when <code>#show-labels:not(:checked)</code> is true <em>anywhere on the page</em>. This kind of CSS only works in browsers that support <code>:has</code>, but as of 2024 that’s “all of them” so that’s handy: no classes that need to be set, and no JavaScript needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/waypoints/hide-labels.png" alt="Hiding our waypoint labels"></p>

<p>In fact, let’s take that one step further by also adding an option that lets us scale our markers down:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map-controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"center-on-plane"</span><span>&gt;</span>Center map on plane<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;input</span> <span>id=</span><span>"center-on-plane"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>checked=</span><span>"checked"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"show-labels"</span><span>&gt;</span>Show waypoint labels<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;input</span> <span>id=</span><span>"show-labels"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>checked</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"tiny-waypoints"</span><span>&gt;</span>Tiny waypoints<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;input</span> <span>id=</span><span>"tiny-waypoints"</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And an extra CSS rule for waypoint images:</p>

<div><pre><code>
<span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>&amp;:has(#</span><span>show-labels</span><span>:</span><span>not</span><span>(:</span><span>checked</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>&amp;</span><span>:has</span><span>(</span><span>#tiny-waypoints</span><span>:checked</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#map</span> <span>.waypoint-div</span> <span>.waypoint-marker</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>&amp;</span> <span>img</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10px</span><span>)</span> <span>scale</span><span>(</span><span>0.4</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now we can toggle between full size waypoints and mini waypoints, which is super useful when we’re zoomed out, looking at a large path with lots of waypoints:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240120115225767.png" alt="image-20240120115225767"></p>

<h3 id="waypoint-management-buttons">Waypoint management buttons</h3>

<p>Next up: some buttons for waypoint management things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a “patrol” button for turning a flightpath into a repeating path,</li>
  <li>a “reset” button to reset the flight path to “not flown yet”, and</li>
  <li>a “clear” button to remove all waypoints.</li>
</ol>

<p>Much like before, let’s start with the HTML:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    ...
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map-controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      ...
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"reset"</span><span>&gt;</span>reset waypoints<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"clear"</span><span>&gt;</span>clear waypoints<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then we update our <code>waypoint-overlay.js</code> since these are waypoint-related controls:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>WaypointOverlay</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>plane</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>addEventHandling</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>addEventHandling</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>document</span>
      <span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>`#map-controls .reset`</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>`click`</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// We won't ask for confirmation to reset the flight path for</span>
        <span>// reasons that will become clear in the next improvement.</span>
        <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>resetWaypoints</span><span>();</span>
      <span>});</span>

    <span>document</span>
      <span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>`#map-controls .clear`</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>`click`</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// But we *do* verify that this wasn't an accidental click!</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>confirm</span><span>(</span><span>`Are you sure you want to clear all waypoints?`</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>clearWaypoints</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sorted. Next up:</p>

<h3 id="repeating-the-flight-path">Repeating the flight path</h3>

<p>Let’s also add in a button that toggles the flight path from being “just this path” to “and when you get to the end, start at the start again”. First up, our page code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    ...
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map-controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      ...
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"patrol"</span><span>&gt;</span>patrol<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"reset"</span><span>&gt;</span>reset waypoints<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"clear"</span><span>&gt;</span>clear waypoints<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    ...
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>because we’re basically turning the flight path into a patrol route =)</p>

<p>Next, our <code>waypoint-overlay.js</code> to add the click handler:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>WaypointOverlay</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>addEventHandling</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>document</span>
      <span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>`#map-controls .patrol`</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>`click`</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>toggleRepeating</span><span>();</span>
      <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// But we're not done: we now also need some extra code that</span>

<p>And now we can “open” or “close” a flight path!</p>

<h3 id="adding-a-waypoint-edit-modal">Adding a waypoint edit modal</h3>

<p>Finally, we’re still missing something that lets us edit a waypoint. We can click-drag them to move them on the map but we still need UI for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>changing the elevation,</li>
  <li>duplicating a waypoint,</li>
  <li>making a waypoint the current target, and</li>
  <li>removing a waypoint.</li>
</ol>

<p>So let’s make a little modal that then let’s make sure we can also edit and/or remove waypoints, by adding some code that gives us an edit modal when we click on waypoints. And edit to our <code>waypoint-overlay.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>showWaypointModal</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>./waypoint-modal.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>WaypointOverlay</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>addWaypoint</span><span>(</span><span>waypoint</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Add a "show dialog" action when we click a waypoint marker:</span>
    <span>marker</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>`click`</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>showWaypointModal</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>waypoint</span><span>));</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then we write a bunch of fairly straight-forward JS in a new <code>waypoint-modal.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>/**

<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>showWaypointModal</span><span>(</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>waypoint</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>And now when we click on a waypoint, we get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240128100954922.png" alt="image-20240128100954922"></p>

<p>And that’s our quality of life improvements covered, how about we make this “plane” fly our flight path already!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-fly-a-flight-path">How to fly a flight path</h2>

<p>As we saw before, our naïve approach of flying waypoints is… not great. Even though we have waypoints, it turns out that just flying towards individual points without regard for the path between those points is a pretty terrible way to fly “a path”.  So (probably unsurprisingly) we need a bit more than just “fly towards a point, and when we get there, fly towards the next point” if we want proper flight path following. So let’s have a bit of a think about how we can improve our flight path logic.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the use case we already have: flying a flight path with a single waypoint. This is what we already implemented: if there’s a single point, then that’s our target, and that’s what we fly towards. So far so good, our plane can already do this!</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/waypoints/flightpath/single-point.png" alt="A single target"></p>

<p>But what do we want to have happens when we add a second point?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/waypoints/flightpath/line-segment.png" alt="Various flight segments"></p>

<p>Now we have conflicting priorities: on the one hand, the idea behind the flight path is that we fly from waypoint to waypoint, while sticking to the path, but we’re not on the path yet: do we first fly towards the next waypoint, or do we first “get on the path”? And if we’ve figured that out, what if we have a third point, creating a “real” flight path with a transition from one leg of the journey to the next:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/waypoints/flightpath/three-point-path.png" alt="Three points form a real flight path"></p>

<p>When do we transition? If we transition “when we pass the waypoint” we’ll be overshooting the next leg by a lot. If we transition too early, we might miss the waypoint we actually wanted to see.</p>

<h3 id="flight-path-policies">Flight path policies</h3>

<p>Let’s investigate some options by writing a graphics program that flies a little plane around.</p>

<graphics-element title="A flight path tester" src="./graphics/flight-path-base.js">
  <source title="our airplane class" src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>This shows the policy we already implemented, with a reduced plane radius: we switch to the next waypoint when we’re 10 pixels away from our current one, and as we know, that’s a pretty terrible policy, and leads to the plane flying something that looks nothing like our intended flight path.</p>

<p>Clearly, what we want is at least <em>some</em> form of “getting onto the line that joins waypoints”, so let’s see what we can do here: if the plane isn’t on the flight path, we can calculate the projection of the airplane onto our flight path using some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1079478/740553">basic linear algebra</a> and then fly towards that point. This will take us closer and closer to the flight path until we’re less than our plane’s radius away, at which point we stop targeting the plane’s projection and instead target the intersection point between the flightpath, and the circle around our plane. This also takes care of transitions: if we’re close enough to the next waypoint, the circle around our plane will also already be intersecting the next flight path, so we just keeping following the line/circle intersection”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Get our current waypoint</span>
<span>const</span> <span>p1</span> <span>=</span> <span>points</span><span>[</span><span>current</span><span>];</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Are we flying "a leg"?</span>
<span>const</span> <span>p2</span> <span>=</span> <span>points</span><span>[</span><span>current</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>];</span>

<span>// If we're not...</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>p2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...and we're close enough to p1 to "transtion" (to nothing,</span>
  <span>// since there's no next waypoint), switch...</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>dist</span><span>(</span><span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>p1</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>p1</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>current</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...and return p1 as "this is our target"</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>p1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// If we *are* flying a leg, project our plane onto the flightpath</span>
<span>// and target that, or if our "circle" overlaps the flight path,</span>
<span>// target the intersection of the flight path line and our circle:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>target</span> <span>=</span> <span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>project</span><span>(</span><span>p1</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>p1</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>p2</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>p2</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>r</span><span>);</span>

<span>// And if we're close enough to p2, transition.</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>dist</span><span>(</span><span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>p2</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>p2</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>airplane</span><span>.</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>current</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>return</span> <span>target</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let’s see what that does when we slot this new targeting code in the above graphics:</p>

<graphics-element title="A flight path testing program" src="./graphics/flight-path-base.js">
  <source title="our airplane class" src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
  <source title="our new targeting policy" src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/project.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>This at least looks a bit better, but it can take quite a while for the plane to be properly aligned with the flight path, and it would be nicer if we could make that happen quicker.</p>

<p>We can sort of fake that by giving our plane a smaller radius: the smaller we make it, the closer our target point on the flight path will be to our plane, but then we also run the risk of overshooting our transitions again… play around with the radius slider in the following graphic to see what happens:</p>

<graphics-element title="Intercepting the flight path" src="./graphics/flight-path-base.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/dynamic-project.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>Of course, we can be clever and give the plane <em>two</em> radii instead of just one:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one that represents our transition radius, and</li>
  <li>one that represents our on-path target radius:</li>

<p>Which has the following effect:</p>

<p>This is again better, but if you look at what happens at the transitions with angles less than 90 degrees, our outer circle intersects the next leg of our flight path <em>before</em> the plane reaches the next waypoint, so what if we transition early?</p>

<p>Instead of just projecting our plane onto the current leg, we’ll also project the plane onto the <em>next</em> leg, and if the distance from our plane to that second projection is less than our plane’s outer radius, we transition, while still using our inner radius for finding a point on the flight path to target:</p>

<p>Let’s switch our targeting code to this, and see what happens:</p>

<graphics-element title="Early transitioning" src="./graphics/flight-path-base.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/path-intersection.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>And that’s… honestly, pretty good! Of course, the challenge is now to figure out which radii to use in order for this to work with “real” planes in MSFS, so let’s change the way we determine what the inner radius is. Instead of hardcoding it, let’s express it as a percentage of the outer circle, and then let’s base our outer circle on the plane’s speed:</p>

<graphics-element title="Early transitioning" src="./graphics/flight-path-base.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/controlled.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>But can we do better? What if we instead borrow a page out of our autopilot book so far, and treat the intersection on the flightpath as an initial target that we then “move a little” so that it’s past the flightpath, so that if we’re far away from the flight path, it’s also far away (on the other side of the path), and if we’re on the flight path, it’s also on the flight path. Does that notably improve things?</p>

<p>It’s actually hard to tell: if we overlay the graphs we see that we get onto the flight path just a <em>tiny</em> bit earlier in the very last turn, but not fast enough to justify the extra work.</p>

  <span>// If we have one root, then that is, by definition, our only</span>

<p>That’s a lot of code to do what we sketched out before, so… does this work?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/waypoints/flightpath/basic-flightpath.png" alt="Following our flight path"></p>

<p>With our mock plane, well enough to barely even see our plane’s flightpath on top of the path polygon… What if we use a slightly more aggressive flight path?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/images/waypoints/flightpath/aggressive-flightpath.png" alt="A more aggressive flight path"></p>

<p>Not quite as good… Because our mock plane is pretty terrible at turning compared to the in-game planes, we’re seeing it overshoot a bit, as well as have difficulties with the short initial leg of the journey, but what we’re seeing by running our mock is promising, which means we can swap over to testing this “for real”, or rather, “in game” =)</p>

<p>But before we do, let’s make sure we can fly the same flight path with lots of different planes…</p>

<h2 id="saving-and-loading-flight-plans">Saving and loading flight plans</h2>

<p>Before we move on to testing, let’s make sure we can actually have different planes fly the same flight path, across multiple game sessions, otherwise testing is going to be quite the challenge. Thankfully, this is going to be super simple. First, we add some save and load buttons to our <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>  ...
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map-controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      ...
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        flight plan:
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"save"</span><span>&gt;</span>save<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
        load: <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"file"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"load"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"patrol"</span><span>&gt;</span>patrol<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"revalidate"</span><span>&gt;</span>revalidate<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"reset"</span><span>&gt;</span>reset waypoints<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"clear"</span><span>&gt;</span>clear waypoints<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>With just enough CSS to hide the filename that file input elements insist on showing you when you’ve pick a file (and which is, annoyingly, not something you just just… remove) in our `index.css:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>fieldset</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>border</span><span>:</span> <span>1px</span> <span>solid</span> <span>black</span><span>;</span>
  <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> <span>0.5em</span><span>;</span>
  <span>margin</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>padding</span><span>:</span> <span>0.25em</span> <span>0.5em</span><span>;</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>inline-block</span><span>;</span>

  <span>input[type="file"]</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>transparent</span><span>;</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>6em</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And some extra JS added to our waypoint overlay event handling function that will turn our list of waypoints into a JSON document that you can save, and can read in those documents in order to recreate a flight path:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>WaypointOverlay</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// Saving our waypoints is actually fairly easy: we throw everything except the lat/long/alt</span>

      <span>// And ask the user what to call this file:</span>

      <span>// Then click the link to trigger a download:</span>

<p>Which leaves adding the <code>revalidate</code> function to our <code>waypoint-manager.js</code>, so that when we load up a flight path, we can find the point on that flight path that the plane is currently closest to, mark the entire path leading up to that point as “completed”, and marking everything past it as “still pending”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>And then of course we need to expose that through the <code>autopilot-router.js</code> too:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AutopilotRouter</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>revalidate</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>waypoints</span><span>.</span><span>revalidate</span><span>(</span><span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And with that, saving and loading’s sorted, although we want to add one more button to our page now that we can load up an entire flight plan: an “arm” button.</p>

<h3 id="get-ready-to-fly-this-path">“Get ready to fly this path”</h3>

<p>When we load a flight plan, it would be super useful if we could “prime” the autopilot so that when we turn it on, we don’t then also have to enabled every single feature manually. This should be a quick fix in our <code>autopilot.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>  ...
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"MASTER"</span><span>&gt;</span>AP<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"arm-all"</span><span>&gt;</span>(arm all)<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>and our <code>public/js/autopilot.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Autopilot</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>owner</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>domAP</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>`.arm-all`</span><span>).</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>`click`</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>AP_OPTIONS</span><span>).</span><span>forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>])</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span> <span>===</span> <span>`MASTER`</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>domAP</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>`.</span><span>${</span><span>key</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>).</span><span>click</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>});</span>
    <span>});</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Done, one button now presses every other button, if they’re not already pressed. Now we can load a flight path, click “arm all”, so that when we’re ready to start flying our flight path, we only have to turn on the autopilot with everything else already set correctly.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202120537200.png" alt="One click, four buttons"></p>

<p>Which means it’s time to test things properly by loading up some planes and flying a plan!</p>

<p>And I don’t know about you, but that looks a lot like “Zero”, the ghost dog from “The Nightmare Before Christmas” to me, so this is now the ghost dog tour. Let’s fly some planes!</p>

<h2 id="initial-test-flights">Initial test flights</h2>

<h3 id="de-havilland-dhc-2-beaver">De Havilland DHC-2 “Beaver”</h3>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202123251197.png" alt="Departing the airport to start our journey"></p>

<p>We’ll start the beaver on the runway, load our flight plan, arm the autopilot, then pilot our plane manually for <em>just</em> long enough to get airborne, and then we’ll turn on the autopilot and let it run the rest of the flight while we sit back, make a coffee, maybe grab some snacks, and enjoy the view:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202123743228.png" alt="image-20240202123743228"></p>

<p>Except not for long: looking at the first few turns, it’s obvious we need to refine out heading mode code a little, because we’re already overshooting our transitions at low speeds:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202125225656.png" alt="image-20240202125225656"></p>

<p>Which means we’ll <em>really</em> overshoot our transitions at high speeds. In fact, let’s try a faster plane to see how wrong things go…</p>

<h3 id="cessna-310r">Cessna 310R</h3>

<p>The 310R is considerably faster than the Beaver, with a cruise speed that’s almost double that of the Beaver, so how do we-</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240120130749555.png" alt="image-20240120130749555"></p>

<p>Oh, okay. We can’t even make the first real turn. What happened?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240120104424564.png" alt="image-20240120104424564"></p>

<p>Ah. We plotted a course around a little 1200’ hill, and thanks to our transition logic and turn behaviour, rather than going <em>around</em> it, we tried to go <em>through</em> it. Earth vs. Plane: Earth wins. One obvious thing we can change is the transition time: a full minute is far too long when we’re going fast, but let’s also have a look at our banking behaviour:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202125414273.png" alt="image-20240202125414273"></p>

<p>This shows a max bank that’s only half of what we wanted our plane to do, so it might be time to tweak some values in <code>fly-level.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// First off, the counter-steering that we've got going on will</span>
<span>// effectively ensure we never actually get the speed we list here.</span>
<span>// As such, we can bump this from 30 to 40, to increase the max</span>
<span>// bank that planes exhibit:</span>
<span>const</span> <span>DEFAULT_MAX_BANK</span> <span>=</span> <span>40</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Next, in order to allow planes to change their rate of turn</span>
<span>// faster, we bump this up from 3 to 5. This might introduce some</span>
<span>// oscillation when we get hit from the side by a good old gust</span>
<span>// of wind, but we'll take "being wibbly" over "being dead":</span>
<span>const</span> <span>DEFAULT_MAX_D_BANK</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>// Then, we change the trim step size based on the plane's</span>
<span>// own flight model:</span>
<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>flyLevel</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>hasAileronTrim</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>isAcrobatic</span><span>,</span> <span>vs1</span><span>,</span> <span>cruiseSpeed</span><span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>flightModel</span><span>;</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>// If we're near stall speed, any amount of turn may kill us...</span>
  <span>// And if we're near cruise speed, we can turn quite a bit:</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>step</span> <span>=</span> <span>constrainMap</span><span>(</span><span>speed</span><span>,</span> <span>vs1</span><span>,</span> <span>cruiseSpeed</span><span>,</span> <span>radians</span><span>(</span><span>0.1</span><span>),</span> <span>radians</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>));</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>// And then we'll want the same kind of logic for getting</span>
  <span>// a target heading, which means passing vs1 and cruiseSpeed</span>
  <span>// on to the waypoint manager's getHeading function:</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>targetBank</span><span>,</span> <span>maxDBank</span><span>,</span> <span>targetHeading</span><span>,</span> <span>headingDiff</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>targetHeading</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// And then let's not restrict our rate of bank until we're 2 degrees,</span>
    <span>// from our target heading, rather than 10 degrees. And let's also make</span>
    <span>// sure to allow for *some* change in rate of bank at 0.</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Which leaves the fix in our <code>waypoint-manager.js</code> for the <code>getHeading</code> function, where we want the transition distance to be based on time, but the <em>amount</em> of time we need should be based on what speed we’re currently flying at, because that determines how fast we can turn:</p>

<p>Hmm. Well, we didn’t crash, but I struggle to call this “better”. In fact, let’s see what happens when try this with a plane that has a roughly similar cruise speed but doesn’t have aileron trim…</p>

<h3 id="piper-turbo-arrow-iii">Piper Turbo Arrow III</h3>

<p>Things aren’t looking too hot for our heading mode already, what if fly the same route on the stick?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202175023483.png" alt="image-20240202175023483"></p>

<p>Yeah… so… look at our plane’s attitude: we’re about to fall out of the sky.</p>

<p>II’m gonna go with “we need to rewrite our heading mode” because this just feels pretty under-performant. The map suggests we’re not turning as fast as we should So: what if we start over, and write a heading mode that turns the plane not based on bank angle, but based on turn rate?</p>

<h2 id="updating-our-heading-mode">Updating our heading mode</h2>

<p>Let’s replace the code we had for stick-based trimming with this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>flyLevel</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>diff</span> <span>=</span> <span>targetBank</span> <span>-</span> <span>bank</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Then, if we're flying on the stick, we target a turn rate that lets</span>
  <span>// cover the heading difference at a resonable speed.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>useStickInstead</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>turnDiff</span> <span>=</span> <span>targetTurnRate</span> <span>-</span> <span>turnRate</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// But we do need to boost stick changes the closer to zero</span>
    <span>// we get, because otherwise ramp-up and ramp-down takes too long:</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>proportion</span> <span>=</span> <span>constrainMap</span><span>(</span><span>turnDiff</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// And we may want to base the "max stick deflection" value on</span>
    <span>// flight model properties, but for now this will do. The maximum</span>
    <span>// deflection of the stick is +/- 2**14, but giving a plane that</span>
    <span>// much stick generally makes it do a barrel roll, so let's not,</span>
    <span>// and instead set our max deflection to 1/5th of that.</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>newAileron</span> <span>=</span> <span>proportion</span> <span>*</span> <span>maxStick</span><span>;</span>

<p>…feels like we might want to replace our original bank-based heading code with this turn rate based heading code. What if we just make <em>every</em> plane use this? Let’s throw away all the heading mode code we wrote before, because science told us it wasn’t all that great, and let’s use the following code for all planes, instead:</p>

<p>Amazing! But the map doesn’t tell the whole story, because if we look at the game (which was the whole point of course), the plane’s wobbling again, with lots of tiny back and forth corrections. So let’s smooth those out by not just setting “the new stick” in one go, but instead using a value “between the old and new stick position”, based on how big the difference between the two is: barely any difference? Bias towards the current stick value. Big difference? Bias towards the new value:</p>

<p>On the left is the usual constrain map behaviour, but that <code>... ** 0.5</code> takes the square root of the result, which means our ratio will favour being “near 1”, which means our mixing ratio will favour our current stick position more, the close to “no difference” we get, which means we jostle the stick less if we’re near our target turn rate. Now, if we look at how the plane flies in-game, we can confirm that indeed looks better, but let’s look at our graphs: what’s the difference between flying without that mixing ration, flying with a linear ratio, and flying with a non-linear ration?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202145354300.png" alt="image-20240202145354300"></p>

<p>As it turns out, we made one thing better by making another thing worse: we’ve reduced the frequency of our wobbling, but we’ve increased the <em>amount</em> of wobble. So what we really want is some way to control how much we’re “allowed” to deflect the stick, in a way that we start with a safe (far too) low maximum, and bump that up if we’re not turning fast enough (based on our turn rate), until we are. With, of course, a little bit of code that pushes it back down when we’re flying the heading we’re supposed to.</p>

<p>And wouldn’t you know it, we have a handy place to put that value: our now unused <code>trim.roll</code>. No code changes required for that at least. Then, we need some new code to let us “grow” and “shrink” the maximum allowed deflection:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>And that should be a lot better, let’s try this again:</p>

<h3 id="cessna-310r-take-3">Cessna 310R, take 3</h3>

<p>Let’s run a take-off with this new code, where we prime the autopilot before we start, and then turn it on the moment the wheels come off the ground, without interfering with the stick afterwards:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240202181817642.png" alt="image-20240202181817642"></p>

<p>Not bad, but the map alludes to something that’s <em>super</em> obvious in-game: because we start with a maximum allowed deflection of 0, the plane doesn’t actually succeed at turning for a while, so “this works” but it’s a nervous first few seconds that we can avoid by starting with a better trim value. We have a few options, none of them perfect, so let’s go with this: the more inertial mass a plane has, i.e. the more it weighs, the more energy it needs to change course. Likewise, the larger the wings and ailerons are, the more a plane will be able to turn at the same aileron angle. So let’s combine those into “weight over wing area” and use that value to set an initial trim that’s very low for planes with a very low weight, very high wing area, or both, and is much higher for planes with a lot of weight, a small wing area, or both. Looking at a few planes, that gives the following table of data:</p>

<table>
  <thead>

      <th>plane</th>

<p>This makes an intuitive kind of sense: the lighter planes are at or near the top, the heavier planes are at or near the bottom, but we also see that even though the Beaver and the D18 are wildly different weight classes, their weight over wing area is pretty similar, and so we’d expect them to need a similar amount of max aileron deflection during flight.</p>

<p>So let’s add the code that sets up our initial deflection value:</p>

<p>Much nicer!</p>

<p>Okay, yes: this is just the previous take, but now we’re looking at the whole flight. And the plane, of course:</p>

<p>And it’s looking good! Much better than before!</p>

<h3 id="dehavilland-dhc-2-beaver">DeHavilland DHC-2 Beaver</h3>

<p>Which means it’s Beaver time! …that’s not a thing. Is it? It could be thing… anyway. It’s Beaver time.</p>

<p>We already did some limited testing with this plane, but not a full flight, so… let’s fly!</p>

<p>Looking pretty, but how did we do?</p>

<p>We did very well indeed. The turbo arrow wants a bit more initial aileron trim (ramping to about 6800 on the turns) but we end up turning pretty soon after takeoff and we just fly parallel to the runway for a bit.</p>

<p>Let’s fly a leisure cruise.</p>

<p>Overall, pretty good, but there’s an interesting overshoot happening at the left-most transition, caused by having a transition radius based on a fixed amount of time. Instead, since we’re now “trimming” on turn rate, what we really want is to see how many degrees we’ll need to cover, and thus how many seconds that’s going to take, given a maximum turn rate of 3 degrees per second.</p>

<p>Let’s modify the <code>getHeading</code> in our <code>waypoint-manager.js</code> just a tiny bit:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>WaypointManager</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>getHeading</span><span>({...})</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>modes</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Get all our points up front, because we'll need all of them to</span>
    <span>// determine how many seconds we're going to need for a transition:</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>{</span> <span>currentWaypoint</span><span>:</span> <span>p1</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>p2</span> <span>=</span> <span>p1</span><span>?.</span><span>next</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>p3</span> <span>=</span> <span>p2</span><span>?.</span><span>next</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// So: how many seconds will we need for the upcoming transition</span>
    <span>// given a turn rate of 3 degrees per second?</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>seconds</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>targets</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And if we draw our transition radius on the map with a quick Leaflet <code>Circle</code>, that’s quite a difference:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203112324179.png" alt="image-20240203112324179"></p>

<p>That’s a considerably longer transition time, so we should have a much better turn now:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203112453153.png" alt="image-20240203112453153"></p>

<p>… wait, what happened? The turn starts nice and early with a good path into the turn, but then it gets what looks like a kink in the path, and then we overshoot the next transition with a tiny radius?</p>

<p>What happened is that as we transition from flying along the coast to flying towards Port Renfrew, we switched our current waypoint from Botanical Beach to Port Renfrew, and suddenly our radius started getting computed based on the path into the valley, rather than up to Port Renfrew. We don’t want that: we want to base our transition radius on “the point we’re nearest”, rather than “the current active waypoint” because those might not be the same point!</p>

<p>So: let’s make that change in our <code>waypoint-manager.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>abs</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>Math</span><span>;</span>

<span>// We'll put a lower limit on how late we can start</span>
<span>// a turn: even if the transition is barely a turn,</span>
<span>// start turning in when we're 20 seconds away, at</span>
<span>// the latest.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>MIN_RADIUS_IN_SECONDS</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>WaypointManager</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

<p>Alright, what does this do for our transition radius throughout the flight?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203123640205.png" alt="image-20240203123640205"></p>

<p>We see a small radius as we transition over a gentle turn, with that radius persisting until we’re closer to the next point, at which point our transition radius switches to the much larger one, because the turn needs to cover far more degrees. Then, once we’re turning we maintain that large radius even after the flight plan has transitioned to the next waypoint, and we don’t switch to the next, smaller, radius until we’re closer to our next point than the one we transitioned over. Leading a much better flight path behaviour:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203132121404.png" alt="image-20240203132121404"></p>

<p>This is the plane that we ended up needing to write the auto-throttle code for, so how does it fare?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203163044676.png" alt="image-20240203163044676"></p>

<p>That’ll do.</p>

<h3 id="top-rudder-solo-103">Top Rudder Solo 103</h3>

<p>So… how about we fly some of the other “edge-case” planes we looked at before? Like: what happens when we, say, try the Top Rudder ultralight again?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203132439900.png" alt="image-20240203132439900"></p>

<p>This is either going to go wrong pretty quickly, or it’s going to be <em>amazing</em></p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203132620555.png" alt="image-20240203132620555"></p>

<p>But first, let’s adjust our lower bound for the initial maximum deflection, because “zero” was clearly too low. Even this ultralight wants more than that, so let’s set it to 1500 and retry.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203133020926.png" alt="image-20240203133020926"></p>

<p>Much better. So.. time to sit back for an hour? This one’s going to take a while!</p>

<p>Or not?</p>

<p>Looks like we might need some extra help to make the top rudder less… wibbly. And this is a special enough plane that it feels okay to add a dedicated, hard coded fix in our <code>fly-level.js</code>:</p>

<p>Which gives us:</p>

<p>Much better. And if you look at our altitude, whereas we were barely keeping 1200’ before because of all the wobbling, this update keeps us at the intended 1400’, which is rather necessary as this part of the flight path takes us over a hill that’s just a few feet shy of 1400’!</p>

<p>Mind you, wind gusts and up- and downdrafts will still “punch us” off-course, but at least we should be able to recover from those reasonably well. So, back to flying the rest of the flight. The two hour flight. See you in a bit…</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240203155113450.png" alt="image-20240203155113450"></p>

<p>Overall, pretty good! The little “lump” just behind the plane in this picture is from having gotten blown off course, which we knew was going to be a possibility. Bottom line: don’t walk away from your plane, an autopilot might still kill you, especially when the plane was never designed to use one =)</p>

<p>In fact, let’s try some more of our edge cases. What about acrobatic planes?</p>

<h3 id="pitts-special-s-1s">Pitts Special S-1S</h3>

<p>Let’s jump back into our stunting plane!</p>

<p>Whereas previously these were… twitchy, the new code made them much more behaved. It’s almost like flying a regular plane!</p>

<p>In fact, what about a plane that’s even <em>more</em> twitchy, normally?</p>

<p>It’s like flying a bullet. This is going to be amazing!</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240229204704309.png" alt="image-20240229204704309"></p>

<p>As it turns out, allowing the max aileron to go all the way down to zero, and allowing it to go all the way up to 50% of the physical stick tolerances, means we’re giving our plane either way too little, or way too much stick. So we’re going to need some extra rules for <em>properly</em> twitchy planes if we want to keep them in the air. On the <code>autopilot.js</code> side we make the code “acrobatics-aware”:</p>

<div><pre><code>  <span>resetTrim</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// We want to further reduce the stick values that acrobatic planes get, so: get that flag:</span>

    <span>};</span>

    <span>// Then make sure acrobatic planes start at "just above zero" rather than "quite a lot above zero":</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>wpa</span> <span>=</span> <span>weight</span> <span>/</span> <span>wingArea</span><span>;</span>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<p>That should hopefully do it, so… did it?</p>

<p>Looks like it. Of course, that does mean we now need to also retest the Pitts Special S-1S, since that’s also has its <code>isAcrobatic</code> flight model flag set…</p>

<h3 id="pitts-special-s-1s-take-2">Pitts Special S-1S, take 2</h3>

<p>Looks like we’re still good.</p>

<h2 id="but-can-we-fly-upside-down">…But can we fly upside-down?</h2>

<p>Think about it. They’re acrobatic planes. They fly upside down at airshows all the time. Can we just… make them do that? On autopilot?? Obviously, step one is to just yank the throttle hard left or right a few times to get our plane in an inverted orientation and seeing what happens:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240204082034304.png" alt="image-20240204082034304"></p>

<p>What happens is that things work… but only ever so briefly.</p>

<p>Despite being a stunt plane, the forces acting on it really want to push it back into a “wheels down” orientation, so we’re going to have to write a bit more code that prevents the plane from righting itself, based on how much we’re tipping over. Our ideal bank angle when going straight is zero (we know it’s almost never <em>actually</em> zero, but we’re tweaking an upside-down autopilot at this point, so let’s just go with the simplest approach), and we don’t want the plane to bank any more than 30 degrees on either side of that, no matter how steep a turn we need to make. And, of course, our altitude hold doesn’t understand “upside down” so it’ll trim us into the ground.</p>

<p>So let’s sort this all out, starting with adding an <code>upsideDown</code> flag to our flight information:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>FlightInformation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>// And our "update the current flight information" code:</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>updateFlight</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>// Are we upside down?</span>
    <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>upsideDown</span> <span>=</span> <span>abs</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>bank</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>90</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Did we flip orientations between now an the previous iteration?</span>
    <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>flipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>upsideDown</span> <span>!==</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>upsideDown</span><span>;</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setGeneralProperties</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now the rest of our code can hook into that flag to do the right thing when we’re flying inverted, like our <code>altitude-hold.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>altitudeHold</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>flightInformation</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>flightData</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>flightModel</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>flightInformation</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// get the upsideDown flag:</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>VS</span><span>,</span> <span>alt</span><span>,</span> <span>pitch</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span><span>,</span> <span>bank</span><span>,</span> <span>upsideDown</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>flightData</span><span>;</span>

  <span>...</span>

  <span>// And then set our trim step, but invert it if we're flying upside</span>
  <span>// down, and double it because we'll need to more aggressively trim</span>
  <span>// while the plane is upside-down.</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>trimStep</span> <span>=</span> <span>trimLimit</span> <span>/</span> <span>10</span><span>_000</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>upsideDown</span><span>)</span> <span>trimStep</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>trimStep</span><span>;</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And, of course, our <code>fly-level.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>flyLevel</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>// Get our flag:</span>

  <span>// And allocate an offset for our aileron position:</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>offset</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

  <span>...</span>

  <span>// Then, are we flying upside down? If so, we're going to counteract</span>
  <span>// physics by adding an offset to our stick adjustments, so that we</span>
  <span>// can "catch" the plane trying to roll out of inverted orientation.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>upsideDown</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// How much are we currently deviating from 180?</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>tipAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>bank</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>?</span> <span>bank</span> <span>+</span> <span>180</span> <span>:</span> <span>bank</span> <span>-</span> <span>180</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// If we're tipping too much, reduce our max stick</span>

    <span>// Then determine how much offset on the stick we need in order to</span>
    <span>// prevent us from "rolling out of inversion", based on heading:</span>
    <span>// if we're flying straight along our flightpath, we don't want</span>
    <span>// our bank to be more than 1 degree off center, and if we're in</span>
    <span>// a turn, we can be out by up to 30 degrees:</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>bank</span><span>);</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>maxBankAngle</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span> <span>*</span> <span>constrainMap</span><span>(</span><span>aHeadingDiff</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>179</span><span>,</span> <span>150</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Also, because this is *such* an unstable way to fly, we need</span>
    <span>// an additional correction for when we're getting blown off</span>
    <span>// course by even the smallest gust or draft:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>aHeadingDiff</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>offset</span> <span>-=</span> <span>constrainMap</span><span>(</span><span>headingDiff</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>500</span><span>,</span> <span>500</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>

  <span>// And then to make things work, we add this offset to our aileron:</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>newAileron</span> <span>=</span> <span>proportion</span> <span>*</span> <span>maxStick</span> <span>+</span> <span>offset</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And with that…</p>

<p>We can fly our autopilot… upside down! Which, incidentally, is absolutely terrifying viewed from the cockpit.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240204093540784.png" alt="image-20240204093540784"></p>

<p>And just because “why not”, what does the flight path look like going around Ghost Dog?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240204095802436.png" alt="image-20240204095802436"></p>

<p>We just flew a tour of South-East Vancouver Island upside down. Need I say more?</p>

<h2 id="part-6-lets-just-have-javascript-fly-the-plane-for-us">Part 6: “Let’s just have JavaScript fly the plane for us”</h2>

<p>So now we get to the part where we’ve implemented an autopilot, and we’ve made planes fly upside down, and we could stop there, <em>or we could keep going</em>. What if we just make JavaScript fly the plane, start to finish? Because in the immortal words of Jeremy Clarkson: how hard could it be?</p>

<p>We’ll tackle this in three parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>we’ll  be adding a terrain follow mode that ensures the plane’s always at a safe altitude,</li>
  <li>we’ll  be adding auto takeoff, to get us off the run way and into the air, and</li>
  <li>we’ll be adding auto landing, to gets us back to being stopped on a runway.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="terrain-follow-mode">Terrain follow mode</h2>

<p>Normally, most planes don’t come with a mode that lets them “hug the landscape”, but we’re not flying real planes, we’re flying virtual planes, and hugging the landscape would be pretty sweet to have if we just want to fly around on autopilot and enjoy the view without having to meticulously set altitudes on every waypoint and then fly the route until we crash so we can refine those values. Having a terrain-follow mode would be so much nicer!</p>

<p>Conceptually, there’s nothing particularly hard about terrain follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scan our flight path up to a several nautical miles ahead of us,</li>
  <li>find the highest point along that path,</li>
  <li>set the autopilot altitude to something that lets us safely clear that highest point, and</li>
  <li>keep repeating this check for as long as the autopilot is running the show.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is with point (2) in that list: there is nothing baked into MSFS that lets us “query landscape elevation” using SimConnect. The only method it (currently) offers for finding elevations is to create a dummy object, spawn it into the world, then move it across the landscape and ask MSFS what its lat, long, and elevation values are, which is both quite a bit of work, and <em>slow</em>.</p>

<p>However, since the whole selling point of MSFS is that you can fly anywhere on Earth -as in, the actual Earth- we have an alternative: we could also just query some out-of-game resource for elevation data based on GPS coordinates.</p>

<p>Back in the day, Google offered that as a free web API, but they decided that it would be more profitable if they charged (quite a bit of) money for elevation API access back in 2018, so that’s out. There is also https://www.open-elevation.com, which is technically free, but because they’re don’t have Google money, they’re more for incidental work rather than constant polling. If the website is up at all. Which realistically only leaves “writing our own elevation API service”.</p>

<p>I know, I know, this sounds ludicrous, but roll with it: what do we even need?</p>

<ol>
  <li>a server that we can send elevation requests to,</li>
  <li>code that can turn GPS coordinates into elevation values, and</li>
  <li>geo data for the entire planet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these three, the first is trivial, the last is surprisingly easy, and really the only actual work we’ll have to do is point 2.</p>

<p><strong><em>“Whoa, hold up. Point 3 is easy?” —you, probably</em></strong></p>

<p>I know, geodata for the entire planet? Where do you even get that? Enter the Japanese Aerospace eXploration Agency, or <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/">JAXA</a>, and their freely available ALOS (“Advanced Land Observing Satellite”) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model">Digital Surface Model</a> datasets. Specifically, their <a href="https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/dataset/aw3d30/aw3d30_e.htm">30 meter dataset</a>, which has elevation data for the entire planet’s land surface at a resolution finer than MSFS uses, and can be downloaded for free after signing up for an (also, free) account and agreeing to their <a href="https://earth.jaxa.jp/en/data/policy">data license</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240213160714400.png" alt="image-20240213160714400"></p>

<p>There is, however, one downside: an entire planet’s worth of data isn’t a small download: it’s 450GB of on-disk data hosted as 150GB of downloads spread out over a few hundred files. But, on the upside, we know how to program, so scripting the downloads isn’t terribly hard, and a 1TB SSD is cheap these days. So as long as you have an internet plan without a data cap (which, if you game: you probably do) then that’s unlikely to <em>really</em> be a problem.</p>

<p>What <em>won’t</em> be easy is step 2, though: all that ALOS data is in the form of GeoTIFF files, which are TIFF images with <a href="http://geotiff.maptools.org/spec/geotiff6.html">metadata that describes what section of the planet they map to, and which mapping you need to use to go from pixel-coordinate to geo-coordinate</a>. Again, perhaps unexpectedly, it’s not the TIFF part that’s going to be the problem (we can just use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiff">tiff</a> package to load those in), and it’s not the “which section of the planet” part that’s going to be the problem (the data is neatly organized in directories and filenames that indicate which whole-angle GPS bounding box they’re for) it’s finding the pixel in the image that belongs to a <em>specific</em> GPS coordinate that’s going to require some work.</p>

<p>Or, it would, if <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47951513#75647596">I hadn’t already done that work for us</a>, so let’s dive in: what do we need?</p>

<h3 id="time-for-another-server">Time for another server</h3>

<p>Let’s create a <code>src/elevation/</code> directory, and then define a new little server in <code>src/elevation/alos-server.js</code> that we can use to test the rest of the code we’re about to write. Something that’ll accept a URL like  http://localhost:9000/?points=48.8,-123.8,48.9,-123.9,49,-124 and then spits out the elevation at each of those three coordinates.</p>

<p>We won’t be using this server in our actual autopilot code, but it’ll make developing and testing the elevation code on its own (before we try to integrate it into the autopilot) a lot easier. And that’s always important.</p>

<p>However, let’s not go overboard: no need for a full <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> server, we just need something small that we can query with the browser, so a plain <code>node:http</code> server will do just fine:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>http</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:http</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<p>As long as we don’t forget to add that new <code>ALOS_PORT</code> value to our <code>.env</code> file (I’m using <code>ALOS_PORT=9000</code> but obviously pick whichever port you like best) this should start up and log <code>Elevation server listening on http://localhost:9000</code>, so that calling the earlier URL http://localhost:9000/?points=48.8,-123.8,48.9,-123.9,49,-124 will give us a JSON object with an elevation value of <code>123</code> for each of those three coordinates:</p>

<p>Of course there’s a sneaky little helper file that we also need to make, <code>shim-response-prototype.js</code>, which is just a bit of code that turns Node’s response object into something a little bit more usable (and a little more into an Express.js response object):</p>

<p>Of course, on its own this server isn’t super useful yet, so let’s write the code we need to actually work with our ALOS data.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-alos-data">Working with ALOS data</h3>

<p>We’re going to split our ALOS code up into three parts: a general querying object, a tile class that maps to individual GeoTIFF files, and a really simple caching system.</p>

<p>First, some ALOS constants that we’ll put in <code>src/elevation/alos-constants.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>join</span><span>,</span> <span>resolve</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>node:path</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>__dirname</span> <span>=</span> <span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>dirname</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>SEA_LEVEL</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>ALOS_VOID_VALUE</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>9999</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>NO_ALOS_DATA_VALUE</span> <span>=</span> <span>9999</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>INDEX_FILE</span> <span>=</span> <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>__dirname</span><span>,</span> <span>`alos-index.json`</span><span>));</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>CACHE_DIR</span> <span>=</span> <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>__dirname</span><span>,</span> <span>`cache`</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, our querying object, which we’ll put in <code>src/elevation/alos-interface.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>getDistanceBetweenPoints</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils/utils.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<p>If we look at the previous result’s <code>ms</code> value, we see that it takes about 100 milliseconds to get a result… that’s pretty long! It might not seem very long, but we don’t want to get “a handful of elevation values”, we’re going to want to get a <em>whole bunch</em> of them and find the highest elevation amongst them, so we Let’s see which part(s) of the code are taking up how much time, <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/js-call-tracer/tree/main">tracing the function calls</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>╭┈┈

╰┈┈
</code></pre></div>

<p>On the first call,  we spend approximately “literally no time” running the actual lookup, and approximately “the entirety of the call runtime” on figuring out the tile name, and loading the associated file into memory. Let’s drill down a little further and split up our <code>getTileFromFolder</code> into separate steps:</p>

<div><pre><code>  <span>...</span>
  <span>getTileFromFolder</span><span>(</span><span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>join</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>tilesFolder</span><span>,</span> <span>fullPath</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let’s run another trace:</p>

<div><pre><code>...
│ —&gt;   call: ALOSInterface.getTileFor(...)
│ —&gt;     call: ALOSInterface.getTileFromFolder(...)
│ —&gt;       call: ALOSInterface.getTileName(...)
│ &lt;—       finished ALOSInterface.getTileName(), return value: ..., runtime: 0ms
│ —&gt;       call: ALOSInterface.getTilePath(...)
│ &lt;—       finished ALOSInterface.getTilePath(), return value: ..., runtime: 0ms
│ &lt;—     finished ALOSInterface.getTileFromFolder(), return value: ..., runtime: 1ms
│ &lt;—   finished ALOSInterface.getTileFor(), return value: ..., runtime: 25ms
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>“why is the runtime 25ms when the inner calls take 0ms?” I imagine you to be asking at this point, and the reason for this is that the tracer can’t trace constructors, it can only work once an object has already been constructed, so there’s a constructor call in there somewhere, and the only candidate for scrutiny is our <code>new ALOSTile(...)</code> call. Let’s add some <code>Date.now() - start</code> logic in that constructor to log how long the various parts take:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>running</span> <span>ALOSTile</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span>
  <span>reading</span> <span>file</span> <span>took</span> <span>5</span><span>ms</span>

  <span>extracting</span> <span>values</span> <span>took</span> <span>0</span><span>ms</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out decoding 25MB tiff files takes a bit, and we do that <em>every time we ask for a coordinate</em>… so how about… we don’t? Let’s add a tile cache to our <code>alos-interface.js</code> so that we only load a tile once, cutting out the file loading and tiff decoding after the first time we need to load a specific tile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<p>Sure, the initial load takes just as long as before, simply because it has to, but any lookup using a cached tile now takes a millisecond. And sure, we now have a higher memory footprint, but RAM is cheap, and the gains are clearly worth it!</p>

<h3 id="working-with-shapes">Working with shapes</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, single point lookups are nice and all, but in order for this to be useful to our autopilot we need to know what the maximum elevation is inside “some shape” rather than “at some point”, which requires writing some more code that can find all pixels within a shape and then turn all of those into a single “highest value”. So:</p>

<ol>
  <li>we’ll want some code that can get the max elevation inside a shape that falls within a single tile,</li>
  <li>then, we’ll want to extend that code so that we can “split up” a shape that covers more than one tile,</li>
  <li>and then we’ll want to combine those two things so that we get a single max elevation value, even if we need to check multiple tiles.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="adding-polygon-awareness">Adding polygon-awareness</h4>

<p>Let’s make life easy (well, “easier”) on ourselves and restrict the kind of shapes we work with to polygons, with GPS coordinates as vertices, so we can ask our server for something like  http://localhost:9000/?poly=47.8,-123.1,47.8,-123.99,48.99,-123.99,48.99,-123.1 and have it know we mean the “rectangle” (not really, but at small scale, close enough) spanned by N47.8W123.1 and N48.99W123.99.</p>

<p>This requires updating our server a tiny bit:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<h4 id="scanlines-and-bresenham">Scanlines and Bresenham</h4>

<p>While we’re trying to find the max elevation, what we’re <em>really</em> trying to do is find the pixel coordinate that has the highest encoded value, which we’re going to have to do by inspecting every pixel that lies within our polygon, and because “reading a pixel value” and “setting a pixel value” are essentially the same thing, what we’re doing is <em>nearly identical</em> to something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill">flood filling</a> a shape.</p>

<p>There are several ways in which to do this (and I encourage you to read about all of them!) but the one we’ll go with is the “scanline” approach: because our pixels are internally organized as a 1D array, with positions 0 through 3599 being the first row of pixels, positions 3600 through 7199 being the second row of pixels, and so on, we can very quickly “scan through lines” of consecutive pixels, but not so easily skip from one row to the next. So, if we can “chop up” our polygon into a set of scan lines, we can then run through each of those, find the max value, and then the overall max value is simply “the max of all maxes”. In pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>highest = -Infinity
scanlines = chopUpPolygon(poly)
for each line in scanlines:
  for each pixel value in line:
    if pixel value &gt; highest:
      highest = pixel_value
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the hard part here is chopping up our polygon into scanlines, but thankfully we’re not sailing through uncharted waters here, this kind of graphics work has some super solid foundations, a famous one of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm">Bresenham’s line algorithm</a> for drawing a line between two points using only integer coordinates, which we can actually very easily use to construct our set of scan lines.</p>

<p>Let’s start from the bottom up:</p>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is Bresenham’s algorithm with one important change: instead of “coloring” pixels in order to draw lines, we store the result in a lookup table that’s indexed on <code>y</code>. For a single pass, that may not sound super useful, but look at what happens if we run this for a polygon with coordinates (0,0), (10,0), (10,10), and (0,10).</p>

<p>First we index between (0,0) and (10,0), filling out <code>scanLines</code> lookup to:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>7</span><span>,</span><span>8</span><span>,</span><span>9</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we process the edge from (10,0) to (10,10):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>7</span><span>,</span><span>8</span><span>,</span><span>9</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>],</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>],</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then the edge from (10,10) to (0,10):</p>

<div><pre><code>{
  [0]: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10],
  [1]: [10],
  ...
  [9]: [10],
  [10]: [10,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then closing edge from (0,10) back to (0,0):</p>

<div><pre><code>{
  [0]: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,0],
  [1]: [10,0],
  ...
  [9]: [10,0],
  [10]: [10,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,0]
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we now sort those arrays and throw away everything except the first and last number, using we get:</p>

<div><pre><code>{
  [0]: [0,10],
  [1]: [0,10],
  ...
  [9]: [0,10],
  [10]: [0,10]
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>And suddenly we have all the scanlines that cover our polygon, expressed as a start and end <code>x</code> value, for any given <code>y</code>: the first row, at <code>y=0</code>, has a scanline that starts at <code>x=0</code> and runs up to and including <code>x=10</code>. The next line has the same, etc.  If we do this for <code>{(0,0), (10,5), (10,10), (0,5)}</code> we get:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>8</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>5</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>7</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>9</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>8</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>]:</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now find all the points in our polygon by starting at a scanline start, and running to the end. The following picture shows our original four points that define our polygon, then the scanline start and end values in the middle, and then all the implicit intermediate values coloured in on the right:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240209112833961.png" alt="image-20240209112833961"></p>

<p>So that looks pretty good! Although there is one caveat: this won’t work if the polygon is concave such that there would be multiple scanlines per row:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240209113348725.png" alt="image-20240209113348725"></p>

<p>Even though the line algorithm will find the lines marked in gray in the middle image, all those pixels are “not at the start or end” and so our concave polygon turns into a convex polygon instead. We <em>could</em> fix our code to account for that, but given the reason that we’re writing this code is to determine the maximum elevation in some area around-and/or-in-front-of our airplane, this simply won’t be an problem we need to deal with. Convex polygons it is!</p>

<p>so, let’s write the code that does the same thing that we just did by hand:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formScanLines</span><span>(</span><span>poly</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// first, rewrite the input so that it's a "closed" polygon</span>
  <span>// by having its first coordinate be its last coordinate, too:</span>
  <span>poly</span> <span>=</span> <span>[...</span><span>poly</span><span>,</span> <span>poly</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]];</span>

  <span>// Then, preallocate our "scanline lookup table":</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>scanLines</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>

  <span>// And then we run through every edge, callig our</span>
  <span>// Bresenham function to update our lookup table:</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>poly</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>poly</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>e</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>poly</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>fillScanLines</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>scanLines</span><span>);</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Then we run the last step, where we turn rows of values</span>
  <span>// into start and end values. If we wanted this to work</span>
  <span>// for concave polygons we would need to do a bit more work,</span>
  <span>// because in that case a row can have multiple start and ends.</span>
  <span>// However, given the shape(s) we'll want to work with, we</span>
  <span>// can assume single start and end values.</span>
  <span>scanLines</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>line</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>line</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>

  <span>});</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>scanLines</span><span>;</span>

<p>Which we can check for accuracy by looking that coordinate up on the map. Does this result make sense?</p>

<p>It looks like we’ve found the peak(s) of Mount Olympus, in Olympic National Park, Washington, US, which is <em>by far</em> the highest point around for many miles (and thus, for “even manier kilometers”): great success!</p>

<h4 id="optimizing-our-call-time-coarse-lookups">Optimizing our call time: coarse lookups</h4>

<p>Let’s check some timings: if we repeat-run this query so that our tile is cached, it takes about 50 milliseconds to find the highest point in an area that’s around 10,000 square kilometers. And while that certainly doesn’t seem bad, is it…. <em>good</em>?</p>

<p>Specifically: the ALOS data has a 30 meter resolution (meaning each pixel represents the elevation measured over a 30m x 30m area), which is smaller than the wing span of some planes (For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320neo_family">Airbus A320neo</a> has a wingspan of 35 meters) so what if we turn our beautiful 30 meter resolution data into something a little coarser, like 60m x 60m, or 120m x 120m, by resizing the image data while keeping “the highest values” instead of averaging them like a normal resize would?</p>

<p>We’re now getting results for entire GPS grid blocks in under 10 milliseconds!</p>

<p>We could even bump our scale up to 4, and get it down to running in only 3 milliseconds, but now we’re looking at diminishing returns: going from 50ms to 6ms is <em>huge</em>, but going from 50ms to 3ms is just not appreciably better. Instead, let’s focus on what’s left on our list of things we need to do before terrain follow can work.</p>

<h4 id="splitting-our-shapes">Splitting our shapes</h4>

<p>So far, we’ve restrict our polygon to something that fits inside a single, 1 degree x 1 degree tile, and that’s not super useful when we’re flying around and crossing degree lines all the time. Ideally, we’d:</p>

<ul>
  <li>split our polygon into 2 or more partials if it crosses degree lines,</li>
  <li>find the max elevation in each “partial”, and then</li>
  <li>pick whichever of those partial’s result is the highest.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last two are pretty straight forward given that we already wrote code that does that above, and the first one is a little harder, but not much harder. Let’s start with our <code>alos-interface.js</code> where we want to update <code>getMaxElevation</code> so it can deal with coordinates that cover more than one tile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>ALOSInterface</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

   * Let's expand our function to deal with multiple tiles:
   */</span>
  <span>getMaxElevation</span><span>(</span><span>geoPoly</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// We'll get to this function...</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>quadrants</span> <span>=</span> <span>splitAsQuadrants</span><span>(</span><span>geoPoly</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// But assuming that works, we start with a dummy result:</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>lat</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>

    <span>};</span>

    <span>// Then check each partial polygon in its own tile to see</span>
    <span>// if that yields a higher max elevation</span>
    <span>quadrants</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>((</span><span>poly</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>// ...but remember that not every GPS "rectangle" has a</span>

<p>So let’s explore that <code>splitAsQuadrants</code> function. At the distances we want to work with, polygons will almost certainly cross degree lines, but they <em>won’t</em> be crossing more than one degree line in either direction, which leaves us with the following possibilities:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240207220242889.png" alt="image-20240207220242889"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240207220309961.png" alt="image-20240207220309961"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240207220348606.png" alt="image-20240207220348606"><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240207220430386.png" alt="image-20240207220430386"></p>

<p>As well as a special case where one of our edges may cross both the vertical and horizontal degree lines at the same time:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240207221029594.png" alt="image-20240207221029594"></p>

<p>So the first step is: figure out which degree lines might split our polygon.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>splitAsQuadrants</span><span>(</span><span>poly</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Figure out which "horizontal" and "vertical"</span>
  <span>// lines we may need to cut our polygon:</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>lats</span> <span>=</span> <span>[],</span> <span>longs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
  <span>poly</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>])</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lats</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>lat</span> <span>|</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>longs</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>long</span> <span>|</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>});</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>hThreshold</span> <span>=</span> <span>ceil</span><span>((</span>
    <span>min</span><span>(...</span><span>longs</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>max</span><span>(...</span><span>longs</span><span>))</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span>
  <span>);</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>vThreshold</span> <span>=</span> <span>ceil</span><span>(</span>
    <span>(</span><span>min</span><span>(...</span><span>lats</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>max</span><span>(...</span><span>lats</span><span>))</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that work done, we can use three steps to split any polygon into “as many pieces as needed”: first we split one way, then we split the resulting (up to) two pieces the other way, yielding (up to) four pieces:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>splitAsQuadrants</span><span>(</span><span>poly</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>// Perform a three-way polygon split:</span>
  <span>//</span>
  <span>// first we split left/right, then we split both results</span>
  <span>// (one of which might be an empty array) top/bottom so</span>
  <span>// that we end up with up to four regions in which we need</span>
  <span>// to find the maximum elevation.</span>
  <span>poly</span> <span>=</span> <span>[...</span><span>poly</span><span>,</span> <span>poly</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]];</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>splitAlong</span><span>(</span><span>poly</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>hThreshold</span><span>);</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>tl</span><span>,</span> <span>bl</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>splitAlong</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>vThreshold</span><span>);</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>tr</span><span>,</span> <span>br</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>splitAlong</span><span>(</span><span>right</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>vThreshold</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>tr</span><span>,</span> <span>br</span><span>,</span> <span>bl</span><span>,</span> <span>tl</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s the easy part covered. Now for the part where we actually split a polygon along some line… For this, we need to consider the two points on either side of an edge: either they’re both on the same side of our dividing line, and we don’t need to do anything special, or they’re on opposite sides of the divide, and the edge between them will need to be split.</p>

<p>So let’s start with two empty shapes, one for “all points less or equal to” our dividing line, and one for “all points greater than” our dividing line, and then start running through our shape one edge at a time:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>splitAlong</span><span>(</span><span>coords</span><span>,</span> <span>dim</span><span>,</span> <span>threshold</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// our new shapes:</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>le</span> <span>=</span> <span>[],</span> <span>gt</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>

  <span>// Then we run through all edges by iterating over point pairs:</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>coords</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>e</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>coords</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>// if the first point is less or equal to our divider,</span>
    <span>// add that point to our new "less or equal" shape.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>[</span><span>dim</span><span>]</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>threshold</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>le</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>);</span>
      <span>// If the second point is on the other side of our</span>
      <span>// divider, we split up the edge by generating two new</span>
      <span>// points on either side of the divider, and then adding</span>
      <span>// the one on a's side to the same shape we added a to,</span>
      <span>// and we add the one on b's side to the other shape.</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>b</span><span>[</span><span>dim</span><span>]</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>threshold</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>splitEdge</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>dim</span><span>,</span> <span>threshold</span><span>,</span> <span>le</span><span>,</span> <span>gt</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// And if the first point is greater than our divider, we</span>
    <span>// do the same thing but with the target shapes switched.</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>gt</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>);</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>b</span><span>[</span><span>dim</span><span>]</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>threshold</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>splitEdge</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>dim</span><span>,</span> <span>threshold</span><span>,</span> <span>le</span><span>,</span> <span>gt</span><span>);</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// Once we've done all that, we need to make sure that we</span>
  <span>// return closed polygons, so for both shapes (IF they have</span>
  <span>// any points) we need to add the first point as the last point.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>le</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>le</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>le</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>le</span><span>,</span> <span>gt</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So: not a lot of code, but we did gloss over <code>splitEdge()</code>, so let’s define that, too:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>splitEdge</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>dim</span><span>,</span> <span>threshold</span><span>,</span> <span>le</span><span>,</span> <span>gt</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// How far along the edge can we find our divider,</span>
  <span>// relative to the first point?</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>threshold</span> <span>-</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>dim</span><span>])</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>b</span><span>[</span><span>dim</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>dim</span><span>]);</span>

  <span>// Then, if we're splitting top/bottom we need two</span>
  <span>// points above and below our dividing line:</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>dim</span> <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>long</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
    <span>// console.log(`splitting [0] with`, [threshold, long]);</span>
    <span>le</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>([</span><span>threshold</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>]);</span>
    <span>gt</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>([</span><span>threshold</span> <span>+</span> <span>cm</span><span>,</span> <span>long</span><span>]);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// If we're not, then we're splitting left/right and we</span>
  <span>// need two points to the left and right of our divider:</span>
  <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>lat</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
    <span>// console.log(`splitting [1] with`, [lat, threshold]);</span>
    <span>le</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>([</span><span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>threshold</span><span>]);</span>
    <span>gt</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>([</span><span>lat</span><span>,</span> <span>threshold</span> <span>+</span> <span>cm</span><span>]);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now we can query across degree lines just fine: if we load http://localhost:9000/?poly=47.1,-123.1,47.1,-124.8,48.8,-124.8,48.8,-123.1 we get:</p>

<div><pre><code>{
  "poly": [
    [47.1, -123.1],
    [47.1, -124.8],
    [48.8, -124.8],
    [48.8, -123.1]
  ],
  "result": {
    "lat": 47.80222222222222,
    "long": -123.7088888888889,
    "elevation": { "feet": 7911, "meter": 2411 },
    "resolution": 123.69
  },
  "ms": 26
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s still Mount Olympus, found in a 2 degree x 2 degree area (50,000 square kilometers), in only 26 milliseconds. I think we’re good to go in terms of plugging this into our autopilot for terrain follow purposes, given that that’s going to run every 500 milliseconds!</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Let’s finally make this all work. First, let’s add some terrain mode related constant to <code>constants.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>KNOTS_IN_KM_PER_MINUTE</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0308667</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>TERRAIN_FOLLOW</span> <span>=</span> <span>`TER`</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>TERRAIN_FOLLOW_DATA</span> <span>=</span> <span>`TerrainFollowData`</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>TERRAIN_FOLLOW_SAFETY</span> <span>=</span> <span>500</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first terrain value is the toggle for enabling/disabling terrain follow, and the second will let us send terrain information to clients so that we can visualize the area we’re working with, with the last value being used to determine how many feet to add to the max elevation in order to set our autopilot’s altitude hold value.</p>

<p>Next up, our <code>autopilot.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Pretty straight-forward code, and even though we’ll want to implement <code>getMaxElevation</code> in our <code>waypoint-manager.js</code> eventually, we can test the non-flight-planned terrain follow mode right now!</p>

<p>…well, okay, almost right now, we still need to add that <code>getPointAtDistance</code> to our <code>utils.js</code>:</p>

<p>And update our browser page, starting with <code>autopilot.html</code> so we have a button to press:</p>

<p>and our <code>public/js/autopilot.js</code> so that button also actually does something:</p>

<p>Then we just need a tiny bit of CSS in our <code>public/css/autopilot.css</code> that makes our “probe polies” stand out:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#autopilot</span> <span>{</span>

<span>.terrain-probe</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>fill</span><span>:</span> <span>#00ffc8</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>/*
  Also: when terrain follow is enabled, we hide the  waypoint marker
  elevation indicators, because they're not actually getting used.
*/</span>
<span>body</span><span>:has</span><span>(</span><span>.TER.active</span><span>)</span> <span>.waypoint-div</span><span>::before</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s it: let’s fire up a flight and turn on terrain follow!</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240209135510306.png" alt="image-20240209135510306"></p>

<p>We see our elevation probe (correctly pointing in the direction of the autopilot), starting at 2km wide (1km on either side of the plane) and ending at a tip a the 5 minute flight’s worth of distance away from the plane. The highest elevation covered by our probe is the peak of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Maxwell_Provincial_Park">Mount Maxwell</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Spring_Island">Salt Spring Island</a>. Since the elevation found is 2002 feet, the autopilot altitude hold value is 2600: 2002 plus 500, rounded up to a multiple of 100.</p>

<p>We could let the plane fly forever and it wouldn’t crash into anything! …well, until it runs out of fuel, of course. But there’s a setting for infinite fuel, so…!</p>

<h3 id="elevation-along-a-flight-path">Elevation along a flight path</h3>

<p>Of course we still need to implement the elevation code for when we’re flying with a flight plan: rather than a single polygon, that “5 minutes of flight distance” might cover multiple full and partial legs of the flight, so we’ll need some code that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>can chop up our “probe distance” into a set of distances, each related to a different leg of the flight plan,</li>
  <li>can create polygons for each of those distances,</li>
  <li>can find the max elevation inside each of those polygons, and</li>
  <li>can return the highest value amongst those results.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve already seen 2 through 4 in code we literally just wrote, leaving us with only the first point to solve, which we can break down into three separate problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>finding the distance from the plane to the waypoint it’s currently flying towards,</li>
  <li>if that distance is less than the probe length: finding how many complete legs after that waypoint are fully covered by our probe length minus the distance found in 1 (which might be zero),</li>
  <li>if there is a next leg, finding out how much of that legs the remaining probe length covers, or</li>
  <li>if there is no next leg, just “finishing the shape” by drawing a shorter-than-full-length triangle in the direction that we’ll be flying in at that point.</li>
</ol>

<p>The nice thing about breaking down the problem is that none of these tasks, individually, is particularly complicated. And once they all work, simply putting them together means we’ll have our full solution.</p>

<h4 id="finding-the-distance-from-the-plane-to-its-next-waypoint">Finding the distance from the plane to its next waypoint</h4>

<p>This one’s pretty easy. If we’re flying a flight plan, we’re either flying towards the current waypoint (when we’re still getting onto the flight path, as well as any time we’re close enough to a waypoint to effect a transition), or we’re flying towards the waypoint after it, so let’s find out which of those it is:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>WayPointManager</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

      <span>// Sweet: we found it.</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>When this happens, we want to make sure to capture a strip of flight path that’s 2km wide and runs from our plane to the waypoint we’re targeting:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>d1</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>d2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>// Then find the max elevation in that strip:</span>

        <span>maxElevation</span> <span>=</span> <span>partialMax</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>

      <span>// Then save the shape we just used so we can send it to the browser:</span>
      <span>geoPolies</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>geoPoly</span><span>);</span>

      <span>// And then as last step, reduce our probe length by the length of our strip:</span>

      <span>probeLength</span> <span>-=</span> <span>d</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And with that, we’ve solved the “if we’re not on the flight path yet” part of the problem</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240209144406788.png" alt="image-20240209144406788"></p>

<p>Though we’re going to have to massage that just a <em>tiny</em> bit because if the first waypoint on a flight plan is far away from us, we don’t want to check the entire length of the distance for a max elevation. We still only want to only check up to a distance of <code>probeLength</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>d1</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>d2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>// Is our waypoint further away than we need for elevation purposes?</span>
        <span>// If so, don't build out our elevation polygon to "the current</span>

        <span>].</span><span>map</span><span>(...);</span>
        <span>...</span>
      <span>}</span>

<p>And now, rather than a “probe polygon” that runs all the way from our plane to the first waypoint, even if that distance is half the world away, we’ll only use a polygon that’s (at most) five minutes long.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240213171035696.png" alt="image-20240213171035696"></p>

<p>So let’s move on to the “if we <em>are</em> on the flight path” equivalent. If we’re on the flight path, then the distances we used in the above check don’t really apply: the distance between the plane and the end point of the leg is (by definition, really) always less than the distance between the two end points, so we’re going to simply iterate over each leg, and if that’s the one we’re currently one, we form a partial “strip”:</p>

<p>This code has three possible branches, one of which is the one we wanted to implement here, and the other two we’ll look at in the next sections. For now, let’s focus on building our “partial leg” polygon: you may notice that we’re starting with <code>const g = current.geoPoly.slice()</code>: since legs on a flightpath are fixed until we move a waypoint, it makes sense to have waypoints cache their associated polygon and max elevation:</p>

<p>Pretty simple, and that save us a <em>lot</em> of computation. Back to our waypoint manager though: <code>current.geoPoly.slice()</code> gets us a copy of the full leg’s polygon, but it has the wrong start points for our need, so we replace those by figuring out how far along the leg we are, expressed as a ratio, which we then use to create new start points for our polygon. For instance, if we’re midway between the start and end points, then the ratio is 0.5, and we create two new points that are 0.5 interpolations of the original start and end points.</p>

<p>And that covers our second possible “start of the probe”:</p>

<h4 id="finding-the-number-of-legs-that-are-fully-covered">Finding the number of legs that are fully covered</h4>

<p>Next up, how many legs are fully covered by the remaining probe length? We already saw the scaffolding for this in the previous section, and our waypoints already cache full-length polygons and max elevations, so this’ll be a quick bit of code:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>probeLength</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

      <span>// If d &lt; probeLength, our probe will cover either the entire leg, or</span>
      <span>// the entire "remainder" of the leg, if it's the one we're flying, so...</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>probeLength</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

          <span>...</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>// If it's not, then we find the max elevation along the entire</span>
        <span>// length of this leg's "strip", which really just means asking</span>
        <span>// the current waypoint for its already cached polygon and elevation:</span>
        <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>geoPolies</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>current</span><span>.</span><span>geoPoly</span><span>);</span>

        <span>// which we'll do in the next section.</span>

<p>We again start with the full-length poly, but this time we need to bring the end points in towards the start, based on how much probe length we have left. Pretty much a straight copy paste, but this time updating <code>g[1]</code> and <code>g[2]</code>, rather than <code>g[0]</code> and <code>g[3]</code>. Boom, problem solved!</p>

<p>Was it a lot of work? Absolutely. Was it worth it? <em><strong>Absolutely</strong></em>.</p>

<h3 id="testing-our-code-2">Testing our code</h3>

<p>So let’s see what happens if we run our test flight with terrain follow rather than preprogrammed altitudes? Let’s find out! We’ll grab ourselves a Twin Beech and let’s see what happens! First, let’s look at the altitude curve when we’re flying the Ghost Dog Tour without terrain follow:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240210101811963.png" alt="image-20240210101811963"></p>

<p>And then, <em>with</em> terrain follow:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240209172658718.png" alt="image-20240209172658718"></p>

<p>So now we have two ways to fly a flight plan, but one of those requires zero effort on our part when it comes to flying it: we can now  just drop down a bunch of points on the map and let the autopilot figure out how to safely fly that. And then it does!</p>

<p>And if we want to make things <em>exciting</em> we can lower the safe altitude to something like 25 feet instead of 500 feet… although of course the terrain follow code will still round that up to the nearest higher multiple of 100, and it won’t be able to fly as low through a canyon as a well-flown, elevation tailored flight plan will simply because the elevation probe almost certainly covers the sides cliff sides on either side.</p>

<p>…Still…</p>

<p>…okay you know what, that actually looks perfectly fine. Guess we’re flying at 25 from now on!</p>

<h2 id="auto-takeoff">Auto takeoff</h2>

<p>So with “safely flying as long as we’re in the air” covered, let’s work on <em>getting</em> ourselves up ion the air. This is, barring auto-landing, the hardest thing to implement if we’re not building a bespoke autopilot for one specific plane, but we’re going to do it anyway, and we’re going to succeed, <em>and</em> it’s going to be glorious. (Although I won’t guarantee it won’t be janky!)</p>

<p>We’ll tackle this by breaking up the task again:</p>

<ol>
  <li>we want to make sure the plane is ready for takeoff, then</li>
  <li>throttle up and roll down the runway to pick up speed. <em>Ideally in a straight line</em>. Then,</li>
  <li>rotating the plane in order to take off once we’re at take-off speed, and then</li>
  <li>switch to the autopilot and keep on flying.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="our-auto-takeoff-handler">Our auto-takeoff handler</h3>

<p>Let’s start by writing the scaffolding we’ll need in order to run through auto-takeoff, with a new autopilot mode, a new mode function, and of course a new browser page button to trigger this functionality. So you know the drill by now: let’s add a constant:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>AUTO_TAKEOFF</span> <span>=</span> <span>`ATO`</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and plug that into the autopilot</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>...,</span> <span>AUTO_TAKEOFF</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils/constants.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>...</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>modes</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>...,</span>
    <span>[</span><span>AUTO_TAKEOFF</span><span>]:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and our <code>public/js/autopilot.js</code> as well:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>AP_OPTIONS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>ATO</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and our <code>autopilot.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  ...
  <span>&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;button</span> <span>title=</span><span>"terrain follow"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"TER"</span><span>&gt;</span>terrain follow<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;button</span> <span>title=</span><span>"auto takeoff"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"ATO"</span><span>&gt;</span>take off<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(Also note the moved  terrain follow button: let’s just group our special functions)</p>

<p>Then, our auto takeoff function. Or rather, our take off object, because it’s going to have to do a lot of “this-takeoff-relevant” value tracking throughout the takeoff process, so it makes more sense to use a proper object rather than a (mostly) stateless function:</p>

<p>Which we then import into the autopilot, but with some extra code to make the autopilot run faster when we’re in auto-takeoff, because our half-second interval is too long for the auto-rudder to do its job (you can literally “spin out” in half a second when a heavy tail dragger goes from three wheels on the ground to only two wheels on the ground because it reached a speed that’s fast enough for the tail to lift).</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s set up some stub implementations so that we can run this code in action while <em>we</em> perform a takeoff.</p>

<p>And now the challenge becomes replicating that in our autopilot.</p>

<h3 id="preflight-checklist">Preflight checklist</h3>

<p>Our pre-flight checklist is relatively simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we want to make sure our altimeter is calibrated,</li>
  <li>we want to make sure the parking brake is off,</li>
  <li>flaps get fully retracted (some planes want flaps during takeoff, others don’t, and we have no way of looking up which it is, so all planes get to lift off without the help of flaps. <em>Use the runway, that’s what it’s for</em>.)</li>
  <li>we reset all the trim values so that we start off neutral (again, some planes want trim for takeoff: too bad for them),</li>
  <li>we set the elevator position to 0 (just in case it wasn’t),</li>
  <li>we set the fuel mixture somewhere between full rich and 65% depending on whether we’re sitting at sea level or 8000 feet, or somewhere in between those two.</li>
  <li>if the plane’s a tail dragger, we lock the tail wheel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Turning that into code:</p>

<p>Nothing particularly hard or complicated, just “set things to what they need to be so we can start our take-off”. So… let’s start our take-off?</p>

<h3 id="runway-roll">Runway roll</h3>

<p>There’s two aspects to a proper runway roll:</p>

<ol>
  <li>build up speed</li>
  <li>keep rolling straight</li>
  <li><code>goto 1</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, the easy part is throttling the engines up to 100%. The <em>hard</em> part is keeping the plane on the runway: propeller torque as well as small differences in engine outputs on multi-engine aircrafts <em>can and will</em> roll us off the runway if we don’t use the pedals to steer us in the right direction. For instance, let’s see what happens if we just throttle up the engines without any kind of rudder action:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240210182744489.png" alt="image-20240210182744489"></p>

<p><em>The 310R, Beaver, Twin Beech, DC-3, Kodiak 100, Top Rudder, Arrow, Pitts, and Gee Bee R3.</em></p>

<p>It’s not good: this is varying degrees of either crashing into trees or buildings, or managing to take off in “nowhere near the direction of the runway”. So we’re definitely going to need to implement an auto-rudder of sorts if we want to at least <em>pretend</em> we’re sticking to the runway during takeoff.</p>

<p>One thing we notice is the difference between the 310R and the three tail draggers. As you may have guessed, this corresponds to the moment when the tail wheel no longer makes contact with the ground: up until that point we have the benefit of actually being able to (slightly) steer using the rear wheel, with the actual rudder having to do very little, but once it’s off the ground we need to briefly work the rudder a lot harder to stop the plane from suddenly veering off.</p>

<p>So our attempt at an auto-rudder will consist of a few phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-roll: where we make sure the plane’s ready to roll (brakes, flaps, etc) and we record our center line,
    <ul>
      <li>which we already implemented!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>initial roll, with all wheels on the ground, and plenty of control
    <ul>
      <li>slowly throttle up so we give ourselves time to ease the rudder in as well.</li>
      <li>pick a target on the center line about a kilometer ahead of us to “rudder towards”</li>
      <li>the more out-of-heading we get, the more we rudder in to get back onto the center line.</li>
      <li>if this is not a tail dragger, this phase effectively lasts for the entire roll, but if this <em>is</em> a tail dragger:
        <ul>
          <li>there will be loss of control when the tail wheel comes off the ground,</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we’re lucky (or we accept “good enough”) we can come up with code that can handle all of these phases without knowing “which phase we’re in”, so we’ll make some more observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the faster we’re going, the less rudder we need to apply to get the same correction over time,</li>
  <li>the closer to the center line we are, the less rudder we need to apply, and</li>
  <li>every plane has rudder characteristics that we could use to finesse the code. But we don’t have access to those.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the first two are relatively easy to implement (although we’ll need a fair bit of code for step 2, even if it’s simple code). It’s that last point that’s properly annoying. There’s just no way to get the information we want, so if we want something that mostly kind of sort of works for mostly all planes, we’re going to have run this code a million times for different planes and figure out what “magic constant” works for which plane. And then try to figure out what plane property that we <em>do</em> have access to we can tie that to. To save you that headache, I’ve done that work for us, but suffice it to say we shouldn’t feel good about this solution and ideally, one day, we will come up with something better.</p>

<p>So let’s write some code:</p>

<p>And with that, what do things look like now?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240211210723937.png" alt="image-20240211210723937"></p>

<p>That looks straight to me! Although those last two reveal an interesting problem: the acrobat planes take off <em>really quickly</em>, at which point their wings are not level, and they start to veer. So let’s keep that in the back of our mind as we implement…</p>

<h3 id="rotatetake-off">Rotate/take-off</h3>

<p>Once we’re at rolling at a good speed, we’ll need to rotate at some point (i.e. get its nose up) and take to the skies, but what’s a good speed for that?</p>

<p>There are two special speeds that determine when an aeroplane can take off (from amongst a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_speeds">truly humongous list</a> of “V-speeds”):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Vr</code>, or the “rotation speed”, which is the speed at which you want to start pulling back on the stick or yoke to get the plane to lift off, and</li>
  <li><code>V1</code>, which is the cutoff speed for aborting a takeoff. If you haven’t taken off by the time the plane reaches <code>V1</code>, you are taking off, whether you like it or not, because the alternative is death. It’s the speed at which your plane can no longer safely slow down to a stop simply by throttling and braking, so you’re going to keep speeding up and you <strong><em>will</em></strong> take off, even if you then immediately need to find a suitable place to perform an emergency landing.</li>
</ul>

<p>And MSFS adds a third value to that, called the “design takeoff speed”, representing the ideal in-game speed at which the plane should be taking off, so for the purpose of our auto-takeoff we’re going to <em>prefer</em> to use <code>Vr</code>, but not every plane has a sensible value set for that (for… reasons? I have no idea, some MSFS planes have complete nonsense values like -1), so we’ll use the rule “use <code>Vr</code>, unless that’s nonsense, then use the design-takeoff-speed”:</p>

  <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s our take off code. It’s pretty rudimentary, but we only need this to run for “just as long as we need to turn the real autopilot on”. Although to save a bit of testing, there’s just a <em>tiny</em> problem with this code as written that we already saw in the previous auto-rudder pictures:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240213205919956.png" alt="image-20240213205919956"></p>

<p>No wing leveler.</p>

<p>The moment some of the twitchier planes lift off, there’s a good chance they’ll just tip over and try to crash. So, since this code will only be in effect for a short time, and we just need a stopgap between “wheels off the ground” and “turning on the real autopilot”, let’s just add the most naive wing lever code we possibly can:</p>

<div><pre><code>  <span>...</span>
  <span>/**
   * Check if we're at a speed where we should rotate, with our bank angle used to keep the plane levelish
   */</span>
  <span>async</span> <span>checkRotation</span><span>({</span> <span>minRotation</span><span>,</span> <span>takeoffSpeed</span><span>,</span> <span>isAcrobatic</span> <span>},</span> <span>{</span> <span>elevator</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span><span>,</span> <span>VS</span><span>,</span> <span>bank</span> <span>})</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>api</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// For as long as we're taking off, use super naive bank-correction,</span>
    <span>// so that twitchy planes stay mostly aligned with the runway on</span>
    <span>// their rotation.</span>
    <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>`AILERON_POSITION`</span><span>,</span> <span>bank</span> <span>/</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>

    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As long as we only need it for a few seconds, dumb is good: if we’re banking, proportionally set the aileron in the opposite direction. Would we want to <em>fly</em> with that? Heck no! But is it good enough to keep planes “level enough” to bridge the gap between takeoff and autopilot? You bet!</p>

<p>And on that note…</p>

<h3 id="handoff-to-the-autopilot">Handoff to the autopilot</h3>

<p>The final step in the auto-takeoff process is, of course, concluding the auto-takeoff procedure and handing things off to the regular autopilot. Once the wheels are off the ground, and we have a decent enough vertical speed, we should just turn on the autopilot and let it deal with the rest of our flight. For our purposes, that’s going to be “is our VS more than 100 feet per minute, and are we at least 50 feet above the ground”, both of which happen <em>pretty</em> quickly after takeoff.</p>

<p>And… that’s it, we implemented auto-takeoff! After the ordeal that was terrain-follow, this was almost no effort! So… who wants to fly around New Zealand’s South Island for a bit?</p>

<h3 id="testing-our-code-3">Testing our code</h3>

<p>And with that, we should be able to just spawn planes, click <code>AP</code>, click <code>auto takeoff</code> and just… fly. And because it’s a gorgeous place to fly out of, let’s head on over to <a href="https://dingleburn.co.nz/">Dingleburn Station</a> in [Wānaka ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C4%81naka, and do some flying. The nice thing about Dingleburn station is that if we just take off and keep going in a straight line,  we end up putting the autopilot through its paces:</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say, this is working brilliantly.</p>

<p>Now, this is not a very long runway, but it <em>is</em> downhill, so we might make it!</p>

<p>nope.</p>

<p>There, how do we do now?</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240213213207296.png" alt="image-20240213213207296"></p>

<p>Seriously? I’ve flown out of this place in the 310R, it’s a joy, what more do you want?</p>

<p>… as it turns out, what it wants is something that knows that there’s trees at the end of the “runway” and thus knows to pull up hard to avoid them, which our autopilot just can’t do. Of course, this code isn’t done: we <em>could</em> spend the next few days trying to refine it so that planes take off as early and as steeply as they physically can, but that sounds more like an exercise for the reader. In the mean time, we can still take off from something a little more “runway” than a grass field. Welcome to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilliwack">Chilliwack</a>, BC, Canada.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240229205717077.png" alt="image-20240229205717077"></p>

<p>Bit of a challenge: we’re starting at, basically, sea level, and we’ll need to get ourselves up many thousands of feet if we want to live.</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240229205917427.png" alt="image-20240229205917427"></p>

<p>Which we can’t, so I’ll set the plane to 360 degrees instead, which will give it a slight more realistic target:</p>

<p>And now we’ll get there so we can fly over, not <em>into</em>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Cascade_Arc">Canadian Cascades</a>!</p>

<h2 id="auto-landing">Auto-landing</h2>

<p>Of course, a flight consists of three parts: takeoff, “the flight” and landing, so… before we consider end this thing I’d say there’s one more thing we should take a crack at.</p>

<h3 id="auto-landing-phases">Auto-landing phases</h3>

<p>There’s a couple of steps and phases that we need to implement, starting with the most obvious one: finding an airport to land at. MSFS has two ways to check for airports, one that just gets every airport in the game, which is maybe a bit much,  and one that gets all airports in the current “local reality bubble” (the SDK term for how much of the world is loaded in), with two event listeners for when new airports get loaded into, or are removed from, the bubble. To make life a little easier (and faster), the API wrapper we’re using comes with an airport database (based on MSFS’s own data) that makes finding nearby airports a little easier as we’re not tied to the local reality bubble but can instead ask for airports within a certain radius of our plane.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find all nearby airports,
    <ol>
      <li>if we’re flying a flight plan, we’ll assume we want that relative to the last waypoint,</li>
      <li>otherwise, we’ll want that relative to the plane.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>sort that list by distance, and then keep the airports that are 25NM or closer:
    <ol>
      <li>find the approach(es) we’d need to fly (even if one airport is closer than another, that may not be true for their approach points)</li>
      <li>remove any airport from the list for which the approach is too hard (or downright impossible: don’t try to land a DC-3 at a float plane dock. It’s probably not going to end well).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>From the list of airports left, pick the one with the nearest approach point, and then</li>
  <li>Determine how many waypoints we need to place, and where, so that the plane can fly that (part of the) flight path as a dedicated “landing approach”.</li>
</ol>

<p>That part will get us lined up with a runway, after which we’ll actually be able to start our landing, consisting of the following phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The slow-down phase, where we try to slow the plane down to a speed where “we should survive landing”,</li>
  <li>the descent phase, where we slowly drop to an altitude from which we’ll (hopefully) survive landing
    <ol>
      <li>we’ll drop gear and add flaps (once we’re going slow enough to safely be able to do those)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The “short final” phase, where we’re basically at the runway and it’s time to send the plane down towards the ground,</li>
  <li>The initial touch down, where we cut the throttle, and probably bounce a bit.</li>
  <li>The roll-out, where we apply brakes and use the rudder to keep us straight on the runway as we slow down, and finally</li>
  <li>The end of our landing, where the plane has stopped, we can let go of the breaks, retract the flaps, and because we’re in a sim, turn off the engine(s) in the middle of the runway and call it a day.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that this is a rather a “simplified landing” that you’d never fly in real life, or even in-sim if you’re flying the plane yourself, but we’re already trying to do more than we set out to do, and we’re not going for realism so much as “can we get JS to land a plane <em>at all</em>?”</p>

<p>So, let’s write some code</p>

<h3 id="a-basic-framework">A basic framework</h3>

<p>Let’s start with (what else) a new file in <code>src/autopilot</code> called <code>auto-landing.js</code> that can run through a sequence of stages:</p>

<p>Of course, just finding the “nearest airports” isn’t really all that useful if we can’t land at them, so we need some more code to actually determine what landings at each airport look like, and whether or not those will work for us:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Mostly “to the point” code: create a flat list of approaches that’ll work, then sort them based on runway length, and pick the one with the longest runway (to give ourselves the best odds of surviving the landing).</p>

<p>However, that <code>calculateRunwayApproaches</code> function is going to need a little more work. And by a little, I mean a lot. Conceptually, it’s not too complicated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for each airport:
    <ul>
      <li>for each runway at that airport:
        <ul>
          <li>for both possible approaches for that runway:
            <ul>
              <li>set up an approach flight path and check whether the terrain allows us to fly that</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of course the “set up an approach flight path” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here, because we’ll want a path that lets us perform a bunch of different actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>figure out a flight plan that gets us straight (enough) onto our approach</li>
  <li>slow down from cruise speed to “safe to land at” speed,</li>
  <li>drop from “whatever altitude we’re flying” all the way down to a runway</li>
  <li><em>actually touch down on a runway without crashing</em></li>
  <li>roll out the runway while braking and <em>hopefully</em> stop before the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which means that we’ll need to do a bit of thinking about what an approach looks like. There’s (at least) five points of interest during the landing procedure that we outlined above, which we can draw out as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/image-20240222093324423.png" alt="image-20240222093324423"></p>

<p>in this, we already have our points 5 and 4: they’re the runway end and start (relative to how we’re approaching the runway). P<sub>1</sub> is the point at which we switch from “flying” to “lining up for our approach”, and where we start to slow does the plane to somewhere between climb and cruise speed, P<sub>2</sub> is where we start descending, and P<sub>3</sub> is where we slow down the plane’s descent and speed so we can hopefully land onto the runway rather than destroy our landing gear on impact.</p>

<p>So where do we place the first three points? Not to complicate things more than we need to but: it depends. Mostly, it depends on what elevation we want these points to sit at, and that’s kind of “up to us”, so I’m going to make an executive decision here based on absolutely nothing other than “it seems reasonable”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P<sub>5</sub> will will be the same elevation as the runway itself.</li>
  <li>P<sub>4</sub> will be a little bit higher, say 15 feet above the runway, so that when we get that, our plane will (hopefully) clear any trees that MSFS decides to place right at the edge of the runway. It’s genuinely baffling how often it does this.</li>
  <li>We’ll put P<sub>3</sub> at 200 feet above the runway, so that we need to drop less than 200 feet in our short final (in a real ILS landing, this would be the “middle marker”, or MM),</li>
  <li>We can basically put P<sub>2</sub> at whatever elevation we want, but that’s a little too free for an initial stab at an auto-lander, so instead we’re going to put it at 1400 feet above the runway (in a real ILS landing, this would be the outer marker, or OM). Paired with a 3 degree glide slope, that sets the distance between P<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> at around  4.5 nautical miles, or about 3 minutes of flight at 100 knots, and a vertical speed of about 400 feet per minute (since we’re going to descend from 1400 feet above the runway to 200 feet above the runway for a total of 1200 feet over three minutes),</li>
  <li>and to make sure we’re at the right elevation by the time we get to P<sub>2</sub>, we’ll set P<sub>1</sub> to the same elevation as P<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which means that if we know our speed, we can put some real distances to this image. So let’s mandate some speeds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At P<sub>1</sub> we’re going at cruise speed, but by the time we reach P<sub>2</sub> we’ll want to be flying our “climb speed, plus 20 knots” so that we can safely fly our glide slope: we <em>could</em> target a speed that is equal to our climb speed, but if we drop too fast because of some low density air or downdraft, we probably won’t be able to recover as easily as when we’re flying a little faster than our minimum climb speed.</li>
  <li>We can also mandate that the moment we cross P<sub>4</sub> we want to cut our engines and just coast down to the runway. As long as we make sure the plane pitches up a tiny bit (say, 2 degrees) this should be “perfectly safe”. Provided the runway’s long enough.</li>
  <li>Consequently, our speed at P<sub>5</sub> doesn’t really matter: ideally we’ve already stopped the plane before then, but even if we cross it, the engines are off already so our speed is irrelevant.</li>
  <li>Leaving P<sub>3</sub>: since we only need to  drop a tiny distance once we get to P<sub>3</sub> we can reduce speed to climb speed. Although some planes have an aggressively high climb speed, and we’re only going to be a minute out from the runway by the time we get here, so let’s go with “climb speed, or 100 knots, whichever is lower”. If a plane can’t stay in the air at 100 knots, we’re flying something very curious indeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now we can finally point some distances to our graphic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our drop to the runway is less than 200 feet, so I’m just going to put P<sub>3</sub> “one minute’s worth of flight time” away from P<sub>4</sub> and that should be more than enough.</li>
  <li>And then because of the previous decisions made about the glide slope, the distance from P<sub>3</sub> to P<sub>2</sub> will span three minutes worth of flight time.</li>
  <li>Finally, as it takes a bit for a plane to slow down just by throttling, we’ll put P<sub>1</sub> at 2 minutes of flight away from P<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now we can <em>finally</em> write some actual code!</p>

<p>We have code! And it’s not even particularly complicated, since we worked out all the complicated parts on paper first. However, this is almost certainly not enough points for a proper approach yet… For the why, let’s look at where an airplane can be relative to a straight line path, and what flight path that results in when we apply our waypoint logic.</p>

<graphics-element title="getting onto the approach" src="./graphics/approach-points.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>Initially, this might look like it’ll work just fine, but if we drag the airplane around, we see that our waypoint logic may dictate flight paths that are <em>super bad</em> if the intention is to land, rather than just “fly part of a flight plan”. For a landing we need to be lined up properly by the time we hit P<sub>2</sub>, and the current set of points don’t guarantee this in the slightest.</p>

<p>So, in order to fix that, let’s add some more point based on where the plane is relative to the start of our approach: we’re going to add a point P<sub>A</sub> ahead of P<sub>1</sub> so that we’re not (or, barely) turning onto the approach by the time we <em>reach</em> P<sub>1</sub>:</p>

<graphics-element title="adding an extra point" src="./graphics/approach-points.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/approach-point-pa.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>This is still not great, though, all we’ve done is pushed the problem back a bit. What we really want is for the plane to target P<sub>A</sub> if we’re to the right of P<sub>A</sub>, but target something that will <em>get</em> us to P<sub>A</sub> if we’re to the left of it, which we can achieve by adding an offset point either above or below P<sub>A</sub>:</p>

<graphics-element title="adding an offset" src="./graphics/approach-points.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/approach-point-f1.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>Which almost solves our problem: as long as the plane is beyond our offset (either above or below depending on whether the offset is above or below P<sub>A</sub>) things work pretty well, but if the plane is too close to the approach itself, we can still run into problems, so let’s add one more offset, when the plane is to the left of P<sub>A</sub>, as well as between the approach and the first offset:</p>

<graphics-element title="adding a second offset" src="./graphics/approach-points.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/airplane.js">
  <source src="https://pomax.github.io/are-we-flying/graphics/approach-point-f2.js">
</graphics-element>

<p>And now we have a setup where no matter where the plane is by the time we set up our approach, we’ll be properly lined up by the time we start gliding. Of course, this <em>does</em> complicate our code a bit:</p>

<p>And now we have all our points! …but we’re still not done. Remember that we assumed this approach would work? We still have to check whether that’s true, but looking at whether there’s terrain interference anywhere, so we can mark the approach as no good if it requires us to fly through some ground for a bit.</p>

<p>Which leaves adding the <code>landing</code> flag to our <code>waypoint.js</code> file:</p>

  <span>...</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Nothing special going on there. Although we also want to update our <code>autopilot-router.js</code> so we can expose that <code>goAround</code> function to the browser:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AutopilotRouter</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>...</span>

  <span>goAround</span><span>(</span><span>client</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>autopilot</span><span>.</span><span>waypoints</span><span>.</span><span>goAround</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let’s hook into that on the browser-side with a new button in our <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html</span> <span>lang=</span><span>"en-GB"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"map-controls"</span><span>&gt;</span>

        <span>&lt;button</span> <span>class=</span><span>"go-around"</span><span>&gt;</span>go-around<span>&lt;/button&gt;</span>

      <span>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
   ...
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And the associated code in our <code>waypoint-overaly.js</code>:</p>

  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And, of course, some CSS to make the landing points stand out, in <code>waypoint-overlay.css</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>.waypoint-div</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>&amp;.active</span> <span>.waypoint-marker</span> <span>img</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now we get to enjoy our landings in glorious blue, with a new “go-around” button in case it looks like things are going wrong during the approach:</p>

<h3 id="implementing-our-landing-phases">Implementing our landing phases</h3>

<p>Which means it’s time to actually implement the landing phases that get us safely (hopefully?) down onto a runway. To make that happen, it’s time to fill in the <code>run</code> function in our <code>auto-landing.js</code> file!</p>

<p>And with that, it’s actual landing code time:</p>

<h4 id="getting-onto-the-approach">Getting onto the approach</h4>

<p>This phase isn’t super interesting, other than that we want it to turn off the terrain follow mode once we get close to our offsets (if we have them) or the approach itself (if we don’t). As such, there’s a bit of duplication, but not the kind we really care to optimize:</p>

<p>The first really interesting stage is the glide slope stage, where we want to perform a controlled glide down towards the runway, ending at P<sub>3</sub>:</p>

<p>Now, while we’re gliding, we want to place some restrictions on the the altitude hold and wing leveler behaviour: we’re supposed to glide down, and we don’t want large VS swings, or “find mid-flight, not fine while landing” flight path drift, so let’s add a little bit of extra code to our <code>altitude-hold.js</code>:</p>

<p>And then we’ll also update the <code>getTargetHeading</code> function in <code>fly-level.js</code> because when we’re landing we don’t actually want to set our heading based on the direction the plane is <em>pointing</em> in, but the direction we’re <em>flying</em> in. If we’re flying with some kind of yaw, we actually want to look at our “real” heading in terms of where we just were, and where we are now, so let’s add a <code>flightHeading</code> value and use that during landing:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>However, because this is the critical transition from “high up” to “low enough to land from”, we’re going to run this loop at the faster autopilot interval, so that the odds of us not being able to correct for a bad altitude (e.g. dropping below the short final glide slope) or crosswind are as low as we can make them. So we update the <code>run</code> function in our <code>autopilot.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AutoPilot</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>async</span> <span>run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>// While the landing can be done at the regular interval, once we're in the short final,</span>

      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then we make sure that the auto-landing <code>run</code> function returns a Boolean value that indicates whether we want regular or fast AP updates:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AutoLanding</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>async</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>flightInformation</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>

    <span>// Make the autopilot run at the higher polling interval based</span>
    <span>// on whether we return true or not at the end of this function:</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>shortFinal</span> <span>=</span> <span>step</span> <span>===</span> <span>RIDE_OUT_SHORT_FINAL</span><span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>aboveRunway</span> <span>=</span> <span>step</span> <span>===</span> <span>ROLL_AND_BRAKE</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>speed</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>vs0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>shortFinal</span> <span>||</span> <span>aboveRunway</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that should at least give us better odds of safely landing.</p>

<p>However, this also means that we’ll be putting in <em>much</em> bigger corrections “per tick” in our <code>altitude-hold.js</code>, so let’s make sure we scale our corrections down accordingly. This wasn’t a problem during auto-takeoff, where altitude hold wasn’t active while the autopilot was updating faster than usual, but now that we’ll be running it faster <em>in flight</em>, we need to address that problem. First, let’s move the AP intervals into <code>constants.js</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// AP values</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>AUTOPILOT_INTERVAL</span> <span>=</span> <span>500</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>FAST_AUTOPILOT_INTERVAL</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then we make the autopilot import those:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>AUTOPILOT_INTERVAL</span><span>,</span>
  <span>FAST_AUTOPILOT_INTERVAL</span><span>,</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils/constants.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far so good: then, we need to update <code>altitude-hold.js</code> to scale its updates each tick according to what speed the autopilot’s running at:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Get the baseline autopilot interval value...</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>AUTOPILOT_INTERVAL</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>../utils/constants.js</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>...</span>

<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>altitudeHold</span><span>(</span><span>autopilot</span><span>,</span> <span>flightInformation</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...then get the current autopilot call interval...</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>api</span><span>,</span> <span>trim</span><span>,</span> <span>AP_INTERVAL</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>autopilot</span><span>;</span>

  <span>...</span>

  <span>// ...and then scale our update so that we're only applying a</span>
  <span>// "partial" update if we're running faster than baseline.</span>
  <span>update</span> <span>*=</span> <span>AP_INTERVAL</span> <span>/</span> <span>AUTOPILOT_INTERVAL</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// We're keeping our VS/dVS protection though. We don't</span>
  <span>// want to scale these down, that might kill us again =(</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>FEATURES</span><span>.</span><span>EMERGENCY_PROTECTION</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now we’re no longer applying updates that have been calculated based on the assumption that we’re updating plane parameters only twice a second, more than twice a second. Instead,  we’re now applying more, but smaller, updates when the autopilot’s running at the fast interval.</p>

<p>While we’re coasting down onto the runway, we do still have some work to do: we need to ensure that the plane is pitched up ever so slightly, so that tricycle gear planes land on the rear wheels first, and tail draggers don’t immediately nose-over when the wheels hit the runway:</p>

<p>Alright! We made it down, the plane is on the runway, we didn’t crash… but that’s really “we didn’t crash <em>yet</em>” because we totally still can. It’s time to make sure we apply enough brakes to stop the plane, while using auto-rudder to keep us in a straight-ish line, with extra checks if we’re in a tail dragger because if we brake too hard, or we don’t pull back on the elevator while we’re braking, we’re going to nose-over followed by it being game-over.</p>

<p>My god, we’re done! <em>We’re done!!</em></p>

<h3 id="testing-everything">Testing <em>Everything</em></h3>

<p>Now, testing this code is rather straight forward in that we just fire up MSFS, put a plan on a runway, create a bit of a flight plan, hit “take off” in the browser, and when we reach the last marker, we click “land” (we could automate that, but that’s for another day. By you). However, since that does not translate well into pictures, let’s just capture these tests using the medium of video.</p>

<p>First, let’s do a quick “take-off and landing” at Victoria Airport in the Cessna 310R. We’ll spawn the plane, click “land” to generate a set of landing waypoints, and then we’ll click “take off” to make the plane take off, switch to autopilot, start flying the flight plan, and land itself on the same runway it took off from:</p>

<p>And since that went pretty well, let’s put this to real use: we’ll fly the Beaver from <a href="https://dingleburn.co.nz/">Dingleburn Station</a>, on New Zealand’s South Island, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C4%81naka">Wānaka</a>, with auto-takeoff, waypoint navigation, and auto-landing. Enjoy a 28 minute trip across some beautiful New Zealand scenery.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Holy crap, we did a lot! Also: this stuff is cool!</p>

<p>We’ve just been writing JS bit by bit, and suddenly our code’s flying aeroplanes in a flight simulator start to finish. Sure, we could have spent all this time learning how to program a flight director, but it’s not like every plane has one, and unless you’re deep into flight sims and you want full realism, programming flight directors using 1980’s interfaces isn’t exactly an appealing prospect.</p>

<p>And yes, getting to the point where can just hit “go” and enjoy the ride took a considerable amount of work, but the result is proportional to the time and effort we expended. We made something pretty damn impressive!</p>

<p>So where do we go from here? Here are some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our alt hold is still a bit wibbly, which is especially noticeable in planes like the Kodiak 100, or when playing game footage at 4x speed. This is a consequence of only firing off corrections every half second, but we could probably still find something that works a little better by using forward prediction and making the alt hold function not be stateless. And then the obvious follow-up would be to make the fly level/heading mode code not stateless, either.</li>
  <li>We could vastly improve auto landing by taking runway length and slope into account, as well as fitting an approach to the terrain instead of simply doing a yes/no basd on where we fairly naively placed our approach points. Imaging auto-landing at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing-Hillary_Airport">Tenzing-Hillary Airport</a>, for instance!</li>
  <li>We could make the waypoint code more like “path tracking” code, where we don’t just define waypoints with an implicit polygon, but where we define the actual flight path itself, so that at any point on the path there is some “ideal” heading that the plane should be flying, so that we can actually fly through curvy canyons or slalom some hills, rather than just flying mostly straight lines.</li>
  <li>We could try to replace our blocks of “control code guesses” with self-tuning PID controlles so we that we only need to say what targets we want, and have the PID controllers figure out what good steps sizes for that are. This is one of those “conceptually, this is simple” because we can replace a whole bunch of code with a PID initialization and then a few lines of update loop, but actually making that work can be the worst time sink you never knew existed. The problem with PID controllers isn’t setting them up, it’s the full-time job of tweaking them that will make you regret your life decisions.</li>
  <li>We could make our ALOS server generate “XYZ tiles”, so that we can use it as a map source for our leaflet map rather than using google’s topology layer.</li>
  <li>…you’ve seen what we can do already, the sky’s the limit. Or, you know what: no, it isn’t. We’re already flying, there are no limits. Get your learn on and write something amazing, and then tell the world about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope you had fun, and maybe I’ll see you in-sim. Send me a screenshot if you see me flying, I might just be testing more code to add to this tutorial! =D</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/05/02/smartplugs/">https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/05/02/smartplugs/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40266845">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>This post <strong>isn’t</strong> a detailed line-by-line tutorial on how to set up each individual piece of the setup as those types of
guides tend to get out of date really easily, but if you know your way around Linux and the command line, then you can
definitely replicate this setup on your own.</p>
<p>Over the past few years I’ve been interested in learning about how much energy my computing setup and home
appliances use.
I’ve used a simple digital energy meter before to get instantaneous readings, but that was not ideal for monitoring
how an electrical appliance consumes power over a longer time period.</p>
<p>My friend bought a few smart plugs from <a href="https://www.athom.tech/">athom.tech</a>. After getting confirmation
that they don’t suck, I went ahead and ordered some myself.</p>
<p>The smart plugs I bought were the <code>EU style plug V3</code> variant. The shipping times in EU were reasonably fast, shipping in 9
days (and that included Christmas!).</p>
<p>The plugs ship with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/">Tasmota</a> pre-flashed. The plugs come with a small paper strip explaining
the steps to take to connect the plug to your Wi-Fi network, and after that you can manage the plug in your browser.</p>

<h3 id="the-software-stack">The software stack</h3>
<p>My initial goal with these plugs was to visually monitor the power consumption of a few devices, such as my home server, router,
workstation setup and the electric water heater.</p>
<p>The power meter data is collected to an existing <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> instance on my home server.
If you’re not sure what Prometheus is, then think of it as a tool that periodically reads metrics from different
sources, saves them to disk and allows you to later query and manipulate that information.</p>
<p>I run multiple instances of this <a href="https://github.com/astr0n8t/tasmota-power-exporter">tasmota-power-exporter</a> solution on my server, one per plug, which get scraped once
per second by the Prometheus instance. <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/9206">It is possible to also make the plugs themselves export these metrics,</a>
but I didn’t fancy building Tasmota firmware myself, yet.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I already had a <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> instance running on my home server, so I reused that to show a few basic
graphs for the power meter setup.</p>
<p><em>Free tech tip</em>: make sure to change the <code>min step</code> setting to 1 second to get the most detailed data points on your graphs.</p>

<h3 id="observations-and-findings">Observations and findings</h3>
<p>So, what have I learned after running this setup for almost 4 months?</p>
<h4 id="water-heater">Water heater</h4>
<p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the electric water heater uses up the most power. The one we have is a 30L one,
just enough for a quick shower or two or for washing a large load of dishes.</p>
<p>Typical power usage: 4.51 kWh/day.</p>
<p>Minimum observed: 0.56 kWh/day, happens usually when nobody is at home</p>
<p>Maximum observed: 11.1 kWh/day, a lot of washing and showering happened on that day</p>

<h4 id="home-server-setup">Home server setup</h4>
<p>I run all my home server workloads off of a <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2023/10/09/zimaboard/">Zimaboard</a>. One of its big selling
points for me was its super low power consumption.
When idling, the Zimaboard can use about 2 W, typical power usage with all my services running was about 7 W and the
maximum power consumption was around 15 W.</p>
<p>The Zimaboard was actually using <em>less power</em> than my internet modem/router box (which is hot garbage by the way).
The ISP-provided box used 12-14 W at all times, regardless if it was operating in router or bridge mode.</p>

<p>At one point I temporarily switched my home server setup back to <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2022/01/17/asrock-x300-future-of-desktops/">the ASRock Deskmini X300</a>,
mainly because I added some latency-sensitive workloads onto my home server setup and the Zimaboard was a bit too weak
for those.</p>
<p>One thing that became really obvious from the power meter is that the Deskmini idle power consumption is
horrible in comparison to the Zimaboard, coming in at around 15-20 W. This might be in part because my Deskmini doesn’t
seem to expose any lower CPU power states than C3 while the Zimaboard exposed C-states all the way down to C10. I could not
find a way to expose lower C-states in UEFI settings or the Linux kernel. Based on a quick remark in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_WJI4hp_B8">this video</a> I believe that it should
be possible to drop ASRock a message and receive a custom BIOS that enables some extra features, but that seems even
more unlikely for a consumer-grade device such as this one.</p>

<p>I’ve added a panel to my usual Prometheus node exporter Grafana view that shows the server setup power consumption alongside
other metrics. Higher CPU activity is clearly visible on the power consumption graphs.</p>

<h4 id="voltage">Voltage</h4>
<p>The Tasmota plugs also report current voltage values. I graphed them just for fun, but noticed that there is a sort of
seasonality to the values. During the usual peak power consumption hours the voltage drops across the board.</p>

<p>This seems like a candidate for testing anomaly detection, as shown in <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/23/anomaly-detection-using-prometheus/">this great GitLab article.</a>
I’ve used this concept at work and it works reasonably well for some metrics.</p>
<p>In other cases the voltage drops were caused by running appliances that use a lot of power, such as the water heater, electric kettle, electric stove or the microwave.</p>

<h4 id="workstation">Workstation</h4>
<p>I have one plug that reports numbers for everything that’s connected to my home office setup: monitor, USB-C dock,
monitor light bar and anything that might be charging on the table.</p>
<p>The power consumption of this setup varies a lot. Sometimes I do a longer home office stint. Sometimes I recharge various
devices.</p>
<p>The typical power consumption of the whole setup while doing something on my computer is around 45-60 W, with peaks near
90-110 W. For an ultrawide monitor, USB-C dock and my laptop I think this is a pretty good result. I’ve had desktop PC-s
that have used just as much power at idle, and in the olden days there were incandescent light bulbs that used up more
electricity than this!</p>

<p>Minimum observed: 0.07 kWh/day</p>
<p>Maximum observed: 1.52 kWh/day</p>
<h4 id="charging">Charging</h4>
<p>These plugs are also great for observing the charging patterns of various devices.</p>
<p>A laptop or a power bank charges faster at the beginning, but the speed drops off as the battery gets more full.
At one point trickle charging seems to kick in until the device is fully charged.</p>

<p>This pattern is similar on most devices that I charge. The battery on my e-bike seems to be an exception to the rule,
with a slighly increasing power consumption throughout, and a faster drop at the end of the charging cycle.</p>

<p>0.5kWh of power consumed for 60km of range with the “Turbo” preset on the bike doesn’t sound bad at all. Half a cent per
kilometer!</p>
<h4 id="stability">Stability</h4>
<p>The stability of the smart plugs is usually fine, but there are frequent cases where certain plugs don’t report back in time
with the statistics. This may be a Wi-Fi access point issue, but annoying nevertheless.</p>
<p>I’ve had to completely power cycle two plugs a few times because they dropped off from the network completely and would
not come back. Again, could be the fault of my Wi-Fi AP.</p>
<h4 id="future-ideas">Future ideas</h4>
<p>The plugs also provide a way to turn the devices on and off over different
API-s (even over HTTP!), which is something I’d like to utilize either using something like <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, or a simple
script that toggles certain devices on and off based on the current electricity price.</p>
<p>I haven’t gotten around to this part yet, but from my research it seems that <a href="https://github.com/custom-components/nordpool">the necessary integrations
exist for Home Assistant.</a></p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>Overall, I’m very happy with this setup. I can get reliable measurements for all sorts of computing setups from now on,
which will make judging the power efficiency of the devices I use much easier. No more guesswork!</p>
<p>If you enjoyed this post, then I highly recommend giving <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2723-power-profiling-my-entire-house-with-the-firefox-profiler/">this FOSDEM 2024 talk by Florian Quèze a listen.</a>
The talk also goes into details about measuring the power consumption of various devices in the speakers’ home and
observations that they’ve made.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We sometimes hear of a paper submission being rejected because the method was too simple, or a promotion being denied because the work artifacts lacked complexity. I think this can be partly explained by Dijkstra’s quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.” — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra" target="_blank">Edsger Dijkstra</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-does-complexity-sell-better">Why does complexity sell better?</h2>
<p><strong>Complexity signals effort.</strong> Papers with difficult ideas and technical details suggest blood, sweat, and tears. Systems with more components and features hint at more effort than systems with less. Because complex artifacts are viewed as requiring more effort, they’re also deemed as more challenging to create and thus more worthy. And because of the perceived effort involved, they’re often judged to be higher quality.</p>
<p><strong>Complexity signals mastery.</strong> A complex system with many moving parts suggests that the designer has proficiency over each part and the ability to integrate them. Inaccessible papers peppered with jargon and proofs demonstrate expertise on the subject. (This is also why we quiz interview candidates on algorithms and data structures that are rarely used at work.) If laymen have a hard time understanding the complex idea or system, its creator must be an expert, right?</p>
<p><strong>Complexity signals innovation.</strong> Papers that invent entirely new model architectures are recognized as more novel relative to papers that adapt existing networks. Systems with components built from scratch are considered more inventive than systems that reuse existing parts. Work that <em>just</em> builds on or reuses existing work isn’t <em>that</em> innovative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The idea is too simple, almost like a trick. It only changes one thing and everything else is the same as prior work.” — Reviewer 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Complexity signals more features.</strong> Systems with components that can be mixed and matched suggest flexibility to cover all the bases. For example, supporting both SQL and NoSQL data stores, or enabling both batch and streaming pipelines. Because complex systems have more lego blocks relative to simple systems, they’re considered more adaptable and better able to respond to change.</p>
<p>All in all, the above leads to <a href="https://fs.blog/complexity-bias/" target="_blank">complexity bias</a> where we give undue credit to and favour complex ideas and systems over simpler ones.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-simplicity-an-advantage">Why is simplicity an advantage?</h2>
<p><strong>Simple ideas and features are easier to understand and use.</strong> This makes them more likely to gain adoption and create impact. They’re also easier to communicate and get feedback on. In contrast, complex systems are harder to explain and manage, making it difficult for users to figure out what to do and how to do it. Because there are too many knobs, mistakes are more frequent. Because there are too many steps, inefficiency occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Simple systems are easier to build and scale.</strong> Systems that require less rather than more components are easier to implement. Using standard, off-the-shelf technology also makes it easier to find qualified people who can implement and maintain it. And because simpler systems have less complexity, code, and intra-system interactions, they’re easier to understand and test. In contrast, needlessly complex systems require more time and resources to build, leading to inefficiency and waste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Instagram was acquired in 2012, it had a 13-person team serving tens of millions of users. It <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/89025069/Mike-Krieger-Instagram-at-the-Airbnb-tech-talk-on-Scaling-Instagram" target="_blank">scaled</a> and kept operational burden per engineer low by <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of-technologies-adf2e22da2ad" target="_blank">sticking to proven technologies</a> instead of new, shiny ones. When other startups adopted trendy NoSQL data stores and struggled, Instagram kept it lean with battle-proven and easy-to-understand PostgreSQL and Redis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Simple systems have lower operational costs.</strong> Deploying a system is not the finish line; it’s the starting line. The bulk of the effort comes <em>after</em> the system is in production, likely by <em>someone other than the original team</em> that built it. By keeping systems simple, we lower their maintenance cost and increase their longevity.</p>
<p>Simple systems have fewer moving parts that can break, making them more reliable and easier to fix. It’s also easier to upgrade or swap out individual components because there are fewer interactions within the system. In contrast, complex systems are more fragile and costly to maintain because there are so many components that need to be grokked by a limited team. Having more interdependent parts also makes troubleshooting harder.</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-rewarding-complexity">What’s wrong with rewarding complexity?</h2>
<p><strong>It incentivizes people to make things unnecessarily complicated.</strong> Using simple methods or building simple systems may appear easier and is thus valued less. As a result, people game the system to get more rewards and the simplest solution is no longer the most obvious one. Complexity begets more complexity, eventually making it impossible to work.</p>
<p><strong>It also encourages the “not invented here” mindset</strong> where people prefer to build from scratch and shun reusing existing components even though it saves time and effort. This wastes time and resources and often leads to poorer outcomes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most promotion processes overemphasize complexity in work artifacts.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Simple solutions are easier to implement and scale than complex solutions. However promotions often are rewarded to those who create complex solutions. We need to start acknowledging the power of simple. Don’t accept complex. It’s a trap.</p>— Bryan Liles (@bryanl) <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanl/status/1555619528096235525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2022</a></blockquote> 
</div>
<p>Ditto for machine learning paper submissions.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A common point raised by ML reviewers is that a method is too simple or is made of existing parts. But simplicity is a strength, not a weakness. People are much more likely to adopt simple methods, and simple ones are also typically more interpretable and intuitive. 1/2</p>— Micah Goldblum (@micahgoldblum) <a href="https://twitter.com/micahgoldblum/status/1554485034744160258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2022</a></blockquote>
</div>
<p>(If your idea didn’t get the credit it deserves, take comfort in the fact that <a href="https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1548321060201803776" target="_blank">breakthroughs</a> such as Kalman Filters, PageRank, SVM, LSTM, Word2Vec, Dropout, etc got rejected too. We’re generally bad at assessing how useful or impactful an innovation will be. 🤷)</p>
<h2 id="how-should-we-think-about-complexity-instead">How should we think about complexity instead?</h2>
<p><strong>The objective should be to solve <em>complex</em> problems with as <em>simple</em> a solution as possible.</strong> Instead of focusing on the complexity of the <em>solution</em>, we should focus on the complexity of the <em>problem</em>. A simple solution demonstrates deep insight into the problem and the ability to avoid more convoluted and costly solutions. Often, the best solution is the simple one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler” — Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Instead of having a complex, catch-all solution, consider multiple focused solutions.</strong> A one-size-fits-all solution is usually less flexible and reusable than expected. And because it serves multiple use cases and stakeholders, it tends to be “tightly coupled” and require more coordination during planning and migrations. In contrast, it’s easier to operate—and unavoidably, deprecate—single-purpose systems.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In my many years as tech lead, later as consultant and then in <a href="https://twitter.com/godotengine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@godotengine</a>, I believe the biggest enemy software engineers fight is the deep &amp; common belief that one-size-fits-all solutions to problems (even hypothetical) always exist.

<p>One way to overcome the complexity bias is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor" target="_blank">Occam’s razor</a>. It states that the simplest solution or explanation is usually the right one. Thus, let’s not be too quick to dismiss simple ideas or add unnecessary complexity to justify their worth.</p>
<p>Alternatively, ask yourself: Given the cost of complexity, is the juice worth the squeeze?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8755256533679090735">
<h2>Intro</h2><p>Espressif Systems released their ESP32-S3 SoC a few years ago, but only recently have they released more documentation and support of its full capabilities. Without any changes to your code, the S3 runs about 15% faster than older ESP32 CPUs at the same clock speed. It has a 'hidden' capability that's more difficult to use, but can be worth the effort if you need more speed. This article is aimed at programmers who are already familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data">SIMD</a> instructions on other platforms.</p><p>I've been optimizing code with SIMD for more than 15 years on Intel, Arm and DSPs (even Cadence's), so when I heard that the S3 had SIMD instructions, I immediately went searching for documentation. When the S3 became available to buy, there was only a promise of documentation and support. In the 2+ years since then, not much has changed. At the end of 2023, Espressif released a document describing the new instructions:</p><p><a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf">S3 Technical Reference Manual</a></p><p>The document has a decent level of detail and only a few errors, but what's missing still are examples and documentation on how to use them in your own code - conspicuously absent are instructions on using the assembler and linking them to your C/C++ code. This isn't entirely the fault of Espressif. The Xtensa processor comes from <a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/ip/tensilica-ip/tensilica-xtensa-controllers-and-extensible-processors.html">Cadence</a> and for some reason they like to keep everything under NDA, even information which would help people use their processors. I find it hard to understand why the instruction set should be kept secret; a CPU vendor should make it as easy as possible for engineers to use their CPUs. The 'trade secrets' are in the hardware design, not in the instruction set. I've worked with Cadence's DSPs before, so I'm familiar with their way of doing things. Their Vision DSPs have a robust and powerful instruction set. Unfortunately, the S3 has a very minimal set of SIMD instructions,&nbsp; probably due to cost and silicon area limits.</p><p>Since the SIMD 'Processor Extension' is treated as a coprocessor, the main instruction set must be mixed in the code. Here's the document for the main LX7 instructions:</p><p><a href="https://dl.espressif.com/github_assets/espressif/xtensa-isa-doc/releases/download/latest/Xtensa.pdf">Xtensa ISA</a></p><p>The programmer model consists of 16 general purpose/address registers (a0-a15), 8 128-bit wide SIMD registers (q0-q7), and two special accumulator registers for multiply/accumulate operations. The memory bus is documented as 128-bits wide, so it is definitely advantageous to read and write to memory at the native width. There are also some instructions to manipulate GPIO bits.</p><h3>How I got started with S3 SIMD</h3><p>I spent the better part of a day searching and experimenting with these instructions until I got working code. I started with a search on Github for any public repos containing the one instruction needed for any S3 SIMD project - load (ee.vld.128). A few hits popped up in Espressif's esp-dsp project. A lot of their ESP32-S3 code is closed source, but a few functions pulled back the veil on how to use them in my own projects. This is the code I used as a starting point:</p><p>https://github.com/espressif/esp-dsp/blob/master/modules/fft/fixed/dsps_fft2r_sc16_aes3.S</p><p>I tried putting multiple functions into a single .S file, but that doesn't seem to work so every function gets it's own file. My first use case for these instructions is to optimize the color conversion step of my JPEG decoder. The YCbCr-&gt;RGB step takes a significant amount of time and is a good fit for SIMD optimization.</p><h3>The Instruction Set</h3><p>I've written SIMD code for the pixel color conversion multiple times in multiple SIMD instruction sets and what struck me with the S3 was how little I had to work with. One of the main sticking points is that even though the instruction encodings are 24-bits each, there's no bits reserved for shift amount. There are explicit shift instructions and even they don't have the shift amount encoded. The multiply instructions can shift right after multiply, but the shift amount must first be loaded into the SAR (shift amount register). This requires 2 additional instructions (and potentially additional pipeline cycles) to accomplish. The main sticking points which make it harder to get work done are that the instructions are not orthogonal across data sizes and are missing a lot of things needed to make efficient code. For example, the shift left and right instructions only operate on 32-bit values and only do arithmetic shifting (carry the sign bit), not logical. To generate RGB565 output, I need to shift 16-bit values. My workaround was to multiply by 1 and set the SAR for right shifting and multiply by a power of 2 and set the SAR to 0 for left shifting.</p><p>Here's a short list of what I consider essential SIMD features that are missing on the S3:</p><p>- Shift right logical<br>- Shift 8 or 16-bit values<br>- Add or multiply with widening<br>- Right shift with narrowing<br>- Add and subtract <b>without</b> saturation<br>- Unaligned reads and writes</p><p>Also missing (Nice to haves) that other Cadence DSPs have:</p><div><p>- Scatter / gather writes/reads<br>- Horizontal vector operations<br>- Rearrange vector element order<br>- Floating point support<br>- Predicated operations (operate on select elements only)</p><p>The gotcha that had me going in circles for a while is the memory alignment restriction. In my JPEG decoder internal data structure, some of the elements are aligned on 4-byte boundaries. S3 SIMD load and store instructions can at best access memory on 8-byte boundaries, but ideally want everything on 16-byte boundaries. I fixed this by inserting a "long double" in front of the items that need 16-byte alignment 😀.</p></div><h3>Where to go from here...</h3><p>I'm going to add some optimized functions to my various imaging libraries where appropriate and see where it takes me. I did an initial test with my <a href="https://github.com/bitbank2/JPEGDEC">JPEGDEC</a> library and saw a nearly 40% speedup (14ms -&gt; 10ms) by using the S3 SIMD instructions for the color conversion step. I'll publish this code after I've had time to fully flesh it out and test it. Good luck with your use of S3 SIMD...</p>
