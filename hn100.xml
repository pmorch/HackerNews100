<p>OpenAI is now internally testing 'ads' inside ChatGPT that could redefine the web economy.</p>


<p>Up until now, the ChatGPT experience has been completely&nbsp;free. While there are premium plans and models, you don't see GPT sell you products or show ads.</p>


<p>As <a href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1994714152636690834" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spotted </a>by Tibor on X,&nbsp;ChatGPT Android app 1.2025.329 beta includes new references to an "ads feature" with "bazaar content", "search ad" and "search ads carousel."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/ai-data-security-best-practices-cheat-sheet?utm_source=bleepingcomputer&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q3_INB_Form_AI-Data-Security-Best-Practices&amp;sfcid=701Py00000SmgsrIAB&amp;utm_term=FY26Q4-bleepingcomputer-970x250&amp;utm_content=AI-Data-Security-BP" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/c/w/wiz/AI-Data-Security-970x250.png" alt="Wiz"></a>
</p>


<p>It is likely that ads will be limited to the search experience only, but that might change soon.</p>


<p>My understanding is that GPT ads could be highly personalised as the AI knows everything about you unless you disable the feature,</p>


<p><em>This is a developing story...</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>EU is not a federation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is arguable, because it isn't a federation indeed, but it's not <em>not</em> one either. </p>

<p>The EU doesn't check any box of existing institutions; it's a <em>sui generis</em> entity that mixes intergovernmental, confederal &amp; federal attributes. It's pretty much unique, and cannot really be compared to anything else.</p>

<p>But you're technically correct.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>EU has actually quite little power. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is just downright bullshit, however.</p>

<p>The EU literally has more exclusive regulatory power than the US federal government in several key areas, notably market regulation, labour legislation, environment regulation, and a few others, which are all very much central to the attributes of sovereign states.</p>



<p>That being said, your answer is pretty much irrelevant to the question the OP asked, though. You're missing his point entirely, and it feels like you just wanted to take a jab at the EU.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="msg_59712"><p>(And Mac OS 8!)</p><p>Hey, guys!</p><p>Surely y'all know and have enjoyed Mac OS 9.2.2 booting and beautifully-running on all four Mac mini G4 models for close to 8 years now. (Wow!)</p><p>Well, that was one massive revolution...</p><p>... But most of us did not think we would live to see the day New World ROM machines, even more so the likes of the Mac mini G4, to NATIVELY boot System 7:</p><p><img src="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/ea941d2fe9ea40eda5ef21b98235a199.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480"></p><p>(Gotta love it trying to display 1 GB RAM capacity.)</p><p>Before your eyeballs leave your eyesockets completely, I ought to warn that there's still much to be sorted out in this, especially sound, video and networking (the usual suspects). In other words, your mileage may vary, so keep expectations in check!</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>OK, so HOW in the WORLD is any of this possible?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>It turned out "New World ROM" Macs had a cousin born out of the clone program (until the usual villain, Steve Jobs, came and killed it), which was an architecture called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Hardware_Reference_Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHRP</a>" (pronounced "chirp"). It was the successor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_Reference_Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PReP</a>, but, unlike PReP, Mac OS was also going to be officially-bootable on it. Close to no CHRP machines ever saw the light of the day, thanks to Jobs' return. Nonetheless, Apple internally developed Mac OS 7.6 ~ 8.0 for CHRP systems before it got axed. It's just that they never released it, but the development was done regardless. On October 2025, it turned out someone preserved some of these Mac versions, which were then acquired and preserved and shared with the world. (<a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/mac-os-chrp-releases-powerpc-common-hardware-reference-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macintosh Garden link</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/apple-mac-os-for-CHRP-PowerPC-Common-Hardware-Reference-Platform-Systems-1997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archive.org link</a>.)</p><p>Although CHRP was left to die, the so-called "New World ROM" Macs inherited much of its architecture and design. As you probably know, these Macs rely on an extra system file called "Mac OS ROM", whereas "Old World ROM" Macs do not need it, and can use their own actual ROM to get Mac OS going. This meant any Mac OS version unaware of the concept of a Mac OS ROM file could not just simply boot in a New World ROM Mac normally. People were able to boot Mac OS versions as low as 8.1, but not any lower, and that too only for the very first few New World ROM Macs, but none of the later ones, which increasingly had a higher and higher minimum OS version.</p><p>But not anymore, as the following major events happened:</p><p>- The recent Mac OS 8.0 CHRP leaks provided an earlier ROM file that, it turns out, allows regular Mac OS 8.0 to boot, as well. Or, alternatively, the Mac OS ROM file that always worked with Mac OS 8.1 also worked on these Mac OS 8.0 CHRP releases. (Exact details are fuzzy in my memory by now, so someone else might want to correct me if I got something wrong.)</p><p>- The recent Mac OS 7.6 CHRP leak provided an additional System Enabler file, which could be exploited for loading Mac OS ROM files. I forget if that's how it worked out-of-the-box, or if a bit of hacking to the System Enabler was required for that, however what I do remember clearly is that, while the System Enabler was hardcoded so that artifically no OS earlier than 7.6 could use it, the OS version check could be patched out of it, so that System 7.5.x (and potentially earlier) can also use it.<br>In other words, <em>this file is the reason that earlier Mac OS versions can make use of the Mac OS ROM file</em>, thus bringing Mac OS 7.6.1 and earlier potentially to ALL New World ROM Macs!<br>(Trivia tidbit: Apparently this enabler was also present in certain archives of the Mac OS 8.0 betas from when it was still known as "Mac OS 7.7". Oops! This thing was right under our nose all this while!)</p><p>- Of course, as hinted at previously, a System Enabler _alone_ is NOT enough to boot System 7 and the like when even much newer systems that were already aware of the Mac OS ROM file could not boot. The newer the model of the New World ROM Mac, the less you could actually "go back". The reason is simple: Mac OS ROM files, over time through its various versions, would get new features added, BUT also would remove older ones which were required by older OS versions. The solution? Using <a href="https://github.com/elliotnunn/tbxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELN's great Mac OS ROM patching tools</a> (plus other tools of his own), "Rairii" AKA "Wack0", known for his amazing PPC Windows NT 3.51 / NT 4.0 project on <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/maciNTosh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerMacs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/entii-for-workcubes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo GC / Wii / Wii U</a>, analyzed many of these Mac OS ROM files, and fixed + patched + stitched together new Mac OS ROM files that attempt to keep ALL the old features that were removed AND all the new features that were added. In other words, the ultimate Mac OS ROM file that boots everything and runs everything (roughly-speaking). He also is the one who figured out and hacked the System Enabler to also accept OSes earlier than Mac OS 7.6.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that this effort essentially allows Macs that are already able to boot SOME version of Mac OS to ALSO boot older versions. But if a given machine cannot boot ANY Mac OS version, such as the two DLSD PowerBook G4s (<a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.67_15_hr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15"</a>, <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.67_17_hr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17"</a>), these patches cannot do anything about that: Their incompatibilities need to be addressed first and separately.</p><p>One more interesting thing to note about the similarity between CHRP systems and New World ROM Macs: If you check ANY "Mac OS ROM" file to see its TYPE and CREATOR codes, you will see they are "tbxi" and, you guessed it, "<strong>chrp</strong>", respectively. I couldn't believe "chrp" was in ALL the Mac OS ROM files all these years!</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>Where can I get ahold of this EPIC stuff ? ? ? ? ?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>Rairii's "super" ROMs are available on <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/universal-tbxi-patchset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this GitHub repository</a>, under <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/universal-tbxi-patchset/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases</a>. You may also fetch the patched System Enabler for Mac OS 7.6.1 and earlier from there, and place it in the System Folder. Make sure to download the files from the latest release there.</p><p>Note that he applied his patches to 3 different versions of the (US) ROMs:</p><p>- 10.2.1 with CPU Software 5.9: The "latest and greatest" Mac OS ROM file of all Mac OS. For reference, this is also the ROM version that the <a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/mac-os-9-roms-without-15-gb-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.628 GB max RAM Mac OS ROM we have was based on (thus going beyond the 1.5 GB limit)</a>, although do note that the RAM limit break patches are NOT included in this, at least not yet as of the time of writing.</p><p>- 2.5.1: A much earlier version of the ROM, but still new enough to support USB. See the GitHub page for details.</p><p>- 1.7.1: A very early ROM, which can be well-leveraged by very early New World ROM Macs. See the GitHub page for details.</p><p>Note you need ROM version 9.1 or higher to use ATA-6 AKA Ultra ATA/100 AKA Kauai drivers, which are essential on the likes of the Mac mini G4 and the MDD. Special notes for the Mac mini G4 are further down.</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>What is the COMPLETE list of Mac OS versions that now boot?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>To be exact, this is the complete list of OSes I have attempted, all on the Mac mini G4 1.5GHz model, with the following results:</p><p>- System 6.0.8: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/eecf1c7de4ff43ca851785c566422bd4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. You get a Happy Mac, followed by a blinking question mark in a floppy icon. (Note: Although this very attempt is UTTERLY insane for multiple technical reasons, it might be not AS seemingly-impossible as one may think, as the 68k emulator resides within the Mac OS ROM file.)</p><p>- System 7.0: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/b1fc8c2fe35d4cd4a5b3bf0047f9d7e2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. You get a Happy Mac, but then a warning window pops up saying System 7.0 cannot boot on this computer.</p><p>- System 7.1.2: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/17bf3873e4c1477899938addae65ab8f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. You get a Happy Mac, but then a warning window pops up saying System 7.1 cannot boot on this computer.</p><p>- System 7.5: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/ea941d2fe9ea40eda5ef21b98235a199.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. It requires you to hold shift to turn Extensions (and Control Panels / INITs) off, though, or to get rid of the "Mouse" Control Panel (and possibly more). The system is surprisingly stable! I tested the British version of this one, as Apple's Mac OS Anthology discs did not include the US installers, for some very slacker-y reason.</p><p>- System 7.5.2: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/0ba4006b498a47e78e44b63f51fb0e61.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boots, but very broken, close to nothing works</a>. It could be because System 7.5.2 was always VERY machine-specific, and is apparently one of the most broken versions of Mac OS of ALL time, regardless. The machine-specific enablers, and other things, might be what is making it so unstable.</p><p>- System 7.5.3: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/f7727e4e760447f986ee90cf58e0052f.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. It requires you to hold shift to turn Extensions (and Control Panels / INITs) off, though, or to get rid of the "Mouse" Control Panel (and possibly more). The system is surprisingly stable!</p><p>- Mac OS 7.6: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/9bc2c9a93e9344aba07960841287a9ab.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. Holding shift is not required here. What else can I say? It "works".</p><p>- Mac OS 8.1: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/49fd379b1e014e24801968343b71d892.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOOTS AND IS STABLE</a>. Holding shift is not required here, either. Behaves much the same as the others, except we now have HFS+ by default. Still, it did NOT like me having a 940 GB HFS+ partition, and prompted me to either eject it or format it. (To be fair, older OSes tried to do that, too, but Mac OS 8.1 was THE OS to _officially_ be able to handle HFS+ properly, so there are no excuses for it to fail here. Mac OS 9.2 ~ 9.2.2 all work perfectly with it.)</p><p>- Mac OS 8.5: No boot. Rather, it seems like it WOULD boot, but starting with Mac OS 8.5, Mac OS now always checks to see if the machine you are booting from is within a list of Apple-endorsed machine IDs for the given Mac OS version. In other words, Mac OS 8.5 does not know what the Mac mini G4 is, nor what a G4 Cube is (our Mac mini G4 ROM file makes the mini pretend to be the latter). It seems it should be possible to patch out the machine check. According to Rairii, this should be able to be patched out by disabling such a check on the "boot" resource in the Resource Fork of the System file, in ID 3 (also known as "boot3"). For Mac OS 8.6, it seems like this check happens at the end of boot3, wherever a check for machine ID 406 is located, in which after it's detected, the code checks to see if the exact Mac model is whitelisted or not.</p><p>- Mac OS 8.5.1: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/7502a600acc044069a280aa4b6bccc1c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. All that applies to Mac OS 8.5 also applies to Mac OS 8.5.1.</p><p>- Mac OS 8.6: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/412760cddd8e4561aac7e16ca413cc04.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. It crashes during the start screen, when the loading bar appears, but before the first extension gets to load. See the top-left corner of the picture for a glitchy visual artifact. Same happens if you try to boot with Extensions off.</p><p>- Mac OS 9.0.4: No boot. It crashes during the start screen, when the loading bar appears, but before the first extension gets to load. Same happens if you try to boot with Extensions off. Exact same symptoms as when trying to boot Mac OS 8.6 at least on this mini model, including the visual artifact on the top-left corner.</p><p>- Mac OS 9.1: <a href="http://revontulet.org/2025/11/27/7765c9186c3a43549015719de3a26387.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No boot</a>. It crashes during the start screen, when the loading bar appears, but before the first extension gets to load. Same happens if you try to boot with Extensions off. Exact same symptoms as when trying to boot Mac OS 8.6 and Mac OS 9.0.4 at least on this mini model, including the visual artifact on the top-left corner.</p><p>- Mac OS 9.2 ~ 9.2.2: BEST OS EVER, BOOTS AND RUNS BEAUTIFULLY. 'Nuff said.</p><p>Note that, although I describe many of these as "stable", I mean you can use much of it normally (sound/video/networking aside) without it crashing or misbehaving, at least not too hard, but that is not to say everything works, because that is just not the case. For example, when present, avoid opening the Apple System Profiler, unless you want a massive crash as it struggles trying to profile and gather all the information about your system. Some other apps or Control Panels might either not work, or work up to a certain point, after which they might freeze, requiring you to Force Quit the Finder to keep on going. And so on.</p><p>As you can see, I did not yet try System 7.5.5, Mac OS 7.6.1 and Mac OS 8.0. That's because they all are most likely working exactly as their neighbouring versions. But feel free to confirm.</p><p>Most non-mini systems should be able to boot Mac OS 8.6 ~ Mac OS 9.1 just fine. A "Mac OS 8.6 Enabler", so to speak, by LightBulbFun, can be renamed as e.g. "Sawteeth" and put inside the System Folder for some machines that cannot boot Mac OS 8.6 normally, so that they can, then, boot it. It is actually a Mac OS ROM file, but can function as a complementary, helper file to aid the actual Mac OS ROM file in this case. If you'd like, check <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/mac-os-8-6-for-some-unsupported-g3s-and-g4s.46765/page-3#post-575895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for more info. I have attached "Sawteeth.bin" to this post for convenience. LightBulbFun first shared it on <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-os-8-6-findings-and-ramblings.2021922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>, specifically through this <a href="https://mega.nz/file/VUgFAKZR#xXTi_4BK2wJHU8QYCoqyNIjq2aZFPFnM7B4JlmY1lRk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEGA link</a>.</p><p>Most non-mini systems should also be able to boot Mac OS 8.5 and 8.5.1, especially on G3s and earlier. Some G4 Macs might need to spoof the Mac model in Open Firmware (or some other Forth script added to ROM) to boot, though, or patch the check out like I mentioned for the mini earlier. The reason the mini doesn't have the spoofing as an option is that any spoofing in OF would be overwritten by its own specialized Mac OS ROM, which spoofs a G4 Cube, which is clearly not in the whitelist of supported machines for Mac OS 8.5 and 8.5.1.</p><p>Also note that the mini behaves as reported above with Mac OS 8.6 with or without this "8.6 enabler" file (and with or without the System Enabler for Mac OS 7.6.1 and earlier, both of which don't seem to get in the way of later, nor earlier, OSes).</p><p>Most importantly, I did <em>not</em> yet attempt to identify which are the latest versions of each Control Panel and Extension for each of these OSes. If I did, I'm sure it would help a lot, and perhaps address quite a number of these problems. The more people chime in on this effort, the better! Imagine if we had a proper "Mac mini G4 System 7.5.5" CD, then an "MDD Mac OS 8.5.1" CD, then an "iBook G3 Mac OS 7.6.1" CD, and so on. Everyone with a G3 or G4 Mac can help by trying things out!</p><p>Namely, something akin to MacTron's efforts highlighting the latest Extensions for Mac OS 9.2.2 and Mac OS 8.6 like this, but also for every other Mac OS version:</p><p><img src="http://revontulet.org/2020/01/14/extensions.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>========================================================<br>But how did you get the mini to boot? It requires its own special ROM!<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>Indeed it does! All credit goes to ELN and all of those who helped him on Mac OS 9 Lives!: you can simply use his tooling (which was also very useful for Rairii) to re-apply the Mac-mini-G4-specific ROM patches to Rairii's latest 10.2.1 ROM, and voila! It works as well as you would hope it to! </p><p>You can even use the resulting ROM for Mac OS 9.2.2, as well, even though you don't have to: Originally, the Mac mini G4 ROM as we see them in RossDarker's Mac mini G4 CDs version 8 and 9 (AKA v8 and v9), as well as in all the previous versions, were based on the US ROM v9.6.1. I could not find an explanation as to why ROM v10.2.1 wasn't used in the end, even when digging the old Mac mini G4 thread again that started it all. Perhaps because we already had a working ROM with v9.6.1 and did not want to risk breaking anything, or who knows. However, I have thoroughly tested Mac OS 9.2.2 with this new ROM combination (latest Rairii 10.2.1 + latest Mac mini G4 patches AKA v9 patches), and from what I could tell, everything behaves <em>exactly</em> the same as with the previous ROM we always used. Except now we have the ability to use the same ROM to also boot System 7.5 (I still can't believe this, even though it is true).</p><p>(For the record, while the 9.6.1 ROM was also modified to spoof the Mac mini G4 model identifier as a G4 Cube, we also tried to spoof it as a QuickSilver 2002 at one point, but someone reported sound issues with that, and so it was quickly changed back to a G4 Cube and such a change never made it into one of RossDarker's CDs. So just about everyone using Mac OS on the mini for all these years has had a ROM reporting to the OS as a G4 Cube, exclusively.)</p><p>To apply the Mac mini G4 patches, I used ELN's <a href="https://github.com/elliotnunn/tbxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tbxi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/elliotnunn/tbxi-patches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tbxi-patches</a> to apply his "macmini.py" script. You can follow the instructions as per the tbxi-patches page, which you should not let intimidate you even if you are not used to this kind of thing. It's quick and easy, and the scripts are also fully-commentated very nicely by ELN if you are curious about what it is doing and why.</p><p>In my case, first I tried using the latest Python 3.13.9 both from Windows 7 (bad idea due to resource fork loss) and macOS 10.14.6 Mojave, but neither worked: it seems like that version of Python was just too new. I then retried with <em>Python 3.8.10</em> instead (which I chose thinking it might be more period-appropriate for the script's age) on Mojave, which worked <em>flawlessly</em>. I didn't try it, but perhaps an older Python version might work on PowerPC OS X, as well.</p><p>I used the Python installer <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from the official website</a>, and I also used an "official" Git installer from <a href="https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/git-osx-installer/git-2.33.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (thus avoiding any package manager headache... man, how I hate non-Mac-OS systems, including OS X, and package managers in general...)</p><p>If somehow someone with plenty of Python knowledge and the willingness to put enough time into it wished to, both tbxi and tbxi-tools could, perhaps, be ported to <a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/macpython-233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacPython 2.3.5</a>, so that we could do all this patching from Mac OS 9.2.2 directly and natively without leaving our main OS. That would also be awesome! (Of course, it helps that this is also available on more recent systems nonetheless, because then everyone gets to join in on the fun with all kinds of different backgrounds and setups.)</p><p>For convenience, I attached the final patched ROM to this post, so that anyone can go wild on their minis right away!</p><p><strong>========================================================<br>Why should I care when Mac OS 9.2.2 already boots, and runs better?<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>It is also my opinion Mac OS 9.2.2 is the greatest OS, and Mac OS, ever, but not everything that is possible in earlier Mac OS versions is possible in Mac OS 9.2.2. For example, some software requires Mac OS 9.0.4 or earlier to work. A lot of software is System-7-exclusive.</p><p>Some people also just prefer the likes of System 7 for its even-lighter memory footprint, lack of mandated Appearance Manager and the like. Mac OS 9.2.2 is already overkill-fast on the mini, and on most New World ROM Macs, but the likes of System 7.5 are just RIDICULOUSLY fast. Even more ridiculously. I still am trying to come into terms with how indescribably fast using it on the mini was. It got even faster when I thought there was no way to get "faster than instantaneous", as Mac OS 9.2.2 always felt instantaneous like no other system already!</p><p>People might also have some other kind of reason and/or special attachment to an earlier OS version. Or maybe people want to explore older OS APIs and behaviors, perhaps even make a new application they want to know how it will behave on bare-metal not just on Mac OS 9, but also System 7 etc..</p><p>The value is in opening up the doors that give us, the users, more options that help us all out. <img src="https://macos9lives.com/smforum/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley"></p><p><strong>========================================================<br>Final remarks<br>========================================================</strong></p><p>Above all, thank you to everyone that made this possible. But I wanted to emphasize and give special thanks to Rairii for engineering all these ROMs, Mac84 for archiving and sharing all the CHRP discs, ELN for engineering all the Mac mini G4 ROM compatibility scripts and creating all the ROM and other Mac OS tooling, and to the Mac community at large everywhere that assisted in all of this into becoming reality. There's honestly many, many people to thank we owe over this one way or another, both in small and big ways.</p><p>I can't wait to see what people will do with all these new Mac OS versions on their New World ROM systems over the course of time!</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/363119/every-mathematician-has-only-a-few-tricks">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/363119/every-mathematician-has-only-a-few-tricks</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46084535">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>From a physicist point of view I want to mention this trick and its generalization for operators:</p>
<pre><code>      "Two commuting matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable"
</code></pre>
<p>(for physicists all matrices are diagonalizable). Of course the idea is that if you know the eigenvectors of one matrix/operator then diagonalizing the other one is much easier. Here are some applications.</p>
<p>1)The system is translation invariant : Because the eigenvectors of the translation operator are <span>$e^{ik.x}$</span>, then one should use the Fourier transform.  It solves all the wave equations for light, acoustics, of free quantum electrons or the heat equation in homogeneous media.</p>
<p>2)The system has a discrete translation symmetry: The typical system is the atoms in a solid state that form a crystal. We have a discrete translation operator <span>$T_a\phi(x)=\phi(x+a)$</span> with <span>$a$</span> the size of the lattice and then we should try <span>$\phi_k(x+a)=e^{ik.a}\phi_k(x)$</span> as it is an eigenvector of <span>$T_a$</span>. This gives the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch%27s_theorem" rel="noreferrer">Bloch</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floquet_theory" rel="noreferrer">Floquet</a> theory where the spectrum is divided into band structure. It is one of the most famous model of condensed matter as it explains the different between conductors or insulators.</p>
<p>3)The system is rotational invariant: One should then use and diagonalize the rotation operator first. This will allow us to find the eigenvalue/eigenvectors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom" rel="noreferrer">Hydrogen atom</a>. By the way we notice the eigenspace of the Hydrogen are stable by rotation and are therefore finite dimension representations of <span>$SO(3)$</span>. The irreducible representations of <span>$SO(3)$</span> have dimension 1,3,5,... and they appears, considering also the spin of the electron, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell" rel="noreferrer">columns</a> of the periodic table of the elements (2,6,10,14,...).</p>
<p>4)<span>$SU(3)$</span> symmetry: Particle physics is extremely complicated. However physicists have discovered that there is an underlying <span>$SU(3)$</span> symmetry. Then considering the representations of <span>$SU(3)$</span> the zoology of particles seems much more organized (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#/media/File:Baryon-decuplet.svg" rel="noreferrer">A</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson#/media/File:Meson_nonet_-_spin_0.svg" rel="noreferrer">B</a>).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/11/28/tricusp-triangle/">https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/11/28/tricusp-triangle/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46084122">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2>Spherical geometry</h2>
<p>In spherical geometry, the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than π. And in fact you can determine the area of a spherical triangle by how much the angle sum exceeds π. On a sphere of radius 1, the area equals the <strong>triangle excess</strong></p>
<p>Area = <em>E</em> = interior angle sum − π.</p>
<p>Small triangles have interior angle sum near π. But you could, for example, have a triangle with three right angles: put a vertex on the north pole and two vertices on the equator 90° longitude apart.</p>
<h2>Hyperbolic geometry</h2>
<p>In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always less than π. In a space with curvature −1, the area equals the <strong>triangle defect</strong>, the difference between π and the angle sum.</p>
<p>Area =&nbsp;<em>D</em> = π − interior angle sum.</p>
<p>Again small triangles have an interior angle sum near π. Both spherical and hyperbolic geometry are locally Euclidean.</p>
<p>The interior angle sum can be any value less than π, and so as the angle sum goes to 0, the triangle defect, and hence the area, goes to π. Since the minimum angle sum is 0, the maximum area of a triangle is π.</p>
<p>The figure below has interior angle sum 0 and area π in hyperbolic geometry.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/tricusp.png" width="500" height="252"></p>
<p>Strictly speaking this is an improper triangle because the three hyperbolic lines (i.e. half circles) don’t intersect within the hyperbolic plane per se but at ideal points on the real axis. But you could come as close to this triangle as you like, staying within the hyperbolic plane.</p>
<p>Note that the radii of the (Euclidean) half circles doesn’t change the area. Any three semicircles that intersect on the real line as above make a triangle with the same area. Note also that the triangle has infinite perimeter but finite area.</p>

            <p>Django 6.0 introduces a built-in background tasks framework in <code>django.tasks</code>. But don't expect to phase out Celery, Huey or other preferred solutions just yet. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/#background-tasks">release notes</a> are quite clear on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Django handles task creation and queuing, but <strong>does not provide a worker mechanism to run tasks.</strong>
Execution must be managed by external infrastructure, such as a separate process or service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of the new <code>django.tasks</code> module is to <strong>provide a common API for task queues</strong> implementations. <a href="https://theorangeone.net/">Jake Howard</a> is the driving force behind this enhancement. Check out the introduction on <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/django-tasks-bringing-background-workers-in-to-django-core/32967">the Django forum</a>.</p>
<p>His reference implementation, and simultaneously a backport for earlier versions of Django, is available <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/">as <code>django-tasks</code> on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>But let's ignore that and play with the more minimal version included in Django 6.0 instead. By creating our very own backend and worker.</p>
<h2>Our project: notifications</h2>
<p>We're going to create an app to send notifications to phones and other devices using <a href="https://ntfy.sh/">ntfy.sh</a>. (<a href="https://roam.be/notes/2025/ping-me-using-ntfy-to-stay-updated/">I'm a fan!</a>)</p>
<p>If you prefer to dive into the code yourself, check out <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo">the final version of the project on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>All that's required to send a notification to your phone using nfty is:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://ntfy.sh/signup">Register for an account</a></li>
<li>Create a topic.</li>
<li>Install the app for your phone and log in.</li>
<li>Send HTTP requests to <code>https://ntfy.sh/&lt;yourtopic&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The free version only provides public topics and messages. Meaning anyone can see the stuff you're sending <em>if</em> they subscribe to the topic. For our purpose we can simply create a topic with a randomized name, like a UUID.</p>
<p>The project's settings expect the URL from step 4 to be supplied as an environment variable. For example:</p>
<p><code>NTFY_URL=https://ntfy.sh/062519693d9c4913826f0a39aeea8a4c</code></p>
<p>Here's our function that does the heavy lifting:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>httpx</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>django.conf</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>settings</span>

<span>def</span><span> </span><span>send_notification</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Pass the title if specified.</span>
    <span>headers</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span> <span>title</span><span>}</span> <span>if</span> <span>title</span> <span>else</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>httpx</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span>
        <span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>NTFY_URL</span><span>,</span>
        <span>content</span><span>=</span><span>message</span><span>,</span>
        <span>headers</span><span>=</span><span>headers</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Really. That's all there is to it to start sending and receiving notifications.</p>
<p><img src="https://roam.be/media/img/2025/ntfy-notifications.png" alt="Ntfy notifications"></p>
<h2>A quick primer</h2>
<p>You really should have a look at the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/tasks/">Django documentation on the Task framework</a> for details, but we'll save you a bit of time and give a quick primer.</p>
<h3>Defining a task</h3>
<p>This is the main goal of the new framework: defining tasks using Django's standard API, rather than using task queue specific decorators, or other methods.</p>
<p>So here it goes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># ...</span>
<span>from</span><span> </span><span>django.tasks</span><span> </span><span>import</span> <span>task</span>

<span>@task</span>
<span>def</span><span> </span><span>send_notification</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span><span>):</span>
    <span># ...as before</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Our function is now a task. In fact it's a <code>django.tasks.Task</code>. </p>
<p>You cannot call <code>send_notification</code> directly anymore. Tasks can only be run by using the <code>enqueue</code> method. It might not be the behavior you'd expect or want, but this seems to be the best option. This design eliminates the possibility of accidentally invoking a task in-process, rather than in the background.</p>
<p>The <code>task</code> decorator allows you to specify the task's priority, queue name and backend name. You can override these settings with the <code>using</code> method, which returns a new <code>django.tasks.Task</code> instance.</p>
<p>If you need more control over task behavior, you can set <code>takes_context</code> to <code>True</code> in the decorator and add <code>context</code> as the first argument. This context currently provides you with access to the task result and thereby useful information like the number of attempts. </p>
<p>There's no way of defining retries and backoffs, or other fancy things you might expect from a full-blown task queue implementation. But that's <em>not</em> what this is. You can easily add your own retry logic by inspecting the task context if needed.</p>
<h3>Enqueuing a task</h3>
<p>Adding a task to the queue is easy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>task_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>send_notification</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span>
    <span>message</span><span>=</span><span>"Season's greeting!"</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>title</span><span>=</span><span>"Santa has something to tell you"</span>
<span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<h3>Executing a task</h3>
<p>This is where things start to fall short. At least right now. Django 6.0 will ship with the <code>ImmediateBackend</code> and the <code>DummyBackend</code>. The first will execute the task immediately, while the latter will not execute the task at all. </p>
<p>Which is why our project includes a (demo) backend backed by the database and a worker process!</p>
<h3>Fetching the result</h3>
<p>If you're not going to wait around for the result, you can get a hold of it later on using its id. Simply call <code>get_result(result_id)</code> on your task. </p>
<p>Our project includes a view that's polled periodically for outstanding results using <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://roam.be/media/img/2025/ui.png" alt="Project UI"></p>
<p>The list underneath the form shows the results for each execution of our task. When the form's submitted, a new result is added to the top of the list. Htmx is instructed to keep polling for changes as long as the result's status isn't <code>FAILED</code> or <code>SUCCESSFUL</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>task_result</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>result_id</span><span>,</span> <span>status</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>send_notification</span><span>.</span><span>get_result</span><span>(</span><span>result_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>result</span><span>.</span><span>status</span> <span>==</span> <span>status</span><span>:</span>
        <span># No need to swap the result.</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>HttpResponse</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>=</span><span>204</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>TemplateResponse</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.html#result"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"result"</span><span>:</span> <span>result</span><span>})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Wondering what <code>index.html#results</code> is doing? Django 6.0 also introduces <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/#template-partials">template partials</a>. In this case our view effectively sends a response containing only the template partial named <code>result</code>.</p>
<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>When you decorate a callable with <code>task</code>, the configured backend's <code>task_class</code> is used to wrap the callable. The default's <code>django.task.Task</code>.</p>
<p>That class's <code>enqueue</code> method will in turn invoke the configured backend's <code>enqueue</code> method.</p>
<p>Calling its <code>get_result</code> method is similar: call the configured backend's <code>get_result</code> method and pass on the result.</p>
<p>Since there's no workers, that's basically all a task backend needs to provide. Cool. Let's add one, shall we?</p>
<h2>A task database backend</h2>
<p>Our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>A basic task backend, backed by our database.</li>
<li>We want to support "automagic" retries</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <code>enqueue</code> and <code>get_result</code> methods will return an instance of the default <code>django.tasks.TaskResult</code>. This determines the minimum amount of data we need to store, and we're going to do so in a model called <code>Task</code>.</p>
<h3>Models</h3>
<p>Let's create a first draft of our <code>Task</code> model, based on the properties of <code>TaskResult</code> and <code>Task</code> in <code>django.tasks</code> (the "dataclasses"):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Task</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>

</pre></div>
<p>What's missing? For one, the <code>TaskResult</code> also includes a list of encountered errors, and ids of the workers that processed the task. Something that we could <em>perhaps</em> ignore. </p>
<p>Except the <code>TaskResult.attempts</code> property is based on the number of worker ids. And if you're using the task context within a task, you're bound to be relying on that type of information.</p>
<p>We could add these details to the <code>Task</code> model by adding a <code>JSONField</code> for each. This is the current approach in the reference implementation. </p>
<p>But let's be more explicit in our approach and define models for these as well. We'll record each attempt to execute a task and its potential error, linking them to the task with a foreign key:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>exception_class_path</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
    <span>traceback</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>

    <span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This setup ensures we have all necessary information to execute a task, plus we can provide every single bit of detail when a <code>TaskResult</code> is requested.</p>
<p>All fine and dandy, but we need to think about the worker's requirements as well. It needs to be able to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Quickly check for outstanding tasks</li>
<li>Claim one of those tasks</li>
<li>Process that task and either mark it as failed, successful or ready (to retry later)</li>
</ol>
<p>We could do all of that with how it's set up right now, but I'd like to refine things a bit.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Task</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span># This field is used to keep track of when to run a task (again).</span>
    <span># run_after remains unchanged after enqueueing.</span>
    <span>available_after</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>DateTimeField</span><span>()</span>
    <span># Denormalized count of attempts.</span>
    <span>attempt_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>IntegerField</span><span>(</span><span>default</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span># Set when a worker starts processing this task.</span>
    <span>worker_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>MAX_LENGTH_WORKER_ID</span><span>,</span> <span>blank</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    <span># ...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>available_after</code> field will contain the earliest time at which the task can be executed. If the task's <code>run_after</code> is specified (which can be done by using a task's... <code>using()</code> method), <code>available_after</code> is set to that value. Otherwise we're using the current datetime; all in UTC.</p>
<p>Once a task needs to be retried, <code>available_after</code> will be set to the next possible point in time the task can be executed. In other words: we can <strong>back off.</strong></p>
<p>The <code>attempt_count</code> field makes querying for available tasks a bit easier. Any tasks with an <code>attempt_count</code> greater than the maximum allowed value can be ignored. Yes, their status should have been set to <code>FAILED</code> which means they should be excluded by default, but we could change the configuration and tweak the maximum number of attempts.</p>
<p>The <code>worker_id</code> field is filled when a worker claims a task. This, among other things, prevents any other workers from picking up the task. Assuming the worker id is unique.</p>
<h3>Enqueueing and fetching a result</h3>
<p>Enqueueing a task could not be easier: create a <code>Task</code> <em>model instance</em> from the <code>Task</code> <em>dataclass instance</em>, save it, done! Well, at least after turning the end result into a <code>TaskResult</code>. </p>
<p>We use the string version of the model's database id as the id of the result.</p>
<p>Retrieving a result is likewise only a matter of loading the task and its attempts, and turning that into a <code>TaskResult</code>. </p>
<p>Here's a simplified version of our task backend as it stands:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>DatabaseBackend</span><span>(</span><span>BaseTaskBackend</span><span>):</span>
    <span>supports_defer</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>

    <span>supports_get_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>

            <span># ...</span>
            <span># More properties being set</span>
            <span># ...</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>task_result</span>

    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_result</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>result_id</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>model_to_result</span><span>(</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>queue_store</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>result_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span>

    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>model_to_result</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>TaskResult</span><span>:</span>
        <span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>At lot of functionality is deferred to this <code>queue_store</code> property. Before we dive into that, we'll explain the configuration options for this backend.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>We want to be able to specify defaults for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the maximum number of attempts (retries)</li>
<li>the backoff factor; i.e. we'll back off using <code>math.pow(factor, attempts)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These can be customized for each individual queue. So we end up with something like this in our <code>OPTIONS</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>TASKS</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"BACKEND"</span><span>:</span> <span>"messagecenter.dbtasks.backend.DatabaseBackend"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"OPTIONS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"queues"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>"low_priority"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
                    <span>"max_attempts"</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span>
                <span>}</span>
            <span>},</span>
            <span>"max_attempts"</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"backoff_factor"</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"purge"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"finished"</span><span>:</span> <span>"10 days"</span><span>,</span> <span>"unfinished"</span><span>:</span> <span>"20 days"</span><span>},</span>
        <span>},</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>A task added to the <code>low_priority</code> queue will be attempted up to five times, with a backoff factor of <code>3</code>. Other tasks will be attempted up to ten times with the same backoff factor.</p>
<h3>Queue store</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo/blob/main/src/messagecenter/dbtasks/backend.py#L279"><code>QueueStore</code> class</a> is a companion of our backend. It's focus is on retrieving and enqueueing tasks, checking for tasks to execute and claiming tasks. </p>
<p>However the main reason it's included is to simplify the worker. As we'll see, the worker gets it's own copy of the queue store, <em>limited to the queues it needs to process.</em></p>
<h3>The worker</h3>
<p>The worker's job, at least in this project, is to provide information on outstanding tasks to the runner and to drive the processing of those tasks <em>by the backend</em>. Which means it looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Worker</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span><span> </span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span>

</pre></div>
<p>All we need to do to have a functioning worker runner:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an instance of the worker.</li>
<li>Ask it if there's tasks to execute using <code>has_more</code>.</li>
<li>If so: tell it to <code>process</code> the first available task. If not: go to 4.</li>
<li>Wait, then return to 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's what our <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo/blob/main/src/messagecenter/dbtasks/management/commands/dbtasks_worker.py"><code>dbtasks_worker</code> command</a> does.</p>
<h3>Claiming a task</h3>
<p>Our queue store provides a <code>peek</code> method which returns the id of the task in our queues with the most urgency; a combination of <code>available_after</code>, <code>priority</code> and <code>attempt_count</code>.</p>
<p>This lets the runner know whether there's more tasks to process. The next step is to claim one of those tasks. So we call <code>peek</code> again and if it returns a task id, we'll try to claim that particular task.</p>
<p>Here's a more basic, clearer version than the one included in our project's <code>QueueStore</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>claim_first_available</span><span>(</span>
    <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>worker_id</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>attempts</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>qs</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>
        <span>worker_id</span><span>=</span><span>""</span><span>,</span> 
        <span>status</span><span>=</span><span>TaskResultStatus</span><span>.</span><span>READY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>attempts</span><span>):</span>
        <span>task_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>peek</span><span>()</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>task_id</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
        <span>count</span> <span>=</span> <span>qs</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>pk</span><span>=</span><span>task_id</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span>
            <span>worker_id</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>id_</span><span>,</span>
            <span>status</span><span>=</span><span>TaskResultStatus</span><span>.</span><span>RUNNING</span><span>,</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Task</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>pk</span><span>=</span><span>task_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If the <code>count</code> is zero, we failed to claim the task. Otherwise we retrieve it from the database and can start processing. </p>
<p>The loop is included because we ended up here after trying to claim the task identified by <code>peek</code>. Which apparently has already been picked up by another worker. We might as well make the most of it and try to grab another task from the queue.</p>
<h3>Processing the task</h3>
<p>And finally the thing that actually does something!</p>
<p>The <code>process_task</code> method of our backend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates an <code>Attempt</code> and constructs the current <code>TaskResult</code>.</li>
<li>Executes the task, capturing anything extending <code>BaseException</code>, or returning the <code>return_value</code> of the task when everything went according to plan.</li>
<li>Either updates the <code>Task</code> model, the <code>Attempt</code> <em>and</em> the <code>TaskResult</code> with the final details of the successful execution, or with details about the failure to do so.</li>
<li>And in the latter case: check if the task can be retried.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again: if you want to dive into the details, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/roam/django-tasks-demo">the repository</a>.</p>
<h2>That's it</h2>
<p>Of course this demo project leaves out all the things you really need to think hard about. Like signals for the worker. Or database transaction logic. That's not to say it's impossible. Far from it. It just wasn't the goal of this article.</p>
<p>The inclusion of this functionality in Django will certainly allow new libraries or adapters for existing task queues to pop up. And we'll probably soon see some complaints that <code>django.tasks</code> isn't extensive enough.</p>
<p>Because, if you're currently using the more advanced functionality of your task queue, there's probably a few things you're missing in <code>django.tasks</code>.</p>
<h3>Complex orchestration</h3>
<p>Some task queue libraries, like Celery, provide ways of combining tasks. You can feed the result of one task into another, enqueue tasks for each item in a list, and so on.</p>
<p>It should be clear by now that supporting this kind of orchestration isn't the goal of <code>django.tasks</code>. And I don't mind at all. There's no feasible way of creating a unified API to support this. I've had my share of problems with libraries that <em>do</em> claim to support it.</p>
<h3>Retry</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, there's currently no way to automatically retry a failed task, unless your backend does the heavy lifting. Like ours does. </p>
<p>Depending on your backend this might be easy enough to handle yourself. For example using a decorator:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>retry</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>):</span>
    <span>@functools</span><span>.</span><span>wraps</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>)</span>

<h3>An actual worker mechanism</h3>
<p>True. But the <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/django-tasks/">reference implementation</a> does provide actual workers. Be patient, or even better: start helping out!</p>
<h2>There is no perfect solution</h2>
<p>I reckon <code>django.tasks</code> will soon result in covering at least the most common 80% of use cases. Yes, its API is simple and limited, but to me that's more a benefit rather than a fault. I think this is as close as you can get to a standardized approach.</p>

		<p>According to aviation insiders, there’s a possible grounding of Airbus narrowbodies coming worldwide. Watchdog <b>JonNYC</b> was first to share this information.  However I do not expect aircraft to be grounded for long, and I’d expect a staggering to minimize flight disruptions.
</p><blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">also 100%++ unconfirmed</p>
<p>"someone says AA Will be doing cxl package for A320 fleet … but this will effect ALL a320 worldwide</p>
<p>",mandatory software update"</p>
<p>— JonNYC (@xJonNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/xJonNYC/status/1994452977218670968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">All signs say this A320 issue is accurate, airworthiness directive from Airbus imminent </p>
<p>Unconfirmed</p>
<p>— JonNYC (@xJonNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/xJonNYC/status/1994454548488843704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Jon <a href="https://x.com/xJonNYC/status/1994455143656366494" target="_blank">suggests</a> that the issue is an with an aileron computer.  This was <a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2025/11/05/a320s-sudden-descent-linked-to-faulty-computer/" target="_blank">identified as the cause</a> of a JetBlue A320 issue on October 30th where a Cancun to Newark flight “unexpectedly pitched downward without pilot input” and diverted to Tampa. The Thales ELAC 2 computer malfunctioned and was replaced.  This interpets pilot commands to control the aircraft.  </p>
<p>10-15 passengers <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=52f1ffc3&amp;opt=0" target="_blank">were hospitalized</a> after the aircraft rapidly descended without being instructed by pilots to do so.  The uncontrolled descent “likely occurred during an ELAC switch change” according to the National Transportation Safety Board.  This is not supposed to happen!  If there’s an issue with one ELAC computer, the other is supposed to take control without missing a beat.  </p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>Presumably, then, what’s being anticipated is a requirement related to these computers.<br>
</p><ul><li>Each aircraft has two, supplied primarily by Thales. There’s also a repair and overhaul ecosystem, not just new equipment production. 
</li><li>The U.S. FAA <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/20/2018-12885/airworthiness-directives-airbus-airplanes" target="_blank">proposed an airworthiness directive in 2018</a> requiring all ELAC units on Airbus A320 family aircraft to be upgraded with new software or replaced with upgraded units due to angle of attack issues. 
</li><li>With about 10,000 A320-family aircraft in service (all variants and engine options), you can’t just pull and replace every ELAC on the planet quickly.  The FAA airworthiness directive used compliance windows and software load options.  </li></ul>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_3266_zpsd3d82b341.jpg"></p>
<p>I’m fascinated to see how this plays out, because the suggestion is there will be an immediate flight cancellation package, while I’d expect it to be small.  Normally you’d expect to see a software upgrade loaded onto existing boxes first, with staggered compliance (different deadlines by serial number, block or hours flown, often tied to C-check/D-check intervals). Meanwhile, Airbus, Thales and Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul shops would ramp production and repair.</p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>That is, unless the issue that’s been found is more significant than much of what we’ve seen in the past (on the scale of 737 MAX MCAS system which grounded that aircraft), I’d expect cancellations to be minor and phased.  So I’ll be watching to see exactly what happens here.  JonNYC notes that tomorrow’s flights with these aircraft do not currently show any cancellations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/frontier-airlines.jpg"></p>
<p>And indeed, Jon now confirms that it’s a software upgrade that’s expected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I consider this fully confirmed at this point. ELAC , software update needed.</p>
<p>Should take a couple hours for each plane, will take longer on some than others. Plan with FAA being worked on now. <a href="https://t.co/v8fEgne6wv">https://t.co/v8fEgne6wv</a></p>
<p>— JonNYC (@xJonNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/xJonNYC/status/1994455745811644439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Airbus, for its part, has <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-11-airbus-update-on-a320-family-precautionary-fleet-action" target="_blank">issued a vaguely-worded statement</a> that “intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls” and that they have:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]orked proactively with the aviation authorities to request immediate precautionary action from operators via an Alert Operators Transmission (AOT) in order to implement the available software and/or hardware protection, and ensure the fleet is safe to fly. </p>
<p>…Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/a321neo.jpg"></p>
<p>Specific details of timing and flight cancellations will be forthcoming. </p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 20:06:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-13-electron-vs-tauri/">https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-13-electron-vs-tauri/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082291">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text" data-astro-cid-fzx4jmue=""> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench/">Dolt Workbench</a> is an open-source SQL workbench supporting MySQL, Postgres, <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt">Dolt</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql">Doltgres</a> databases. We built the workbench using <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, which is a popular framework that allows you to convert web apps built with traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript to desktop applications. Since the workbench shares much in common with <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> and <a href="https://hosted.doltdb.com/">Hosted Dolt</a>, the architecture is very similar to those products. That is, the workbench uses <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> for the frontend with an additional GraphQL layer that handles database interactions. For this reason, it made a lot of sense to use Electron to get the desktop version of our application up and running.</p>
<p>That said, Electron comes with a few rather significant drawbacks, and those drawbacks have started to become more apparent as the workbench has matured. Because of this, I spent some time exploring <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/">Tauri</a>, a newer framework that supports the same web-to-desktop use case as Electron. In this article, we’ll discuss how well Electron and Tauri integrate with the workbench, and weigh some pros and cons between the two frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="nextjs-support">Next.js Support<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#nextjs-support">#</a></h2>
<p>Next.js doesn’t translate very cleanly to a desktop application context. This is primarily due to the framework’s architecture around server-side rendering and API routing features. In a desktop app, there’s no application server interacting with a client; we just need to render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a window. For these reasons, Electron only loosely supports Next.js applications. That’s not to say you can’t build an Electron app with Next.js, but it requires some workarounds to make it function properly. One of the more popular workarounds is a project called <a href="https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron">Nextron</a>, which aims to wire Next.js applications to the Electron framework and streamline the build process. This is the project we use for the workbench. The issue is that, at the time of writing, it appears that Nextron is no longer being maintained, and we started hitting a few bugs with it.</p>
<p>Tauri is largely frontend-framework agnostic. For Next, specifically, you still can’t use the server-side features, but Tauri makes the integration process much simpler by relying on Next’s static-site generation capabilities. To make a Next app work with Tauri, you just need to set <code>output: 'export'</code> in your Next configuration file, and Tauri handles the rest.</p>
<h2 id="the-webview">The Webview<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#the-webview">#</a></h2>
<p>The biggest difference between Electron and Tauri comes from how they render the UI. The Electron framework comes with a full Chromium browser engine bundled in your application, which is the same engine that backs Google Chrome. This is useful because it means you don’t have to worry about browser compatibility issues. Regardless of the end user’s machine or architecture, the same Chromium instance renders your application UI. This results in a very standardized experience that ensures your app will look the same regardless of where it’s running. However, this also results in a fair amount of bloat. For the vast majority of desktop apps, a full Chromium browser engine is overkill. Even the simplest “Hello World” applications using Electron can run you up to 150 megabytes of disk space.</p>
<p>Tauri solves this problem by leveraging the system’s native webview. Instead of bundling a full browser engine, Tauri uses a library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wry/0.33.0">WRY</a>, which provides a cross-platform interface to the appropriate webview for the operating system. As you’d expect, this makes Tauri apps far more lightweight. The downside here is that you no longer have a hard guarantee on compatibility. From what I can tell, however, this mostly seems to be a non-issue. Compatibility issues across system webviews are exceedingly rare, especially for the major operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="nodejs-vs-rust">Node.js vs. Rust<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#nodejs-vs-rust">#</a></h2>
<p>Another major difference between the two frameworks is how they handle the “main” process. This refers to the backend process that orchestrates the application windows, menus, and other components of a desktop app that require interaction with system APIs. In Electron, the main process runs in a Node.js environment. This means you get access to all the typical Node APIs, you can import things like normal, and, perhaps most importantly, you can write your Electron-specific code in pure JavaScript. This is a huge bonus for Electron’s target audience: web developers.</p>
<p>Tauri, on the other hand, uses Rust. All the framework code and the main process entrypoint are written in Rust. Obviously, this makes it a bit less accessible to the average web developer. That said, Tauri provides a fairly robust set of JavaScript APIs to interact with the Rust layer. For most applications, these APIs will be sufficient to do what you need to do. In the case of the workbench, I was able to fully replicate the functionality of the Electron version using the JavaScript APIs and some minimal Rust code.</p>
<p>In my experience, I found the Tauri APIs to fit more naturally in our application code. With Electron, if you need the main process to do something, you must always use inter-process communication, even for the simplest of tasks. If you want to write to a file on the host machine, for instance, your frontend needs to send a signal to the Electron main process, which will then spawn a new process and run the function you wrote that performs the write. With Tauri, you can just use Tauri’s filesystem API directly in your application code. Under the hood, the same sort of IPC pattern is happening, but I think the Tauri abstraction is a bit nicer.</p>
<h2 id="sidecars">Sidecars<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#sidecars">#</a></h2>
<p>Since Electron runs on Node.js, it also bundles a full Node.js runtime with your application. This comes with some pros and cons. For the workbench, specifically, this is beneficial because the GraphQL layer is itself a separate Node.js application that needs to run alongside the frontend. Since Electron ships with Node.js, this means we can directly spin up the GraphQL server from the Electron main process using the Node runtime. This eliminates a lot of the headache associated with bundling and running a typical sidecar process. For instance, our app also ships with a copy of Dolt, which allows users to start up local Dolt servers directly from the workbench. To make this work, we have to bundle the appropriate Dolt binary with each workbench release that corresponds to the correct architecture. Without the Node runtime, we’d have to do something similar for the GraphQL layer.</p>
<p>With Tauri, this is exactly the problem we run into. To get around it, we need to compile the GraphQL server into a binary using a tool like <code>pkg</code>, then run it as a sidecar the same way we run Dolt. Thankfully, this seems to be a fairly common use case for Tauri applications, and they have a useful guide on <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/learn/sidecar-nodejs/">how to run Node.js apps as a sidecar</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that the full Node.js runtime is quite heavy, which also contributes to bloated Electron app sizes. After building the workbench using both Electron and Tauri, the difference in size was substantial. The left is the Electron version and the right is Tauri:</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#limitations">#</a></h2>
<p>After replicating the workbench’s functionality in Tauri, we’re holding off on making the full transition for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4818">Lack of support for .appx and .msix bundles on Windows</a> - Currently, Tauri only support .exe and .msi bundles on Windows. This means your Microsoft Store entry will only link to the unpacked application. The workbench is currently bundled and published using the .appx format. To address this, we would need to take down the workbench entirely from the Microsoft store and create a new application that uses the .exe format.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/6052">Issues with MacOS universal binaries</a> - This is more an annoyance than a bug, but I ran into a few issues related to codesigning universal binaries for MacOS. Namely, Tauri doesn’t seem to be able to create Mac universal binaries from their arm64 and x64 subcomponents. It also seems to be codesigning the Mac builds twice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these are hard blockers, but they’re annoying enough that I’m holding off on migrating until they’re resolved or our issues with Nextron become more problematic. For now, I’m leaving <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench/pull/672">my branch with the migration</a> open and hope to revisit soon. If you’re on the Tauri team, let us know if you have solutions!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a aria-label="Link to heading" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Overall, I’m impressed with Tauri. It eliminates much of the classic Electron bloat and integrates naturally with our existing codebase. If you’re curious about Tauri or the Dolt Workbench, let us know on <a href="https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe">Discord</a>.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p>Every couple of years <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/">somebody</a> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/10362">notices</a> that large tech companies sometimes produce surprisingly sloppy code. If you haven’t worked at a big company, it might be hard to understand how this happens. Big tech companies pay well enough to attract many competent engineers. They move slowly enough that it looks like they’re able to take their time and do solid work. How does bad code happen?</p>
<h3>Most code changes are made by relative beginners</h3>
<p>I think the main reason is that <strong>big companies are full of engineers working outside their area of expertise</strong>. The average big tech employee stays for only <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/19/whats-the-average-tenure-of-an-engineer-at-a-big-tech-company-ep-434/">a year or two</a><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. In fact, big tech compensation packages are typically designed to put a four-year cap on engineer tenure: after four years, the initial share grant is fully vested, causing engineers to take what can be a 50% pay cut. Companies do extend temporary yearly refreshes, but it obviously incentivizes engineers to go find another job where they don’t have to wonder if they’re going to get the other half of their compensation each year.</p>
<p>If you count internal mobility, it’s even worse. The longest I have ever stayed on a single team or codebase was three years, near the start of my career. I expect to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDcaRklX7q4">re-orged</a> at least every year, and often much more frequently.</p>
<p>However, the average tenure of a codebase in a big tech company is a lot longer than that. Many of the services I work on are a decade old or more, and have had many, many different owners over the years. That means many big tech engineers are constantly “figuring it out”. <strong>A pretty high percentage of code changes are made by “beginners”:</strong> people who have onboarded to the company, the codebase, or even the programming language in the past six months.</p>
<h3>Old hands</h3>
<p>To some extent, this problem is mitigated by “old hands”: engineers who happen to have been in the orbit of a particular system for long enough to develop real expertise. These engineers can give deep code reviews and reliably catch obvious problems. But relying on “old hands” has two problems. </p>
<p>First, <strong>this process is entirely informal</strong>. Big tech companies make surprisingly little effort to develop long-term expertise in individual systems, and once they’ve got it they seem to barely care at all about retaining it. Often the engineers in question are moved to different services, and have to either keep up their “old hand” duties on an effectively volunteer basis, or abandon them and become a relative beginner on a brand new system.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>experienced engineers are always overloaded</strong>. It is a <em>busy</em> job being one of the few engineers who has deep expertise on a particular service. You don’t have enough time to personally review every software change, or to be actively involved in every decision-making process. Remember that <em>you also have your own work to do</em>: if you spend all your time reviewing changes and being involved in discussions, you’ll likely be punished by the company for not having enough individual output.</p>
<h3>The median productive engineer</h3>
<p>Putting all this together, what does the median productive<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> engineer at a big tech company look like? They are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>competent enough to pass the hiring bar and be able to do the work, but either</li>
<li>working on a codebase or language that is largely new to them, or</li>
<li>trying to stay on top of a flood of code changes while also juggling their own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are almost certainly working to a deadline, or to a series of overlapping deadlines for different projects. In other words, <strong>they are trying to do their best in an environment that is not set up to produce quality code.</strong></p>
<p>That’s how “obviously” bad code happens. For instance, a junior engineer picks up a ticket for an annoying bug in a codebase they’re barely familiar with. They spend a few days figuring it out and come up with a hacky solution. One of the more senior “old hands” (if they’re lucky) glances over it in a spare half-hour, vetoes it, and suggests something slightly better that would at least work. The junior engineer implements that as best they can, tests that it works, it gets briefly reviewed and shipped, and everyone involved immediately moves on to higher-priority work. Five years later somebody notices this<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> and thinks “wow, that’s hacky - how did such bad code get written at such a big software company”?</p>
<h3>Big tech companies are fine with this</h3>
<p>I have written a lot about the internal tech company dynamics that contribute to this. Most directly, in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company"><em>Seeing like a software company</em></a> I argue that big tech companies consistently prioritize internal <em>legibility</em> - the ability to see at a glance who’s working on what and to change it at will - over productivity. Big companies know that treating engineers as fungible and moving them around destroys their ability to develop long-term expertise in a single codebase. <strong>That’s a deliberate tradeoff.</strong> They’re giving up some amount of expertise and software quality in order to gain the ability to rapidly deploy skilled engineers onto whatever the problem-of-the-month is.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is a good idea or a bad idea. It certainly seems to be working for the big tech companies, particularly now that “how fast can you pivot to something AI-related” is so important. But if you’re doing this, then <em>of course</em> you’re going to produce some genuinely bad code. That’s what happens when you ask engineers to rush out work on systems they’re unfamiliar with.</p>
<p><strong>Individual engineers are entirely powerless to alter this dynamic</strong>. This is particularly true in 2025, when <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-times-are-over">the balance of power has tilted</a> away from engineers and towards tech company leadership. The most you can do as an individual engineer is to try and become an “old hand”: to develop expertise in at least one area, and to use it to block the worst changes and steer people towards at least minimally-sensible technical decisions. But even that is often swimming against the current of the organization, and if inexpertly done can cause you to get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1et7miz/what_you_need_to_know_about_performance/">PIP-ed</a> or worse.</p>
<h3>Pure and impure engineering</h3>
<p>I think a lot of this comes down to the distinction between <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/pure-and-impure-engineering">pure and impure software engineering</a>. To pure engineers - engineers working on self-contained technical projects, like <a href="https://ziglang.org/">a programming language</a> - the only explanation for bad code is incompetence. But impure engineers operate more like plumbers or electricians. They’re working to deadlines on projects that are relatively new to them, and even if their technical fundamentals are impeccable, there’s always <em>something</em> about the particular setup of this situation that’s awkward or surprising. To impure engineers, bad code is inevitable. As long as the overall system works well enough, the project is a success.</p>
<p>At big tech companies, engineers don’t get to decide if they’re working on pure or impure engineering work. It’s <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/not-your-codebase">not their codebase</a>! If the company wants to move you from working on database infrastructure to building the new payments system, they’re fully entitled to do that. The fact that you might make some mistakes in an unfamiliar system - or that your old colleagues on the database infra team might suffer without your expertise - is a deliberate tradeoff being made by <strong>the company, not the engineer</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s fine to point out examples of bad code at big companies. If nothing else, it can be an effective way to get those specific examples fixed, since execs usually jump at the chance to turn bad PR into good PR. But I think it’s a mistake<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> to attribute primary responsibility to the engineers at those companies. If you could wave a magic wand and make every engineer twice as strong, <em>you would still have bad code</em>, because almost nobody can come into a brand new codebase and quickly make changes with zero mistakes. The root cause is that <strong>most big company engineers are forced to do most of their work in unfamiliar codebases</strong>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>As AI agents become more capable, developers are increasingly asking them to take on complex tasks requiring work that spans hours, or even days. However, getting agents to make consistent progress across multiple context windows remains an open problem.</p><p>The core challenge of long-running agents is that they must work in discrete sessions, and each new session begins with no memory of what came before. Imagine a software project staffed by engineers working in shifts, where each new engineer arrives with no memory of what happened on the previous shift. Because context windows are limited, and because most complex projects cannot be completed within a single window, agents need a way to bridge the gap between coding sessions.</p><p>We developed a two-fold solution to enable the <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview">Claude Agent SDK</a> to work effectively across many context windows: an <strong>initializer agent</strong> that sets up the environment on the first run, and a <strong>coding agent</strong> that is tasked with making incremental progress in every session, while leaving clear artifacts for the next session. You can find code examples in the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/tree/main/autonomous-coding">quickstart.</a></p><h2 id="the-long-running-agent-problem">The long-running agent problem</h2><p>The Claude Agent SDK is a powerful, general-purpose agent harness adept at coding, as well as other tasks that require the model to use tools to gather context, plan, and execute. It has context management capabilities such as compaction, which enables an agent to work on a task without exhausting the context window. Theoretically, given this setup, it should be possible for an agent to continue to do useful work for an arbitrarily long time.</p><p>However, compaction isn’t sufficient. Out of the box, even a frontier coding model like Opus 4.5 running on the Claude Agent SDK in a loop across multiple context windows will fall short of building a production-quality web app if it’s only given a high-level prompt, such as “build a clone of <a href="http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.625e97eb-61f9-4c27-bed0-43f02b69fc6c">claude.ai</a>.”</p><p>Claude’s failures manifested in two patterns. First, the agent tended to try to do too much at once—essentially to attempt to one-shot the app. Often, this led to the model running out of context in the middle of its implementation, leaving the next session to start with a feature half-implemented and undocumented. The agent would then have to guess at what had happened, and spend substantial time trying to get the basic app working again. This happens even with compaction, which doesn’t always pass perfectly clear instructions to the next agent.</p><p>A second failure mode would often occur later in a project. After some features had already been built, a later agent instance would look around, see that progress had been made, and declare the job done.</p><p>This decomposes the problem into two parts. First, we need to set up an initial environment that lays the foundation for <em>all</em> the features that a given prompt requires, which sets up the agent to work step-by-step and feature-by-feature. Second, we should prompt each agent to make incremental progress towards its goal while also leaving the environment in a clean state at the end of a session. By “clean state” we mean the kind of code that would be appropriate for merging to a main branch: there are no major bugs, the code is orderly and well-documented, and in general, a developer could easily begin work on a new feature without first having to clean up an unrelated mess.</p><p>When experimenting internally, we addressed these problems using a two-part solution:</p><ol><li>Initializer agent: The very first agent session uses a specialized prompt that asks the model to set up the initial environment: an <code>init.sh</code> script, a claude-progress.txt file that keeps a log of what agents have done, and an initial git commit that shows what files were added.</li><li>Coding agent: Every subsequent session asks the model to make incremental progress, then leave structured updates.<sup>1</sup></li></ol><p>The key insight here was finding a way for agents to quickly understand the state of work when starting with a fresh context window, which is accomplished with the claude-progress.txt file alongside the git history. Inspiration for these practices came from knowing what effective software engineers do every day.</p><h2 id="environment-management-">Environment management </h2><p>In the updated <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices#multi-context-window-workflows">Claude 4 prompting guide</a>, we shared some best practices for multi-context window workflows, including a harness structure that uses “a different prompt for the very first context window.” This “different prompt” requests that the initializer agent set up the environment with all the necessary context that future coding agents will need to work effectively. Here, we provide a deeper dive on some of the key components of such an environment.</p><h3 id="feature-list">Feature list</h3><p>To address the problem of the agent one-shotting an app or prematurely considering the project complete, we prompted the initializer agent to write a comprehensive file of feature requirements expanding on the user’s initial prompt. In the <a href="http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.625e97eb-61f9-4c27-bed0-43f02b69fc6c">claude.ai</a> clone example, this meant over 200 features, such as “a user can open a new chat, type in a query, press enter, and see an AI response.” These features were all initially marked as “failing” so that later coding agents would have a clear outline of what full functionality looked like.</p><div><pre><code>{
    "category": "functional",
    "description": "New chat button creates a fresh conversation",
    "steps": [
      "Navigate to main interface",
      "Click the 'New Chat' button",
      "Verify a new conversation is created",
      "Check that chat area shows welcome state",
      "Verify conversation appears in sidebar"
    ],
    "passes": false
  }
</code></pre></div><p>We prompt coding agents to edit this file only by changing the status of a passes field, and we use strongly-worded instructions like “It is unacceptable to remove or edit tests because this could lead to missing or buggy functionality.” After some experimentation, we landed on using JSON for this, as the model is less likely to inappropriately change or overwrite JSON files compared to Markdown files.</p><h3 id="incremental-progress">Incremental progress</h3><p>Given this initial environment scaffolding, the next iteration of the coding agent was then asked to work on only one feature at a time. This incremental approach turned out to be critical to addressing the agent’s tendency to do too much at once.</p><p>Once working incrementally, it’s still essential that the model leaves the environment in a clean state after making a code change. In our experiments, we found that the best way to elicit this behavior was to ask the model to commit its progress to git with descriptive commit messages and to write summaries of its progress in a progress file. This allowed the model to use git to revert bad code changes and recover working states of the code base.</p><p>These approaches also increased efficiency, as they eliminated the need for an agent to have to guess at what had happened and spend its time trying to get the basic app working again.</p><h3 id="testing">Testing</h3><p>One final major failure mode that we observed was Claude’s tendency to mark a feature as complete without proper testing. Absent explicit prompting, Claude tended to make code changes, and even do testing with unit tests or <code>curl</code> commands against a development server, but would fail recognize that the feature didn’t work end-to-end.</p><p>In the case of building a web app, Claude mostly did well at verifying features end-to-end once explicitly prompted to use browser automation tools and do all testing as a human user would. </p><div><figure><img alt=" Screenshots taken by Claude through the Puppeteer MCP server as it tested the claude.ai clone.

For example, Claude can’t see browser-native alert modals through the Puppeteer MCP, and features relying on these modals tended to be buggier as a result.</p><h2 id="getting-up-to-speed">Getting up to speed</h2><p>With all of the above in place, every coding agent is prompted to run through a series of steps to get its bearings, some quite basic but still helpful:</p><ol><li><em>Run <code>pwd</code> to see the directory you’re working in. You’ll only be able to edit files in this directory.</em></li><li><em>Read the git logs and progress files to get up to speed on what was recently worked on.</em></li><li><em>Read the features list file and choose the highest-priority feature that’s not yet done to work on.</em></li></ol><p>This approach saves Claude some tokens in every session since it doesn’t have to figure out how to test the code. It also helps to ask the initializer agent to write an init.sh script that can run the development server, and then run through a basic end-to-end test before implementing a new feature.</p><p>In the case of the claude.ai clone, this meant that the agent always started the local development server and used the Puppeteer MCP to start a new chat, send a message, and receive a response. This ensured that Claude could quickly identify if the app had been left in a broken state, and immediately fix any existing bugs. If the agent had instead started implementing a new feature, it would likely make the problem worse.</p><p>Given all this, a typical session starts off with the following assistant messages:</p><div><pre><code>[Assistant] I'll start by getting my bearings and understanding the current state of the project.
[Tool Use] &lt;bash - pwd&gt;
[Tool Use] &lt;read - claude-progress.txt&gt;
[Tool Use] &lt;read - feature_list.json&gt;
[Assistant] Let me check the git log to see recent work.
[Tool Use] &lt;bash - git log --oneline -20&gt;
[Assistant] Now let me check if there's an init.sh script to restart the servers.
&lt;Starts the development server&gt;
[Assistant] Excellent! Now let me navigate to the application and verify that some fundamental features are still working.
&lt;Tests basic functionality&gt;
[Assistant] Based on my verification testing, I can see that the fundamental functionality is working well. The core chat features, theme switching, conversation loading, and error handling are all functioning correctly. Now let me review the tests.json file more comprehensively to understand what needs to be implemented next.
&lt;Starts work on a new feature&gt;</code></pre></div><div><div aria-label="Summarizing four common failure modes and solutions in long-running AI agents." role="region" tabindex="0"><p>Agent failure modes and solutions </p><table><tbody><tr><th><strong>Problem</strong></th><th><strong>Initializer Agent Behavior </strong></th><th><strong>Coding Agent Behavior</strong></th></tr><tr><td>Claude declares victory on the entire project too early.</td><td>Set up a feature list file: based on the input spec, set up a structured JSON file with a list of end-to-end feature descriptions.</td><td>Read the feature list file at the beginning of a session.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imgur decided to block UK users. Honestly? I don’t really care that much. I haven’t actively browsed the site in years. But it used to be everywhere. Back when Reddit embedded everything on Imgur, maybe fifteen years ago, it was genuinely useful. Then Reddit built their own image hosting, Discord did the same, and Imgur slowly faded into the background.</p><p>Except it never fully disappeared. And since the block, I keep stumbling across Imgur links that just show “unavailable.” It’s mildly infuriating.</p><p><img src="https://blog.tymscar.com/imgur-uk/not-working.png" alt="Imgur showing unavailable in the UK"></p><h2 id="the-minecraft-shader-problem">The Minecraft shader problem<a href="#the-minecraft-shader-problem" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Here’s a concrete example. I was playing Minecraft with some work colleagues and wanted to try different shaders. Most shader pages embed preview images hosted on Imgur. So I’d click through shader after shader, and every single preview was just gone. I couldn’t see what any of them looked like without the images.</p><p>This kind of thing happens constantly now. Old forum posts, Reddit threads, documentation pages, random project READMEs. Imgur links are still scattered across the internet, and in the UK, they’re all broken.</p><h2 id="why-i-didnt-just-install-a-vpn">Why I didn’t just install a VPN<a href="#why-i-didnt-just-install-a-vpn" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The obvious solution is to use a VPN. Change your location, problem solved. But I have a few issues with that approach.</p><p>First, I just <a href="https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/wifi7speedhunt/">upgraded to 2.5 Gbps internet</a> and I don’t want to route all my traffic through a VPN and take the speed hit. I have this bandwidth for a reason.</p><p>Second, even if I installed a VPN on my main machine, what about my phone? My laptop? My desktop? Every device would need the VPN running, and I’d have to remember to connect it before browsing. It’s messy.</p><p>I wanted something cleaner: a solution that works for every device on my network, automatically, without any client-side configuration.</p><h2 id="the-network-level-approach">The network-level approach<a href="#the-network-level-approach" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>I already run a homelab with Traefik as my reverse proxy, Pi-hole for DNS, and everything declaratively configured with NixOS. If you’ve read my <a href="https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/nixosdockerwithsecrets/">previous post on Docker containers with secrets</a>, you’ll recognise the pattern.</p><p>The idea was simple: intercept all requests to <code>i.imgur.com</code> at the DNS level, route them through a VPN-connected container, and serve the images back. Every device on my network automatically uses Pi-hole for DNS via DHCP, so this would be completely transparent.</p><p>Here’s the flow:</p><ol><li>Device requests <code>i.imgur.com</code></li><li>Pi-hole returns my Traefik instance’s IP instead</li><li>Traefik sees the SNI hostname and routes to Gluetun</li><li>Gluetun tunnels the request through a VPN</li><li>Nginx (attached to Gluetun’s network) proxies to the real Imgur</li><li>Image comes back through the tunnel to the device</li></ol><h2 id="why-nginx-when-i-already-have-traefik">Why Nginx when I already have Traefik?<a href="#why-nginx-when-i-already-have-traefik" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Good question. Gluetun isn’t a reverse proxy. It’s a container that provides VPN connectivity to other containers attached to its network namespace. So I needed something inside Gluetun’s network to actually handle the proxying. Nginx was the simplest choice.</p><p>The Nginx config is minimal. It just does TCP passthrough with SNI:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="nginx"><span><span><span>user</span> <span>nginx</span>;

<p>I don’t remember when I first started noticing that people I knew out in the world had lost their sense of erotic privacy, but I do remember the day it struck me as a phenomenon that had escaped my timeline and entered my real, fleshy life. It was last year, when I was having a conversation with a friend of mine, who, for the record, is five years younger than me (I’m 31). I told my friend about an erotic encounter I’d just experienced and very much delighted in, in which I had my hair brushed at the same time by two very beautiful women at the hair salon — one was teaching the other how to do it a certain way. When I finished my story, my friend looked at me, horrified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They had no idea you felt something sexual about them,” she said. “What if they found out? Lowkey, I hate to say this but: you took advantage of them.” I was shocked. I tried to explain — and it felt extremely absurd to explain — that this had happened in my body and in my thoughts, which were private to me and which nobody had the right to know about. But they did have the right, my friend argued. She demanded that I apologize to the women for sexualizing them. Offended at having been accused — in my view, in extremely bad faith — of being some kind of peep-show creep, I tried to argue that I’d simply responded in a physical way to an unexpected, direct, and involuntary stimulus. Back and forth, back and forth, we fought like this for a while. In fact, it ended the friendship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were other conversations, too, that suggested to me that conceptions of love and sex have changed fundamentally among people I know. Too many of my friends and acquaintances — of varying degrees of “onlineness,” from veteran discourse observers to casual browsers — seem to have internalized the internet’s tendency to reach for the least charitable interpretation of every glancing thought and, as a result, to have pathologized what I would characterize as the normal, internal vagaries of desire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence, there was the friend who justified her predilection for being praised in bed as a “kink” inherited through the “trauma” of her father always harping on her because of her grades. There was the friend who felt entitled to posting screenshots of intimate conversations on Twitter after a messy breakup so that she could get a ruling on “who was the crazy one.” Then there was the friend who bitterly described a man he was dating as a “fuckboy” because he stood him up, claiming that their having enjoyed sex together beforehand was “emotionally manipulative.” When I dug a bit deeper, it turned out the man in question had just gotten out of a seven-year relationship and realized he wasn’t ready to be sexually intimate, and while he was rude to stand my friend up, it shocked me how quick my friend was to categorize his rightfully hurt feelings as something pathological or sinister in the other person, and that he did this in order to preemptively shield himself from being cast as the villain in what was a multi-party experience. This last friend I asked: “Who are you defending yourself against?” To which he answered, to my astonishment: “I don’t know. The world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I choose these examples from my personal life because they express sentiments that were once the kind of stuff I encountered only in the messy battlegrounds of Twitter, amid discussions about whether Sabrina Carpenter is being oversexualized, whether kinks are akin to a sexual orientation, whether a woman can truly consent in an age-gap relationship, and whether exposure to sex scenes in movies violates viewer consent. It is quite easy to dismiss these “discourse wars” as a “puritanism” afflicting the young, a reactionary current to be solved with a different, corrective discourse of pro-sex liberation, distributed via those same channels. If only it were so! To me, the reality goes deeper and is bleaker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is that our most intimate interactions with others are now governed by the expectation of surveillance and punishment from an online public. One can never be sure that this public or someone who could potentially expose us to it isn’t there<em>, </em>always secretly filming, posting, taking notes, ready to pounce the second one does something cringe or problematic (as defined by whom?). To claim that these matters are merely discursive in nature is to ignore the problem. Because love and sex are so intimate and vulnerable, the stakes of punishment are higher, and the fear of it penetrates deeper into the psyche and is harder to rationalize away than, say, fear of pushback from tweeting a divisive political opinion.</p>



<p>I should state at this point that this is not an essay about “cancel culture going too far,” a topic which can now be historicized as little more than a rhetorical cudgel wielded successfully by the right to wrest cultural power back from an ascendant progressive liberalism. This was especially true after the prominence of organized campaigns such as #MeToo. #MeToo was smeared by liberals and conservatives alike (united, as they always are, in misogyny) as being inherently punitive in nature, meant to punish men who’d fallen into a rough patch of bad behavior, or who, perhaps, might not have done anything at all (the falsely accused or the misinterpreted man became the real victim, in this view). #MeToo did make use of the call-out — the story shared in a spreadsheet anonymously or in a signed op-ed — but the call-outs had a purpose: to end a long-standing and long-permitted norm of sexual abuse within institutions. Underlying this was a discursive practice and a form of solidarity building in which people believed that sharing their stories of trauma en masse could bring about structural change. As someone who participated myself, I too believed in this theory and saw it as necessary, cathartic, and political, and far from vigilante justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the pushback against #MeToo reveals a certain peril to storytelling as politics, not only in the retraumatization evident in the practice of revealing one’s most intimate harms before an infinite online audience, which could always include those listening in bad faith. But also, a discursive market opened up in which trauma became a kind of currency of authenticity, resulting in a doubled exploitation. This idea, while not very nice, lingers in the use of harm as an authoritative form of rhetorical defense. The problem here is not what is said, but how it is used. A friction has since emerged between an awareness of weaponization of harm and emotion and the continued need to express oneself as vulnerably as possible in order to come off as sincere. This friction is unresolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The organized goals of the #MeToo movement are missing from the new puritanism. I think that the prudish revulsion I’ve seen online and in my own life has as much to do with surveillance as with sex. Punishing strangers for their perceived perversion is a form of compensation for a process that is already completed: the erosion of erotic and emotional privacy through internet-driven surveillance practices, practices we have since turned inward on ourselves. In short, we have become our own panopticons.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>The prudish revulsion I’ve seen online and in my own life has as much to do with surveillance as with sex.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>On the rightmost side of the spectrum, punitive anti-erotic surveillance is very explicit and very real, especially for women. The Andrew Tates of the world and the practitioners of extreme forms of misogyny have no problem with using internet tools and social media websites for mass shaming and explicit harm. Covert filming of sex acts, AI deep fakes, extortion, and revenge porn are all realities one has to contend with when thinking about hooking up or going to public places such as nightclubs and gay bars. This is blackmail at its most explicit and extreme, meant to further solidify a link between sex and fear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that link between sex and fear is operating in more “benign” or common modes of internet practice. There is an online culture that thinks nothing of submitting screenshots, notes, videos, and photos with calls for collective judgement. When it became desirable and permissible to transform our own lives into content, it didn’t take long before a sense of entitlement emerged that extended that transformation to people we know and to strangers. My ex sent me this text, clearly she is the crazy one, right? Look at this dumb/funny/cringe Hinge profile! Look at this note some guy sent me, is this a red flag? Look at this random woman I photographed buying wine, coconut oil, and a long cucumber at the supermarket!&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think these kinds of posts sometimes amount to little more than common bullying, but they are on a continuum with a puritan discourse in which intimate questions, practices, and beliefs about queerness, sexuality, gender presentation, and desire are also subjected to days-long piles-on. In both instances, the instinct to submit online strangers to viral discipline is given a faux-radical sheen. It’s a kind of casual blackmail that warns everyone to conform or be exposed; a way of saying if you don’t cave to my point of view, redefine yourself in my image of what sexuality is or should be, and (most importantly) apologize to me and the public, I will subject you to my large following and there will be hell to pay. Such unproductive and antisocial behavior is justified as a step toward liberation from predation, misogyny, or any number of other harms. But the punitive mindset we’ve developed towards relationships is indicative of an inability to imagine a future of gendered or sexual relations without subjugation. To couch that in the language of harm reduction and trauma delegitimizes both.</p>



<p>There are other ways the politics of surveillance have become a kind of funhouse mirror. It is seen as more and more normal to track one’s partner through Find My iPhone or an AirTag, even though the potential for abuse of this technology is staggering and obvious. There are all kinds of new products, such as a biometric ring that is allegedly able to tell you whether your partner is cheating, that expand this capability into more and more granular settings. That’s all before we get into the endless TikToks about “why I go through my partner’s text messages.” That men use these tactics and tools to control women is a known threat. What is astonishing is the lengths to which some women will go to use these same technologies, claiming that they are necessary to <em>prevent </em>harm — especially that caused by cheating, which is now seen as some kind of lifelong trauma or permanently damnable offense instead of one of the rather quotidian, if very painful, ways we hurt one another. Each of these surveillance practices operates from a feeling of entitlement and control over other people, their bodies, and what they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pundits like to decree sexlessness as a Gen-Z problem, to argue no one is fucking because they are too on their phones. However, it is always too easy to blame the young. It was my generation that failed to instill the social norms necessary to prevent a situation where fear of strangers on the internet has successfully replaced the disciplinary apparatus more commonly held by religious or conservative doctrine. Even when, as in my experience in the salon, I am acting in the privacy of my own body, someone is always there watching, ready to interpret my actions, problematize them so as to share in the same sense of magical thinking, the same insecurities, and to be punished for not being insecure in the same way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s only in retrospect that I’m able to realize the toll that constant, nagging interaction with my devices and the internet has taken on my thinking life <em>and</em> my sex life. I remember very viscerally when I’d just come out of the closet as bisexual in 2016. When I embarked on a journey to find the kind of lover I wanted to be, my only experience with the world of queerness was online through memes, articles, and others’ social media presentation of themselves and of politics. Queer sex was not something that could be discovered through sensation, through physical interaction, but was rather a catalog of specific acts and roles one was already expected to know. I was terrified of making some kind of mistake, of being the wrong kind of bisexual, of misrepresenting myself in an offensive way (could I use the term “soft butch” if I wasn’t a lesbian?), of being exposed somehow as a fraud. When the time came for me to have sex for the first time, what should have been a joyous occasion was instead burdened with a sense of being watched. I could not let the natural processes of erotic discovery take their course, so caught up was I in judging myself from the perspective of strangers to whom I owed nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it wasn’t just a matter of queerness, either. When I hooked up with men, I could only perceive of sex the same way, not as situational but as a set of prescribed acts and scenes, many of which I wanted to explore. However, this time I interrogated these urges as being sociogenic in nature and somehow harmful to me, when they were, in fact, private, and I did not, in reality, feel harmed. Because I wanted, at one point in my life, to be tied up and gagged, the disempowering nature of such a want necessitated trying to justify it against invisible accusations with some kind of traumatogenic and immutable quality. Maybe it was because I was raped in college. Maybe I was just inherently submissive. One of the great ironies in the history of sex is that pathologization used to be a way of controlling sexual desire. (All are familiar with the many myths that masturbation would turn one blind.) Now it is a way of exempting oneself, of relinquishing control of one’s actions so as to absolve them of scrutiny. My little bondage moment couldn’t be problematic if it couldn’t be helped. It couldn’t be subjected to interrogation if there was something I could point to to say “it’s beyond my control, don’t judge me!” One day, however, I came to an important revelation: The reality was much simpler. It was a passing phase, a desire that originated with a specific man and lost its charm after I moved on from him. There wasn’t some deterministic quality in myself that made me like this. My desire was not fixed in nature. My sexual qualities were transient and not inborn. What aroused me was wonderfully, entirely situational.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A situational eroticism is what is needed now, in our literalist times. It’s exhausting, how everything is so readily defined by types, acts, traumas, kinks, fetishes, pathology, and aesthetics. To me, our predilection for determinism is an expected psychological response to excessive surveillance. A situational eroticism decouples sensation from narrative and typology. It allows us to feel without excuse and to relate our feelings to our immediate embodied moment, grounded in a fundamental sense of personal privacy. While it is admirable to try and understand ourselves and important to protect ourselves from harm and investigate critically the ways in which what we want may put us at risk of that harm — or at risk of doing harm to others — sometimes desires just are, and they are not that way for long. Arousal is a matter of the self, which takes place within the body, a space no one can see into. It is often a mystery, a surprise, a discovery. It can happen at a small scale, say, the frisson of two sets of fingers in one’s hair at once. It is beautiful, unplanned and does not judge itself because it is an inert sensation, unimbued with premeditated meaning. This should liberate rather than frighten us. Maybe what it means doesn’t matter. Maybe we don’t have to justify it even to ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;We are very afraid not of sex, but of exposure.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But in order to facilitate a return to situational eroticism, we need to kill the panopticon in our heads. That means first killing the panopticon we’ve built for others. There is no purpose in vindictive or thoughtless exposure. Not everything needs to be subjected to public opinion, not every anecdote is worth sharing, not every debate needs engagement, especially those debates which have no material basis to them, no ask, no funnel for all that energy. We need to stop confusing vigilantism with justice and posting with politics. That does not mean we stop the work that #MeToo started, but that revenge is a weapon best utilized collectively against the enemies of liberation. We need to protect the vulnerable from exploitative technologies and practices, repeatedly denounce their use, and work towards a world without sexual coercion, digital or otherwise.</p>



<p>On an individual level, we need to abandon or reshape our relationships with our phones and regain a sense of our own personal and mental privacy. It’s a matter of existential, metaphysical importance. Only when this decoupling from ourselves and the mediated performance of ourselves is complete, can we begin the process of returning to our own bodies out there, in the world, with no one watching or reading our thoughts except those we want to. The truth is, we are very afraid not of sex, but of exposure. Only when we are unafraid can we begin to let desire flourish. Only when we return to ourselves can we really know what we want.</p>

<p>Kuo said Apple plans to utilize Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/process/18a.html">18A process</a>, which is the "earliest available sub-2nm advanced node manufactured in North America."</p>
<p>If this rumor proves to be accurate, Intel could supply Apple with M6 or M7 chips for future MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models at a minimum. However, while previous Intel chips for Macs were designed by Intel and based on x86 architecture, M-series chips are designed by Apple and use Arm architecture. Intel would only assist with manufacturing.</p>
<p>TSMC would continue to supply the majority of Apple's M-series chips.</p>
<p>Kuo said that Apple choosing to have Intel supply its lowest-end M-series chip would appease the Trump administration's desire for "Made in USA" products, and it would also help Apple to diversify its supply chain for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Apple began transitioning away from Intel processors in Macs in 2020, and its own M-series chips continue to provide industry-leading performance per watt.</p>
<p>Apple previously announced that macOS Tahoe will be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/intel-macs-no-more-updates/">final major macOS release that supports Intel-based Macs</a> with x86 architecture.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>November 26, 2025</p><article><p>When we launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/skaldlabs/skald">Skald</a>, we wanted it to not only be self-hostable, but also for one to be able to run it without sending any data to third-parties.</p>
<p>With LLMs getting better and better, privacy-sensitive organizations shouldn't have to choose between being left behind by not accessing frontier models and doing away with their committment to (or legal requirement for) data privacy.</p>
<p>So here's what we did to support this use case and also some benchmarks comparing performance when using proprietary APIs vs self-hosted open-source tech.</p>
<h2 id="rag-components-and-their-oss-alternatives"><a href="#rag-components-and-their-oss-alternatives"></a>RAG components and their OSS alternatives</h2>
<p>A basic RAG usually has the following core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A vector database</li>
<li>A vector embeddings model</li>
<li>An LLM</li>
</ul>
<p>And most times it also has these as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reranker</li>
<li>Document parsing (for PDFs, PowerPoints, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>What that means is that when you're looking to build a fully local RAG setup, you'll need to substitute whatever SaaS providers you're using for a local option for each of those components.</p>
<p>Here's a table with some examples of what we might use in a scenario where we can use third-party Cloud services and one where we can't:</p>



































<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Proprietary Options</th><th>Open-Source Options</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vector Database</td><td>Pinecone, Turbopuffer, Weaviate Cloud, Qdrant Cloud</td><td>Qdrant, Weaviate, Postgres with pgvector</td></tr><tr><td>Vector Embeddings Provider</td><td>OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage</td><td>Sentence Transformers, BGE, E5</td></tr><tr><td>LLM</td><td>GPT, Claude, Gemini</td><td>Llama, Mistral, GPT-OSS</td></tr><tr><td>Reranker</td><td>Cohere, Voyage</td><td>BGE Reranker, Sentence Transformers Cross-Encoder</td></tr><tr><td>Document Parsing</td><td>Reducto, Datalab</td><td>Docling</td></tr></tbody></table>
<blockquote>
<p>Do note that running something locally does not mean it <em>needs</em> to be open-source, as one could pay for a license to self-host proprietary software. But at Skald our goal was to use fully open-source tech, which is what I'll be convering here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The table above is far from covering all available options on both columns, but basically it gives you an indication of what to research into in order to pick a tool that works for you.</p>
<p>As with anything, what works for you will greatly depend on your use case. And you need to be prepared to run a few more services than you're used to if you've just been calling APIs.</p>
<p>For our local stack, we went with the easiest setup for now to get it working (and it does! see writeup on this lower down) but will be running benchmarks on all other options to determine the best possible setup.</p>
<p>This is what we have today:</p>
<p><strong>Vector DB:</strong> Postgres + pgvector. We already use Postgres and didn't want to bundle another service into our stack, but this is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://alex-jacobs.com/posts/the-case-against-pgvector/">controversial</a> and we will be running benchmarks to make a better informed decision here. Note that pgvector will serve a lot of use cases well all the way up to hundreds of thousands of documents, though.</p>
<p><strong>Vector embeddings:</strong> Users can configure this in Skald and we use Sentence Transformers (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a>) as our default (solid all-around performer for speed and retrieval, English-only). I also ran Skald with bge-m3 (larger, multi-language) and share the results later in this post.</p>
<p><strong>LLM:</strong> We don't even bundle a default with Skald and it's up to the users to run and manage this. I tested our setup with GPT-OSS 20B on EC2 (results shown below).</p>
<p><strong>Reranker:</strong> Users can also configure this in Skald, and the default is the Sentence Transformers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder">cross encoder</a> (solid, English-only). I've also used bge-reranker-v2-m3 and mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1 which offer multi-lingual support.</p>
<p><strong>Document parsing:</strong> There isn't much of a question on this one. We're using Docling. It's great. We run it via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve">docling-serve</a>.</p>
<h2 id="does-it-perform-though"><a href="#does-it-perform-though"></a>Does it perform though?</h2>
<p>So the main goal here was first to get something working then ensure it worked well with our platform and could be easily deployed. From here we'll be running extensive benchmarks and working with our clients to provide a solid setup that both performs well but is also not a nightmare to deploy and manage.</p>
<p>From that perspective, this was a great success.</p>
<p>Deploying a production instance of Skald with this whole stack took me 8 minutes, and that comes bundled with the vector database (well, Postgres), a reranking and embedding service, and Docling.</p>
<p>The only thing I needed to run separately was the LLM, which I did via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>Having gotten this sorted, I imported all the content from the PostHog website <a href="#footnotes">[1]</a> and set up a tiny dataset <a href="#footnotes">[2]</a> of questions and expected answers inside of Skald, then used our Experiments feature to run the RAG over this dataset.</p>
<p>I explicitly kept the topK values really high (100 for the vector search and 50 for post-reranking), as I was mostly testing for accuracy and wanted to see the performance when questions required e.g. aggregating context over 15+ documents.</p>
<details><summary>Full config</summary><p>Here are the params configured in the Skald UI for the the experiment.</p>




































<table><thead><tr><th>Config option</th><th>Selection</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Extra system prompt</td><td>Be really concise in your answers</td></tr><tr><td>Query rewriting</td><td>Off</td></tr><tr><td>Vector search topK</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Vector search distance threshold</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>Reranking</td><td>On</td></tr><tr><td>Reranking topK</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>References</td><td>Off</td></tr></tbody></table></details>
<p>So without any more delay, here are the results of my not-very-scientific at all benchmark using the experimentation platform inside of Skald.</p>
<p><img alt="skald experiments" src="https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/images/voyage-claude.png"></p>
<h3 id="voyage-claude"><a href="#voyage-claude"></a>Voyage + Claude</h3>
<p>This is our default Cloud setup. We use voyage-3-large and rerank-2.5 from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.voyageai.com/">Voyage AI</a> as our embedding and reranking models respectively, and we default to Claude Sonnet 3.7 for responses (users can configure the model though).</p>
<p>It passed with flying colors.</p>
<p>Our LLM-as-a-Judge gave an average score of 9.45 to the responses, and I basically agree with the assessment. All answers were correct, with one missing a few extra bits of context.</p>
<h3 id="voyage-gpt-oss-20b"><a href="#voyage-gpt-oss-20b"></a>Voyage + GPT-OSS 20B</h3>
<p>With the control experiment done, I then moved on to a setup where I kept Voyage as the embeddings provider and reranker, and then used GPT-OSS 20B running on a llama.cpp server on a g5.2xlarge EC2 instance as the LLM.</p>
<p>The goal here was to see how well the open-source LLM model itself stacked up against a frontier model accessed via API.</p>
<p>And it did great!</p>
<p>We don't yet support LLM-as-a-Judge on fully local deployments, so the only score we have here is mine. I scored the answers an average of 9.18 and they were all correct, with two of them just missing a few bits of information or highlighting less relevant information from the context.</p>
<h3 id="fully-local-gpt-oss-20b"><a href="#fully-local-gpt-oss-20b"></a>Fully local + GPT-OSS 20B</h3>
<p>Lastly, it was time for the moment of truth: running a fully local setup.</p>
<p>For this I ran two tests:</p>
<p><strong>1. Default sentence transformers embedding and reranking models</strong></p>
<p>The most popular open-source models are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> for embeddings and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2">ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2</a> as the reranker, so I used those for my first benchmark.</p>
<p>Here the average score was 7.10. Not bad, but definitely not great. However, when we dig into the results, we can get a better understanding of how this setup fails.</p>
<p>Basically, it got all point queries right, which are questions where the answer is somewhere in the mess of documents, but can be found from one specific place.</p>
<p>Where it failed was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-english query: The embeddings model and the reranker are English-based, so my question in Portuguese obviously got no answer</li>
<li>An ambiguous question with very little context ("what's ch")</li>
<li>Aggregating information from multiple documents/chunks e.g. it only found 5 out of PostHog's 7 funding rounds, and only a subset of the PostHog competitors that offer session replay (as mentioned in the source data)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, this is good news. That means that the default options will go a long way and should give you very good performance if your use case is only doing point queries in English. The other great thing is that these models are also fast.</p>
<p>Now, if you need to handle ambiguity better, or handle questions in other languages, then this setup is simply not for you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi-lingual models</strong></p>
<p>The next test I did used <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3">bge-m3</a> as the embeddings model and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/jeffwan/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1">mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1</a> as the reranker. The embeddings model is supposedly much better than the one used in the previous test and is also multi-lingual. The reranker on the other hand uses the same cross-encoder from the previous test as the base model but also adds multi-lingual support. The more standard option here would have been the much more popular <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3">bge-reranker-v2-m3</a> model, but I found it to be much slower. I intend to tweak my setup and test it again, however.</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the results! I scored it 8.63 on average, which is very good. There were no complete failures, and it handled the question in Portuguese well.</p>
<p>The mistakes it made were:</p>
<ul>
<li>This new setup also did not do the best job at aggregating information, missing 2 of PostHog's funding rounds, and a couple of its session replay competitors</li>
<li>It also answered a question correctly, but added incorrect additional context after it</li>
</ul>
<p>So overall it performed quite well. Again what we what saw was the main problem is when the context needed for the response is scattered across multiple documents. There are various techniques to help with this and we'll be trialing some soon! They haven't been needed on the Cloud version because better models save you from having to add complexity for minimal performance gains, but as we're focused on building a really solid setup for local deploys, we'll be looking into this more and more.</p>
<h2 id="now-what"><a href="#now-what"></a>Now what?</h2>
<p>I hope this writeup has provided you with at least some insight and context into building a local RAG, and also the fact that it does work, it can serve a lot of use cases, and that the tendency is for this setup to get better and better as a) models improve b) we get more open-source models across the board, with both being things that we seem to be trending towards.</p>
<p>As for us at Skald, we intend to polish this setup further in order to serve even more use cases really well, as well as intend to soon be publishing more legitimate benchmarks for models in the open-source space, from LLMs to rerankers.</p>

<p><strong>[1]</strong> I used the PostHog website here because the website content is MIT-licensed (yes, wild) and readily-available as markdown on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com">GitHub</a> and having worked there I know a lot of answers off the top of my head making it a great dataset of ~2000 documents that I know well.</p>
<p><strong>[2]</strong> The questions and answers dataset I used for the experiments was the following:</p>
<details><summary>Dataset</summary>
































































<table><thead><tr><th>Question</th><th>Expected answer</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>How many raises did PostHog do?</td><td>PostHog has raised money 7 times: it raised $150k from YCombinator, then did a seed round ($3.025M), a series A ($12M), a series B ($15M), a series C ($10M), a series D ($70M), and a series E ($75M).</td><td>Requires aggregating context from at least 7 documents</td></tr><tr><td>When did group analytics launch?</td><td>December 16, 2021.</td><td>Point query, multiple mentions to "group analytics" in the source docs</td></tr><tr><td>Why was the sessions page removed?</td><td>The sessions page was removed because it was confusing and limited in functionality. It was replaced by the 'Recordings' tab.</td><td>Point query, multiple mentions to "sessions" in the source docs</td></tr><tr><td>What's the difference between a product engineer and other roles?</td><td>Compared to product managers, product engineers focus more on building rather than deep research and planning. When it comes to software engineers, both product and software engineers write code, but software engineers focus on building great software, whereas product engineers focus on building great products.</td><td>Requires aggregating context from multiple docs + there are a ton of mentions of "product engineer" in the source docs</td></tr><tr><td>What were the main benefits of YC?</td><td>The main benefits of YC were: Network Access, Investor Reviews, Office Hours, Funding Opportunities, Hiring Resources, Angel Investing Opportunities, Accelerated Growth and Experience, Shift in Self-Perception, Customer Acquisition, Product Market Fit, Ambitious Goal Setting, Access to Thought Leaders, Community Support</td><td>Point query</td></tr><tr><td>quem foi o primeiro investidor da posthogg?</td><td>O primeiro investidor da PostHog foi o YCombinator.</td><td>Question in Portuguese, with PostHog misspelled</td></tr><tr><td>what posthog competitors also offer session replays</td><td>LogRocket, Smartlook, FullStory, Microsoft Clarity, Contentsquare, Mouseflow, Heap, Pendo, Hotjar, Glassbox, and Amplitude.</td><td>Requires aggregating content from at least 11 docs (more because I actually missed some in my expected answer)</td></tr><tr><td>top tips find client</td><td>1. Leverage your inner circle 2. Join relevant communities 3. Be laser-focused 4. Set achievable goals 5. Frame conversations properly</td><td>Point query, worded weirdly</td></tr><tr><td>what's ch</td><td>CH most likely refers to ClickHouse, a column-oriented OLAP database.</td><td>Really ambiguous. I meant ClickHouse with my question.</td></tr><tr><td>what is mixedpanel</td><td>Mixpanel is a popular product analytics tool that was founded in 2009</td><td>Mixpanel misspelled as Mixedpanel</td></tr><tr><td>how was prpoerty filtering made faster?</td><td>Using materialized columns allowed ClickHouse to skip JSON parsing during queries and made queries with property filtering 25x faster.</td><td>Point query with a typo</td></tr></tbody></table></details></article><div><p>subscribe to get notified of new posts</p></div></section><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The internet is raging right now over <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/stellantis-news" target="_blank">Stellantis</a> pushing marketing pop-ups to owners’ in-car screens. It’s obnoxious, to be sure, and it’s legit—we have confirmation from a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/jeep-news" target="_blank">Jeep</a> driver as well as Stellantis itself. But this isn’t even the first time it’s happened, as we <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/jeep-owners-say-pop-up-ads-for-extended-warranties-keep-blocking-their-touchscreens" target="_blank">reported in February</a> about Jeep advertising extended warranties in the same way.</p>



<p>Auto writer and all-around car guy <a href="https://x.com/SpeedSportLife" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Zerin Dube</a> posted earlier this week about his WL Grand Cherokee’s “marketing notification” on X. The photo started popping off, and before long, others were sharing the same ad that was sent to their screens. Dube labeled it as “late stage capitalism,” which feels like an accurate descriptor.</p>



<p>Funny enough, Dube was in the market for a new Wrangler anyhow, and he took advantage of the $1,500 loyalty offer Jeep sent straight to his Grand Cherokee. He drove off the lot Thursday night in a new Rubicon X, so I guess you can say it worked.</p>




<figure><div>

<blockquote data-tweet-id="1991132235328610547" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And you're looking for ANOTHER jeep? I'd swear off the brand forever if it started sending me ads in the infotainment</p>— Vee! (@VLangs) <a href="https://twitter.com/VLangs/status/1991132235328610547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote>

</div></figure>




<figure></figure>



<p>Others online were less accepting of the ploy. Practically every repost of Dube’s photo decried Jeep and Stellantis at large, with some Ram and Chrysler drivers corroborating the ad’s rollout that spread across multiple brands. Most of the comments said something along the lines of, “Guess what I’m never buying.” Some made the informed prediction that this type of promotion will become commonplace in the industry before long.</p>



<p>For its part, Stellantis told <em>The Drive</em> that it sends out these notifications to “stay in contact with our owners at critical points in their ownership.” The in-vehicle message system is also used to notify drivers of vehicle recalls and health monitor alerts. A spokesperson for the brand said:</p>



<p>“Recently, a select group of owners received a special marketing notification in their vehicle, and we tailored this special offer to minimize any intrusions:</p>



<ul>
<li>The simple text message offering a $1,500 bonus incentive appears only on startup and while the vehicle is stationary</li>



<li>The message disappears when the vehicle begins moving, or the driver clicks the OK or X icon on the screen, or after 15 seconds</li>



<li>The message returns at the next key-on cycle&nbsp;<strong><em>only</em></strong>&nbsp;if the driver clicked on Remind Me Later, or they did not click OK or X</li>
</ul>



<p>“Our goal is to deliver the best vehicle experience for our customers. As a result of these efforts, we have seen our customers take advantage of this offer,” the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>The Stellantis spokesperson concluded by saying that owners can permanently opt out of in-vehicle messaging by calling the company’s customer care line at 800-777-3600.</p>




<figure></figure>



<p>The $1,500 loyalty bonus is just one of many discounts that Stellantis dealers are stacking in order to move more units. I reported last week that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-bronco-sales-are-threatening-the-jeep-wranglers-dominance-for-the-first-time" target="_blank">storming Ford Bronco sales</a> are genuinely threatening the Wrangler’s spot atop the segment, and as Dube shared on X, he got something like $16,500 off his new Jeep. Apparently, now’s a good time to buy if you can stand the occasional spam on your car’s screen.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/jeep-owners-say-pop-up-ads-for-extended-warranties-keep-blocking-their-touchscreens" target="_blank">The last time this happened</a>, Stellantis was advertising extended warranties to owners via their infotainment. Many were frustrated as the offer continued to show, even after acknowledging it by pressing “OK.” What’s more, others saw the ad despite their car exceeding the mileage limit mentioned in the promotion.</p>



<p>Connected cars, man. Gotta love ’em.</p>

<p dir="auto">We're taught that email must go through servers. Why? Because the Internet was built around centralized infrastructure. Every email you send travels through multiple servers - your provider's server, maybe a few relay servers, and finally your recipient's provider's server. Each hop is a potential point of surveillance, censorship, or failure.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even "encrypted" email solutions still rely on these centralized servers. They encrypt the message content but the metadata - who you're talking to, when, how often - is visible to anyone watching the servers.</p>
<p dir="auto">But there is a network, called <strong><a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Yggdrasil</a></strong>, that gives everyone a free IPv6 and doesn't need a blessing from your ISP. We finally have this possibility to use true P2P email. And moreover, this network has strong encryption to protect all data that flows from one IP to another.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tyr brings true peer-to-peer email to your Android device</strong> using these unusual conditions. Unlike traditional email clients, Tyr doesn't need:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>❌ Centralized mail servers (the connections are straight P2P)</li>
<li>❌ Message encryption layers (the network takes care of that)</li>
<li>❌ Port forwarding or STUN/TURN servers (Yggdrasil handles NAT traversal)</li>

<p dir="auto">Tyr runs a complete email server right on your Android device, using the Yggdrasil network for transport. The <strong><a href="https://github.com/JB-SelfCompany/yggmail-android">Yggmail</a></strong> mail server (built in Go) is embedded as a library inside the app and runs as a foreground service.</p>
<p dir="auto">On top of Yggdrasil, it provides standard <strong>SMTP</strong> and <strong>IMAP</strong> protocols on localhost (<code>127.0.0.1:1025</code> and <code>127.0.0.1:1143</code>). Any email client can connect to these ports - but we recommend <strong>DeltaChat</strong> or <strong>ArcaneChat</strong> for the best P2P messaging experience.</p>

JVCo, in turn, owns Laidley LLC (Landlord). None of this is unusual except for the part where Meta designs, builds, guarantees, operates, funds the overruns, pays the rent, and does not consolidate it.</p><p>This project has nine data centers and two support buildings, with about four million sq. ft. and 2.064 GW capacity. The support buildings will store the reams of documentation needed to convince everyone this structure isn’t what it looks like. The total capital plan of $28.79 billion will be funded as follows:</p><ul><li><p>$27.30 billion of debt raised by Beignet.</p></li><li><p>$2.45 billion of deferred equity commitments from Blue Owl funds.</p></li><li><p>And, in a feat of financial hydration, $1.16 billion of interest generated by the same borrowed money while it sits in laddered Treasuries.</p></li></ul><p>The structure allows the Issuer to borrow money, earn interest on the borrowed money, and then use that interest to satisfy the equity requirement that would normally require… money.</p><p>Nothing is created. Nothing is contributed. It’s a loop. Borrow money, earn interest, and use the interest to claim you provided equity. The kind of circle only finance can call a straight line.</p><p>Together, these flows cover Beignet’s $23.03 billion obligation to JVCo, plus the usual constellation of capitalized interest, reserve accounts, and transaction expenses. In any other context this would raise questions. For us, it raises the credit rating.</p><p>Meta, through Pelican Leap LLC (Tenant), has entered into eleven triple-net leases—one for each building—with an initial four-year term starting in 2029 and four renewal options that could extend the arrangement to twenty years. The leases rely on the assumption that Meta will continue to need exponentially more compute power and that AI demand will not collapse, reverse, plateau, or become structurally inconvenient.</p><p>The notes issued by Beignet are secured by Beignet’s equity interest in JVCo and relevant transaction accounts. They are not secured by the underlying physical assets, which remain at the JVCo and Landlord level. This is described as standard practice, which is true in the same way that using eleven entities to rent buildings to yourself has become standard practice.</p><p>The resulting structure allows Meta to support the project economically while leaving the associated debt somewhere that is technically not on Meta’s balance sheet. The distinction is thin, but apparently wide enough to matter.</p><p>The preliminary A+ rating reflects our view that this is functionally Meta borrowing $27.30 billion for a campus no one else will touch, packaged in legal formality precise enough to satisfy the letter of consolidation rules and absurd enough to insult the spirit.</p><p>Credit risk aligns almost one-for-one with Meta’s own profile because:</p><ul><li><p>Meta is obligated to fund construction cost overruns beyond 105 percent of the fixed budget, excluding force majeure events, which rating agencies historically treat as theoretical inconveniences rather than recurring features of the physical world.</p></li><li><p>Meta guarantees all lease payments and operating obligations, both during the initial four-year term and across any renewal periods it already intends to exercise, an arrangement whose purpose becomes clearer when one remembers why the campus is being built at all.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides an RVG (residual value guarantee) structured to be sufficient, in most modeled cases, to ensure bondholders are repaid even if Meta recommits to the Metaverse or any future initiative born from its ongoing fascination with expensive detours. We did not model what would happen if data center demand collapses and Meta cannot secure a new tenant. This scenario was excluded for methodological convenience.</p></li><li><p>The minimum rent schedule has been calibrated to produce a debt service coverage ratio of approximately 1.12 through 2049. We consider this a sufficient level of stability usually found only in spreadsheets that freeze when real-world data is used.</p></li></ul><p>Taken together, these features tie Beignet’s credit quality to Meta so tightly that you’d have to not be paying attention to miss them. The structure maintains a precarious technical separation that, under current interpretations of accounting guidance, allows Meta to keep roughly $27 billion of assets and debt off its own balance sheet while continuing to provide every meaningful form of economic support.</p><p>This treatment is considered acceptable because the people who decide what is acceptable have accepted it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://stohl.substack.com/p/exclusive-credit-report-shows-meta?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://stohl.substack.com/p/exclusive-credit-report-shows-meta?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Share</span></a></p><p>JVCo qualifies as a variable interest entity because the equity at risk is ceremonial and the real economic exposure sits entirely with the party insisting it does not control the venture. This remains legal due to the enduring belief that balance sheets are healthier when the risky parts are hidden.</p><p>Under U.S. GAAP, consolidation is required if Meta is the primary beneficiary, defined as the party that both:</p><ol><li><p>Directs the activities that most significantly affect the entity’s performance, and</p></li><li><p>Absorbs significant losses or receives significant benefits.</p></li></ol><p>Meta asserts it is not the primary beneficiary.</p><p>To evaluate that assertion, we note the following uncontested facts:</p><ul><li><p>Meta is responsible for designing, overseeing, and operating a 2.064 GW AI campus, an activity that requires technical capabilities Blue Owl does not possess.</p></li><li><p>Meta bears construction cost overruns beyond 105 percent of the fixed budget, as well as specified casualty repair obligations of up to $3.125 billion per event during construction.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides the guarantee for all rent and operating payments under the leases, across the initial term and any renewals.</p></li><li><p>Meta provides the residual value guarantee, ensuring bondholders are repaid if leases are not renewed or are terminated, either through a sale or by paying the guaranteed minimum values directly.</p></li><li><p>Meta contributes funding, directs operations, bears construction risk, guarantees payments, guarantees asset values, determines utilization, controls renewal behavior, and can trigger the sale of the facility.</p></li></ul><p>Based on this, or despite this, Meta concludes it does not control JVCo.</p><p>Our interpretation is fully compliant with U.S. GAAP, which prioritizes the geometry of the legal structure over the inconvenience of economic substance and recognizes control only if the controlling party agrees to be recognized as controlling.</p><p>Meta has not agreed, and the framework, including this agency, respects that choice.</p><p>For rating purposes, we therefore accept Meta’s non-consolidation as an accounting outcome while treating Meta, in all practical respects, as fully responsible for the performance of an entity it does not officially control.</p><p>The lease structure is designed to look like a normal commercial arrangement while functioning as a long-term commitment Meta insists, for accounting reasons, it cannot possibly predict.</p><p>Tenant will pay fixed rent for the first 19 months of operations, based on a 50 percent assumed utilization rate, after which rent scales with actual power consumption. The leases are triple-net. Meta is responsible for everything: operating costs, maintenance, taxes, insurance, utilities. If a pipe breaks, Meta fixes the pipe. If a hurricane relocates a roof, Meta pays to staple the roof back on.</p><p>In practical terms, the only scenario in which Beignet bears operating exposure is a scenario in which Meta stops paying its own bills, at which point the lease structure becomes irrelevant because the same lawyers that structured this deal will have already quietly extricated Meta from liability.</p><p>The contract terms include:</p><ul><li><p>A minimum rent floor engineered to produce a DSCR of 1.12 in a spreadsheet where 1.12 was likely hard-coded and independent of math.</p></li><li><p>A four-year initial term with four four-year renewal options, theoretically creating a 20-year runway Meta pretends not to see.</p></li><li><p>Meta guarantees all tenant payment obligations across the entire potential lease life, including renewals it strategically refuses to acknowledge as inevitable.</p></li><li><p>No performance-based KPIs. Under this structure, the buildings could underperform, overperform, or catch fire. Meta still pays rent.</p></li><li><p>The RVG requires Meta to ensure that, at every potential lease-termination date, the asset is worth at least the guaranteed minimum value. If markets disagree, Meta pays the difference. Because Meta is rated AA-/Stable, we are instructed to assume that it will do so without hesitation, including in scenarios where demand softens or secondary markets discover that a hyperscale campus in Richland Parish is not the world’s most liquid asset class.</p></li></ul><p>The interplay between the lease term and the RVG creates a circular logic we find structurally exquisite.</p><p>From a credit perspective, this circularity is considered supportive, because the same logic used to avoid consolidating the debt also ensures bondholders are paid. The circularity is not treated as a feature or a flaw. It is treated as accounting.</p><p>Because Meta is AA-/Stable, we assume it will pay whatever number the Excel model finds through Goal Seek, even in scenarios involving technological obsolescence or an invasion of raccoons.</p><p>The accounting hinges on a paradox engineered with dull tweezers:</p><ul><li><p>Under lease accounting, Meta must record future lease obligations only if renewals are reasonably certain.</p></li><li><p>Under RVG accounting, Meta must record a guarantee liability only if payment is probable.</p></li></ul><p>To keep $27 billion off its balance sheet, Meta must therefore assert:</p><ul><li><p>Renewals are not reasonably certain, despite designing, funding, building, and exclusively using a 2.064 GW AI campus for which the realistic tenant list begins and ends with Meta.</p></li><li><p>The RVG will probably never be triggered, despite the fact that not renewing would trigger it immediately.</p></li></ul><p>This requires a narrow corridor of assumptions in which Meta simultaneously plans to use the facility for two decades and insists that no one can predict four years of corporate intention.</p><p>From a credit standpoint, we are supportive. The assumptions that render the debt invisible are precisely what make it secure. A harmony best described as collateralized cognitive dissonance.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Meta linkage.</strong><span> The economics are wedded to Meta’s credit profile, which we are required to describe as AA-/Stable rather than “the only reason this entire structure doesn’t fold from a stiff breeze.” Meta guarantees the rent, the RVG, and the continued relevance of the facility. The rest is décor auditors would deem “tasteful.”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimum rent floor.</strong><span> The lease schedule produces a perfectly flat DSCR of 1.12 through 2049. Projects of this size do not produce flat anything, but the model insists otherwise, so we pretend we believe it. Being sticklers for tradition, and having learned nothing from the financial crisis of 2008, we treat the spreadsheet as the final arbiter of truth, even when the inputs describe a world no one lives in.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Construction risk transfer.</strong><span> Meta absorbs cost overruns beyond 105 percent of budget and handles casualty repairs during construction. Our methodology interprets “contractually transferred” as “ceased to exist,” so we decline to model the risk of overruns on a $28 billion campus built in a hurricane corridor. This is considered best practice.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>RVG backstop.</strong><span> The residual value guarantee eliminates tail risk in much the same way a parent cosigning for their teenager’s car loan eliminates tail risk: by ensuring that the person with all the money pays for everything. If the market value collapses, Meta pays the difference. If the facility can’t be sold, Meta pays the whole thing. If the entire campus becomes a raccoon sanctuary, Meta still pays. We classify this as credit protection, a nuanced designation that allows us to recognize the security of the arrangement without recognizing the debt.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Absence of performance KPIs. </strong><span>There are no operational KPIs that allow rent abatement. This is helpful because KPIs create volatility, and volatility requires thought, a variable we explicitly exclude from our methodology. By removing KPIs entirely, the structure ensures a level of cash-flow stability that exists only in transactions where the tenant is also the economic owner pretending to be a squatter.</span></p></li></ul><p>The rating also reflects several risks that are acknowledged, intellectually troubling, and ultimately tolerated because Meta is large enough that everyone agrees to stop asking questions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Off-balance-sheet dependence. </strong><span>Meta treats JVCo as if it belongs to someone else, which is a generous interpretation of ownership. If consolidation rules ever evolve to reflect economic substance, Meta could be required to add $27 billion of assets and matching debt back onto its own balance sheet. Our methodology treats this as a theoretical inconvenience rather than a credit event, because calling it what it really is would create a conflict with the very companies we rate.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concentration risk. </strong><span>The entire project exists for one tenant with one business model in one industry undergoing technological whiplash. The facility is engineered so specifically for Meta’s AI ambitions that the only plausible alternative tenant is another version of Meta from a parallel timeline. We strongly disagree with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. We set this concern aside because at this stage in the transaction, the A+ rating is a structural load-bearing wall, and we are not paid to do demolition.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Residual value uncertainty. </strong><span>The RVG depends on modeled guaranteed minimum values that assume buyers will one day desire a vast hyperscale complex in Richland Parish under stress scenarios. If hyperscale supply balloons or the resale market for 2-gigawatt data centers becomes as illiquid as common sense, Meta will owe more money. This increases Meta’s direct obligations, which should concern us, but does not, because Meta is rated AA-/Stable and therefore presumed to withstand any scenario we have chosen not to model.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Casualty and force majeure. </strong><span>In extreme scenarios, multiple buildings could be destroyed by a hurricane, which we view as unlikely given that they almost never impact Louisiana. The logic resembles a Rube Goldberg machine built out of indemnities. We classify this as a strength.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>JV structural subordination. </strong><span>Cash flows must navigate waterfalls, covenants, carve-outs, and the possibility of up to $75 million of JV-level debt. These features introduce structural complexity, which we flag, then promptly ignore, because acknowledging would force us to explain who benefits from the convolution.</span></p></li></ul><p>Despite these risks, we maintain an A+ rating because Meta’s credit quality is strong, the structure is designed to hide risk rather than transfer it, and our role in this ecosystem is to observe these contradictions and proceed as though they were features rather than warnings.</p><p>The outlook is Superficially Stable. That means we expect the structure to hold together as long as Meta keeps paying for everything and the accounting rules remain generously uninterested in economic reality.</p><p>We assume, with the confidence of people who have clearly not been punished enough:</p><ul><li><p>Meta will preserve an AA-/Stable profile because any other outcome would force everyone involved to admit what this actually is.</p></li><li><p>Construction will stay “broadly on schedule,” a phrase we use to pre-forgive whatever happens as long as Meta covers the overruns, which it must.</p></li><li><p>Lease payments and the minimum rent schedule will continue producing a DSCR that hovers around 1.12 in models designed to ensure that result, and not materially below 1.10 unless something un-modeled happens, which we classify as “outside scope.”</p></li><li><p>The RVG will remain enforceable, which matters more than the resale value of a hyperscale facility in a world where hyperscale facilities may or may not be worth anything.</p></li><li><p>Changes in VIE or lease-accounting guidance will affect where Meta stores the debt, not whether Meta pays it.</p></li></ul><p>We could lower the rating if Meta were downgraded, if DSCR sagged below the range we pretend is acceptable, if Meta weakened its guarantees, or if events unfold in ways our assumptions did not account for, as events tend to do. The last category includes anything that would force us to revisit the assumptions we confidently made without testing.</p><p>We view an upgrade as unlikely. The structure already performs the single miracle it was designed for: keeping $27.3 billion off Meta’s balance sheet in a manner we are professionally obligated to support.</p><p><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AND USE:</strong><span> This report is intended solely for institutional investors, entities required by compliance to review documents they will not read, and any regulatory body still pretending to monitor off-balance-sheet arrangements.

<a name="tmpdir" href="https://blog.plover.com/tech/tmpdir.html">Don't tug on that, you never know what it might be attached to</a>
<br>
</p><p>This is a story about a very interesting bug that I tracked down
yesterday.  It was causing a bad effect very far from where the bug
actually was.</p>

<h3>emacsclient</h3>

<p>The <code>emacs</code> text editor comes with a separate utility, called
<code>emacsclient</code>, which can communicate with the main editor process and
tell it to open files for editing.  You have your main <code>emacs</code>
running. Then somewhere else you run the command</p>

<pre><code>     emacsclient some-files...
</code></pre>

<p>and it sends the main <code>emacs</code>  a message that you want to edit
<code>some-files</code>.  Emacs gets the message and pops up new windows for editing
those files.  When you're done editing <code>some-files</code> you tell Emacs, by
typing <code>C-#</code> or something, it
it communicates back to <code>emacsclient</code> that the editing is done, and
<code>emacsclient</code> exits.</p>

<p>This was more important in the olden days when Emacs was big and
bloated and took a long time to start up.  (They used to joke that
“Emacs” was an abbreviation for “Eight Megs And Constantly Swapping”.
Eight megs!)  But even today it's still useful, say from shell scripts
that need to run an editor.</p>

<p>Here's the reason I was running it.  I have a very nice shell script,
called <code>also</code>, that does something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interpret command-line arguments as patterns</li>
<li>Find files matching those patterns</li>
<li>Present a menu of the files</li>
<li>Wait for me to select files of interest</li>
<li>Run <code>emacsclient</code> on the selected files</li>
</ul>

<p>It is essentially a wrapper around
<a href="https://github.com/mjdominus/util/blob/master/bin/menupick"><code>menupick</code></a>,
a menu-picking utility I wrote which has seen use as a component of
several other tools.
I can type </p>

<pre><code>    also Wizard
</code></pre>

<p>in the shell and get a menu of the files related to the wizard, select
the ones I actually want to edit, and they show up in Emacs.  This is
more convenient than using Emacs itself to find and open them. I use
it many times a day.</p>

<p>Or rather, I did until this week, when it suddenly stopped working.
Everything ran fine until the execution of <code>emacsclient</code>, which would
fail, saying:</p>

<pre><code> emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?
</code></pre>

<p>(A socket is a facility that enables interprocess communication, in
this case between <code>emacs</code> and <code>emacsclient</code>.)</p>

<p>This message is familiar.  It usually means that I have forgotten to
tell Emacs to start listening for <code>emacsclient</code>, by running <code>M-x
server-start</code>.  (I should have Emacs do this when it starts up, but I
don't.  Why not?  I'm not sure.) So the first time it happened I went
to Emacs and ran <code>M-x server-start</code>.  Emacs announced that it had
started the server, so I reran <code>also</code>.  And the same thing happened.</p>

<pre><code> emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?
</code></pre>

<h3>Finding the socket</h3>

<p>So the first question is: why can't <code>emacsclient</code> find the socket?
And this resolves naturally into two subquestions: where is the
socket, and where is <code>emacsclient</code> looking?</p>

<p>The second one is easily answered; I ran <code>strace emacsclient</code> (hi
Julia!) and saw that the last interesting thing <code>emacsclient</code> did
before emitting the error message was</p>

<pre><code>    stat("/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/server", 0x7ffd90ec4d40) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
</code></pre>

<p>which means it's looking for the socket at <code>/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/server</code>
but didn't find it there.</p>

<p>The question of where Emacs actually put the socket file was a little
trickier. I did not run Emacs under <code>strace</code> because I felt sure that
the output would be voluminous and it would be tedious to grovel over
it.</p>

<p>I don't exactly remember now how I figured this out, but I think now
that I probably made an educated guess, something like: <code>emacsclient</code>
is looking in <code>/mnt/tmp</code>; this seems unusual.  I would expect the
socket to be under <code>/tmp</code>.  Maybe it <em>is</em> under <code>/tmp</code>?  So I looked
under <code>/tmp</code> and there it was, in <code>/tmp/emacs2017/server</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    srwx------ 1 mjd mjd 0 Jun 27 11:43 /tmp/emacs2017/server
</code></pre>

<p>(The <code>s</code> at the beginning there means that the file is a “Unix-domain
socket”.  A socket is an endpoint for interprocess communication.  The
most familiar sort is a TCP socket, which has a TCP address, and which
enables communication over the internet.  But since ancient times Unix
has also supported Unix-domain sockets, which enable communication
between two processes on the same machine.  Instead of TCP addresses,
such sockets are addressed using paths in the filesystem, in this case
<code>/tmp/emacs2017/server</code>.  When the server creates such a socket, it
appears in the filesystem as a special type of file, as here.)</p>

<p>I confirmed that this was the correct file by typing <code>M-x
server-force-delete</code> in Emacs; this immediately caused
<code>/tmp/emacs2017/server</code> to disappear.  Similarly <code>M-x server-start</code>
made it reappear.</p>

<h3>Why the disagreement?</h3>

<p>Now the question is: Why is <code>emacsclient</code> looking for the socket under
<code>/mnt/tmp</code> when Emacs is putting it in <code>/tmp</code>?  They used to
rendezvous properly; what has gone wrong?  I recalled that there was
some environment variable for controlling where temporary files are
put, so I did</p>

<pre><code>       env | grep mnt
</code></pre>

<p>to see if anything relevant turned up.  And sure enough there was:</p>

<pre><code>       TMPDIR=/mnt/tmp
</code></pre>

<p>When programs want to create tmporary<!-- this typo is too good to
correct --> files and directories, they normally do it in <code>/tmp</code>.  But
if there is a <code>TMPDIR</code> setting, they use that directory instead.  This
explained why <code>emacsclient</code> was looking for
<code>/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/socket</code>.  And the explanation for why Emacs itself
was creating the socket in <code>/tmp</code> seemed clear: Emacs was failing to
honor the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting.</p>

<p>With this clear explanation in hand, I began to report the bug in
Emacs, using <code>M-x report-emacs-bug</code>. (The folks in the <code>#emacs</code> IRC
channel on Freenode suggested this.  <a href="https://blog.plover.com/prog/elisp.html">I had a bad
experience</a> last time I tried
<code>#emacs</code>, and then people mocked me for even <em>trying</em> to get useful
information out of IRC.  But this time it went pretty well.)</p>

<p>Emacs popped up a buffer with full version information and invited me
to write down the steps to reproduce the problem.  So I wrote down</p>

<pre><code>     % export TMPDIR=/mnt/tmp
     % emacs
</code></pre>

<p>and as I did that I ran those commands in the shell.</p>

<p>Then I wrote</p>

<pre><code>     In Emacs:
     M-x getenv TMPDIR
     (emacs claims there is no such variable)
</code></pre>

<p>and I did that in Emacs also.  But instead of claiming there was no
such variable, Emacs cheerfully informed me that the value of <code>TMPDIR</code>
was <code>/mnt/tmp</code>.</p>

<p>(There is an important lesson here!  To submit a bug report, you find
a minimal demonstration.  But then you also <em>try</em> the minimal
demonstration exactly as you reported it.  Because of what just
happened!  Had I sent off that bug report, I would have wasted
everyone else's time, and even worse, I would have looked like a
fool.)</p>

<p>My minimal demonstration did not demonstrate.  Something else was
going on.</p>

<h3>Why no <code>TMPDIR</code>?</h3>

<p>This was a head-scratcher.  All I could think of was that
<code>emacsclient</code> and Emacs were somehow getting different environments,
one with the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting and one without.  Maybe I had run them
from different shells, and only one of the shells had the setting?</p>

<p>I got on a sidetrack at this point to find out why <code>TMPDIR</code> was set in
the first place; I didn't think I had set it. I looked for it in
<code>/etc/profile</code>, which is the default Bash startup instructions, but it
wasn't there.  But I also noticed an <code>/etc/profile.d</code> which seemed
relevant.  (I saw later that the <code>/etc/profile</code> contained instructions
to load everything under <code>/etc/profile.d</code>.)  And when I grepped for
<code>TMPDIR</code> in the <code>profile.d</code> files, I found that it was being set by
<code>/etc/profile.d/ziprecruiter_environment.sh</code>, which the sysadmins had
installed.  So that mystery at least was cleared up.</p>

<p>That got me on a second sidetrack, looking through our Git history for
recent changes involving <code>TMPDIR</code>.  There weren't any, so that was a
dead end.</p>

<p>I was still puzzled about why Emacs sometimes got the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting
and sometimes not.  That's when I realized that my original Emacs
process, the one that had failed to rendezvous with <code>emacsclient</code>,
had not been started in the usual way.  Instead of simply running
<code>emacs</code>, I had run</p>

<pre><code>    git re-edit
</code></pre>

<p>which invokes Git, which then runs</p>

<pre><code>    /home/mjd/bin/git-re-edit
</code></pre>

<p>which is a Perl program I wrote that does a bunch of stuff to figure
out which files I was editing recently and then execs <code>emacs</code> to edit
them some more.  So there are several programs here that could be
tampering with the environment and removing the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting.</p>

<p>To more accurately point the finger of blame, I put some diagnostics
into the <code>git-re-edit</code> program to have it print out the value of
<code>TMPDIR</code>.  Indeed, <code>git-re-edit</code> reported that <code>TMPDIR</code> was unset.
Clearly, the culprit was Git, which must have been removing <code>TMPDIR</code>
from the environment before invoking my Perl program.</p>

<h3>Who is stripping the environment?</h3>

<p>To confirm this conclusion, I created a tiny shell script,
<code>/home/mjd/bin/git-env</code>, which simply printed out the environment, and
then I ran <code>git env</code>, which tells Git to find <code>git-env</code> and run it.
If the environment it printed were to omit <code>TMPDIR</code>, I would know Git
was the culprit.  But <code>TMPDIR</code> <em>was</em> in the output.</p>

<p>So I created a Perl version of <code>git-env</code>, called <code>git-perlenv</code>, which
did the same thing, and I ran it via <code>git perlenv</code>.  And this time
<code>TMPDIR</code> was <em>not</em> in the output. I ran diff on the outputs of <code>git
env</code> and <code>git perlenv</code> and they were identical—except that <code>git
perlenv</code> was missing <code>TMPDIR</code>.</p>

<p>So it was <em>Perl's</em> fault!  And I verified this by running <code>perl
/home/mjd/bin/git-re-edit</code> directly, without involving Git at all.
The diagnostics I had put in reported that <code>TMPDIR</code> was unset.</p>

<h3>WTF Perl?</h3>

<p>At this point I tried getting rid of <code>get-re-edit</code> itself, and ran the
one-line program</p>

<pre><code>    perl -le 'print $ENV{TMPDIR}'
</code></pre>

<p>which simply runs Perl and tells it to print out the value of the
<code>TMPDIR</code> environment variable. It should print <code>/mnt/tmp</code>, but instead
it printed the empty string.  This is a smoking gun, and Perl no
longer has anywhere to hide.</p>

<p>The mystery is not cleared up, however.  Why was Perl doing this?
Surely not a bug; someone else would have noticed such an obvious bug
sometime in the past 25 years.  And it only failed for <code>TMPDIR</code>, not
for other variables.  For example</p>

<pre><code>    FOO=bar perl -le 'print $ENV{FOO}'
</code></pre>

<p>printed out <code>bar</code> as one would expect.  This was weird: how could
Perl's environment handling be broken for just the <code>TMPDIR</code> variable?</p>

<p>At this point I got Rik Signes and Frew Schmidt to look at it with
me.  They confirmed that the problem was not in Perl generally, but
just in <em>this</em> Perl.  Perl on <em>other</em> systems did not display this
behavior.  </p>

<p>I looked in the output of <code>perl -V</code>, which says what version of Perl
you are using and which patches have been applied, and wasted a lot of
time looking into
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2381">CVE-2016-2381</a>,
which seemed relevant.  But it turned out to be a red herring.</p>

<h3>Working around the problem, 1.</h3>

<p>While all this was going on I was looking for a workaround.  Finding
one is at least as important as actually tracking down the problem
because ultimately I am paid to do something other than figure out why
Perl is losing <code>TMPDIR</code>.  Having a workaround in hand means that when
I get sick and tired of looking into the underlying problem I can
abandon it instantly instead of having to push onward.</p>

<p>The first workaround I found was to not use the Unix-domain socket.
Emacs has an option to use a TCP socket instead, which is useful on
systems that do not support Unix-domain sockets, such as non-Unix
systems.  (I am told that some do still exist.)</p>

<p>You set the <code>server-use-tcp</code> variable to a true value, and when you
start the server, Emacs creates a TCP socket and writes a description
of it into a “server file”, usually <code>~/.emacs.d/server/server</code>.  Then
when you run <code>emacsclient</code> you  tell it to connect to the socket that
is described in the file, with</p>

<pre><code>    emacsclient --server-file=~/.emacs.d/server/server
</code></pre>

<p>or by setting the <code>EMACS_SERVER_FILE</code> environment variable. I tried
this, and it worked, once I figured out the thing about
<code>server-use-tcp</code> and what a “server file” was.  (I had misunderstood
at first, and thought that “server file” meant the Unix-domain socket
itself, and I tried to get <code>emacsclient</code> to use the right one by
setting <code>EMACS_SERVER_FILE</code>, which didn't work at all.  The resulting
error message was obscure enough to lead me to IRC to ask about it.)</p>

<h3>Working around the problem, 2.</h3>

<p>I spent quite a while looking for an environment variable analogous to
<code>EMACS_SERVER_FILE</code> to tell <code>emacsclient</code> where the Unix-domain socket
was.  But while there is a <code>--socket-name</code> command-line argument to
control this, there is inexplicably no environment variable.  I hacked
my <code>also</code> command (responsible for running <code>emacsclient</code>) to look for
an environment variable named <code>EMACS_SERVER_SOCKET</code>, and to pass its
value to <code>emacsclient --socket-name</code> if there was one.  (It probably
would have been better to write a wrapper for <code>emacsclient</code>, but I
didn't.)  Then I put</p>

<pre><code>    EMACS_SERVER_SOCKET=$TMPDIR/emacs$(id -u)/server
</code></pre>

<p>in my Bash profile, which effectively solved the problem.  This set
<code>EMACS_SERVER_SOCKET</code> to <code>/mnt/tmp/emacs2017/server</code> whenever I
started a new shell.  When I ran <code>also</code> it would notice the setting
and pass it along to <code>emacsclient</code> with <code>--socket-name</code>, to tell
<code>emacsclient</code> to look in the right place.  Having set this up I could
forget all about the original problem if I wanted to.</p>

<h3>But but but WHY?</h3>

<p>But why was Perl removing <code>TMPDIR</code> from the environment?  I didn't
figure out the answer to this; Frew took it to the <code>#p5p</code> IRC channel
on <code>perl.org</code>, where the answer was eventually tracked down by Matthew
Horsfall and Zefrem.</p>

<p>The answer turned out to be quite subtle.  One of the classic attacks
that can be mounted against a process with elevated privileges is as
follows.  Suppose you know that the program is going to write to a
temporary file.  So you set <code>TMPDIR</code> beforehand and trick it into
writing in the wrong place, possibly overwriting or destroying
something important.</p>

<p>When a program is loaded into a process, the dynamic loader does the
loading.  To protect against this attack, the loader checks to see if
the program it is going to run has elevated privileges, say because it
is setuid, and if so it sanitizes the process’ environment to prevent
the attack.  Among other things, it removes <code>TMPDIR</code> from the
environment.</p>

<p>I hadn't thought of exactly this, but I had thought of something like
it:  If <em>Perl</em> detects that it is running setuid, it enables 
a secure mode which, among other things, sanitizes the environment.
For example, it ignores the <code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable that
normally tells it where to look for loadable modules, and instead
loads modules only from a few compiled-in trustworthy directories.  I
had checked early on to see if this was causing the <code>TMPDIR</code> problem,
but the <code>perl</code> executable was not setuid and Perl was not running in
secure mode.</p>

<p>But Linux supports a feature called “capabilities”, which is a sort of
partial superuser privilege.  You can give a program <em>some</em> of the
superuser's capabilities without giving away the keys to the whole
kingdom.  Our systems were configured to give <code>perl</code> one extra
capability, of binding to low-numbered TCP ports, which is normally
permitted only to the superuser.  And when the dynamic loader ran
<code>perl</code>, it saw this additional capability and removed <code>TMPDIR</code> from
the environment for safety.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why Emacs had the <code>TMPDIR</code> setting when run from the command
  line, but not when run via <code>git-re-edit</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until this came up, I had not even been aware that the “capabilities”
feature existed.</p>

<h3>A red herring</h3>

<p>There was one more delightful confusion on the way to this happy
ending.  When Frew found out that it was just the Perl on my
development machine that was misbehaving, he tried logging into his
own, nearly identical development machine to see if it misbehaved in
the same way.  It did, but when he ran a system update to update Perl,
the problem went away.  He told me this would fix the problem on my
machine.  But I reported that I had updated my system a few hours
before, so there was nothing to update!</p>

<p>The elevated capabilities theory explained this also.  When Frew
updated his system, the new Perl was installed without the elevated
capability feature, so the dynamic loader did not remove <code>TMPDIR</code> from
the environment.  </p>

<p>When I had updated my system earlier, the same thing happened.  But
as soon as the update was complete, I reloaded my system configuration, which
reinstated the capability setting.  Frew hadn't done this.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>The system configuration gave <code>perl</code> a special capability</li>
<li>so the dynamic loader sanitized its environment</li>
<li>so that when <code>perl</code> ran <code>emacs</code>,</li>
<li>the Emacs process didn't have the <code>TMPDIR</code> environment setting</li>
<li>which caused  Emacs to create its listening socket in the usual place</li>
<li>but because <code>emacsclient</code> <em>did</em> get the setting, it looked in the <em>wrong</em> place</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This computer stuff is amazingly complicated.  I don't know how anyone
gets anything done.</p>

      <p>The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court <span>suddenly couldn't access his email. According to Microsoft, that's because of US </span><a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2025/11/04/internationaal-strafhof-dumpt-microsoft-en-kiest-voor-europees-alternatief-a4911821"><span>sanctions</span></a><span> against the court's employees. </span>The Trump administration was not amused by the Court's arrest warrant against the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.</p><p>The main takeaway from this episode is that those looking to protect themselves from Trump's wrath would be wise not to depend on any companies from his country. According to the Dutch newspaper <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2025/11/04/internationaal-strafhof-dumpt-microsoft-en-kiest-voor-europees-alternatief-a4911821">NRC</a>, the International Criminal Court now uses a German alternative to Microsoft, though it has not officially commented on the switch.</p><p>The German alternative, OpenDesk, allows users to send emails, edit text-based documents, create presentations, share files, and make video calls. It is open source, so anyone can view and improve its code.</p><p>The same applies to another alternative, also from Germany, called Nextcloud. This office software has been tested by around 75 researchers from five Dutch universities since the beginning of 2025. Maybe other institutions could switch to it as well?</p><p><strong>Dependency</strong><br>Dutch higher education is highly dependent on American tech companies, especially Microsoft. Not only do students and staff use its software extensively, but their IT staff are tied to a wide range of specialised Microsoft software. In addition, Dutch universities store a lot of data in Microsoft's cloud.</p><p>Dutch lecturers have been sounding the alarm about this. Last Wednesday, the knowledge centre for practice-oriented research, DCC-PO, <a href="https://dcc-po.nl/publicaties/position-statement-digitale-soevereiniteit/">stated</a> that the dominance of parties such as Google and Microsoft threatens the autonomy of Dutch researchers. In their view, universities should adopt more open-source tools and open standards.</p><p>In July, the Young Academy also <a href="https://dub.uu.nl/en/news/young-academy-sounds-alarm-about-power-big-tech">warned</a> that students and staff at Dutch higher education institutions have no idea what tech companies are doing with their data. By outsourcing the management of IT systems, these educational institutions are losing technical knowledge and control. As a result, they are becoming increasingly dependent on big tech, putting academic freedom and independence at risk.</p><p><strong>Fickle</strong><br>Seven Dutch universities and one university college are already on the State of Florida's <a href="https://dub.uu.nl/en/news/utrecht-university-blacklisted-florida-pension-fund">sanctions list</a> for severing or freezing ties with Israeli institutions. With a fickle president like Donald Trump, educational institutions could also face “punishment” at any moment.</p><p>Can they do without Microsoft, however? Can they work without Office, Outlook, Teams and OneDrive? Not yet, according to UU professors José van Dijck and Albert Meijer. "All research and education would come to an immediate standstill," <a href="https://dub.uu.nl/en/news/professors-concerned-about-uus-dependence-big-tech">they wrote in March</a> in an open letter calling on the Executive Board to do something about digital dependence.</p><p>According to the professors, Utrecht University is particularly dependent on Microsoft Office 365. UU staff and students use the programme for email and video calls, writing and sharing documents, creating presentations and data storage, among other tasks. Such dependence makes for "vulnerabilities, especially in light of a rapidly changing geopolitical situation".</p><p>Meijer and Van Dijck believe that "dependence on big tech is fundamentally at odds with public values such as freedom, independence, autonomy and equality". The professors would like the Executive Board to invest more in "local expertise," for example, by using its own mail server. They also recommend collaborating with other European universities, especially those in Germany and France, "on an autonomous academic IT infrastructure".</p><p><strong>Breaking free</strong><br>It is becoming increasingly clear that dependence on big tech entails risks. This also applies to Dutch higher education, according to Wladimir Mufty, from SURF, the IT cooperative of Dutch education and research institutions. "We have already gone through an awareness phase that lasted several years. We have looked at where the dependencies lie, and now it is time to start trying out alternatives."</p><p>Mufty is SURF's digital sovereignty programme manager. At the end of last year, he sat down with five universities that wanted a single, shared digital environment for their research programme, AlgoSoc. Scientists from Delft, Utrecht, Rotterdam, Tilburg and Amsterdam (UvA) wanted to use the same appointment planner, share files, work together on a single text, and make video calls, without being dependent on a large provider. Mufty suggested the open source software package from Nextcloud.</p><p>One of the users, PhD student Jacqueline Kernahan from TU Delft, thinks that Nextcloud could compete with Microsoft, though there are still a few glitches here and there. She is not deterred by those, as she knows how problematic dependence on Microsoft is.</p><p>She demonstrates the software in the hall of her faculty in Delft. It looks very ordinary. "The word processor is quite good," says Kernahan, who is doing her PhD on quality and security controls in digital systems. "I'm an average user, so I don't need all the options and apps the programme has to offer. But, to be honest, Microsoft is making it increasingly attractive to switch. Now that the company is putting AI in everything, everything is becoming more annoying to use."</p><p>Nevertheless, Mufty believes that not all educational institutions will be able to switch to OpenDesk or Nextcloud overnight. "The Criminal Court now has to act quickly, under pressure, but if a university wanted to move away from Microsoft tomorrow, that would pose a problem."</p><p><strong>Entanglement</strong><br>Meanwhile, Microsoft is taking on more and more tasks. In addition to office software, it also develops artificial intelligence, builds its own data centres and even lays its own internet cables on the seabed. The company is “vertically integrated”, as specialists call it: everything can be done through one company, from basic technology to the end user.</p><p>And that's not all. Microsoft is also expanding “horizontally” by acquiring companies where content is the primary focus, rather than technology. "That's a new phase, which I find worrying," says Mufty. For example, Microsoft bought LinkedIn, with its hundreds of millions of active users who produce enormous amounts of data, and GitHub, where software developers can share and store their work.</p><p>SURF is keeping a close eye on these developments. "I would like our education to remain public and be able to pursue public values such as autonomy, independence and academic freedom. IT should be helpful, not controlling," says Mufty.</p><p>He views the collaboration between Microsoft and Sanoma with suspicion. The Finnish publisher, which also serves the Dutch education market through its Malmberg subsidiary, wants to make its teaching materials available via Microsoft Teams. Microsoft would then add its own “learning accelerators”, i.e. artificial intelligence designed to help personalise the learning process. “Things like this sometimes keep me awake at night,” sighs Mufty.</p><p><strong>Alternatives</strong><br>Dutch and European alternatives do exist. For example, research institute TNO is working with SURF and the Netherlands Forensic Institute on its own AI language model. There are also dedicated data centres.</p><p>Additionally, SURFConext is making headway with a secure login service. "But that's not enough. If logging in via Microsoft doesn't work in the future for whatever reason, we'll have a big problem. This also applies to applications that are not from Microsoft itself," explains Mufty.</p><p>In his view, we need serious alternatives. When the need arises, one shouldn't have to start from scratch. Moreover, competition ensures that the market leader cannot charge top dollar.</p><p>But which educational institution is willing to sacrifice itself to run those alternatives, with all the teething problems that entails, when Microsoft can deliver everything ready-made? Mufty believes that, especially in the beginning, educational institutions will have to run two systems in parallel, with additional expenditure on support, maintenance, and security. "But in my opinion, no sector is as value-driven as education and research. This is precisely where alternatives should be able to get off the ground."</p><p><strong>Rectors</strong><br>In 2019, the rectors of fourteen universities jointly published a compelling argument about the digital independence of Dutch higher education. The gist was that we risk losing control to Google and Microsoft.</p><p>Little has improved since then, according to Jacquelien Scherpen, Rector of the University of Groningen. "The coronavirus pandemic broke out just a few months after that article was published. We became even more dependent on big tech, because we didn't have time to look for alternatives." Microsoft Teams has become indispensable, for example.</p><p>Scherpen is the portfolio holder for digital sovereignty within UNL, the umbrella association for Dutch universities. She advocates taking small steps: "If we now choose an alternative product that functions less well, students and staff will start using free programmes, and we will be further away from our goal."</p><p>Moreover, Scherpen says that we need legislation to protect European alternatives from big tech. Suppose a university partners up with a European competitor of Microsoft, and then Microsoft buys that company, what is the university to do then?</p><p>That is not a theoretical scenario. She mentions the Dutch software company Solvinity, which is involved with government services such as DigiD and provides secure communication for the Ministry of Justice. An American company now wants to take it over.</p><p>Scherpen: "Perhaps we need to become more protectionist, without hindering the free exchange of new insights and innovations. We must ensure that the independence we are fighting for does not slip out of our hands again."</p>
