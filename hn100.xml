  <p id="TFcc8B"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> is a game about infinity. It’s not just about having infinite things to do, which is how games often express themselves. It’s a game about being an inhabitant of an infinite universe, an infinitely tiny speck among the stars.</p>
<p id="gMFGZ6"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony">At launch, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> was almost lonely</a>, as you moved from one planet to the next in a solitary adventure despite the universe being shared, supposedly, with all of the rest of the players. After an intense cycle of hype and marketing, many players were disappointed to find that their “forever game” felt much smaller than they expected. Other than scanning plants and animals and discovering new planets, there wasn’t much to <em>do</em>.</p>
<p id="F8KOKm">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/no-mans-sky/35726"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> of today</a> is nigh unrecognizable compared to the sparse game it was when it launched. The game still boasts the distinctive art direction that initially made it look so appealing — basically any planet you visit looks like the cover of a 1970s science fiction novel. But now the universe is a busy, almost cluttered place. As I play, I get the sense that I will basically never run out of things to do. My base can always be bigger or more beautiful; my small fleet of ships and freighters can only grow; there is always technology to add or upgrade to make my travels run a bit more smoothly. The universe is also very full — everywhere you go is full of life, in the form of alien plants or animals, or aliens on the space waystations in each galaxy, or even other players who can join you in special missions.</p>

<p id="LNkPkv">While I was partial to the emptiness of the original version, the game in its current state is simply a lot more inviting, especially the animals. On the planet where I made my first base in my current save, there were roving bands of creatures that looked like miniature T. rexes with bioluminescence on the backs of their necks. I gave one some Creature Pellets (which I crafted from resources in my surroundings) and they became my animal companion. I can even ride them around, which was useful before I had any exocraft — land vehicles — unlocked.</p>

<p id="5kpOyH">This isn’t to say that <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is some kind of wholly unique experience. If I were particularly cynical, I’d describe it as a science fiction take on <em>Minecraft</em>, because mining and crafting make up the bulk of its activities. You want more fuel for your spaceship? Mine some dihydrogen and craft some launch fuel. Want new parts for your base? Mine some carbon and ferrite dust and then craft them. Want to make your mining multitool more efficient? Most technology requires you to mine and craft something before it can be fully installed. What <em>No Man’s Sky </em>also shares with <em>Minecraft</em> is that it’s largely self-directed. While there are tons of quests, there’s no real urgency behind any of them. If you’d rather ignore them all and just warp out into the unknown universe, there is nothing stopping you. The only things you lose by not following these missions are the free technology and a bit of tutorializing, but maybe you prefer that kind of challenge.</p>
<p id="9jNaRw">While all of these self-directed tasks are on offer, you can also set out to join the constant motion of the universe. Once, spawning into a new galaxy, I got a call for help from a nearby freighter. I’d done this mission before and knew that once I defeated all the enemy ships, the freighter would offer me either a cash reward or ask me to be the new captain of their ship. I gladly accepted the freighter as part of my fleet, and added a science terminal and overseer, which allowed me to finally unlock exocraft. A few galaxies later, another freighter sent me a message — they wanted to join my fleet, for a price. I didn’t have the cash and had to turn them down. After another few warps, I got another incoming message, this time from a single wrecked ship, a recording telling me to “not believe their lies,” with coordinates to a distant galaxy attached. I can investigate, if I want to, or move on and let these characters fend for themselves. But each new warp, each new planet, each new call from a strange signal is another chance to explore the unknown of the universe — and as you keep exploring, you only find how much of this universe is still unknown. </p>

<p id="2O2rWs"><em>No Man’s Sky</em> might be busier, but it’s also never been easier to wrap your head around. While there are a lot of systems built on top of systems, they mostly work in concert with each other. Having a base allows you to follow a quest line that unlocks new technologies from the base computer, which makes exploration easier, which gives you access to better resources, which allows you to craft better technologies, and so on. There are sometimes conflicts between quests that were added later, but the game leans in favor of giving the player <em>more</em>. If two different quests require you to install a personal forcefield, they’ll both give you the upgrade you need, and it only needs to be installed once to be valid for each quest. Once, I could see the game getting confused because I had hired an overseer to work on my freighter instead of my base, and the mission text kept instructing me to return to my base when I needed to go to space. No matter — I could still fulfill everything I needed to do to move on. </p>

<p id="WBERUA">One of the biggest improvements is spaceflight, and especially battles in space. By holding down the left trigger you can now lock on to enemy ships, something that wasn’t available at launch. Actually hitting something has never been easier; in fact, I’ve actually won some space fights where in the past I’d either be exploded by pirates or forced to run away. There appears to be some changes to how the spaceships handle, or maybe I just notice them more now that flying in space feels like less of a chore. One thing that always tickles me is that whenever I brake hard in space, my ship starts going backward. In a game with whispering eggs and laser guns, this little bit of real-world physicality is grounding.</p>
<p id="B0Xy4i">Despite how different the game feels, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has retained its specificity. While it has much more of the <em>stuff</em> that fills other games, its best part is still what it launched with: seeing new places. In my absence, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has gotten an abundance of new kinds of places to see. On an airless planet, I watched a meteor shower light up the star-filled sky. On an erupting planet, I dodged between the legs of tall, bipedal creatures in the sweltering heat. On a fractured planet, I found a souvenir — a floating cube that looked like it was made of panes of broken glass. They live in my base now, situated on a hill of a ringed planet overlooking a frigid lake that reflects the sunlight. There may be other views in the universe like mine, but as I build out the base and add new cosmetic items, this one really does feel like it’s <em>mine</em>, my home away from home as I warp across the universe.</p>
<p id="FF6dtT">Whenever I visit the Nexus, the multiplayer hub for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, I am struck by how inconsequential my journey feels. Seeing those other players, many of whom are much farther along in their journeys and know their way around much better than I, shows me how far I have to go. But <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is a game about that exploration, about chasing new experiences, vistas, sunsets. In an infinite universe you’ll never see everything. But there is a joy in discovering just how small you are among the stars. </p>

It’s an unavoidable consequence of trying to fit every letter into a uniform box, when some letters want more space, and some want less.</p><p>These shortcomings have been the same since the heyday of the Teletype machine in the 1960s. Texture Healing is a novel technique that evens out the density of monospaced type, bringing it closer to how proportional type has looked for centuries.</p><p>Texture healing preserves the monospace grid, and works in most editors without needing new software or editor plugins.<!-- --> <span>How does it work?</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>In proportional typefaces, every glyph is designed with a unique width.</span> <!-- -->The design of an <code>m</code> can be wider than the design of an <code>i</code>.

This swapping is powered by an OpenType feature called “contextual alternates,” which is widely supported by both operating systems and browser engines.</span></p><p><span>Contextual alternates are normally used for certain scripts, like Arabic, where the shape of each glyph depends on the surrounding glyphs.

                                        <p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — The Illinois Senate approved <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/illinois-nuclear-reactor-moratorium-7646499fdbed1dadde25c7b475b2e29f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifting a 36-year-old moratorium</a></span> on new nuclear power installments on Wednesday in a plan proponents say will ensure the state can meet its carbon-free power production promise by 2045.</p><p>The Senate’s 44-7 endorsement opens the door for <span><a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10300HB2473sam003&amp;GA=103&amp;SessionId=112&amp;DocTypeId=HB&amp;LegID=147557&amp;DocNum=2473&amp;GAID=17&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge nuclear technology</a></span> in so-called small modular reactors, designed to sit on sites for which they produce power, such as large factories. </p><p>Environmentalists have criticized the plan, noting that small modular reactors are a decade or more from viability. Sponsoring Sen. Sue Rezin, a Republican from Morris, said that’s the reason, coupled with a federal permitting process of as much as eight years, her legislation is timely. </p>
    

<p>“If we want to take advantage of the amazing advancements in new nuclear technology that have occurred over the past couple of decades and not fall behind the rest of the states, we need to act now,” Rezin said. </p>



<p>The House has through Thursday — the scheduled adjournment of the General Assembly’s fall session — to OK the proposal and send it to Gov. J.B. Pritzker. </p>
<p>Under the legislation, Illinois would allow development of small modular reactors in January 2026. That’s when a report on necessary safety measures and updated guidelines would be due. </p><p>The plan also tasks the Illinois Emergency Management Agency with oversight of newly installed reactors. Rezin added that layer of inspection, despite her contention that strict federal control is sufficient, to appease a concerned Pritzker. The Democrat cited the issue as one that caused him to side with environmentalists and veto initial legislation Rezin saw approved overwhelmingly last spring. </p><p>Just over two years ago, Pritzker signed a law requiring the state to use only <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-climate-business-electric-vehicles-illinois-106a47b73989384d09e757b5715b19ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon-free electricity by 2045</a></span>. That means closing numerous coal-fired power plants and investing heavily in wind and solar energy. It also included a $700 million bailout to keep afloat two unprofitable nuclear plants in the state, validating for Rezin and other supporters that nuclear power must remain part of the picture. </p><p>“As we move toward a clean energy future and we start taking certain types of energy offline, we have to have something to replace all those megawatts,” said Sen. Patrick Joyce, a Reddick Democrat. “As technology changes, we need to make sure that we change with it.”</p>

In May at NYU Langone Health in New York City, the surgery was performed on a 46-year-old man who had suffered severe electrical burns to his face, left eye and left arm. He does not yet have vision in the transplanted eye and may never regain it there, but early evidence suggests the eye itself is healthy and may be capable of transmitting neurological signals to the brain.</p>

<p>The feat opens up the possibility of restoring the appearance—and maybe even sight—of people who have been disfigured or blinded by injuries. Researchers caution there are many technical hurdles before such a procedure can effectively treat vision loss, however.</p>

<p>“I think it’s an important proof of principle,” says Jeffrey Goldberg, a professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, who was not involved in the surgery but has been part of a team working toward whole-eye transplants in humans. “I think it points to the opportunity and importance that we really stand on the verge of being able to [achieve] eye transplants and vision restoration for<strong> </strong>blind<strong> </strong>patients more broadly.”<strong> </strong>But he cautions that the main obstacle is achieving regeneration of the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain; this step has not yet been successfully demonstrated in humans.</p>

<p>Face and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/she-has-his-eyes-does-gender-matter-in-cornea-transplants/">cornea transplants</a> have been performed before, yet to the NYU Langone team’s knowledge, this is the first time a whole eye has been transplanted successfully (with or without a face). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420670/">first partial face transplant</a> was performed in 2005 in France. As of 2021, nearly 50 face transplants had been conducted worldwide. In 1969 Texas physician Conard Moore <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038417/">claimed to have attempted the first whole-eye transplant</a> in a human, but it was not successful. Amid criticism, Moore later retracted his claim, saying he had only transplanted the eye’s outer portion—the sclera and cornea. Although a subsequent analysis suggested he may, in fact, have transplanted the whole eye, it did not develop a blood supply.</p>

<p>The recent transplant was performed by Eduardo Rodriguez, director of the face transplant program and chair of the department of plastic surgery at NYU Langone Health, and his colleagues. The recipient was Arkansas-based military veteran Aaron&nbsp;James, whose face touched a live wire while he was working as an electrical lineman in Oklahoma in June 2021. The accident left him with severe burns to the left side of his face, including his left eye, nose and lips, and extensive damage to his left arm, his dominant limb. James was transferred to a hospital in Texas, where he received multiple reconstructive surgeries. His left eye was removed because it was causing pain, and his left arm was amputated above the elbow and fitted with a prosthetic hook. He was in a medical coma for six weeks and he says he doesn’t remember anything from the accident and afterward until he woke up at the hospital.</p>

<p>Two months after the accident, Rodriguez and his colleagues at NYU Langone Health became aware of James’s case. Over the next year they discussed the possibility of a face transplant with Aaron James and his wife, Meagan. The decision was made to transplant the donor’s eye as well, because even if James never regained sight, the organ would help restore his face’s appearance. Like any transplant, there was a chance his immune system would reject the eye—but he would already need to take immunosuppressant medication for the face transplant.</p>

<p>James was added to a transplant waiting list in February 2023, and on Memorial Day weekend in May a donor was identified: a deceased man in his 30s whose family consented to donate his organs. James and his family flew to New York City for the operation, which took place on May 27. The portions of the face that were transplanted included the nose, left eyelids and eyebrow, lips, underlying skull, nasal and chin bones, cheekbones, and all of the muscle and nerve tissue under the right eye. The entire left eye and optic nerve were transplanted, and stem cells from the donor’s bone marrow were transplanted along with them in the hopes of helping the optic nerve regenerate. The surgery itself lasted 21 hours and involved more than 140 people, including doctors, nurses and support staff.</p>

<p>James has since made a good recovery. He is able to talk, and although he does not have much ability to move his lips and facial muscles yet, Rodriguez says he will recover a lot of that ability with time. He can eat food on his own again now, and his wife Meagan says he has a big appetite. James was even able to attend his daughter’s high school graduation, and he says keeping his sense of humor has been critical to his recovery.</p>

</figure>

<p>Rodriguez and the rest of the surgical team are very pleased with James’s recovery. “Everything that we’re seeing so far, no one expected,” he says. “Even if we don’t get sight, I will tell you at this point in time, everything seems incredibly exciting.”</p>

<p>As of six months post-transplantation, James does not yet report any vision in the transplanted eye. But measurements show the eye is receiving good blood flow and is maintaining normal ocular pressure, according to Vaidehi Dedania, an associate professor in the department of ophthalmology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who has been involved in monitoring the health of the donor eye.</p>

<p>“We ensured that the eye from the donor was in excellent health prior to the transplantation,” Dedania says. About nine days post-transplantation, “we were able to see that the blood is pumping through the eye and really getting a good flow and good oxygen to the entire retina through the retinal circulation. And that was really, really remarkable,” she adds.</p>

<p>Cross-sectional imaging of the donated eye’s macula (the central part of the retina) showed it was thinner after the transplant—but this had been expected because the blood supply had been necessarily disrupted, and a fair number of photoreceptors—light-sensitive cells in the retina—were still present, Dedania says. The photoreceptors appear to be responsive to light in preliminary tests. The medical team plans to conduct more rigorous follow-up testing soon to confirm this, however.</p>

<p>“The current studies seem to indicate that there’s the possibility of some communication between the [eye] and the brain,” says Rodriguez, who declined to comment further on preliminary findings that his team has submitted to a journal for publication. “However, we would like to validate that further, with a higher-fidelity piece of equipment by a nationally recognized expert.”</p>

<p>Scientists have been working toward whole-eye transplantation for many years. “This has been, I would say, science fiction for a long time,” says José-Alain Sahel, a professor and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who has been working toward such transplants with Goldberg and others. Progress in surgical techniques and nerve regeneration have made this goal seem more attainable. Although eye transplants have been done <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/eye2016272">in rodents</a> with some success, the animals’ eyes are much smaller and less vascularized than those of humans. Goldberg and his team have done some research on pig eyes, which are more similar to humans’, but optic nerve regeneration remains a challenge.</p>

<p>“The fact that this surgery was successful is wonderful news,” Sahel says. He cautions that surgery is only a small part of the issues that need to be addressed in order to restore eye function, however. These include making sure the immune system doesn’t reject the donor eye, which is a challenge with any type of transplant. Then the corneal nerve—which carries sensory signals from the transparent part of the eye—must be reconnected. Yet the most complex part is regenerating the optic nerve. In order to do so, surgeons have to coax the nerve fibers to grow to the right place, which Sahel says could take months or even years. And complete optic nerve regeneration has not yet been successfully achieved in humans or other mammals.</p>

<p>Even if the optic nerve can regrow, there is the question of whether the brain will be able to interpret the signals from the transplanted eye. The brain has a lot of plasticity, so there is some reason to hope it may be able to adapt to the new input. Until these questions are addressed, “I’m doubtful that you will get a successful transplant in terms of restoring function,” Sahel says, adding, “I’m looking forward to seeing more results in this patient.”</p></div><section><h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</h3><section><p><img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/91556F8B-189C-4F0F-82DC8929AFCD4E55_small.png?h=65&amp;w=65" alt="author-avatar" width="65" height="65"></p><div><ul></ul><p><strong>Tanya Lewis</strong> is a senior editor covering health and medicine at <em>Scientific American</em>.

A similar thing is now haunting OneDrive users on Windows, <em>demanding</em> to answer why they are closing the app. And demanding is a correct word here because Windows will not let you quit OneDrive without answering first.</p>

<p>Here are the options the app lets you pick:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do not want OneDrive running all the time</li>
	<li>I do not know what OneDrive is</li>
	<li>I do not use OneDrive</li>
	<li>I am trying to fix a problem with OneDrive</li>
	<li>I am trying to speed up my computer</li>
	<li>I get too many notifications</li>
	<li>Other</li>
</ul>                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>Sadly, there is no "none of your business, let me quit" option.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472645_onedrive_prompt_1.jpg"><img alt="A prompt asking you to explain your decision to quit OneDrive in Windows 11" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2023/11/1699472645_onedrive_prompt_1_story.jpg"></a></figure><p>The updated "Quit OneDrive" dialog with its poll is just another Microsoft attempt to impose its services, and discovering similar "ads" across Windows and other products takes only a few clicks. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Settings app will prompt you to enable OneDrive backup when changing your Windows background. <em>"</em><em>Back up your Pictures folder to automatically back up your background image."</em>
</li>
	<li>File Explorer shows a flashing backup button in user folders. Tip: close OneDrive to make it disappear.</li>
	<li>
<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-is-now-pushing-ads-and-promos-in-windows-11-start-menu-but-you-can-disable-them/">Backup notifications in the Start menu</a>.</li>
	<li>Backup notifications in Office apps when saving files locally (how could you dare not save your files in OneDrive).</li>
	<li>And multiple notifications from the OneDrive app itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new OneDrive dialog is available in version 23.214.1015.0001 (Stable build). If you want, you can update your OneDrive client by downloading its executable <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download">from the official website</a>. If not, the app will update itself automatically whenever it feels like doing so.</p>

<p>Forcing customers to explain their actions may not look like the deadliest sin, but it does not make user experience any better or more convenient either. Next time, Microsoft might ask you to explain turning off your computer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/">https://corrode.dev/why-rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38207959">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/hero.svg" alt="Why Rust?"></p><p>Interest in Rust has surged in recent years, with tech leaders such as
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon coming forward to share their experiences of
leveraging Rust for critical systems.</p>
<p>Much of the dialogue about Rust, however, is still driven by those who have not
leveraged Rust in a significant production capacity or have only done so for
non-critical systems. This results in a skewed understanding of Rust's
application in production settings, especially for small and medium-sized
businesses, where discussions tend to highlight performance benefits and gloss
over other crucial aspects.</p>
<p>In my role as a Rust consultant, I have had the opportunity to engage with many
companies, both large and small. I found that companies value productivity,
stability, and long-term maintainability over performance.</p>
<p>Much of my Rust consultancy is under NDA, so I use public data and surveys to
back my insights. I'm working with past clients to share more in the future.</p>
<p>This overview distills key insights, offering a resource for businesses to
assess whether Rust is the right tool for their use-case or not.</p>
<p>The intent is to provide an honest look at Rust's practicality for production
to help decision-makers understand its benefits and challenges.</p>
<h2 id="reasons-for-using-rust-in-production">Reasons For Using Rust In Production</h2>
<h3 id="reliability-and-stability">Reliability and Stability</h3>
<p>From experience, the majority of companies care less about uncompromising
performance and more about <a href="https://talks.osfc.io/osfc2021/talk/JTWYEH/">reliability and
stability</a> of their services. More
predictable and stable services are easier to maintain and cheaper to operate.
Less time is spent on debugging and on-call, and more time on building new
features. Scaling services is also easier when you know how systems behave under
load. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given our small team size, infrastructure reliability is crucial, otherwise,
maintenance starves innovation. Rust provides us with confidence that any code
modification or refactor is likely to produce working programs that will run for
months with minimal supervision. - <a href="https://x.ai/">xAI (formerly Twitter)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://deepsource.com/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs">Bugs cost more to fix the later they are found.</a>
Below is the relative cost of fixing bugs at various stages of the development lifecycle.
Bugs found in production are significantly more expensive to fix than bugs found
during development. (Source: NIST <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/director/planning/report02-3.pdf">Costs of Software Defects</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/bug-costs.svg" alt="Cost of fixing bugs over time"></p><p>In a survey, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/07/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">Microsoft found that 70% of their bugs are due to memory safety
issues</a>.
Rust couldn't have prevented all of these bugs, but it would have drastically
reduced the total amount. 
Rust's strong type system and its borrow checker allow you to <a href="https://kerkour.com/bugs-rust-compiler-helps-prevent">catch bugs
earlier in the development lifecycle, typically at compile-time</a> (instead of
runtime as in languages with less stringent type systems or static analysis
capabilities). This results in real cost savings for companies.</p>
<p>As requirements grow, Rust is a great language for building larger applications
that are maintained by a bigger team over a long period of time. This is due to
its strong type system, its focus on memory safety, its powerful tooling (cargo,
rustfmt, clippy, etc.) and its stability guarantees (backwards compatibility)
due to its edition system. All of that makes large-scale refactoring easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We always talk about the performance gains [...] when using Rust but honestly I
much more look for the stability gains. - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTJIsicwW5s">Stefan Baumgartner, Senior Product Architect at Dynatrace</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="predictable-runtime-behavior">Predictable Runtime Behavior</h3>
<p>Predictable runtime behavior is closely related to reliability and stability.
It means that services run smoothly without any hiccups. This is especially
important for latency-sensitive services like games, chat applications, or
services that need to act on real-time data.</p>
<p>Smooth operation is of uppermost importance for organizations as it is a
significant cost factor and can impact customer satisfaction. According to a 
<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/on-call-cloud-operations-cost-organizations-an-average-of-2-5-million-per-year/">recent
study</a>,
organizations are spending an average of $2.5 million per year on on-call
operations. <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/oncall-compensation/">Compensation for on-call
engineers</a> is a big
part of that cost.</p>
<p>Discord has a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust">great
article</a>
about why they switched from Go to Rust. They mention that Go's garbage
collector was a source of unpredictable latency spikes. After switching to Rust,
they were able to fully get rid of garbage collection and have a more
predictable runtime behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we started load testing, we were instantly pleased with the results. The
latency of the Rust version was just as good as Go’s and had no latency spikes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a diagram from the above article by Discord.
Notice how the latency spikes in the Go version are gone in the Rust version
and how that impacts the 95th percentile response time, making it much more
predictable and smooth.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/discord.png" alt="Discord Go vs Rust"></p><p>Another example is
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/big-pineapple-intro/">Cloudflare</a>,
which uses Rust to power their DNS service, <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>. They
mention that Rust's predictable runtime behavior is a big reason for using it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things we’ve learned with the previous implementations is that, for
a service open to the public, a peak performance of the I/O matters less than
the ability to pace clients fairly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Rust shows excellent runtime behavior when handling network requests.
In a <a href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">benchmark by Eugene Retunsky</a>, Rust had the lowest tail latency and maximum throughput next to C and C++. </p>
<p>Here is the diagram from the benchmark, showing the p99.9 latency for each
language under test. As the requests per second increase, the latency for Rust
stays low and stable. Go and Java on the other hand have a higher baseline
latency while Python shows latency spikes at a certain point.</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/runtime.png" alt="Rust Runtime behavior"></p><p>The author concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, Rust has a much lower latency variance than Golang, Python, and especially Java. 
[...] Rust might be a better alternative to Golang, Java, or Python if predictable performance is crucial for your service. Also, before starting to write a new service in C or C++, it’s worth considering Rust. - <a href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/benchmarking-low-level-i-o-c-c-rust-golang-java-python-9a0d505f85f7">Eugene Retunsky</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cost-savings">Cost Savings</h3>
<p>We touched on cost savings already, but its significance warrants a dedicated
section.</p>
<p>Rust has a low runtime overhead. This is especially important for services that
need to scale to handle a large number of requests.
It can save a lot of money on cloud infrastructure costs if the same workload
can be handled with fewer resources.</p>
<p>For example, AWS has a service called
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/">Firecracker</a>,
which runs virtual machines with very low overhead. It powers AWS Lambda functions and AWS Fargate containers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firecracker consumes about 5 MiB of memory per microVM. You can run thousands
of secure VMs with widely varying vCPU and memory configurations on the same
instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The better hardware utilization translates to lower costs for companies.</p>
<p>Firecracker allowed AWS to improve the efficiency of Fargate, which passed on
cost savings to customers. As a result, they were able to reduce the price of Fargate by
up to 50%. 
(<a href="https://shahbhargav.medium.com/firecracker-secure-and-fast-microvms-628e6043b572">Image source</a> and
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/aws-fargate-price-reduction-up-to-50/">AWS announcement</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/fargate.png" alt="Firecracker"></p><h3 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>Rust has great developer ergonomics. Its expressive type system allows
developers to model their domain in a way that lets the compiler help with
writing correct code.</p>
<p>Furthermore, functional concepts like pattern matching, enums, <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types
allow for concise and expressive code.</p>
<p>Rust's robust error handling story, which requires the programmer to explicitly handle
errors, is a big reason for its reliability.</p>
<p>All these features make it easier to write correct code, reduce the cognitive
load on developers and catch bugs at compile-time instead of runtime.
Static analysis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing">shifts the quality assurance of code to the left</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/robustness.svg" alt="Bug detection over time"></p><blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of
the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on
correctness has helped us tame sync’s complexity. We can encode complex
invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them
for us. - <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">Dropbox</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An often mentioned benefit of Rust is the possibility to refactor code without
fear. This should not be underestimated as it allows you to improve your
codebase over time and make it more robust. Especially for applications that use
multi-threading, this is a big advantage as <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html">typical error scenarios of
concurrent programming are detected by the
compiler</a>.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-long-term-sustainability">Focus on Long-Term Sustainability</h3>
<p>Companies rarely rewrite their services in another language. It incurs a lot of costs
and risks. Only if a rewrite promises a <em>significant</em> upside, companies will
consider it.</p>
<p>One well-known company that started to heavily invest in Rust is Microsoft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is going big on Rust and spending $10 million to make it 1st class
language in our engineering systems + $1 million @rustlang foundation. - <a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1720134540822520268">David Weston, Vice President of OS Security and Enterprise at Microsoft</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft even <a href="https://twitter.com/markrussinovich/status/1656416376125538304">integrated Rust into the Windows kernel</a>.
The fact that they take big bets on Rust shows that they are in it
for the long run. This is a good sign for the Rust ecosystem, as the backing of
a large company can help Rust to become more mainstream and ensure
long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/rust/index.html">the Linux kernel now supports Rust</a>
as well.
The Kernel incorporating Rust is a major endorsement of the language. Notably,
the Linux Kernel maintainers have previously <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus">refused to integrate C++ in the Kernel</a>.</p>
<p>In a landmark development for Rust, the open source <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/officially-qualified-ferrocene/">Ferrocene
toolchain</a> has
achieved a significant milestone: Ferrocene, based on Rust 1.68, is now ISO
26262 and IEC 61508 qualified. This certification means that the Rust compiler
meets rigorous safety standards, making it fully usable in safety-critical
environments like automotive or avionics. Few other languages have
achieved this level of certification. It is another strong signal that Rust is
here to stay.</p>
<p>For another take on this, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnIWRks35Fk">"In It for the Long
Haul"</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/carols10cents">Carol
Nichols</a>.</p>
<h3 id="productivity-and-developer-happiness">Productivity And Developer Happiness</h3>
<p>Many developers enjoy working with Rust. It is the most admired language for the
6th year in a row according to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>.
More than 80% of developers that use it want to use it again next year.</p>
<p>For teams that are looking to hire and retain talent, Rust is a great choice
because developer happiness is a big factor in job satisfaction and has a positive
impact on productivity.</p>
<h3 id="performance-and-energy-efficiency">Performance And Energy Efficiency</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, performance often gets mentioned as a main reason for using Rust.
Rust also has great support for multi-threaded workloads. Libraries like
<a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> are considered
best-in-class for writing high-performance applications.</p>
<p>Making efficient use of compute resources has much deeper implications for
companies than just raw execution speed. One important aspect is energy efficiency.</p>
<p>In the below benchmark, taken from <a href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf">"Energy Efficiency across Programming Languages"</a>
by Pereira et al., Rust has superior runtime performance on par with C and C++
and faster than Go by a factor of 2-3x as well as Python by a factor of 70x.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Lang</th><th>Time (Normalized)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>C</td><td>1.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rust</td><td>1.04</td></tr>
<tr><td>C++</td><td>1.56</td></tr>
<tr><td>Java</td><td>1.89</td></tr>
<tr><td>Go</td><td>2.83</td></tr>
<tr><td>JavaScript</td><td>6.52</td></tr>
<tr><td>PHP</td><td>27.64</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ruby</td><td>59.34</td></tr>
<tr><td>Python</td><td>71.90</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This translates to lower energy consumption as well. 
Energy is another important cost factor for companies at scale.</p>

<h3 id="immature-ecosystem">Immature ecosystem</h3>
<p>Rust is a relatively young language. Version 1.0 was first released in 2015.
This means that the ecosystem is still maturing. Many important libraries <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/">did not see their 1.0 release yet</a>.</p>
<p>This phenomenon has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/11byl6u/why_is_every_crate_pre10/ja3auop/">brought up as a reason to be cautious when using Rust in production</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, it might be hard to find production-grade libraries for specific
needs. Your team might be required to write custom crates or improve existing
ones. Furthermore, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/explore?ecosystem=RUST">sponsoring open source maintainers</a> to work on critical
dependencies is a good way to ensure that the long-term sustainability of the
ecosystem.</p>
<p>That said, libraries for common tasks like JSON parsing or network handling are
very robust and stable and considered best-in-class. Breaking changes are rare
and important crates like <code>serde</code> or <code>tokio</code> are already past their 1.0 release.</p>
<p>A relatively recent addition to the Rust ecosystem is async/await support, a
feature designed to streamline the writing of concurrent applications. This support
represents a significant evolution in Rust's capabilities, but it is still
in its early stages.
If you're planning to write network applications in Rust, there is a high chance
that you will need to use async/await. As such it's important to stay on top of
its ongoing development and limitations. For a detailed exploration of where
async/await in Rust stands today, including its practical implications, we
invite you to read our comprehensive post detailing the current <a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/async/">state of
async/await in Rust</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-developers">Lack Of Developers</h3>
<p>Related to the previous point, the Rust community is still relatively small.
It is hard to find developers with professional Rust experience. </p>
<p>From talking to companies that use Rust in production, I found that they are
mostly training their developers on the job.
Moreover, Rust is noted for enabling a smooth onboarding process for engineers
already proficient in languages like C++ or Java.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rust developers are generally very passionate about their
craft and are actively seeking out jobs that allow them to use Rust,
so the market for Rust developers is growing. (Also see
the previous section about developer happiness.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust has more than tripled the size of its community over the past two years
and currently has 3.7M users, of which 0.6M joined in the last six months
alone.[...] Furthermore, Rust has built a loyal community of developers who care
about memory safety and security. - <a href="https://www.developernation.net/resources/reports/state-of-the-developer-nation-24th-edition-q1-2023">State of the Developer Nation 24th Edition - Q1 2023 report</a></p>

<img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/communities.svg" alt="Programming Language Communities Size">
</a></p><h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>
<p>Cargo, rustfmt, clippy, and rust-analyzer
are all great tools that make Rust development a joy. 
However, <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/debugging-support-in-rustc.html">debugging support is still lacking</a>.
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/rust/">The story for profiling support is similar.</a></p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/">JetBrains announced RustRover</a>,
a new IDE for Rust which is based on IntelliJ.
This is a strong signal that JetBrains sees it as a good investment to build
tooling for Rust developers and that they expect Rust to become more mainstream.</p>
<h3 id="learning-curve">Learning Curve</h3>
<p>Rust has a famously steep learning curve. It is a complex language with many
advanced features. </p>
<p>When asked why they don't use Rust, participants of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/07/Rust-Survey-2023-Results.html#rust-usage">2022 Annual Rust Survey</a>
mentioned the learning curve as the main reason:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/why-not-rust.svg" alt="Why not Rust?"></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/16/rust-survey-2020.html#improved-learnability">Rust 2020
survey</a>,
participants were asked to rate the difficulty of various Rust concepts. Here
are the results:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/topic-difficulty-ratings.svg" alt="Difficulty by topic"></p><p>Lifetime annotations, ownership, and borrowing were mentioned as the most
difficult topics to grasp. In real-world applications, lifetimes
are less of an issue, however, as the compiler can often infer them through
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html">lifetime elision</a>.
Ownership and borrowing however are crucial concepts in Rust that need to be 
understood to become proficient.</p>
<p>It is important to set clear expectations for your team when adopting Rust: Rust
is not a language that you can learn in a few days. It requires practice to internalize
the concepts around ownership and borrowing to become productive with it.
Typically, it takes a few months to become productive with Rust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on our studies, more than 2/3 of respondents are confident in
contributing to a Rust codebase within two months or less when learning Rust.
Further, a third of respondents become as productive using Rust as other
languages in two months or less. <strong>Within four months, that number increased to
over 50%.</strong> - <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft shared a <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2020/04/the-safety-boat-kubernetes-and-rust/">similar experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It takes several weeks of hard effort</strong> learning how to code properly in Rust
before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays
off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features. We also noticed that
once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code
just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some
initial pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on your immediate needs, this might be a deal-breaker for your team.
Other languages like Go or Python have a much lower learning curve and are
a better fit for rapid prototyping.</p>
<h3 id="compile-times">Compile Times</h3>
<p>Rust has a reputation for having long compile times. This is especially true for
large projects with many dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow build speeds were by far the #1 reported challenge that developers have
when using Rust, with only a little more than 40% of respondents finding the
speed acceptable. - <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">Google</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rapid iteration is important for developers. Long compile times can be a
productivity killer. This is most noticeable for developers that are used to
languages like Go or Python, where the feedback loop is much faster.</p>
<p>Compile times are a known issue and the Rust team is <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/03/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2023.html">continously working on improving them</a>.
And these incremental improvements are paying off. The Rust compiler is getting
faster over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://corrode.dev/why-rust/compile-times.svg" alt="Rust Compile Times Over Time"></p><p>For advice on how to improve compile times, see <a href="https://endler.dev/2020/rust-compile-times/">my article on this topic</a> with many practical tips.
For medium-sized projects, compile times are less of an issue. 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/qgi421/doing_m1_macbook_pro_m1_max_64gb_compile/">Modern hardware can also mitigate the issue to some extent.</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rust is a great language for building large-scale, reliable, and stable
applications. It is a good fit for companies that value productivity and
developer happiness and see it as a long-term investment.</p>
<p>On the other side, Rust is still a young language and the ecosystem is still
maturing. It has a steep learning curve and long compile times.</p>
<p>These challenges are not insurmountable, however. They require a commitment to
Rust and a willingness to invest in training and tooling.</p>
<p>Navigating the decision to integrate Rust into your technology stack is pivotal
and requires thoughtful consideration. Should you find yourself weighing its
benefits against your specific requirements, professional guidance can prove
invaluable. Equally, if you are ready to embrace Rust and are seeking expertise
in training or consulting to ensure a smooth transition, specialized support is
essential.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Just outside public view, the American <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims">health insurance industry’s algorithms</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/unitedhealth-healthcare-insurance-denial-ulcerative-colitis">employees</a> and executives process tens of millions of claims for people seeking medical care.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Sometimes, as ProPublica has reported, insurers base decisions on what’s good for the company’s bottom line rather than what’s good for the patient’s health. Sometimes, insurers make mistakes. In one case we learned about, a company denied a child’s treatment because it based its judgment on adult guidelines instead of pediatric ones. In another, an internal reviewer misread what type of surgery the patient sought and denied coverage based on that error.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">At first, these patients had no idea why they were denied treatment. But in each instance, insurance employees left a paper trail — in notes, emails or recordings of phone calls — explaining what happened. Patients and advocates used what they found in those records to craft appeals and ultimately receive the care they needed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"><a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/erisa#:~:text=The%20Employee%20Retirement%20Income%20Security,for%20individuals%20in%20these%20plans.">Federal law</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/147.136">regulations</a> require insurers to hand over exactly this sort of information in response to a written request. And they have to do it fast: Most people who get insurance through an employer should get the records, called claim files, within 30 days.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">There’s just one catch: Some insurers aren’t turning files over like they’re supposed to. We followed ProPublica readers through the process with five different insurers. Several companies only shared documents with patients after we reached out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Our team discovered how useful claim files can be after a patient shared internal notes and calculations that a health insurer had made about his case. But few health insurers advertise this service or offer clear instructions for getting these records. To help fill that gap, we published a guide explaining <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/find-out-why-health-insurance-claim-denied">how to submit a claim file request</a>. We also <a href="https://propublica.jotform.com/231996124151859">shared resources with health care providers</a> and patient advocates nationwide, including request letter templates.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">More than 120 people have told us that they have since requested or intend to request their claim files. Though a handful say they received information that helped them understand why their health insurer denied coverage, many more have been running into challenges. They’ve told us about insurers blowing past deadlines, wrongly requiring subpoenas and —&nbsp;in several cases — misinterpreting their request entirely.</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">We shared a summary of these examples with Tim Hauser, a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Labor. His office oversees claim file laws that cover more than 131 million people. He said insurers who fail to provide records are breaking the law. “The claimant really needs to be able to see what the relevant evidence is so that they can respond to it,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">We brought our findings to five insurance companies. We presented them with details about the requests patients had made and how the company had responded, and we asked for an explanation of what happened in each case.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">All of the insurers acknowledged that the patients were entitled to the material they’d asked for. Four began sending the files after our inquiry. Two, spokespeople told us, are updating policies to handle future requests. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson Michael Bowman said the company needed to better train staff on the rules “to close any gaps to prevent this from occurring in the future.” Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions admitted that patients do not need a subpoena to access their records, contrary to what the insurer had told a member. She said the company would update its “policies and communications to reflect that for future requests. We regret that we did not make these updates sooner and apologize for any frustration or confusion this has caused our customers.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">By crowdsourcing people’s experiences, we identified some patterns in health insurers’ behavior. Here are some of the most common issues people encountered — and what to watch out for if you <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/claimfile/">submit your own request</a>:</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Insurers Asking for Unnecessary Subpoenas or Court Orders</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">Cigna and Anthem told members that they would need to obtain a court order or subpoena to access their claim file records.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">“This is completely unheard of,” said Wells Wilkinson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit legal group Public Health Advocates who regularly files these requests. “It also sounds completely illegal. The consumer has the right to any information used by the health plan in the context of the denial.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">On July 12, Lisa Kays, a Maryland resident, asked Cigna for phone call records related to its decision to deny coverage for her 4-year-old son’s speech therapy. “We couldn’t afford to just give up,” Kays said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">In September, Cigna sent her a letter saying she would need to submit a subpoena to get any transcripts or recordings.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.1">After ProPublica inquired, the company sent Kays partial transcripts of the calls. It also reimbursed her for some of the previously denied coverage. She is still waiting for the recordings.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">We asked Anthem about a similar case. On July 19, a call center agent told Pamela Tsigdinos she would need a subpoena to receive her claim file records. Tsigdinos had submitted the request 50 days earlier.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Bowman, the Anthem spokesperson, told us the response was an error and apologized. The company compiled the claim file and sent it to Tsigdinos.</p>

<h3>Insurers Confusing Claim File Requests With Appeals</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1">At least five people told ProPublica that, after submitting a request for a claim file, their health insurer mistook the request for an appeal.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">We brought three cases to UnitedHealthcare. S.J. Farris requested her claim file from the company on May 10. Five days later, she received a response stating that her request for an appeal had been received. Farris sent a clarifying letter but was met with a call from an appeals agent based in Ireland. “I asked her to send the claim files,” Farris said. “She had no idea what I was talking about.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">After ProPublica sent the company questions, Farris received a call from UnitedHealth in October. They told her that the insurer was working on her claim file and that she should expect it soon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>In response to five class-action lawsuits, a Washington appeals court has decided that Honda and several other automakers did nothing wrong by storing text messages and call records from connected smartphones.</p>
<p>Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, and General Motors were all facing charges in separate but related class-action suits that all claimed they violated Washington state privacy laws. The cases were all dismissed in court earlier this year, and the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/11/09/honda-infotainment-privacy-appeal-decision.pdf" rel="nofollow">decided</a> [PDF] this week they weren't going to reopen the cases to further litigation.</p>
<p>The Circuit judges hearing the case lumped all of them together because "the factual background and legal issues are virtually identical," and dismissed the appeal not because the automakers hadn't done anything wrong, but rather because the claims didn't meet the Washington Privacy Act's (WPA) statutory injury requirements.</p>

    

<p>"To succeed at the pleading stage of a WPA claim, a plaintiff must allege an injury to 'his or her business, his or her person, or his or her reputation,'" the judges ruled. "Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, a bare violation of the WPA is insufficient to satisfy the statutory injury requirement."</p>

        


        

<p>In other words, it's A-OK for your car to "automatically and without authorization, instantaneously intercept, record, download, store, and [be] capable of transmitting" text messages and call logs since the privacy violation is potential, but the injury not necessarily actual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 9th Circuit judges' determination was based on the dismissal of a fifth class-action lawsuit in Washington that made the same arguments against Ford, which was <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/22-35447/22-35447-2023-10-27.html" rel="nofollow">dismissed</a> in late October on identical grounds. One of the same 9th Circuit judges, Michael Daly Hawkins, was on the appeals panel that made both decisions.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>We asked Honda and lawyers for both sides of the case to comment but haven't heard back.</p>

</ul>
<p>Per the first amended <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/11/09/honda-infotainment-class-action-suit.pdf" rel="nofollow">complaint</a> [PDF] filed in the Honda case, Honda infotainment systems in vehicles manufactured from 2014 onward "store each intercepted, recorded, and downloaded copy of text messages in non-temporary computer memory in such a manner that the vehicle owner cannot access it or delete it," plaintiffs argued. "Even if the text message is deleted from the smartphone, the Honda vehicle retains a copy in on-board memory, even after the smartphone is disconnected."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for call logs, the class-action complaint argued.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs accusing Honda of WPA violations pointed to Maryland-based Berla Corporation, which manufactures equipment "capable of extracting stored text messages from infotainment systems" as a reason for owners to consider the data harvesting a privacy concern. According to the suit, Berla software isn't generally available to the public, and is designed for law enforcement use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Copies of text messages and call logs stored on Honda vehicles can be, and are, retrieved by unauthorized users of Berla's equipment without any password, fingerprint, face image, or other security measures, thus bypassing any security measures Plaintiffs and class members employ to secure data on their phones," the complaint alleged.</p>

        

<p>The Honda case and those involving Toyota, VW, and GM were all dismissed with prejudice, so the only way for the cases to go is up to the Supreme Court on further appeal. It's not immediately clear if further appeals are planned. ®</p>

<p>The groundbreaking Intel 386 processor (1985) was the first 32-bit processor in the x86 line.
It has numerous internal registers: general-purpose registers, index registers, segment selectors, and
more specialized registers.
In this blog post, I look at the silicon die of the 386 and explain how some of these registers are
implemented at the transistor level.
The registers that I examined are implemented as static RAM, with each bit stored in a common 8-transistor circuit, known as "8T".
Studying this circuit shows the interesting layout techniques that Intel used to squeeze two storage cells together to minimize the space they require.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the internal structure of the 386. I have marked the relevant registers with three red
boxes. Two sets of registers are in the segment descriptor cache, presumably holding cache entries, and one set is at the bottom of
the data path. Some of the registers at the bottom are 32 bits wide, while others are half as wide and
hold 16 bits. (More registers with different circuits, but I
won't discuss them in this post.)</p>

<h2>The 6T and 8T static RAM cells</h2>
<p>First, I'll explain how a 6T or 8T static cell holds a bit.
The basic idea behind a static RAM cell is to connect two inverters into a loop.
This circuit will be stable, with one inverter on and one inverter off, and each inverter supporting the other.
Depending on which inverter is on,
the circuit stores a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/inverter-loop.png"><img alt="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." height="121" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/inverter-loop-w250.png" title="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." width="250"></a></p><p>Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p>To write a new value into the circuit, two signals are fed in, forcing the inverters to the desired new values.
One inverter receives the new bit value, while the other inverter receives the complemented bit value.
This may seem like a brute-force way to update the bit, but it works.
The trick is that the inverters in the cell are small and weak, while the input signals are higher current,
able to overpower the inverters.<span id="fnref:flip"><a href="#fn:flip">1</a></span>
The write data lines (called bitlines) are connected to the inverters by pass transistors.<span id="fnref:pass"><a href="#fn:pass">2</a></span> When the pass transistors are on, the
signals on the write lines can pass through to the inverters. But when the pass transistors are off, the
inverters are isolated from the write lines.
Thus, the write control signal enables writing a new value to the inverters.
(This signal is called a wordline since it controls access to a word of storage.)
Since each inverter consists of two transistors<span id="fnref:inverter"><a href="#fn:inverter">7</a></span>, the circuit below consists of six transistors,
forming the 6T storage cell.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/simple-cell.png"><img alt="Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written." height="125" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/simple-cell-w350.png" title="Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written." width="350"></a></p><p>Adding pass transistor so the cell can be written.</p>
<p>The 6T cell uses the same bitlines for reading and writing.
Adding two transistors creates the 8T circuit, which has the advantage that you can read one register
and write to another register at the same time. (I.e. the register file is two-ported.)
In the 8T cell below, two additional transistors (G and H) are used for reading.
Transistor G buffers the cell's value; it turns on if the inverter output is high, pulling the read output bitline low.<span id="fnref:precharge"><a href="#fn:precharge">3</a></span>
Transistor H is a pass transistor that blocks this signal until a read is performed on this register;
it is controlled by a read wordline.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of a storage cell. Each transistor is labeled with a letter." height="155" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-schematic-w500.png" title="Schematic of a storage cell. Each transistor is labeled with a letter." width="500"></a></p><p>Schematic of a storage cell. Each transistor is labeled with a letter.</p>
<p>To form registers (or memory), a grid is constructed from these cells.
Each row corresponds to a register, while each column corresponds to a bit position.
The horizontal lines are the wordlines, selecting which word to access, while the
vertical lines are the bitlines, passing bits in or out of the registers.
For a write, the vertical bitlines provide the 32 bits (along with their complements).
For a read, the vertical bitlines receive the 32 bits from the register.
A wordline is activated to read or write the selected register.</p>

<h2>Silicon circuits in the 386</h2>
<p>Before showing the layout of the circuit on the die, I should give a bit of background on the technology used
to construct the 386.
The 386 was built with CMOS technology, with NMOS and PMOS transistors working together, an advance over the
earlier x86 chips that were built with NMOS transistors.
Intel called this CMOS technology CHMOS-III (complementary high-performance metal-oxide-silicon), with 1.5 µm features.
While Intel's earlier chips had a single metal layer, CHMOS-III provided two metal layers, making signal
routing much easier.</p>
<p>Because CMOS uses both NMOS and PMOS transistors, fabrication is more complicated.
In an MOS integrated circuit, a transistor is formed where a polysilicon wire crosses active silicon,
creating the transistor's gate.
A PMOS transistor is constructed directly on the silicon substrate (which is N-doped).
However, an NMOS transistor is the opposite, requiring a P-doped substrate.
This is created by forming a P well, a region
of P-doped silicon that holds NMOS transistors.
Each P well must be connected to ground; this is accomplished by connecting ground to specially-doped regions of the P well, called "well taps"`.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a cross-section through two transistors, showing the layers of the chip.
There are four important layers: silicon (which has some regions doped to form active
silicon), polysilicon for wiring and transistors, and the two metal layers.
At the bottom is the silicon, with P or N doping; note the P-well for the NMOS transistor on the left.
Next is the polysilicon layer.
At the top are the two layers of metal, named M1 and M2. 
Conceptually, the chip is constructed from flat layers, but the layers have a three-dimensional
structure influenced by the layers below.
The layers are separated by silicon dioxide ("ox") or silicon oxynitride<span id="fnref:oxynitride"><a href="#fn:oxynitride">4</a></span>; the
oxynitride under M2 caused me considerable difficulty.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/process-cross-section.jpg"><img alt="A cross-section of circuitry formed with the CHMOS-III process. From A double layer metal CHMOS III technology." height="244" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/process-cross-section-w600.jpg" title="A cross-section of circuitry formed with the CHMOS-III process. From A double layer metal CHMOS III technology." width="600"></a></p>
<p>The image below shows how circuitry appears on the die;<span id="fnref:layers"><a href="#fn:layers">5</a></span>
I removed the metal layers to show the silicon and polysilicon that form transistors.
(As will be described below, this image shows two static cells, holding two bits.)
The pinkish and dark regions are active silicon, doped to take part in the circuits, while the "background" silicon
can be ignored.
The green lines are polysilicon lines on top of the silicon.
Transistors are the most important feature here: a transistor gate is formed when polysilicon crosses active
silicon, with the source and drain on either side.
The upper part of the image has PMOS transistors, while the lower part of the image has the P well that holds
NMOS transistors. (The well itself is not visible.)
In total, the image shows four PMOS transistors and 12 NMOS transistors.
At the bottom, the well taps connect the P well to ground.
Although the metal has been removed, the contacts between the lower metal layer (M1) and the silicon or
polysilicon are visible as faint circles.</p>

<h2>Register layout in the 386</h2>
<p>Next, I'll explain the layout of these cells in the 386.
To increase the circuit density, two cells are put side-by-side, with a mirrored layout.
In this way, each row holds two interleaved registers.<span id="fnref:density"><a href="#fn:density">6</a></span>
The schematic below shows the arrangement of the paired cells, matching the die image above.
Transistors A and B form the first inverter,<span id="fnref2:inverter"><a href="#fn:inverter">7</a></span> while transistors C and D form the second
inverter.
Pass transistors E and F allow the bitlines to write the cell.
For reading, transistor G amplifies the signal while pass transistor H connects the selected bit to the
output.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/schematic-full.png"><img alt="Schematic of two static cells in the 386. The schematic approximately matches the physical layout." height="273" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/schematic-full-w700.png" title="Schematic of two static cells in the 386. The schematic approximately matches the physical layout." width="700"></a></p><p>Schematic of two static cells in the 386. The schematic approximately matches the physical layout.</p>
<p>The left and right sides are approximately mirror images, with separate read and write control lines for
each half.
Because the control lines for the left and right sides are in different positions, the two sides have
some layout differences, in particular, the bulging loop on the right.
Mirroring the cells increases the density since the bitlines can be shared by the cells.</p>
<!--
Inconveniently, the read outputs for the two cells are at opposite ends, so the output on the left is connected
to the read bitline on the right.
-->

<p>The diagram below shows the various components on the die,
labeled to match the schematic above.
I've drawn the lower M1 metal wiring in blue, but omitted the M2 wiring (horizontal control lines, power, and ground). "Read crossover" indicates the connection from the read output on the left to the bitline on the right.
Black circles indicate vias between M1 and M2, green circles indicate contacts between silicon and M1, and
reddish circles indicate contacts between polysilicon and M1.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-silicon.jpg"><img alt="The layout of two static cells. The M1 metal layer is drawn in blue; the horizontal M2 lines are not shown." height="396" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/cell-silicon-w600.jpg" title="The layout of two static cells. The M1 metal layer is drawn in blue; the horizontal M2 lines are not shown." width="600"></a></p><p>The layout of two static cells. The M1 metal layer is drawn in blue; the horizontal M2 lines are not shown.</p>
<p>One more complication is that alternating registers (i.e. rows) are reflected vertically, as shown below.
This allows one horizontal power line to feed two rows, and similarly for a horizontal ground line.
This cuts the number of power/ground lines in half, making the layout more efficient.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/multi-cells.jpg"><img alt="Multiple storage cells." height="387" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/multi-cells-w500.jpg" title="Multiple storage cells." width="500"></a></p><p>Multiple storage cells.</p>
<p>Having two layers of metal makes the circuitry considerably more difficult to reverse engineer. The
photo below (left) shows one of the static RAM cells as it appears under the microscope.
Although the structure of the metal layers is visible in the photograph, there is a lot of ambiguity.
It is difficult to distinguish the two layers of metal. Moreover, the metal completely hides the
polysilicon layer, not to mention the underlying silicon.
The large black circles are vias between the two metal layers.
The smaller faint circles are contacts between a metal layer and the underlying silicon or polysilicon.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/metal-layers.jpg"><img alt="One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers." height="452" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/metal-layers-w600.jpg" title="One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers." width="600"></a></p><p>One cell as it appears on the die, with a diagram of the upper (M2) and lower (M1) metal layers.</p>
<p>With some effort, I determined the metal layers, which I show on the right:
M2 (upper) and M1 (lower).
By comparing the left and right images, you can see how the structure of the metal layers is somewhat visible.
I use black circles to
indicate vias between the layers, green circles indicate contacts between M1 and silicon, and pink circles indicate
contacts between M1 and polysilicon.
Note that both metal layers are packed as tightly as possible.
The layout of this circuit was highly optimized to minimize the area.
It is interesting to note that decreasing the size of the transistors wouldn't help with this circuit, since
the size is limited by the metal density.
This illustrates that a fabrication process must balance the size of the metal features, polysilicon features,
and silicon features since over-optimizing one won't help the overall chip density.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the bottom of the register file.
The "notch" makes the registers at the very bottom half-width:
4 half-width rows corresponding to eight 16-bit registers.
Since there are six 16-bit segment registers in the 386, I suspect these are the segment registers and
two mystery registers.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/split.jpg"><img alt="The bottom of the register file." height="186" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-reg/split-w500.jpg" title="The bottom of the register file." width="500"></a></p><p>The bottom of the register file.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to determine which registers in the 386 correspond to the other registers on the die.
In the segment descriptor circuitry, there are two rows of register cells with ten more rows below,
corresponding to 24 32-bit registers. These are presumably segment descriptors.
At the bottom of the datapath, there are 10 32-bit registers with the T8 circuit.
The 386's programmer-visible registers consist of eight general-purpose 32-bit registers (EAX, etc.).
The 386 has various control registers, test registers, and segmentation registers<span id="fnref:registers"><a href="#fn:registers">8</a></span> that are
not well known.
The 8086 has a few registers for internal use that aren't visible to the programmer, so the 386 presumably
has even more invisible registers.
At this point, I can't narrow down the functionality.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It's interesting to examine how registers are implemented in a real processor. 
There are plenty of descriptions of the 8T static cell circuit, but it turns out that the physical implementation
is more complicated than the theoretical description.
Intel put a lot of effort into optimizing this circuit, resulting in a dense block of circuitry.
By mirroring cells horizontally and vertically, the density could be increased further.</p>
<p>Reverse engineering one small circuit of the 386 turned out to be pretty tricky, so I don't plan to do
a complete reverse engineering.
The main difficulty is the two layers of metal are hard to untangle.
Moreover, I lost most of the polysilicon when removing the metal.
Finally, it is hard to draw diagrams with four layers without the diagram turning into a mess,

Specifically, if I have a tech company set up in the US that's pulling some decent revenue, is it worth applying for an O1? What other circumstances come into play against/in favor of this?</p><p>I've seen a lot of advisors and "influencers" all over the web saying that it's "easy". I don't think that's the case because nothing in US immigration is easy, unless your net worth is like 9 figures, maybe; but if it's not that far-fetched I may consider applying for one.</p><p>Alternatively, could one sponsor its own H1B visa? I guess the actual underlying question is: if I'm an entrepreneur with a real, solid company based in the US (but I'm not in the US and not a US citizen), what is the best way for me to move there and keep working at my company?

At the end of the day, the issue is less about the quality of the evidence - although that matters - and more about the existence of evidence that checks at least 3 boxes/criteria. And now, with the recent public announcements from the Administration, O-1 petitions with an AI component have an even greater chance of approval.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Then apply for a change of status while in the USA.<p>I probably should have listened to her.. I did it the "right" way since I wanted to quit that job anyway.  Got married abroad and filed an I-130.  It took like 18 months to get it, it was nuts.  I'm a native-born US citizen and my wife is from Japan, no criminal records or anything, and I was making 3-5x the national median household income this whole time, so it's not like there was anything tricky about our case.</p><p>I'd recommend you just talk to a lawyer.  I hired a lawyer for our case, and it was about $3k total.  It would've been entirely doable without the lawyer's help, but it was easier that way and I helped fund her charity work where she helps refugees and domestic abuse victims.

My employer suggested I explore visa options to visit Canada or the USA for a brief two-week trip in early June next year. I'm young, unmarried, renting an apartment, paying a monthly car loan, and have parents in good standing in Morocco. I've never traveled outside Morocco. How can I make this happen as a contractor without intentions to immigrate or enter the Canadian labor market, just to meet with my globally scattered teammates? Your friendly advice on navigating this would be fantastic! Thanks a bunch!</span></p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Our 10 person startup gets acquired by Google, we rebuild our product the Google way, and begin to understand that amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the Google game. A follow up to <a href="https://shreyans.org/venmo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What I learned at Venmo</a> and <a href="https://shreyans.org/socratic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">What I learned at Socratic</a></em></p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/nooglers.jpg" alt="Nooglers"></p>
<hr>
<p>As we started to raise <a href="https://shreyans.org/socratic">Socratic’s</a> Series B in 2017, we quickly learned that our focus on getting usage at the expense of revenue was going to bite us. Our growth got us in the door, but every VC asked for a monetization plan, and in the process of figuring that out we concluded that an education app focused on credit-card-less high school students wasn’t going to become a big business.</p>
<p>Around the same time, we were introduced to Evan Spiegel, the CEO of Snapchat. Evan suggested a partnership to integrate our camera-based homework helper into their app. But one of our advisors figured that if he introduced you to their Head of Corporate Development, he may be suggesting an eventual acquisition, and if so, we should get a competitive process going. So we did, and reached out to Microsoft, Chegg, Byju’s, and Google.</p>
<p>My co-founder, Chris, had previously worked at Google and reconnected with his past manager to get an intro to Lens - Google’s camera-first app. What we didn’t know was that she had recently started an education effort of her own, along with the co-founders of Khan Academy and Android. We met and learned that we had hugely overlapping visions for a learning-focused, AI-powered tutor. Maybe it helped that we had just won Google’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/topic?id=campaign_editorial_apps_bestof2017" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Android App of the Year</a>, but soon after that meeting, we kicked off a process that led to Google acquiring Socratic in March of 2018.</p>
<p>We merged with an existing team of the same size, composed of multiple long tenured Googlers. Chris and I became the product and engineering leads, tasked with building an AI-powered tutor and bringing those capabilities to Google’s largest products.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, we rebuilt Socratic and relaunched it as “Socratic by Google”<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>, shipped Socratic features in Search and Lens, released a math solver and prototyped a step-by-step math tutor, and built capabilities that are being used across Google.</p>
<p>Some things I learned along the way:</p>
<p><strong>Working at Google is like having a second passport.</strong> Go to any major city in the world and your badge<sup><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> unlocks a beautiful office with great food, desks, and a high speed link to every person in Google’s 200,000+ person network. And like visiting America as a foreigner, everything you see inside feels oddly familiar because of its massive exported influence, yet is just slightly different.</p>
<p>Shockingly, you get immediate access to all of it. Access to their gigantic monorepo<sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2854146" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup> with billions of lines of code covering almost all their products. Live statuses of their globe-covering data centers. Strategy documents spanning two decades of history. And direct access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">legends</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Google does things the Google way.</strong> Just about every piece of software and infrastructure used at Google was built at Google, a natural result of facing the hardest engineering problems earlier than most companies. At Google's scale, the external world ceases to exist and is only rarely and carefully allowed to enter their walls.</p>
<p>This meant that there was no chance of keeping our existing codebase. We would need to start from scratch, rediscovering our product insights with the new team, then rebuilding our app on Google’s stack. Problems we had already solved, like our ML system to classify the topics in a homework problem, had to be re-solved using Search techniques and to Search standards, which needless to say were higher than ours. </p>
<p>One place we were able to break Google's mold was with ‘Ceebo’, our app mascot. Look at Google’s collection of app icons and you’ll see four colors and simple shapes. Works for them, but boring to us. They pushed (“we don’t anthropomorphize”), we pushed back (“you do with Android!”), until we finally got our way because we were too small to matter. Ceebo lives on as our app icon, and has blossomed within Google, where dozens of variants have been illustrated, and Ceebo pops up in surprising docs and sites all around Google. </p>

<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/socratic_app_logo.png" alt="Socratic's cbo"></p><p><strong>Simple things done repeatedly feel magical.</strong> Re-building our query classification system alongside Search veterans was an illuminating peek into how Search itself was built. On the one hand there’s the incredible depth of information retrieval tools, and the mind-boggling ability to calculate and add a new signal to <em>every page on the Internet</em> (e.g. <code>contains_math</code>, or <code>subject:chemistry</code>).</p>
<p>On the other hand there was the discovery that most Search improvements are manually reviewed by engineers through ‘side-by-side’ comparisons between old and new results...on spreadsheets! </p>
<p>One may expect Google engineering to largely consist of implementing PhD level algorithms, and while that's sometimes true, much of a search or AI engineer's job involves looking at examples, spotting patterns, hand labelling data, and other non-scalable, in-the-weeds analysis. This seems to be generally true among the best AI teams:</p>
<p><em>"One pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly. Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable intuitions about the problem."</em><sup><a href="https://twitter.com/_jasonwei/status/1708921475829481683" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Most problems aren’t worth Google’s time, but surprising ones are.</strong> Most 10-50 million user problems aren’t worth Google's time, and don’t fit their strategy. But they’ll take on significant effort on problems that do fit their nature, strategy, and someone’s promotion goals. </p>
<p>One such example: computer vision is a big part of Socratic’s interface, specifically being able to read text and math in images. As a startup we used a 3rd party tool, but between exposing sensitive data, expectations of scale, and a complex vendor review process - using it within Google proved too difficult. Sometimes it’s easier to just buy the company to bring the tech in-house. Other times, as in our case, there’s an AI research team that’s interested in the problem, hires a top PhD talent to work on it, and delivers a world-class math recognition API within 6 months.</p>
<p>Of course, if you’ve read Steve Yegge’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">classic blog post</a> comparing Google and Amazon's platforms, you’ll know that this world class service was not externalized.</p>
<p><strong>Google is an ever shifting web of goals and efforts.</strong> Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people care about them. A VP that gets it, a research team with a related charter, or compatibility with an org’s goals. Navigating this mess of interests is half of a PM’s job. And then you need the blessing of approvers like privacy, trust and safety, and infra capacity. It takes dozens of conversations to know if an idea is viable, and hundreds more to make it a reality.</p>
<p>And that’s the happy path. Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people <em>keep</em> caring about them. Team goals can change in any given quarter, and entire teams can disappear in the face of a 'reorg', a phenomenon so common that Googlers can look past the tragedy and see the comedy in it.</p>
<p>Suppose you dodge all those bullets, you might still wake up to find that while you were working on your project, two distant teams were also working on the same idea, and the time has come to fight it out because only one can proceed. The internal users of the losing projects will find that the API they depended on is now ‘deprecated’, but the replacement, well it’s not quite ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>Googlers wanted to ship great work, but often couldn’t.</strong> While there were undoubtedly people who came in for the food, worked 3 hours a day, and enjoyed their early retirements, all the people I met were earnest, hard-working, and wanted to do great work.</p>
<p>What beat them down were the gauntlet of reviews, the frequent re-orgs, the institutional scar tissue from past failures, and the complexity of doing even simple things on the world stage. Startups can afford to ignore many concerns, Googlers rarely can.</p>
<p>What also got in the way were the people themselves - all the smart people who could argue against anything but not <em>for</em> something, all the leaders who lacked the courage to speak the uncomfortable truth, and all the people that were hired without a clear project to work on, but must still be retained through promotion-worthy made-up work.</p>
<p><img src="https://shreyans.org/images/posts/google/nooglers-no-more.jpg" alt="Nooglers no more"></p>
<p><strong>Top heavy orgs are hard to steer.</strong> Another blocker to progress that I saw up close was the imbalance of a top heavy team. A team with multiple successful co-founders and 10-20 year Google veterans might sound like a recipe for great things, but it’s also a recipe for gridlock.</p>
<p>This structure might work if there are multiple areas to explore, clear goals, and strong autonomy to pursue those paths. But if you want to work on one unified product, it needs a clear leader, with a clear direction, and more doers than thinkers. And counter-intuitively, adding more people to an early-stage project doesn't make it go faster.</p>
<p><strong>Technical debt is real. So is process debt.</strong> Engineers are used to talking about <em>technical debt</em>: a corner that you cut today to save time and ship a feature; a loan from your future self that is either paid back in time or it slowly gets more expensive to deal with. Good teams regularly pay down debt by cleaning things up on quieter days.</p>
<p>Just as real is process debt. A review added because of a launch gone wrong. A new legal check to guard against possible litigation. A section added to a document template. Layers accumulate over the years until you end up unable to release a new feature for months after it's ready because it's stuck between reviews, with an unclear path out.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, process is rolled back: Google recently changed their onerous perf(ormance review) process, from twice a year to once, from a long to a short questionnaire, and hopefully from 30+% of a manager's year to less than 10%.</p>
<p>And sometimes an external threat either forces this change, or percipitates a company's decline. Google invented the technologies behind ChatGPT, but wasn't the one to release that product. Now it must resolve the growing tension between the builders that want to reclaim Google's AI lead, and the reviewers that want to guard against all possible troubles<sup><a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/google-svp-cautions-against-launching-ai-products-too-quickly/" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the right game.</strong> Google used to have a set of internal values they called "The Three Respects": respect the user, respect each other, and respect the opportunity. The first two are somewhat easy to understand, but the third one confused most people. My interpretation is as follows: you're at Google, an insanely profitable, genius-filled enterprise. You're well-paid, well-fed, and live in the eternal spring paradise of Silicon Valley. <em>What's the best thing you can do with this insane luck?</em></p>
<p>And my answer to that question echoes what Richard Hamming said in his great talk, <em>You and Your Research</em><sup><a href="https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/stripe-press/TAODSAE_zine_press.pdf" target="_blank">🔗</a></sup>: you must find the most important problem in your field, and play whatever games necessary to solve it.</p>
<p>Practically, what this means is to first do the work that is given to you. But once that's under control, to reach out into the vast Google network, to learn what's being planned and invented, to coalesce a clear image of the future, to give it shape through docs and demos, to find the leaders whose goals align with this image, and to sell the idea as persistently as you can.</p>
<p>To some extent I did this. One of my favorite examples was a demo for a step-by-step math tutor, built on top of our new math solver, made by three of us on the side over a few months. The demo gave our vision for intelligent tutoring a tangible form - it had a link, it could be used, it could be shared. It grounded conversations, gave people something specific to react to, and took on a life outside our team, being passed around, independently discussed, and leading back to us.</p>
<p>I also saw this go wrong. One of our leaders clearly saw the world we were heading towards, had designers make great demos, and would share them whenever he could. But he was trapped in the wrong part of the company, and his boss's goals pointed elsewhere. He eventually switched to a more compatible team, and his dream now has a chance of becoming a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Many acquisitions fail. Socratic's story is mixed.</strong> On one hand, we managed to merge two vastly different cultures, our product lives on and has grown to serve ~5 <em>billion</em> queries a year, and careers across the Socratic team have bloomed.</p>
<p>On the other, both Chris and I left Google to found startups<sup><a href="#note-3">3</a></sup>, and neither the Socratic team nor Google as a whole have yet produced an AI powered tutor worthy of Google's capabilities. But a few Socratic Googlers might yet make it happen, unless they've been re-org'd.</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>As dawn breaks</span> over Silicon Valley, the world is getting its first look at Pathfinder 1, a prototype electric airship that its maker LTA Research hopes will kickstart a new era in climate-friendly air travel, and accelerate the humanitarian work of its funder, Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p>
<p>The airship — its snow-white steampunk profile visible from the busy 101 highway — has taken drone technology such as fly-by-wire controls, electric motors and lidar sensing, and supersized them to something longer than three Boeing 737s, potentially able to carry tons of cargo over many hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>“It’s been 10 years of blood, sweat and tears,” LTA CEO Alan Weston told TechCrunch on the eve of the unveiling. “Now we must show that this can reliably fly in real-world conditions. And we’re going to do that.”</p>
<p>A series of increasingly ambitious flight tests lie ahead, before Pathfinder 1 is moved to Akron, Ohio, where <a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LTA Research</a> is planning an even larger airship, the Pathfinder 3. The company eventually hopes to produce a family of airships to provide disaster relief where roads and airports are damaged, as well as zero-carbon passenger transportation.</p>
<p>For the next year however, the gigantic airship looks set to become a Silicon Valley landmark as its novel materials and systems are methodically put through their paces within shouting distance of companies like Google, Meta and Amazon. “I’m excited about the potential of not building just one airship, but laying the foundation for many airships to be built,” said Weston. “The innovations and the technologies that we’re about to demonstrate have the potential to lay the foundation for a new industry.”</p>
<h2>The biggest aircraft in almost a century</h2>

<p>At 124.5 meters long, Pathfinder 1 dwarfs the current Goodyear airships and even the massive Stratolaunch plane designed to launch orbital rockets. It’s the largest aircraft to take to the skies since the gargantuan Hindenburg airship of the 1930s. Although similar in appearance to that ill-fated airship, and using a passenger gondola supplied by Zeppelin, the Pathfinder 1 was mostly built from the ground up using new materials and technologies.</p>
<p>LTA’s airship uses stable helium rather than flammable hydrogen as a lifting gas, held in 13 giant rip-stop nylon cells and monitored by lidar laser systems. A rigid framework of 10,000 carbon-fiber reinforced tubes and 3,000 titanium hubs form a protective skeleton around the gas cells, surrounded by a lightweight synthetic Tedlar skin.</p>
<p>Twelve electric motors powered by diesel generators and batteries enable vertical take-off and landing. They can propel the Pathfinder 1 at up to 65 knots (75 mph), although its initial flights will be at much lower speeds.</p>
<p>This morning, the airship floated silently from its WW2-era hangar at NASA’s Moffett Field at walking pace, steered by ropes held by dozens of the company’s engineers, technicians and ground crew.</p>
<p>The whole operation occurred under the cover of darkness, not because LTA has something to hide but because the airship’s flight test program begins with the first rays of the morning sun. The first lesson its engineers hope to learn is how Pathfinder 1’s approximately one million cubic feet of helium and weather resistant polymer skin will respond to the warming effect of Californian sunshine.</p>
<p>“We have sophisticated methodology that allows us to replicate real-world conditions using static test stands,” said Jillian Hilenski, senior mechanical engineer at LTA. “However, dynamic on-ship flight tests provide the best data on the health and efficiency of the airship.”</p>
<h2>Test, test, test again</h2>

<p>At the start of September, the FAA issued a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lta-airship-faa-clearance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special airworthiness certificate</a> for the Pathfinder 1 allowing test flights in and around Moffett Field and the nearby Palo Alto airport, and over the southern part of the San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>Those tests will initially happen just a few feet off the ground, with the airship tethered to a mobile tripod mast. These will be followed by simple maneuvers around Moffett Field, before a series of flights out and over the Bay.</p>
<p>“The advantages of going over the water are multiple,” said Weston. “First of all, when you come off Moffett Field, the air is smoother over the Bay than it is anywhere else. That’s very important. And there’s not much in the way of traffic on the surface, so that’s a big plus as well.”</p>
<p>Safety is top of Weston’s mind as he works to reintroduce rigid airships to the skies of North America — and ultimately the world. The first 50 flights of Pathfinder 1 covered by the FAA certificate will allow flights no higher than 1,500 feet, and will use two pilots rather than the single pilot the airship was designed to need.</p>
<p>“I can count the number of companies in the lighter-than-air space on my hands, and we all have a lot to lose if anybody has a serious problem,” he said. Weston says LTA is working closely with the FAA to ensure that anything the company builds has a safe and sensible path to full certification. “The last maiden flight of an airship like this was the Graf Zeppelin II in 1938,” he noted during the interview. “The FAA wasn’t even around then.”</p>
<h2>Back to the future</h2>
<p>In a world of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/evtol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eVTOL air-taxis</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/electric-aircraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electric aviation startups</a> and hydrogen planes, Weston acknowledges that airships are only ever likely to be a partial solution. “I can’t see airships replacing aircraft,” he said. “But I do see a niche for airships to be part of the transportation architecture that reduces the carbon footprint of air travel.”</p>
<p>Another important niche could be responding to natural disasters like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes. Sergey Brin also funds a nonprofit called <a href="https://www.gsd.ngo/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Support and Development</a> that aims to deliver humanitarian aid within the first 24 to 96 hours of a disaster.</p>
<p>Brin founded GSD in 2015 after using his own superyacht to deploy medics to the scene of a cyclone in the South Pacific. The nonprofit has since partnered with the nonprofit YachtAid Global, and now also has its own purpose-built vessel, the <a href="https://www.gsd.ngo/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-vessel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MV Dawn</a>, that can swiftly transport dozens of doctors and aid workers, alongside life-saving supplies.</p>
<p>While Pathfinder 1 can carry about four tons of cargo in addition to its crew, water ballast and fuel, future humanitarian airships will need much larger capacities. They will also likely use zero-carbon technologies like hydrogen fuel cells for power, said Hilenski. That will involve a long, slow slog to validate the new technologies and to demonstrate, to the FAA and paying customers, that a new generation of super-large airships can match the generally excellent safety and reliability record of today’s commercial jets.</p>
<p>“What excites me about what we’ve done so far is that we’ve shown to ourselves, and we hope to show to the rest of the world, that we can scale in size and productivity,” said Weston. “And I believe in our potential to scale up again in the future.”</p>
<p>The FAA’s experimental certificate for the Pathfinder 1 expires in September 2024.</p>

                    <p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Today, we’re announcing a free early preview of CLion, which uses the ReSharper C++/Rider C++ language engine instead of the CLion "legacy" engine. The Preview build is available via our dedicated Toolbox App feed. At some point in 2024, depending on the results of the feedback collected, CLion Nova will be merged into CLion. Until then, the Preview build will be free to use and can be installed in parallel with your usual CLion (Classic) installation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" alt="CLion Nova" width="640" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Featured_Blog_1280x720_CLionNova.png"></a></p>
<h2 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h2>
<p>The first C++ engine by JetBrains was designed for AppCode, our IDE for iOS and macOS developers. It was part of the IntelliJ Platform, initially written in Java and later also in Kotlin. The approach and the architecture of the engine serve many languages in IntelliJ-based IDEs well; however, this design turned out not to be the best fit for the C++ language specifically.</p>
<p>To more quickly align with the evolution of C++ and to separate the engine and IDE processes, a clangd-based engine was later added to CLion. Built on our custom branch of clangd, this engine detects any warnings and errors, shows them in the editor, and suggests quick-fixes, as well as performing highlighting, completion, and certain navigation actions. It’s also used for things like <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2023/11/striving-for-better-cpp-code-part-i-data-flow-analysis-basics/">data flow analysis</a> and MISRA checks. Meanwhile, CLion’s “legacy” engine is responsible for other code insight features like refactorings. You can see a detailed “list of responsibilities” in our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/c-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Clangd has many advantages, but it isn’t very helpful when it comes to project-wide refactorings and actions. We prototyped a clangd-based indexer and even implemented an experimental <em>Find Usages</em> on top of it, which you can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable and evaluate in </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion</a>.</p>
<p>Another alternative developed by JetBrains for C++ is the language engine used in ReSharper C++ and Rider (for game development in C++). There is also a communication protocol in place that makes it possible for an IntelliJ-based IDE like Rider to communicate with the stand-alone backend process serving as a language engine. We have now adapted this protocol and the original engine to CLion as well!</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>In this new and experimental solution, we’re focused on the responsiveness, accuracy, and performance of the IDE. There are two main goals we have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing the long-standing <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> issues of CLion caused by the usage of the “legacy” engine.</li>
<li>Unifying the user experience across all of our C++ tools, i.e. CLion, Rider, and ReSharper C++.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="CLion Nova About" width="531" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/about.png"></p>
<p>We named our new experimental preview <strong>CLion Nova,</strong> and the current version of CLion is now <strong>CLion Classic</strong>. In the future, we plan for CLion Nova to be merged into CLion Classic. No new product is envisaged.</p>
<h2 id="benefits_and_enhancements">Benefits and enhancements</h2>
<p>CLion Nova still uses two C++ language engines: a clangd-based one and the one used by ReSharper C++/Rider. Most of the features of CLion Classic should work exactly the same in CLion Nova.</p>
<p>The most notable benefits in terms of performance in CLion Nova are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster highlighting speeds, especially in the case of incremental code updates</li>
<li>A more responsive UI</li>
<li>Faster <em>Find Usages</em></li>
<li>Significantly fewer freezes and hangs in refactorings</li>
<li>Faster test indexing</li>
</ul>
<p>This unification also brings some new functions to CLion Nova that aren’t included in CLion Classic’s feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>New refactorings like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#intro_field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce field</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#namespace_alias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce namespace alias</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#using_enum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce using enumeration</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#convert_to_scoped" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to scoped enumeration</a>.</li>
<li>New inspections, quick-fixes, and intentions like redundant qualifier, the replace <code>auto</code> with explicit type declaration, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sorting of </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>#include</code></a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> directives</a>.</li>
<li>New code hints like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Settings_Inlay_Hints_CPP_Other.html#preprocessor-directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preprocessor directive hints</a>﻿ and a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Inline_Parameter_Name_Hints.html#push-to-hint-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push-to-Hint mode</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Sorting includes" width="600" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sort_includes.png"></p>
<h2 id="notable_differences">Notable differences</h2>
<p>Unlike CLion Classic, CLion Nova doesn’t use <strong>clangd</strong> for core IDE features like code completion or highlighting. However, the JetBrains’ clangd fork is still running alongside the new engine for various tasks (ClangFormat, Clang-Tidy, MISRA checks, data flow analysis, etc.).</p>
<p>There are a few things that will look and feel new to CLion Classic users when they start using CLion Nova:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the ways the IDE reacts when the user is typing are different.</li>
<li>Some UI elements and settings related to code insight features might look unusual or be found in unfamiliar locations.</li>
<li>Some code-related settings might have different default values in CLion Nova. On the first launch, CLion Nova will migrate some of your per-project and per-application settings from CLion Classic, but not all of them.</li>
<li>Switching between different language configurations (i.e. Debug/Release) might require more time for the code insight engine to catch up. There is also no option to switch resolve context per file.</li>
<li>ReSharper C++ is Windows-only, while Rider is cross-platform. Still, the ReSharper C++/Rider engine might not support non-Windows environments as seamlessly as a Windows one. It’s worth reporting such cases to us if you come across them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Type conversion hints settings" width="912" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/type_conversion_hints.png"></p>
<p>There’s also a list of currently missing functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toolchains</strong>: Several options exist to set up <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/remote-development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remote work</a> in CLion. Remote work with local sources is supported in CLion Nova, while remote work with a thin client (Gateway) is not yet available.</li>
<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Objective-C language, CUDA (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSCPP-613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSCPP-613</a>, <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-26144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-26144</a>), and some vendor-specific compiler extensions aren’t yet supported.</li>
<li>Some intentions and quick-fixes like <em>Simplify statement</em> are not supported at present (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35879</a>).</li>
<li>Some less popular refactorings are also missing. We plan to reintroduce the <em>Move</em> (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35867</a>) and <em>Inline Parameter</em> refactorings (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35868</a>) at a later date.</li>
<li>JetBrains’ AI Assistant is not yet available for CLion Nova.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how_to_install_clion_nova">How to install CLion Nova</h2>
<p>CLion Nova is a free early preview build available only via the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox App</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Toolbox app" width="427" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/toolbox_app.png"></p>
<p>CLion Nova is an Early Access Preview build, which means a login is required, but you can use it for free until CLion Nova merges into CLion. We’ll be publishing regular updates to CLion Nova, which will also be available via the Toolbox App.</p>
<p>Compared to CLion Classic, CLion Nova brings a more responsive UI, better overall IDE performance, and increased feature quality, especially with C++ code refactorings. Try it now and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>CLion Nova marks a big change and requires detailed testing in various environments. So we’re asking you, our users, for help! Given that you have a variety of environments and use cases, we want you to test out CLion Nova and share your experiences with us.</p>
<p>We are specifically interested in your thoughts on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What works better on your project in CLion Nova compared to CLion Classic?</li>
<li>What interrupts your workflow and prevents you from using the IDE in CLion Nova? Are these interruptions CLion Nova-specific, or are they also present in CLion Classic?</li>
</ul>
<p>After using CLion Nova for some time, you’ll be asked to submit a feedback form. We’d be grateful if you can spare the time to do so!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Feedback" width="688" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/feedback.png"></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-dateline="" data-subscriber-content="">  <p><span>SPATA, Greece&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span></p><p>In an olive grove on the outskirts of Athens, grower Konstantinos Markou pushes aside the shoots of new growth to reveal the stump of a tree — a roughly 150-year-old specimen, he said, that was among 15 cut down on his neighbor’s land by thieves eager to turn it into money.</p><p>Surging olive oil prices, driven in part by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-26/pray-for-rain-spanish-farmers-hold-unique-mass-amid-drought">two years of drought in Spain</a>, has meant opportunity for criminals across the Mediterranean. Warehouse break-ins, dilution of premium oil with inferior product and falsification of shipping data are on the rise in olive-growing heartlands of Greece, Spain and Italy. And perhaps worst of all: gangs using chainsaws to steal heavily laden branches and even entire trees from unguarded groves.</p><p>“The olive robbers can sometimes produce more oil than the owners themselves — seriously,” Markou said, before heading off to patrol his own grove at nightfall. </p><p>The crimes mean fewer olives for growers already contending with high production costs and climate changes that have brought warmer winters, major flooding and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-08-24/greece-wildfires-largest-ever-european-union">more intense forest fires</a>. In Italy’s southern Puglia region, growers are pleading with police to form an agriculture division. Greek farmers want to bring back a rural police division that was phased out in 2010. In Spain, a company has developed tracking devices that look like olives to try to catch thieves.</p><p>The groves outside Athens are part of an agricultural tradition that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-nov-26-fi-47925-story.html">stretches back to antiquity</a>, on plains that now surround the city’s international airport. Some trees are centuries old.</p><p>Most of the thefts are of branches. When an entire tree is cut down, the thieves typically chop it up and load the pieces into a pickup truck, taking the olives to an oil mill and selling the wood to lumberyards or firewood vendors.</p><p>The robbers “look for heavily loaded branches and they cut them,” said Neilos Papachristou, who runs an olive mill and nearby grove in a fourth-generation family business. “So, not only do they steal our olives, but they cause the tree serious harm. It takes four to five years for it to return to normal.”</p><p>The thefts are driving some growers to harvest early, which means accepting lower yields to avoid long-term damage to their trees. Christos Bekas was among the farmers at Papachristou’s mill who were dumping their crop into stainless steel loading bins, untying sacks and tipping over tall wicker baskets from the back of their pickup trucks.</p><p>Bekas, who owns 5,000 olive trees, suffered repeated raids by thieves before deciding to take an early harvest. That has meant needing 2½ times as much in the weight of the olives to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of oil as last year, he said.</p><p>“And all this after we’ve been spending nights guarding our fields,” he said. ”The situation is appalling.”</p><p>After decades of growth, the global olive oil market has been disrupted by a nearly <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-09-04/drought-europe-climate-change">two-year drought in Spain</a>, which typically accounts for about 40% of world supply. It’s expected to shrink global production to about 2.76 million tons this crop year, down from 3.75 million a year earlier.</p><p>Benchmark prices in Spain, Greece and Italy for extra virgin olive oil reached $4.35 per pound in September, more than triple their level in 2019.</p><p>That’s translated to higher prices for consumers. In Greece, a quart of extra virgin olive oil jumped from around $8 or $9 last year to as much as $15 this year.</p><p>Spanish police said in October that they had retrieved 100 tons of stolen olives in recent weeks. In February, six people were arrested in southern Greece for the theft of 8.8 tons of olive oil in a series of warehouse break-ins over several weeks.</p><p>Farmers around Italy’s southwestern port city of Bari say thieves have become increasingly brazen, snatching tractors and expensive equipment along with olives.</p><p>The regional agricultural association issued a plea for police assistance following reports that 100 olive trees were destroyed or seriously damaged in a single incident last month. Gennaro Sicolo, the association’s leader, called the economic damage “enormous” and said that “farmers must be protected.”</p><p>“This is a felony,” Markou, the grower near Athens, said of the tree-cutting. “You kill your own history here.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>After years of</span> searching for the perfect laptop—and making this search <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cheap-laptops/">part of my full-time job</a> here at WIRED—I've given up. I am sorry to say there is no such thing as the perfect laptop. There are too many variables at play, too many use cases to handle. All laptops have trade-offs.</p><p>There are, however, some that come close enough to perfect, and System76’s updated Lemur Pro is about as close to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-linux-laptops/">perfect Linux laptop</a> as you’re likely to get. Part of that is the simple, clean design, but much of it comes from the customization options. System76 has put in a lot of work in the firmware and software that ships with the Lemur Pro.</p><p>Hardware</p><p>System76’s Lemur Pro line is the company’s thin and light laptop. It’s not a gaming rig, nor would it be my top pick for a dedicated video editing station. (That said, I edited a ton of video on it. It’s certainly capable, if not optimized for video.) However, if you need a solid Linux laptop that’s light enough to carry with you everywhere you go, offers a ton of expansion possibilities, and just works, then the Lemur Pro should be almost everything you’re looking for.</p><figure><p><span><p>System76 Lemur Pro Laptop.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: System76</span></p></figure><native-ad position="in-content" shoulddisplaylabel="true"></native-ad><p>The Lemur Pro is a 14-inch all-around laptop that’s thin and lightweight. At just 2.5 pounds and 0.54 inches thick, you can slide the Lemur Pro in a small bag and forget you’re even carrying it. System76 makes larger, more powerful laptops if you need one, but the Lemur Pro is the ultraportable one in the lineup.</p><p>The latest iteration of the Lemur Pro arrived earlier this year, with new 13th-generation Intel chips inside. The Lemur Pro starts at $1,150 for an Intel i5 machine with 8 GB of RAM and a 256-GB SSD. The model I tested had a 5-GHz Intel Core i7 chip (1355U), 16 GB of RAM, a 250-GB SSD OS drive, and a 1-TB SSD for storage. That brought the price to $1,474.</p><p>The price is reasonable for the hardware (if perhaps a tad high), but part of what you’re paying for is System76’s excellent support for Linux, which is hard to come by in cheaper options. The Lemur Pro base model is also user-upgradeable, so if you already have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-portable-external-storage-drives/#six">a few PCIe SSDs</a> and some RAM lying about, you could upgrade the Lemur yourself.</p><figure><p><span><p>System76 Lemur Pro Laptop.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

<p><span>2023-11-06</span> Earlier this year in July, Servo received a NLnet grant to enhance several aspects of Servo.</p>

<div>
  <p>We are excited to announce that earlier this year in July, Servo received a <strong><a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Servo/">NLnet grant</a></strong> to enhance several aspects of Servo. Under this grant, our primary focus is to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete float support in Servo</strong></li>
<li><strong>Support more languages in inline layout</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add initial &lt;table&gt; support</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="floats" tabindex="-1">Floats <a href="#floats">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>Supporting floats in Servo is an ongoing effort since mid-2023. We’ve made significant progress on floats, but there are still some issues that need to be addressed before Servo can boast a fully-compliant implementation of CSS floats.</p>
<p>Our objective is to achieve an average pass rate of over 80% for <code>/css/CSS2/floats/</code> and <code>/css/CSS2/floats-clear/</code>. You can track the results on our <strong><a href="https://wpt.servo.org/">WPT dashboard</a></strong></p>
<p>Last week, we surpassed this for the floats tests, with an 82.2% WPT pass rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/floats-2023-11-06.png" alt="Image showing web platform test result for floats, that is 82.2%"></p><p>We’re also nearing the milestone for floats-clear, currently at a 73.3% pass rate:</p>
<p><img src="https://servo.org/img/blog/floats-clear-2023-11-06.png" alt="Image showing web platform test result for floats-clear, that is 73.3%"></p><h2 id="more-languages-in-inline-layout" tabindex="-1">More languages in inline layout <a href="#more-languages-in-inline-layout">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>Servo’s layout engine lacks crucial features for rendering languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet. This includes proper font selection, support for right-to-left scripts, and logical properties. Our aim is to improve Servo’s support for displaying a wider variety of content.</p>
<h2 id="initial-%3Ctable%3E-support" tabindex="-1">Initial &lt;table&gt; support <a href="#initial-%3Ctable%3E-support">
        <span><i></i></span>
      </a></h2>
<p>HTML tables are an important and widely used feature. Servo’s new layout engine doesn’t support tables yet, which leads to incorrect layout of many web pages. Under this scope, our main focus is to implement initial support for tables in Servo, so that it can render tables used on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As we progress and achieve these milestones, we’ll cover them in more detail in subsequent blog posts. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>Since we first introduced <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/AbanteAI/mentat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mentat</a>, GPT-4 has been the default model. While Mentat can run with GPT-3.5 or even local models, GPT-4’s higher quality code edits are well worth the extra cost. We are excited to unlock GPT-4 Turbo's full potential — being 2-3x cheaper and having a significantly larger context — but does it match the quality of GPT-4, especially for editing code?<!-- --></p><h2>Benchmarking GPT-4 Turbo</h2><p>To answer this question, we ran both GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo on our <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/AbanteAI/mentat/blob/main/tests/benchmarks/exercism_practice.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercism benchmarks</a>, compiled from a set of 122 <!-- --><a href="https://exercism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exercism</a> programming exercises. We ran GPT-4 on each task and gave it two tries to succeed (on the second attempt, it is shown why it failed). GPT-4 ended up solving 86/122, or 70%, of the JavaScript exercises.<!-- --></p><p>Running that same benchmark with GPT-4 Turbo we got 84/122, or 68.8% of the exercises. Slightly worse, but close enough that it could just be statistical noise. But wait! Looking closer at the results there was a significant difference: GPT-4 solved 76 on the first try and only an additional 10 on the second attempt, while GPT-4 Turbo only solved 56 on the first try and solved an additional 28 on the second attempt.</p><h2>Interpreting Results</h2><p>Why would GPT-4 Turbo solve fewer tasks on the first attempt? We examined individual exercises and the code it wrote for them and found that it often wrote reasonable solutions but failed on the first attempt due to unclear or ambiguous instructions. But then how does GPT-4 solve them? Our theory was that GPT-4 had substantially memorized the Exercism training tasks, but that when GPT-4 was downsized (most likely through distillation) to GPT-4 Turbo, it lost some of this raw memorization capability.</p><p>We designed a test for this theory: we reran the benchmarks without showing the models the instructions to each exercise. Instead, we just told them that they were Exercism exercises, and gave them the exercise names and function stubs. This is not enough to solve the problem unless the model has it memorized. Due to rate limits on GPT-4 Turbo, we only ran the first 40 exercises. GPT-4 solved 23/40, or 57.5%, on the first try and an additional 5 on the second try. GPT-4 Turbo, on the other hand, only solved 12/40, or 30%, on the first try and an additional 11 on the second try. We interpret this as confirming that GPT-4 has more of the exercises memorized than GPT-4-Turbo.</p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,aoa9JDugtTsDNSAVzXKgW8vq1o.png" data-framer-height="878" data-framer-width="1330" height="439" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/aoa9JDugtTsDNSAVzXKgW8vq1o.png" width="665"></p><p>Our results seem similar to <!-- --><a href="https://twitter.com/wangzjeff/status/1721934560919994823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this finding</a>:<!-- --></p><p><img alt="" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,xOoj8r4n0N1TQ4Px32I4PlhECz8.png" data-framer-height="2584" data-framer-width="1262" height="1292" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/xOoj8r4n0N1TQ4Px32I4PlhECz8.png" width="631"></p><p>Although the author OCR’ed the SAT questions and believes that they weren’t in the training data, we believe it’s fairly likely that these questions – and definitely some incredibly similar questions – ended up in the training data at some point, making the drop in GPT-4 Turbo's measured performance hard to interpret.</p><h2>Future Benchmarks</h2><p>Benchmarks derived from content in GPT’s training data are still valuable for determining how good GPT is at responding in the correct edit format, as well as comparing fine-tuned models to each other. But these results make it pretty clear that they aren’t an accurate test for comparing models trained on separate datasets or distilled models – which is what we suspect GPT-4 Turbo is.</p><p>These results emphasize the need for better benchmarks, something we've already begun building for Mentat: real world, realistic coding tasks based on recent commits to open source repositories that were made after the training cutoff. Although no benchmark will ever be perfect, we are confident that these improvements will help us gauge the relative accuracy of different models in the future.</p></div></div>]]></description>

When its findings were shared with senior managers, his concerns were dismissed as unfounded and he was ordered to cease the investigation.</p><p>Rather than drop it, the spy took the extraordinary step of beginning to secretly record conversations with colleagues. Conversations about the NSA partnership with Denmark’s most senior spymasters, including Lars Findsen, appear to have been among those captured over a period of several years.</p><p>Today, Findsen is sharply critical of the officer and says there was “no basis” for his actions. He was, he says, “unhinged and had his own narrative”.</p><figure id="47e4580f-ece1-420e-bb44-9a8337f79669" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4168c0308ffeb41fda8249bc1d9270d7dd0c8bde/360_474_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4168c0308ffeb41fda8249bc1d9270d7dd0c8bde/360_474_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4168c0308ffeb41fda8249bc1d9270d7dd0c8bde/360_474_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4168c0308ffeb41fda8249bc1d9270d7dd0c8bde/360_474_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4168c0308ffeb41fda8249bc1d9270d7dd0c8bde/360_474_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4168c0308ffeb41fda8249bc1d9270d7dd0c8bde/360_474_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Claus Hjort Frederiksen (left) at home, with Lars Findsen" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4168c0308ffeb41fda8249bc1d9270d7dd0c8bde/360_474_7728_4637/master/7728.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.011516563147" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Claus Hjort Frederiksen (left) at home, with Lars Findsen.</span> Photograph: Ritzau/Jacob Ehrbahn/Scanpix/Alamy Live News.</figcaption></figure><p>In late 2019, the officer’s concerns found their way to the independent oversight body that supervises Danish intelligence, which took possession of his secret recordings – as many as 100 hours of audio – as well as the internal Dunhammer report. Behind closed doors, the spy had turned whistleblower.</p><h2 id="a-historic-scandal">A ‘historic scandal’?</h2><p>In August 2020, “all hell broke loose”, a former intelligence official recalls. The independent watchdog, led by a senior judge, revealed in a brief statement that it had obtained a large amount of material from a whistleblower and listed a series of incendiary allegations about how the DDIS spy service was operating.</p><p>Among its findings, the body warned there were “risks in the central part of DDIS’s intelligence gathering capabilities that unauthorised intelligence has been gathered on Danish citizens”. The statement was not explicit, but according to former officials this was a reference to data collected under the NSA cable-tapping programme.</p><p>The fallout was immediate. Findsen and several colleagues at the agency were placed on indefinite leave. “It was not a nice situation,” says Findsen.</p><p>The media branded the findings a “historic scandal” and suggested the spies were working outside the law, effectively acting as a “state within a state”. As one front page read: “Spy chiefs accused of illegal surveillance”.</p><figure id="b914bf86-8516-44bc-9746-6c12a5c1f0bb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Lars Findsen in Copenhagen in December 2017" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f369adc06103f91f79ca7cf9bb04aceae103d075/0_15_3616_2169/master/3616.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.9261615044248" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Lars Findsen in Copenhagen in December 2017.</span> Photograph: Liselotte Sabroe/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Responding to the coverage, Frederiksen, who had left the defence ministry a year earlier, defended Findsen and the other officials. “This is what triggered my involvement in this case,” Frederiksen says. “I knew them as loyal employees, dedicated and honest people, who were unjustly labelled as having done something wrong.”</p><p>In September 2020, Frederiksen publicly criticised the decision to publish the watchdog’s findings and, crucially, while defending the DDIS employees he appeared to provide the first on-the-record confirmation of the existence of the cable-tapping deal with the US glimpsed in the Snowden leaks.</p><p>Frederiksen acknowledged the arrangement again in subsequent interviews and went further in another media appearance in December 2021. “I’m going to be careful what I can say, otherwise I’ll risk a prison sentence,” he said on live TV before remarking that Denmark “greatly benefits from being allied with the NSA”.</p><p>Shortly before the interview, a government-appointed panel of judges had rejected the independent watchdog’s findings, seemingly drawing a line under the controversy.</p><p>Behind the scenes, there had been a remarkable twist. People close to Findsen were suddenly unable to contact him. It was as though he’d disappeared.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-42">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-42" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>What only a few in Denmark knew was that, days earlier, a group of armed officers had stopped the spy chief at Copenhagen airport and, before anyone could notice, quietly arrested him.</p><h2 id="microphones-were-everywhere">‘Microphones were everywhere’</h2><p>Speaking to the Guardian as he prepares for trial, Findsen appears relaxed, though there is undoubtedly a quiet anger as he describes the events of the past three years.</p><p>Released from prison in February 2022 after 70 days in custody, Findsen technically remains head of the spy agency DDIS, albeit suspended and on two-thirds salary. He says he cannot be certain he’s not still under surveillance.</p><p>Suddenly finding himself in prison, he says, was strange. “There were no other spy chiefs,” he jokes. He says he established good relations with the other prisoners. “They were much younger than me. They were there for things like drugs, arms dealing and kidnapping, so it was a different environment for me.”</p><p>Findsen’s close ties to the domestic service, which he previously ran after 9/11, added to the sense of betrayal when he came to understand colleagues had authorised a surveillance operation against him, which he believes lasted for more than a year.</p><p>“The microphones were everywhere,” he says, not just in his kitchen and living rooms, but in his car and holiday home.</p><p>In custody, he was shown the surveillance reports being used as evidence against him. His daily family life was described in the kind of documents he’d spent a career in intelligence reading. “I was talking to my children when they came back from school and things like that.”</p><p>Perhaps unusually for a spy chief, Findsen had developed relationships with journalists, on which he’s believed to have relied to counter negative stories about DDIS once sent home in 2020 after the watchdog’s damning statement.</p><p>Prosecutors allege that Findsen shared state secrets with two reporters, as well as close relatives, his girlfriend and an old friend. Much about the case remains shrouded in secrecy but Danish journalists reported last year that prosecutors allege Findsen’s conversations related to the NSA cable-tapping partnership.</p><p>In April 2021, for example, he is alleged to have spoken to his 84-year-old mother about the whistleblower who raised the alarm about the deal. Many of the conversations, it is alleged, risked causing “significant damage” to Denmark’s “security and relations with foreign powers”. Unable to discuss the specific charges, Findsen describes them as “crazy and ridiculous”.</p><p>As for the whistleblower, he remains an elusive protagonist at the heart of the affair. Now in his 40s, he’s never spoken publicly. He no longer works at DDIS and appears to be living a quiet life in the countryside running a small cybersecurity business. He did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.</p><h2 id="state-secrets-in-the-public-domain">State secrets in the public domain</h2><p>In December 2021, a week after the Frederiksen, the former minister, mentioned the NSA cable-tapping deal on television, police officers turned up at his home. Standing outside the thatched fisherman’s cottage, the officers informed the 76-year-old he’d been charged with treason.</p><p>The charges have been brought under a section of the criminal code last used against an East German Stasi agent in 1979. It is the same law that is being used in Findsen’s case but Frederiksen is accused of disclosing classified information in media appearances rather than in private. He denies revealing state secrets in the interviews, since the information he shared – which he can no longer repeat – had been in the public domain since the 2014 Snowden story.</p><figure id="6dc0ebcf-05ca-44a6-ae3e-c5d48f382bd8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Edward Snowden" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d803ef9687ac444cfa342c1949a3c2a0fce97513/248_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed how European countries such as Denmark help facilitate the US’s globe-spanning electronic surveillance.</span> Illustration: Joseph Pierce/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>“The present government is of the opinion that a secret is a secret,” Frederiksen says. “It might have been described in the newspapers, but they still say it’s a secret.” In court, the trial is expected to turn on whether an open secret can still be a state secret.</p><p>The paradox in both cases is that Findsen and Frederiksen, according to people who know them, are staunch believers in DDIS’s US partnership and proud of its special relationship with the NSA.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><span>Y</span>esterday I was rudely summoned away from a beautiful autumn day of wild foraging by The King.</p>
<p>Specifically, I was given a heads-up about one of the bills which would be in yesterday’s King’s Speech – the first of the King’s reign, and the first and only one of Rishi Sunak’s time in office.</p>
<p>The bill in question is the Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill, the outcome of a consultation held over the summer, which I obviously missed being out of work. (Neil Brown <a href="https://decoded.legal/blog/2023/06/consultation-on-changes-to-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016s-notices-regime/">did not miss one word</a> from his tech lawyer perspective, and TechUK <a href="https://www.techuk.org/resource/as-the-government-reviews-the-investigatory-powers-act-s-notices-regime-it-is-vital-we-maintain-proper-checks-and-balances-to-protect-privacy.html">were equally diligent</a> from the service provider perspective.) There was also an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-the-investigatory-powers-act-2016--2">independent review</a> which requires prior knowledge of the IPA.</p>
<p>The problem is that aside from the rather legalistic topics dealt with in the summer consultation and independent review, some of which do indeed have merit, the politicians have stepped in.</p>

<p>What we learned yesterday is that the Bill aims to</p>
<ul>
<li>Force technology companies to inform the Home Office in advance of security and privacy features they want to add, including encryption, and force them to disable features which the government objects to;</li>
<li>Increase the power of the Home Office to force non-UK companies to comply with changes it wants them to make to security features without the right to appeal; and</li>
<li>Require companies to comply with a notice before any requested review is completed, depriving companies of the opportunity to seek a review of the appropriateness of notices before being obliged to follow them.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://x.com/katebevan/status/1721861707868324062?s=20">The adoring public was not impressed</a>.</p>
<p>And yes, this all dovetails with the Online Safety Act, in ways I will make no attempt to parse out over morning coffee.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/654a21952f045e001214dcd7/The_King_s_Speech_background_briefing_notes.pdf">official speech souvenir handout</a> noted how these asks will be framed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make changes to the bulk personal dataset regime to ensure the UK’s intelligence agencies can more effectively make use of less sensitive data, which is already widely available to the public, subject to appropriate safeguards</li>
<li>Expand the oversight regime to support the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to effectively carry out their role, including putting a number of their functions on a statutory basis. This will maintain the robust, transparent, and world-leading safeguards in the regime.</li>
<li>Reform the notices regime, to help the UK anticipate the risk to public safety posed by the rolling out of technology by multinational companies that precludes lawful access to data. This will reduce the risk of the most serious offences such as child sexual exploitation and abuse or terrorism</li>
<li>Update the conditions for use of Internet Connections Records to ensure that these can be used effectively to detect the most serious types of criminal activity and national security threats, underpinned by a robust independent oversight regime</li>
<li>Increase the resilience of the warrantry authorisation processes to ensure the security and intelligence agencies, as well as the National Crime Agency, can always get lawful access to information in a timely way so that they can respond to the most serious national security and organised crime threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ve probably been reading this blog long enough to know how the sausage gets made. These asks, which go well beyond the hair-splitting legal minutiae of the summer consultation and of the independent review, were asks thrown in by the authoritarian wing of the Home Office, who are obviously still enraged that they failed to regulate the entire open internet around Meta via the <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2023/04/17/greatest-hits-b-sides-and-unfinished-demo-tracks-or-all-my-blogging-on-the-online-safety-bill/">Online Safety Act</a>.</p>
<p>And let’s state the obvious here: that’s what this is bill about.</p>
<p><em>While we don’t know what is actually in the bill, as it doesn’t exist yet</em>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f92f62-9895-4ff4-9e4a-659d217dc9af">it’s already clear</a> that this is the latest salvo in government’s <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2020/12/09/facebook-derangement-syndrome/">Meta Vendetta</a>.</p>
<p>You would think that they’d have learned their lesson from spending six years crafting world-leadingly bad legislation around the obsession with getting one company, its suite of products, and its executive leadership (which just happens to include their former political enemy number one).</p>
<p>But this is Conservative digital policymaking we’re talking about. <a href="https://x.com/WebDevLaw/status/1721066591641592255?s=20">It learns nothing from its mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>So without knowing the contents, one thing’s for sure: the sharpest minds on these issues across law, policy, tech, and digital rights need to saddle up for yet another year of going into government meetings, in good faith, with notes prepared and talking points honed, so that they can be shouted at for 58 minutes about Meta, and leave with nothing accomplished.</p>
<p>Plus ça change.</p>
<p>And while everyone obviously needs to show up for this Bill, and yes that includes the people who don’t show up for anything because “politics”, it’s also worth remembering the <em>actual</em> politics of the thing.</p>
<p>First, we will be having a general election no later than January 2025, one which is going to wipe the Conservatives into the third party. That’s why the King’s Speech was so strikingly <em>meh</em>: it’s all tinkering and technocracy to fill twelve months of time, as opposed to the post-EU revolutionary bombast we’ve seen in recent years. And while the public knows full well that the Conservatives are openly shitting the bed on their way out, knowing it will be someone else’s responsibility to change the sheets, they’re not dumb. And certainly not about a bill like this.</p>
<p>Second, while the Home Office has been a rogue outfit for a long time, it’s currently headed by a racist lunatic who, by all accounts from the Westminster gossip chain, is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67344806">deliberately trolling the town</a> <em>so that</em> she can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/tory-insiders-suggest-suella-braverman-trying-to-get-sacked">get sacked</a> <em>so that</em> she can work up her leadership challenge to Rishi Sunak. (Yes, there are people who dream of a Braverman-led UK and a Trump-led US. They work hard. They’re working right now.) And what better way to gum up the works for your political rival, who’s riding high on the global AI summit he led last week, than by introducing a law that would <a href="https://x.com/marypcbuk/status/1722003706332209653?s=20">make it impossible</a> for anyone anywhere to do any tech of any kind?</p>
<p>By the way, if you think it isn’t possible for the integrity of the open internet to fall victim, via bad legislation, to backstabbing Tory power grabs, what do you think I’ve been working on since 2016? Like I said. This garbage is what the sharpest tech policy minds in the UK have been dealing with for seven years. Not the work they were born to do.</p>
<p>So while we wait for the IP(A)A to be published, let’s all read up, form up, strategise, and get this right, so that what’s good about the IP(A)A gets sorted and what’s bad about the IP(A)A gets put in the bin. Quickly, cleanly, and definitively.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side: you’ve just had six years of practice.</p>
<p>An aside because fuck yeah I am going there: the IPA and IPCO were one of four disparate policy portfolios I held in my brief stint in a digital rights organisation, on a salary of £28k per year, a salary which in the end they could not sustain for an entire year. Imagine getting up to speed with all of that, above, back to front, including building a relationship with IPCO all for nothing, on a few hours a month, for net pay of less than £500 pcm for that work, in a work environment which was, as they say, suboptimal. It is well past time to have the ugly conversation about how the resourcing and leadership of UK digital rights organisations is failing to contribute to the solution and, indeed, is now becoming part of the problem. </p>

        <p>Don’t want a big old bloated multi-kilobyte executable with a data segment, but you do need to store some data?</p>
<p>I "discovered" this while working on <a href="https://ratfactor.com/meow5/">Meow5</a>.</p>
<p>One of my biggest challenges has been storing strings in a position-independent
way. I’ve considered a Global Offset Table (GOT), but it seems like <strong>way</strong> more
machinery than I need. And though I went well
<a href="https://ratfactor.com/repos/mez/">out of my way</a>
to figure out how to make multi-segment ELF executables, I just couldn’t bear
to export a "huge" 2kb+ padded file with the proper alignment.</p>
<p>So I was determined to store strings in a Forth-style manner - embedding them with the executable code and jumping over them.</p>
<p>To do this was going to be a lot of painful trial-and-error to get the exact right opcodes compiled in place to push the address of the string on the stack followed by a <code>jmp</code> instruction to hop over the string (gotta know the length first, then come back and write the instruction).</p>
<p>The thing that makes this <em>extra</em> hard is that 32-bit i386 doesn’t have an instruction for getting the value of the instruction pointer (EIP) directly. (x86_64 added this later.)</p>
<p>But I realized something: there <em>is</em> an instruction that pushes the following address on the stack and then jumps to a location. It’s <code>call</code>.</p>
<p>So I made a little stand-alone NASM assembly "Hello world" test as a proof of concept. I realized I can even get the length of the string by subtracting the offset of my call’d label from the return address:</p>
<div>
<pre>global _start
_start:

    ; call pushes the next address on the stack
    ; so we could "return" there
    call print

    ; this gets jumped over, but we've got the address!
    db `Hello World!\n`

print:
    ; Print with Linux SYS_WRITE
    ; pop the address from the stack to ecx
    pop ecx        ; string address
    mov edx, print ; label address
    sub edx, ecx   ; length of string!
    mov     ebx, 1 ; STDOUT
    mov     eax, 4 ; SYS_WRITE
    int     80h

    ; Exit with Linux SYS_EXIT
    mov ebx, 0 ; return status
    mov eax, 1 ; SYS_EXIT
    int 80h    ; kernel syscall</pre>
</div>
<p>Let’s build it:</p>
<div>
<pre>$ nasm -f elf32 -o hello.o hello.asm
$ ld -m elf_i386 -n hello.o -o hello</pre>
</div>
<p>Without a data segment, this executable is truly tiny, just 532 bytes.</p>
<div>
<pre>$ ls -l hello
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dave users 532 Nov  8 20:58 hello</pre>
</div>
<p>And does it work?</p>

<p>Of course. :-)</p>
<p>I’m sure this trick is well-known and has a name and everything, but it’s new
to me.</p>
<p>I was really pleased with how nice and neat it turned out and it’s definitely
going straight into Meow5, which should allow me to finally finish that
project.</p>

<p>When Anna Carin Elf arrived at her workplace in Gothenburg, she immediately realized something was not right. She works at a library, and she was greeted by several visitors, just like any other day. But this was not any other day — the library was supposed to be closed.</p>



<p>“They were surprised. They thought it was a bit empty,” <a href="https://www.dn.se/sverige/biblioteket-var-stangt-lanade-bocker-anda/">she says</a>. “The people in the library behaved as usual. Many were sitting reading newspapers, some families were in the children’s section and others were searching for books on the computer.”</p>




<p>The library was supposed to be closed for All Saints Day — a celebration sometimes also called <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/culture/culture-society/a-short-history-of-halloween/">All Hallows Day, the precursor of Halloween</a>. But the library staff had forgotten to close a door. So people came in, thinking the library was open. Some visitors <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">realized the library</a> was technically closed and went home, but others did not.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->
 





<p>As people were coming in and out of the library, one librarian (Elf) walked by and noticed the people using the library. She realized what was happening, called her manager and a colleague, and then announced that the library was closing. The visitors calmly folded their books closed and left. </p>



<p>But some left with books.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent_3 -->




<p>During that day, 446 people visited the city library. A total of 246 books were borrowed. To date, all the books have been returned.</p>



<p>Through a door mistakenly left ajar, the people of Gothenburg demonstrated the power of community and the value they place on the guardianship of shared resources. It was a quiet revolution, an act of civil responsibility that spoke volumes, reaffirming the notion that a library is much more than a building; it is a cornerstone of community, education, and trust.</p>



<p>The City Library published a loving post, thanking people for their well-behaved visits. “Thank you for Saturday, dear Gothenburg,” the library’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/859585461/gothenburg-public-library/">post read</a>.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->








<p>“It felt good that everyone behaved exactly as usual, they borrowed books, read the newspaper and so on… the citizens of Gothenburg take care of their library. There is obviously a desire to be there,” said one of the library’s visitors, Arvid Jadenius, <a href="https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/arvid-var-en-av-hundratals-inne-p%C3%A5-ol%C3%A5sta-biblioteket-1.114743762">for a local publisher</a>.</p>



<p>In a world often marred by headlines of chaos and discord, the story of Gothenburg’s library stands as a testament to the inherent good in society — and shows that libraries truly are one of the beacons of our society. It seems almost poetic that on All Saints Day, a day of remembrance and reverence, the citizens of Gothenburg would unknowingly participate in an act of collective respect and honor for their beloved library.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2666077708" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductor" data-authors="Charles Q. Choi" data-headline="Researchers Uncover the Fastest Semiconductor Yet" data-page-title="Researchers Uncover the Fastest Semiconductor Yet - IEEE Spectrum"><p>Scientists have discovered what they say is the fastest and most efficient semiconductor yet. Although the new material is made using one of the rarest elements on Earth, the researchers suggest counterparts made from more abundant materials may be discovered that operate comparably fast.<br></p><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">Semiconductors</a> underpin virtually all modern electronics. However, as commonplace as they’ve become, semiconductors still face constraints when it comes to their speed.</p><p>One reason for these speed limits has to do with atomic vibrations, which travel as quasiparticles known as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cryogenics" target="_self">phonons</a> within solid materials. Phonons can scatter the particles that carry energy and information around electronics. These are typically electrons, but are sometimes more exotic particles, such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-magnet" target="_self">excitons</a> (electrons bound to their positively charged quasiparticle counterparts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_hole" target="_blank">electron holes</a>).</p><p>In a new study that overcame the problems that phonons can cause, researchers experimented with a semiconductor made out of Re6Se8Cl2—a molecule built out of rhenium, selenium, and chlorine. The semiconductor’s atoms form clusters called “superatoms” that each behave like one big atom, but with different properties than the elements used to build them. Each cluster consists of an octahedron made of six rhenium atoms nestled within a cube made of eight selenium atoms, with a chlorine atom on the top and bottom of the cluster.</p><p>“Now that we know what structural and electronic properties are needed...there is good likelihood that we will find earth-abundant alternatives to this rhenium-based material.” <strong>—Milan Delor, Columbia University</strong></p><p>When excitons come in contact with phonons in Re6Se8Cl2, instead of scattering, they actually bind together, forming new quasiparticles called acoustic exciton-polarons. These quasiparticles are capable of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/molybdenumdisulfide-2d-transistors-go-ballistic" target="_self">ballistic</a>, or scatter-free, flow.</p><p>In experiments at room temperature, acoustic exciton-polarons in Re6Se8Cl2 moved twice as fast as electrons in silicon. This is the first material in which anyone has detected sustained room-temperature ballistic exciton movement.</p><p>Electrons in semiconductors usually scatter after traveling just nanometers, on a timescale measured in femtoseconds. In contrast, the acoustic exciton-polarons in Re6Se8Cl2 successfully crossed several micrometers (about 3 orders of magnitude farther) over the course of a nanosecond (about 6 orders of magnitude longer). Given that polarons can last for about 11 nanoseconds, the scientists think that acoustic exciton-polarons could cover more than 25 micrometers before scattering.</p><p>These quasiparticles are controlled by light rather than by an electric current. This means processing speeds in devices based on them could reach femtoseconds, a million times as fast as the speeds achievable with current gigahertz electronics.</p><p>The researchers did not originally test Re6Se8Cl2 thinking it would prove a new and improved semiconductor. Instead, they were testing lab microscopes on a material they had thought should not have conducted much of anything. They ended up seeing the fastest semiconductor they had ever seen, says study senior author Milan Delor, a physical chemist at Columbia University in New York City.</p><p>After two years of work, Delor and his colleagues now believe they understand why Re6Se8Cl2 displays such extraordinary behavior. As it turns out, excitons in this semiconductor move very slowly compared to electrons in silicon. However, this means that the excitons can pair up with equally slow-moving phonons. The resulting quasiparticles are “heavy,” meaning they move slowly but steadily. In contrast, electrons are “light,” meaning they bounce around too much to actually travel very far or fast in the end.</p><p>Re6Se8Cl2 is also, along with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-battery-no-anode" target="_self">graphite</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/memristor-ai-chip-hybrid" target="_self">hexagonal boron nitride</a>, what’s called a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/phonon" target="_self">van der Waals material</a>. These materials are made of stacked films of smooth, atomically thin layers held together by weak electric forces known as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-microscope-nanoscale-mri" target="_self">van der Waals interactions</a>, the same forces that often make adhesive tapes sticky. Previous research has suggested that when atom-thin sheets of different van der Waals materials are placed on top of each other to form so-called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/vanderwaals-heterostructure-flash-memory-5000-times-speedier" target="_self">heterostructures</a>, novel hybrid properties can emerge.</p><p>One major problem that Re6Se8Cl2 faces is that rhenium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. This makes Re6Se8Cl2 very expensive and unlikely to ever make its way into a commercial product.</p><p>However, Re6Se8Cl2 belongs to a family of superatomic semiconductors that share structural and electronic properties. Many of these materials are made of more abundant elements. This includes a recently discovered all-carbon material named<strong></strong><a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/graphullerene-exists" target="_blank">graphullerene</a>, which resembles balls of carbon arranged in sheets.</p><p>“Now that we know what structural and electronic properties are needed to achieve the new transport regime discovered in this work, there is good likelihood that we will find earth-abundant alternatives to this rhenium-based material that also show impressive transport properties,” Delor says.</p><p>All in all, the researchers suggest acoustic exciton-polarons “could be a general way to achieve long-range energy flow in different materials that traditionally would not be expected to show good transport properties,” Delor says. “It’s a surprising finding that we’re looking forward to applying to more systems.”</p><p>Another caveat of this work is that it relies on excitons instead of electrons. “Although excitons carry information and energy just like electrons, they are not necessarily compatible with current hardware used in the semiconductor industry,” Delor says. Therefore, the applications for these semiconductors “would likely be different than those for traditional semiconductors.”</p><p>Potential devices made from these semiconductors may include “ballistic transistors” that use excitons instead of electrons. These could serve as very efficient light detectors, or find use in computing to reduce energy losses and increase performance, Delor says.</p><p>The scientists detailed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2698" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their findings</a> in the 27 October issue of the journal <em>Science</em>.</p><div><p>From Your Site Articles</p><ul><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cosmic-ray-failures-of-power-semiconductor-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Ray Failures of Power Semiconductor Devices - IEEE ... ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chips-act-workforce-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Universities Are Building a New Semiconductor Workforce ... ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/gallium-oxide-the-supercharged-semiconductor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallium Oxide: The Supercharged Semiconductor - IEEE Spectrum ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/best-semiconductor-boron-arsenide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is This the Best Semiconductor Ever Found? ›</a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Sony has announced the Alpha 9 Mark III, the world's first full-frame camera with a global shutter. It can shoot at 120 fps with no blackout and a maximum shutter speed of 1/80,000 sec.</p>
<p>It's a 24.6MP camera that Sony says doesn't compromise on ISO performance or dynamic range. The camera has a base ISO of 250 though, which is likely to mean that its DR is comparable to existing cameras at that sensitivity setting. The global shutter means photos with zero distortion of movement. It promises 8EV of in-body stabilization.</p>

<p>The a9 III is built around the latest Bionz XR processors, giving eight times as much processing power as was present in the a9 II.</p>
<p>The a9 III can shoot 120 fps with full AF conducting calculations between each shot. It can continue this for 1.6secs of 14-bit Raw files: 192 frames and 6GB/s. It can pre-buffer for up to 1 sec, giving a preemptive 120 frames of pre-capture. The camera includes a 'Speed Boost' custom button to prompt the camera to jump from a slower rate up to 120 fps.</p>
<p>Sony has published a list of lenses able to shoot at 120fps with full AE and AF in AF-C mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="IMG_7314.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7314.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>CMOS sensors with a global shutter have been available for several years but haven't been able to offer as much dynamic range as conventional, progressive-scan designs. The emergence of Stacked CMOS technology allows the photo diode and readout circuitry to be built as separate layers, providing more space for the readout circuitry without cutting so much into the sensor's capacity to store electrons (which can limit dynamic range).</p>
<p>Sony isn't giving detail of the sensor but it appears to be a two-layer design, not the <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/news/2021/2021121601.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three-layer approach</a> being used for some smartphone sensors. This might explain the base ISO of 250, which will ultimately limit the camera's maximum dynamic range. Sony isn't quoting a DR figure for the camera. Unlike the original a9, the a9 III includes the ability to shoot in S-Log3, with base ISO jumping by 3 stops to ISO 2000, to facilitate its greater degree of highlight capture.</p>
<p>The global shutter means the a9 III can sync at up to 1/80,000 sec and eliminates the need for High Speed Sync, and allows this feature with third-party flashes. It also means there's no risk of banding from artificial lights, but the camera has an 'Anti-Flicker' mode that syncs the shutter with the bright point in the light's cycle, to avoid inconsistent exposure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="443" src="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="IMG_7316_1.jpeg" srcset="https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/IMG_7316_1.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>It's rated to focus down to -5EV with an F1.8 aperture lens. It adds smaller AF points, alongside Sony's subject recognition modes.</p>
<p>On the video side, it can shoot 4K/60p taken from 6K capture and 4K/120p without any crop. It includes options such as 10-bit 4:2:2 capture, the S-Cinetone profile and '16-bit' Raw video output over HDMI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg" target="article-7271416294"><img data-thumbnail-height="0" data-thumbnail-width="590" height="395" src="https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg" width="590" data-filename="DSC07594.jpeg" srcset="https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/7271416294/DSC07594.jpeg 2x"></a></p>
<p>The a9 III has a 2M-dot 3.2" rear screen with full articulation and a tilt-out cradle. It's the same setup as the a7R V and includes an LCD panel which covers the DCI P3 color gamut. It features a 9.44M dot OLED viewfinder with 0.9x magnification. It can run at full resolution at 120fps or with a reduced resolution at 240fps.</p>
<p>Sony says it's moved the shutter button to improve ergonomics, as well as adding a fifth function button to the front of the camera. The difference is immediately apparent when you pick the camera up: the grip tilts your hand backwards slightly, giving a comfortable grip and putting the shutter button immediately under your finger.</p>
<p>The optional battery grip's ergonomics have also been reworked and the battery performance boosted by 15% by treating the two included batteries as a single entity, rather than discharging one and then the other.</p>

<p>The a9 III will be available from Spring 2024 at a recommended price of $5999.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="global">What is a global shutter?</h3>
<p>Global shutter is a method of ending an exposure where all the image data is captured simultaneously. This is distinct from most existing shutter systems (electronic and mechanical) that start and end progressively: working their way across the sensor.</p>
<p>There are multiple benefits to such a system, with the most obvious being the elimination of the rolling shutter distortion effect often seen on video and with slow electronic (progressive) shutters.</p>
<p>But another major benefit is that a global shutter can sync with flash at almost any shutter speed. With global shutter it's the duration of the flash burst that becomes the limitation, rather than the length of time it takes to close the shutter (which in turn dictates the shortest period where the whole sensor is exposed). Sony says the a9 III can sync at all shutter speeds (all the way up to 1/80,000 sec).</p>
<p>A global shutter also eliminates the banding that can occur with progressive shutters under flickering lights. Because the image is all captured at exactly the same moment, you don't capture different parts of a light's flicker cycle in different parts of the image. You might capture an image of an LED sign board refreshing, if you use a very high shutter speed, but that's an issue with the LEDs, not the camera, which is accurately capturing a single moment in time.</p>
</div>
<p>It also says it will be introducing firmware updates to the a7S III and the a1, adding features such as breathing compensation. The a7S III will also gain DCI 4K capture. Sony says there will also be a firmware update for the a9 III, adding the ability to continuously shoot with shutter speeds at up to 1/80,000 sec.</p>
<p>All three cameras will also add <a href="https://c2pa.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">C2PA authentication</a> metadata. C2PA is a combination of the efforts of the Content Authentication Initiative and the separate Project Origin initiative.</p>

<h2>Sony Electronics Releases the Alpha 9 III; the World's First Full-Frame Camera with a Global Shutter System<span>i </span></h2>
<p><em>The next-generation Alpha 9 III captures all decisive moments with up to 120 frames per second high-speed shooting, distortion-free and blackout-free images, and flash sync at all shooting speeds</em></p>

<p>SAN DIEGO- Nov. 7, 2023 – Sony Electronics today introduced the Alpha 9 III camera equipped with the world's firsti full-frame global shutter image sensor. ​</p>
<p>The newly developed global shutter image sensor exposes and reads all pixels simultaneously, unlike a rolling shutter sensor that records images sequentially from the top row of pixels to the bottom. The impressive global shutter full-frame image sensor enables the camera to shoot at burst speeds up to 120 frames per second with no rolling shutter distortion or camera blackout. This innovative sensor is combined with Sony’s most advanced AF (autofocus) system to date - boasting AI autofocus with up to 120 times AF/AE focus calculations per second. With the added ability to sync flash at all shooting speeds, the Alpha 9 III opens up a new world of possibilities for professional photographers to capture every decisive moment.</p>
<p>“The Alpha 9 III full-frame camera is a landmark achievement for the industry,” says Yang Cheng, Vice President, Imaging Solutions, Sony Electronics. “Designed with the needs and demands of professional photographers in mind, every single update to this camera – from the sensor to even the size to the button layouts and menu functions – has been made to address specific input and feedback from our community. We have listened and are thrilled to bring the new capabilities of the Alpha 9 III to market---capabilities which allow photographers to capture things they’ve never been able to capture before.” Cheng continued, “For professionals everywhere, they can achieve even more dynamic expressions when the Alpha 9 III is combined with our rich lineup of lenses, in particular with the new 300mm F2.8 G Master OSS – the world’s lightestii large-aperture telephoto lens.”</p>
<h3>Features of the Alpha 9 III Full-Frame Camera</h3>
<h3>A New Dimension of Still Image Performance Created by the World's First<span>i</span> Global Shutter Image Sensor</h3>
<p>The Alpha 9 III is equipped with the newly developed, world's first<span>i</span> global shutter full frame stacked CMOS image sensor with approximately 24.6 effective megapixels<span>iii</span> and built-in memory. Combined with the latest image processing engine BIONZ XR®, the Alpha 9 III achieves blackout-free Continuous Shooting Speed with AF/AE tracking<span>iv</span> of up to approximately 120 fps<span>iv</span>. The Alpha 9 III is supplied with high-density focal plane phase detection AF. A designated AI processing unit uses Real-time Recognition AF to recognize a wide variety of subjects with high precision. By combining high-speed performance of up to 120 fps with highly accurate subject recognition performance, it is possible to easily photograph scenes and moments that cannot be seen with the naked eye<span>iv</span>. The AI processing unit in the Alpha 9 III supports movies as well as still photography with accurate subject form and movement recognition. The Real-time Recognition AF and Real-time Tracking provide a significant improvement in human eye recognition performance, allowing the camera to automatically recognize, track, and focus on the eyes of a specified subject<span>v</span>. The Alpha 9 III is equipped with 8.0 stops<span>vi</span> of optical 5-axis in-body image stabilization, allowing for high-quality image rendering.</p>
<p>Shutter speed is freed from the limitations of conventional mechanical shutter image sensors and achieves a maximum shutter speed of 1/80,000 second (1/16,000 second during continuous shooting)<span>vii</span>, making it possible to capture at high speed without any distortion. When a compatible Sony flash<span>viii</span> is attached, such as the HVL-F60RM2 and HVL-F46RM (sold separately), it is possible to synchronize the flash and take pictures at all shutter speeds up to 1/80,000 second<span>vii</span>. Previously, if the user released the shutter at a speed faster than the flash's synchronization speed, the amount of light would drop sharply, but with the full-speed flash synchronization function, it’s now possible to photograph scenes that could not be easily captured with conventional technology. Also, when shooting stills or movies under LED lighting, the Hi Frequency Flicker function can significantly reduce high-frequency flicker problems by allowing the shutter speed to be finely adjusted to match the flicker frequency while viewing the monitor.</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III features selectable release lag modes which allows the user to prioritize release lag or viewfinder/monitor display<span>ix</span>. The newly developed Pre-Capture function allows the camera to continuously record up to one second before the shutter is released, making it easy to capture moments that would otherwise be missed. When selected, the Continuous Shooting Speed Boost<span>x</span> function allows for the user to change to a faster, preset speed set by the user at any time during shooting, and enhanced burst stamina ensures that important moments are reliably captured due to a large buffer memory and increased overall system speed allow up to approximately 390 Fine JPEG images<span>xi</span> to be captured in one continuous 30 fps<span>xii</span> burst.</p>
<p>Customizable focus areas have been expanded to include from XS to XL in addition to the previous S, M, and L sizes. The Preset Focus/Zoom function allows preset focus and zoom settings to be memorized in the camera for quick recall when needed<span>xiii</span>. In addition to the existing custom white balance frame size, the user can now select other sizes as needed which allows for fine white balance adjustment after an image has been composed. The Alpha 9 III has upgraded features such as the latest AF algorithms to achieve high AF precision down to light levels as low as EV-5 in AF-S mode (ISO 100 equivalent, F2.0 lens), AF tracking for continuous shooting at F22<span>xiv</span> and a composite RAW shooting function that gives the ability to combine multiple consecutive images into a high-quality composite.</p>
<h3>Advanced Video Performance Without Distortion</h3>
<p>The global shutter image sensor provides distortion-free image expression for videos as well as still images. For example, the user can shoot images of nearby scenery from a fast-moving vehicle such as a car or fast-moving subjects with ease. This camera is the first in the Alpha™ series to be able to record 4K 120p high-frame-rate video without cropping, allowing the user to shoot at the angle of view intended. It is also possible to shoot high-resolution 4K 60p videos with 6K oversampling.</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III has S-Cinetone™, a unique Sony feature which can create a cinematic look straight out of the camera without post-processing. S-Cinetone was created through the development of the VENICE high-end cinema camera and makes human skin tones and subjects stand out beautifully, creating natural highlights. The Alpha 9 III has the latest video performance including rich gradation performance and S-Log3, and when in Log shooting mode, it can reflect and display the user's favorite imported LUT (lookup table). The Alpha 9 III is compatible with the mobile app "Monitor &amp; Control" for video creators.</p>
<h3>Operability and Reliability for Professionals</h3>
<p>Sony has listened to the voices of professional photographers and created operability and reliability that supports professional users. The shape of the grip is improved and ergonomically designed so that it can be easily held in the palm of the hand to avoid straining the user even when wearing a telephoto lens or using it for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The VG-C5 vertical grip (sold separately), provides the same operability and versatility as when shooting horizontally; the user can comfortably support long shooting sessions. The grip and shutter button area share the same design as the main body, allowing image capture without feeling uncomfortable, with the same operability as the camera. The Alpha 9 III is equipped with a 4-axis multi-angle LCD monitor that can be operated by touch, allowing for intuitive operation using the latest touch menu. The electronic viewfinder uses a 9.44 million-dot Quad XGA OLED and achieves high visibility with the same brightness as the Alpha 7R V and a magnification of approximately 0.90x. Also, a custom button is placed on the front of the camera, and the continuous shooting speed can be changed by operating the custom button assigned with Continuous Shooting Speed Boost with the finger holding the grip, allowing for highly immediate operations. It supports professional photographers when shooting in all environments.</p>
<h3>High-Speed Workflow and Scalability to Support Immediate Delivery</h3>
<p>New features for the Alpha 9 III include a playback image filter that allows the user to efficiently select a large number of images using high-speed continuous shooting, and a function menu that can be used even during image playback, strongly supporting professional workflows from shooting to delivery.</p>
<p>The "Playback Function Menu" can be assigned in advance, so the user can perform protection, smartphone transfer, File transfer protocol, etc. during image playback. The user can select images narrowed down with a playback filter and play them from the function menu, allowing for quick delivery of specific images. The camera has a dedicated microphone for voice memos on the back, and by positioning the built-in microphone near the user’s mouth allows clear recording of audio even in noisy environments. The recorded audio data can be transferred via FTP along with the images. The camera allows the user to set up to 20 presets from the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC), an international consultative body in which news organizations from various countries participate. ​</p>
<p>The Alpha 9 III can transfer data up to twice as fast as the Alpha 9 II. 5 GHz communication offers maximum speed and stability for news and sports shooters who need to deliver immediately via FTP, as well as for studio environments. The Alpha 9 III allows stills and movies to be recorded to memory media in numerous ways including the two media slots that support CFexpress Type A cards as well as UHS-I and UHS-II SD cards.</p>
<p>It is compatible with the professional mobile application "Transfer &amp; Tagging" which speeds up the image delivery workflow, and the application "Remote Camera Tool" which allows remote shooting of PCs using wired LAN. Also, Sony plans to support a new version of Camera Remote SDK, a software development kit that allows remote camera operation and changing shooting settings, in Spring 2024.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alpha 9 III is scheduled to support functional enhancements such as FTP operability, relay playback, and C2PA<span>xv</span> ​ format support <span>xvi</span> through a camera software update<span>xvii</span>.</p>
<h3>Firmware Updates for the Alpha 1 and Alpha 7S III Models</h3>
<p>In addition to the release of Alpha 9 III, Sony has announced new firmware updates for the Alpha 1 and Alpha 7S III full-frame mirrorless cameras<span> xvii</span>. The new software will provide both models with some of Sony’s latest imaging technologies including the highly requested Focus Breathing Compensation feature, IPTC and FTP workflow enhancement, and C2PA format support. The firmware will also update the Alpha 1 with Relay Playback, and the Alpha 7S III with DCI 4K 24.00P shooting format. The camera software update will be available in Spring 2024.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>The Alpha 9 III camera is available for pre-order Nov. 8, 2023, at a variety of Sony's authorized dealers, for a suggested retail price of $5,999.99 USD and $8,299.99 CAN.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Designing a new domain specific language is as any other complex task sometimes error-prone and usually time consuming, especially if the language shall be of high-quality and comfortably usable. Existing tool support focuses on the simplification of technical aspects but lacks support for an enforcement of principles for a good language design. In this paper we investigate guidelines that are useful for designing domain specific languages, largely based on our experience in developing languages as well as relying on existing guidelines on general purpose (GPLs) and modeling languages. We defined guidelines to support a DSL developer to achieve better quality of the language design and a better acceptance among its users.

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-overview" dir="auto"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">LLMs as a way to browse the web is being explored by numerous startups and open-source projects. With this project, I was interested in seeing if we could only use <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card" rel="nofollow">GPT-4V</a>'s vision capabilities for web browsing.</p>
<p dir="auto">The issue with this is it's hard to determine what the model wants to click on without giving it the browser DOM as text. <a href="https://vimium.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Vimium</a> is a Chrome extension that lets you navigate the web with only your keyboard. I thought it would be interesting to see if we could use Vimium to give the model a way to interact with the web.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-ideas" dir="auto"><a href="#ideas">Ideas</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Feel free to collaborate with me on this, I have a number of ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview" rel="nofollow">Assistant API</a> once it's released for automatic context retrieval. The Assistant API will create a thread that we can add messages too, to keep the history of actions, but it doesn't support the Vision API yet.</li>
<li>Vimium fork for overlaying elements. A specialized version of Vimium that selectively overlays elements based on context could be useful, effectively pruning based on the user query. Might be worth testing if different sized boxes/colors help.</li>
<li>Use higher resolution images, as it seems to fail at low res. I noticed that below a certain threshold, the model wouldn't detect anything. This might be improved by using higher resolution images but that would require more tokens.</li>
<li>Fine-tune <a href="https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA">LLaVa</a> or <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM">CogVLM</a> to do this. Could be faster/cheaper. CogVLM can accurately specify pixel coordinates which may be a good way to augment this.</li>
<li>Use JSON mode once it's released for Vision API. Currently the Vision API doesn't support JSON mode or function calling, so we have to rely on more primitive prompting methods.</li>
<li>Have the Vision API return general instructions, formalized by another call to the JSON mode version of the API. This is a workaround for the JSON mode issue but requires another LLM call, which is slower/more expensive.</li>
<li>Add speech-to-text with Whisper or another model to eliminate text input and make this more accessible.</li>
<li>Make this work for your own browser instead of spinning up an artificial one. I want to be able to order food with my credit card.</li>
<li>Provide the frames with and without Vimium enabled in case the model can't see what's under the yellow square.</li>
<li>Pass the Chrome accessibility tree in as input in addition to the image. This provides a layout of interactive elements that can be mapped to the Vimium bindings.</li>
</ul>

      Using a travel agent to buy a plane ticket&nbsp;or a stockbroker to trade equities seem like relics of the past. And yet, every day, people across America hire a real estate agent to help them sell a home. It’s one of the few industries that has been able to largely avoid the disruption that has helped consumers cut costs in the Internet age.

      And that is largely because of the power of the National Association of Realtors, the largest professional organization in America and a significant lobbying group for the real estate industry.

      But the verdict handed down in a Missouri court on Tuesday that found NAR and two brokerage firms, Homeservices of America and Keller Williams Realty, were liable for $1.8 billion in damages for conspiring to keep commissions artificially high,&nbsp;may mark the beginning of the end of how homes are bought and sold.

      “This matter is not close to being final as we will appeal the jury’s verdict,” said Mantill Williams, NAR vice president of communications. “In the interim, we will ask the court to reduce the damages awarded by the jury.”

      The cornerstone of the plaintiff’s argument is that NAR is forcing homesellers to pay an inflated commission that is then split between their agent and the buyer’s agent.&nbsp;The homesellers argued commission sharing as a condition for access to the Multiple Listing Service was unfair and kept commissions artificially high.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000o3b6i4glbjvwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Typically, when a home goes on the market for sale, the seller offers their broker a set commission. For decades, the commission has&nbsp;consistently been around 6% of the sale price, usually with a 3% split for the buyer’s and seller’s agent.
  </p>

  


  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000q3b6i9zloguvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In a competitive market, the homesellers argue, the cost of the buyer’s agent’s commission would be paid not by the seller, but by the buyer who received the service. The sellers said that the buyers should be able to negotiate the fee with their agent, and that the sellers should not be on the hook for paying it.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000r3b6iliyvp2z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      NAR and the other defendants argued in court that their commissions are always negotiable. They also said that the system of having the seller’s agent split the commission with the buyer’s agent allows buyers, who are already weighed down with expenses like a downpayment, closing costs, inspections and appraisals, to avoid the added expense of having to pay an agent as well.

      Consumer advocates celebrated the verdict and hoped that plaintiffs would also receive their request for the judge to order changes to how commissions are structured in the industry.

      While already large, the award could grow even more — to a total of $5 billion, depending on what the judge decides.

      The jury clearly saw the industry had restricted price competition to a point where it could ensure nearly uniform 5%-6% commissions, said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America. Jurors made their decision quickly, he said, deliberating for only a few hours.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cloj31k01000v3b6iwgicpier@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “The extent of injunctive relief decided by the court will strongly influence whether a price competitive system develops that lowers consumer costs and increases quality of services,” Brobeck said. “We hope that the court will sever the ties between listing agent and buyer agent compensation, freeing sellers from the obligation and need to compensate buyer agents.”

      Not much is expected to change in the near term with regard to how commissions are set, agents say.

      The longer-term impact of the verdict may be that the pairing of buyer’s agent commission and seller’s agent commission will eventually be separated.

      Analysts from Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, an investment banking firm, said in report released ahead of the verdict that the NAR litigation and related government action is likely to reshape the residential brokerage industry’s commission structure, by eliminating the buyer-broker commission rule, and eventually the practice of listing agents and sellers setting and paying buyer agent commissions.

      And since the commission paid to an agent is typically baked into a home price, if they were reduced&nbsp;or were to become more negotiable, home prices could drop as well, they said.

      “Short term nothing changes,” said Jen Davis, a Keller Williams agent with Holt Homes Group, in Springfield, Missouri. “Commissions have always been negotiable. That will continue to be the case.”

      “There are buyers that aren’t going to know the steps to buy a home,” Davis said. “They have to pay for a down payment, closing costs, appraisals, inspections. If they also have to come up with money to pay for a buyer’s agent, some just won’t and they’ll get in over their heads or they won’t buy at all. Not having representation will make the market less inclusive.”
