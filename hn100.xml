<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Hey, how long do you believe <code>Feature F</code> will take?</p>

  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Idk. We haven’t even started working on it and it’s bound to stir up some old issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Estimates come in various disguises, but when you peek under the trench coat there is always the question:</p>

<p>
"How long -- and using what amount of resources -- will be required to do <code>X</code>?"
</p>

<p>When I wear the <em>developer hat</em>, it can be infuriating to attempt to give an answer. It’s difficult to estimate (or the
product owner could do it themselves) and a lot of the time it can be difficult to see why the estimate is even
important.</p>

<p>When I wear the <em>product owner hat</em>, estimates are a crucial piece of the puzzle that must be laid in an attempt to plan
the short <em>and</em> long term life cycle of a product.</p>

<p>In this post I want to attempt to explore and elaborate on both sides, in an attempt to make developers understand <em>why
estimates are important to product owners</em> and in order to help product owners see <em>why developers so often despise
having to estimate their work</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-po-wants-you-to-estimate">Why the PO wants you to estimate</h2>

<p>As a Product Owner (PO), I am responsible for <em>learning the market and customers’ needs</em> and translating these into
<em>feature requests which developers can turn into actual features in our products</em>. The means varies, but most
organisations have some sort of backlog in which <em>things to be acted upon</em> are placed while they await being <em>picked up</em>
by some developer or development team. We call these <em>things</em> user stories, issues, tickets, tasks, <em>and probably many
other things</em>… The important thing for this discussion is that the items in the backlog are candidates for being
implemented in our product and it’s the PO’s job to prioritise the backlog.</p>

<p>Why does the backlog need to be prioritised?</p>

<p>Because the inflow of items to the backlog is (pretty much always) higher than the speed at which the developers can
implement them. Ergo, if the PO does not constantly <em>learn the market and customers’ needs</em> and prioritise the backlog
accordingly, the developers might implement features that the users of the product are not interested in. Worst case?
Existing users stop using the product and no new users buy it which will ultimately lead to bankruptcy.</p>

<h3 id="but-what-about-the-estimates">But what about the estimates?</h3>

<p>The above makes sense – I hope – but it doesn’t really pinpoint the need for estimates. Unfortunately, the job of a PO
is not as easy as always prioritising in accordance to whatever the market wants. More often than not, the PO must also
consider pre-communicated release dates and manage expectations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hate when release dates are communicated in advance. The only thing worse than release dates that are set in stone
months ahead of time (I’m looking at you, Mr 12-week-increments-SAFe) are releases with pre-communicated content.
Unfortunately, both are common. Often combined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine a backlog in which resides a really big feature. Something that is sought after, but will take a lot of time and
resources to implement. The same backlog has a handful of smaller features which are not as requested as the big one.
The PO would really like to include the big feature in the next release, but the next release date is not so far away.
If the PO prioritises the big feature but it’s not done in time for <em>the already communicated release date</em>, the release
will be severely lacking and considered a failure. In that case, the PO would rather include a couple of the smaller
features. A safer bet, but the payoff is smaller.</p>

<p><strong>THIS</strong> is why estimates matter so much to product owners. They must constantly run the above equation when they
prioritise the teams’ backlogs. A constant risk/reward balancing act. They undoubtedly need help from the experts (the
developers) to better understand the ramifications of the features they are proposing. If POs do not understand how big
different <em>work packages</em> are, they cannot do their jobs in an effective way.</p>

<h3 id="it-gets-worse">It gets worse</h3>

<p>Instead of one PO there are now a couple of them. They are responsible for different <em>parts</em> of a larger product which
requires the POs to coordinate both the date <em>and</em> the content of their releases. There is probably a <em>main backlog</em>
describing upcoming features in the final product, as well as <em>team backlogs</em> where each team are assigned puzzle pieces
which must be implemented and integrated in a coordinated fashion.</p>

<p>This is painful in multiple ways, but the most obvious issue is that – in order to have a functioning release – the
POs must agree on the prioritisation of the <em>main backlog</em> and this will in turn affect the prioritisation of the <em>team
backlogs</em>. The POs must each acquire information about how long it will take (and how costly it will be) to implement
and to integrate the puzzle piece(s) they are responsible for into a cohesive feature. The tool for acquiring this
<em>idea</em>?</p>

<p>
    Estimates.
</p>

<h2 id="technical-debt">Technical debt</h2>

<p>Programming is a craft. An art. My art, to some extent. I’m in my happy place when I get to succumb to a tricky task and
surface a couple of days later with a solution to a problem that initially seemed impossible. As a developer, I want to
build the best possible product. I dislike shortcuts. Half-arsed solutions. <em>Fixes.</em> Not because a single shortcut or
fix will destroy a product, but because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt"><em>technical debt</em></a> they
incur will accumulate over time and eventually erode the product from the inside out; making it ever more difficult to
work with it and ultimately cause it to break.</p>

<p>Technical debt is – I believe – the main reason for conflict between a PO and a development team. A not so technically
inclined PO will fail to see how detrimental technical debt is to the product and how painful it is for the developers
to work in a code base with a high amount of debt.</p>

<p>Put in other words: If I’m tasked with implementing a new feature and I come across something in the code that is
obviously smelly, error prone, or just not very good, I want to leave the code in better shape than I found it. Not
taking time to “payoff” such debt <em>once</em> might not be the end of the world, but the hard coded quick-fix that you know
ought to be generalised will likely bite you down the road. And if you have ignored updating dependencies for a couple
of months and find yourself in a situation where you <em>need</em> to upgrade <code>Package 1</code>, but it depends on a newer version of
<code>Packages 2 &amp; 3</code>, which in turn requires a framework upgrade… Let’s just say the feature you’re working on will take
a while longer.</p>

<h2 id="why-developers-hate-estimates">Why developers HATE estimates</h2>

<p>When a PO asks: “How long will it take to implement <code>Feature F</code>?”, they aren’t just asking the developers to estimate
the amount of time they think it will take to write the code for the feature. A good PO understands that implementing a
new feature is an iterative process and that <em>integration hell</em> is a thing. An even better PO understands that they are
also asking the team to estimate how many unforeseen issues they will encounter while implementing the feature.</p>

<p>This detail: <em>The unforeseen issues</em>, which the PO asks the developers to foresee, is key. It is – per definition –
not possible to foresee something unforeseeable.</p>

<p>Many developers I’ve met dislike uncertainty. One of the things they appreciate most about coding is the deterministic
aspect of it. You run the same program again and again and it returns the same results.<sup id="fnref:determinism" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:determinism" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The journey on
which we travel while writing the code is, however, not particularly deterministic.</p>

<p>It is true, that the more you code and the more familiar you get with a codebase, the more accurate your estimates will
be. However, just the other day I was working on an issue which I had estimated would take <em>approximately two days</em>. All
of a sudden, I realised that the simple change required updating a shared component that had been tightly coupled years
ago. When I touched that code, dozens of failing tests appeared, each revealing another hidden dependency. Fixing those
uncovered yet another module depending on outdated patterns. Halfway through, we decided we had to refactor the entire
flow just to make the original change safe. My “two-day task” turned into two weeks of archaeological software
excavation.</p>

<p>Could we have solved this quicker by not caring so much about the amount of technical debt we left in our wake?
Probably.</p>

<p>Would we have encountered a two <em>month</em> excavation in the future? Probably.</p>

<h3 id="it-gets-worse-1">It gets worse</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/estimate">According to Merriam-Webster</a>: <em>estimate</em> is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To judge tentatively or approximately the value, worth, or significance of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very definition of <em>estimates</em> tells us that they are either <em>tentative</em> or <em>approximate</em>. As a developer, I choose
to interpret the <em>or</em> as meaning that it could even be both.</p>

<p>When I started my career as a software developer, I really did not have an issue with estimates. We would refine our
backlog and I would gladly give an estimate on various items. (1) Because I was fresh out of university and wanted to
prove myself by doing a good job and not being too difficult, but more importantly: (2) because I had not understood
that my estimates would soon be used against me.</p>

<p>I soon learned that my team’s estimates were not interpreted and used as <em>estimates</em>. They were used as <em>deadlines</em>. If
we broke down a feature into its reasonable components (an error prone science, which introduces uncertainties, on its
own) and estimated the parts accordingly, the PO would often take the sum of the parts and communicate it to their
colleagues as: “This is the time we will be done.”</p>

<p>Two things came out of this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My team (consisting mostly of newly graduated developers) became much more reluctant to estimate.</li>
  <li>When we estimated we always padded our <em>actual beliefs</em>, significantly, to give ourselves a buffer.</li>
</ol>

<p>The estimates stopped being estimates. They became safety railings against being held accountable for unreasonable
expectations.</p>

<h2 id="the-clash">The clash</h2>

<p>Do you see the problem?</p>

<p>Do you see a solution?</p>

<p>I believe the overarching problem with estimates stems from expectations. Somewhere, someone, communicates <em>something</em>
to the users/customers of the product, which sets expectations the rest of the organisation are then forced to live up
to. In a small company, it might very well be the PO who does that communication but in a larger organisation the PO is
likely as helpless as the developers w.r.t. having a say about the product’s roadmap.</p>

<p>The “solution” is simple: Stop communicating new features in advance. Stop setting more or less arbitrary
deadlines<sup id="fnref:deadlines" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:deadlines" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Let the PO tell the developers what features they want, in what order, and let the developers do
what they do best: Code!</p>

<p>But these deadlines are there for a reason. If your company builds a product which assists people doing their yearly tax
returns, a missed delivery window will result in the entire revenue opportunity for that year being missed. Resources
(most often in terms of salaries to employees) will have been poured into a project and if there’s no payoff in terms
of additional sales, it could lead to a need for finding other ways to reclaim those resources; often in terms of
reduced costs, which universally means: lay-offs.</p>

<p>Therefore, it’s in everyone’s best interest to play along. We play the estimates game even though it’s a bad way (but
also the best we know of) to help each other do our respective jobs.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-devops">What about DevOps?</h2>

<p><em>You didn’t think I’d miss an opportunity to talk about DevOps, did you?</em></p>

<p><em>Flow</em> is a key concept within DevOps which describes an organisation’s ability to reduce bottlenecks and increase the
pace at which they are able to deliver new versions of their product(s). High flow is synonymous with frequent
deliveries and updates of our product(s).</p>

<p>The concepts from DevOps do not directly address the issue with estimates, but there are tools which can be used to
reduce the risk associated with delivering software. Flow can inform how we tackle technical debt and how we make sure
we don’t fall behind on our dependencies. Flow can also help us identify issues in our product’s life cycle as well as
help us understand how to get rid of the issues.</p>

<p>Flow is one of <a href="https://itrevolution.com/articles/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/"><em>The Three Ways</em></a> in
DevOps and if you want to learn more, feel free to reach out. I give presentations on various topics related to DevOps
and I can come to your company and give a course about DevOps tailored to your company’s needs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Estimates – as defined in the English language – isn’t really the problem here. The problem is when <em>estimates</em> are
treated as predictions, deadlines, and used to put pressure on developers who are just trying to do their jobs.
Estimates – the way they are used in our industry today – hurts people and reduces the psychological safety in our
organisations. I believe we would be better off if we could work in a way that allows developers to be transparent and
continuously communicate updated estimates as development progresses.</p>

<p>Then again, product owners are people too! As developers we must understand that POs are under pressure too. We must
help them and the best way to help them is to continuously provide them with updates about how development is
progressing and whether we have encountered anything that we believe will significantly alter the original estimate we
gave.</p>

<p>It's a classic example of early web era design. Simple, colorful, and sparks joy. We're going to find out if we can get Claude to recreate it using only a screenshot.</p>
<h2 id="set-up"><a href="#set-up" aria-label="set up permalink"><span></span></a>Set Up</h2>
<p>At a minimum, I'm providing Claude:</p>
<ul>
<li>a screenshot of the website</li>
<li>all of the assets the website uses</li>
</ul>
<p>To track Claude's inner monologue and actual API calls, I set up a man-in-the-middle proxy to capture the full conversation between Claude Code and Anthropic's API. This logs everything: user prompts, Claude's responses, tool invocations (Read, Write, Bash commands), etc. Each attempt generates a <code>traffic.log</code> file with the raw API traffic, which I then parse for easier analysis.</p>

<p>The Space Jam website is simple: a single HTML page, absolute positioning for every element, and a tiling starfield GIF background. The entire page uses absolute positioning with pixel specific left/top values. The total payload is under 200KB.</p>
<p>Given that Claude has all of the assets + screenshots of the website, I assume this should be relatively boring. He'll nail it, and we'll move on to something much more. A mildly cute example of agentic HTML generation…</p>
<p>I tell Claude:</p>

<p>What he produces is actually not that bad. But it's not right. From a distance, the layout kind of resembled the original: planets arranged in an ellipse around the logo, little yellow labels where the buttons go. But, the orbital pattern was off, almost diamond shaped and symmetrical.</p>

<p>Digging through the logs I found it interesting that Claude actually did notice the planets were arranged in a deliberate way, so much so that it's called out twice in both the screenshot analysis and CSS construction, but he failed to recreate the pattern faithfully.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. Maybe he needed a nudge to get the orbit right. So for my next attempt, I try to push him to focus on understanding the orbital pattern and I ask him to explain his reasoning before generating his HTML. I was hoping to understand the delta between what is there and what he thought he was seeing. In my prompt, I outline a set of sections for him to consider. Each one of these sections also includes a number of sub-questions, which I won't include here for the sake of brevity. This made things significantly worse.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="false"><code><p><span>Please</span><span> follow </span><span>this</span><span> structure exactly </span><span>in</span><span> your reasoning explanations</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Perception</span><span> </span><span>Analysis</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Spatial</span><span> </span><span>Interpretation</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Reconstruction</span><span> </span><span>Plan</span></p></code></pre></div>
<p>Claude didn't ignore my instructions (not always a given) and things seemed promising until I realized he was ignoring his own analysis during the HTML generation phase. He would say things like "the orbit radius appears to be 220 pixels" and then place the planets directly next to the logo. His self critique was surprisingly accurate. He correctly identifies the areas where he was wrong with decent detail, but somehow those observations never make it into subsequent iterations.</p>
<p>In my next attempt I interrogate Claude with a set of onion peeling questions: "Can you tell me the EXACT pixel coordinate where "PLANET B-BALL" text starts?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No, I cannot measure exact pixel coordinates. I can only make visual estimations."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked him a few more questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you extract exact pixel coordinates? "No."</li>
<li>Can you measure exact distances? "No."</li>
<li>Confidence you can get within 5 pixels? "15 out of 100."</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh. This explains a lot. But it raises a bigger question to me: "Why can't he measure?" It's a screenshot. The pixels are right there. Claude clearly understood the structure, but he couldn't recreate it with any precision. Also, I'm not even sure I trust Claude. Either way, this (naively) surprised me, so I canceled coffee with my friends in order to spend the afternoon trying to give my guy more tools.</p>
<p>Before I start I execute one more attempt and ask him: "Would you bet $1000 on your HTML matching this screenshot exactly?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely not</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Maybe he just needs a little help.</em></p>
<p>In one of Claude's responses from Part 1, he tells me that he would be more effective if he had access to exact "pixel measurements." so I build a few tools to make it impossible for Claude to mis-measure anything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grid overlays and a script to generate grid overlays on screenshots</li>
<li>labeled pixel coordinate reference points</li>
<li>color-diff comparison (this ignores the background which was giving Claude false positives because of how much black there was)</li>
<li>Tool to take screenshots of his <code>index.html</code> file to compare iteratively with the original</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three grid versions Claude generated which I am including because I find them aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>Claude loved the grids. As decoration.</p>
<p>I put together a new prompt: same screenshot, same assets folder. I even included some grid screenshots so Claude wouldn't have to remember to do it himself. The instructions were essentially: <em>stop guessing, just read the coordinates off the picture.</em></p>
<p>Claude's new attempt still wasn't correct. The orbit was better: closer to the original but somehow compressed and smooshing (a technical word) into the Space Jam logo. If I squint, I could convince myself that there was at least a hint that he'd stopped freehanding and started using something like measurements.</p>

<p>When I dug into the logs, it appeared that Claude actually <em>did</em> use the grids. He pulled out these numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Center at (961, 489)</li>
<li>Logo "centered at approximately (755, 310)"</li>
<li>Planet B-Ball at "approximately (850, 165)"</li>
<li>and so on down the list</li>
</ul>
<p>In one iteration, Claude built himself a helper: <code>compare.html</code> a little side by side viewer so he could look at his screenshot and the reference together. It didn't help him at all, but my God was he convinced it did.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam website with pixel-perfect accuracy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the optimism my dog.</p>
<p>The actual progression tells a different story. Going through the iterations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iteration 1 (50px grid):</strong> he notices things are off and makes a few conservative tweaks — moves Planet B-Ball from (850, 165) to (800, 120), shifts Lunar Tunes from (925, 195) to (950, 200). These are 15 - 50 pixel changes, tiny nudges.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration 2 (25px grid):</strong> he decides he needs "more precise positioning" and shifts the <em>entire</em> orbit inward by ~20 pixels. Planets go from roughly a 250px radius to ~230px. He is now confidently converging on the wrong answer.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration 3 (5px grid):</strong> he shuffles around a lot of deck chairs in the name of micro adjustments. 5 - 10 pixel tweaks: Planet B-Ball from (800, 120) to (805, 125), that kind of thing.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration 4:</strong> more "fine-tuning based on exact grid measurements." Site Map drifts from (755, 460) to (750, 455). The numbers look careful; the layout does not lol.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the final iteration, Claude announces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now the positioning should be much more accurate!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across all five iterations, he's moved planets maybe 50 - 75 pixels total when they needed to move 150 - 200 pixels outward. The orbital radius never expands beyond ~250px when it should be closer to 350 -400px. The planets stay trapped in this ever compressing orbit while Claude dances around telling a story about steady convergence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Getting closer!"</p>
<p>"Much better alignment!"</p>
<p>"Nearly perfect now!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is absolutely not getting closer.</p>
<p>Before giving up on tools entirely, I had one more idea. I created a tool that would split the screenshot into six regions. Claude could then compare his output to the reference region by region.</p>

<p>The prompt was getting desperate at this point lol:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre data-linenumber="false"><code><p><span>## </span><span>INITIAL</span><span> </span><span>ANALYSIS</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>DO</span><span> </span><span>THIS</span><span> </span><span>FIRST</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>Before</span><span> creating index</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>,</span><span> study the reference </span><span>in</span><span> detail using zoom inspection</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>python3 split</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span> reference</span><span>.</span><span>png</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>This</span><span> creates </span><span>6</span><span> files showing every detail</span></p></code></pre></div>
<p>Claude ran the tool and the logs look promising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Examining region 1 (top-left): I can see Jam Central and Press Box Shuttle clearly at 2x zoom
Examining region 2 (top-right): Planet B-Ball and Lunar Tunes are visible with precise spacing
Examining region 4 (middle-right): Jump Station appears approximately 280px from center</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Claude's "precise observations" from the zoomed regions were just as wrong as before. He'd look at a planet and confidently declare it was at position (750, 320) when it was actually at (850, 380). The split did not appear to help him measure or get a more accurate picture of planet spacing.</p>
<p>What makes this phase ~~depressing~~ interesting is that the tools, despite invalidating his result, seem to lock in the wrong answer. Once he's picked an internal picture of the layout ("the orbit radius is about 230px"), the grids and the compare viewer don't correct it. They just help him make more confident micro moves around his invented orbit. Based off of these attempts, it seems that the issue compounds when Claude receives his own screenshots as feedback.</p>
<p>My very rough read of Anthropic's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05221">"Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know"</a>, is that models can become overconfident when evaluating their own outputs, in part because they cannot distinguish the tokens they generated from tokens provided by someone else / an external source. So, when Claude is asked to judge or revise content that originated from itself, it treats that material as if it were "ground truth."</p>
<p>This kind of fits what I'm seeing in the logs. Once Claude's version existed, every grid overlay, every comparison step, every "precise" adjustment was anchored to his layout, not the real one. At the end of all this, I'm left with the irritating fact that, like many engineers, he's wrong and he thinks he's right.</p>
<p>What this teaches me is that Claude is actually kind of a liar, or at least Claude is confused. However, for the drama, I'll assume Claude is a liar.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-claude-the-blind"><a href="#part-3-claude-the-blind" aria-label="part 3 claude the blind permalink"><span></span></a>Part 3: Claude the Blind</h2>
<p>At this point I had tried grids, comparisons, step-by-step corrections, letting Claude narrate his thought process, and every combination of tools I could bolt onto the interaction. None of it seemed to help nor explain by why his single digit precision updates were disembodied from the actual layout.</p>
<p>Before getting to the final experiment, here's the mental model I was forming about Claude's vision. The vision encoder converts each 16 x 16 block of the image into a single token. So instead of geometry, he sees semantics: "near," "above," "roughly circular." When he says "approximately 220px radius," he's not measuring anything. He's describing the idea of a radius. He excels at semantic understanding ("this is a planet," "these form a circle") but  lacks the tools for working with visual media. It explains why his perception is good. He always knows a planet is a planet but the execution is never precise.</p>
<p>I'm getting frustrated and I haven't left my apartment in days so I turn to some research. GPTing around, I found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929">"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words"</a>. I have no idea if Claude uses this exact architecture or anything close to it, but the intuition seemed right. The paper (after I made ChatGPT explain it to me) explains that the the image is chopped into fixed patches, each patch gets compressed into a single embedding, and whatever details lived inside those pixels vanish.</p>
<p>Oooh.</p>
<p>Assuming this applies, a lot of the failures suddenly make sense. Most planets on the Space Jam screenshot are maybe 40 - 50 pixels wide. That's two or three patches. A three patch planet is basically a blob to him. Claude knows it's a planet, but not much else. The orbit radius only spans a couple dozen patches total. Tiny changes in distance barely show up in the patch embeddings.</p>
<p>But this raised a new and final idea. If the 40px planets turn into fuzzy tokens, what if I make them bigger? What if I give Claude a 2x zoomed screenshot? Would each planet spans 10 - 15 patches instead of two or three? Maybe this gives him a more crisp understanding of the spatial relationships and a better chance at success.</p>
<p>I deleted most of the prompt and tools and just gave Claude this 2x'd screenshot</p>

<p>😞</p>
<p>My best explanation for all of this is that Claude was working with a very coarse version of the screenshot. Considering the 16 x 16 patch thing from earlier it sort of helps me understand what might be happening: he could describe the layout, but the fine grained stuff wasn't in his representation. And that weird tension I kept seeing , where he could describe the layout correctly but couldn't reproduce it, also looks different under that lens. His explanations were always based on the <em>concepts</em> he got from the image ("this planet is above this one," "the cluster is to the left"), but the actual HTML had to be grounded in geometry he didn't have. So the narration sounded right while the code drifted off.</p>
<p>After these zoom attempts, I didn't have any new moves left. I was being evicted. The bank repo'd my car. So I wrapped it there.</p>
<h2 id="end"><a href="#end" aria-label="end permalink"><span></span></a>End</h2>
<p>Look, I still need this Space Jam website recreated. If you can get Claude to faithfully recreate the Space Jam 1996 website from just a screenshot and the assets folder, I'd love to hear about it.</p>
<p>Based on my failures, here are some approaches I didn't try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break the screen into quadrants, get each quadrant right independently, then merge. Maybe Claude can handle spatial precision better in smaller chunks.</li>
<li>Maybe there's some magic prompt engineering that unlocks spatial reasoning. "You are a CSS grid with perfect absolute positioning knowledge…" (I'm skeptical but worth trying).</li>
<li>Providing Claude with a zoom tool and an understanding of how to use the screenshots might be an effective path.</li>
</ol>
<p>For now, this task stands undefeated. A monument to 1996 web design and a humbling reminder that sometimes the simplest tasks are the hardest. That orbital pattern of planets, thrown together by some Warner Brothers webmaster 28 years ago, has become an inadvertent benchmark for Claude.</p>
<p>Until then, the Space Jam website remains proof that not everything old is obsolete. Some things are just irreproducibly perfect.</p></section></div>]]></description>

    <p>Is this clickbait? Not really. <br>
Is this the fault of the language or the compiler? Definitely not. <br>
Rather, it was part of a rushed migration. Sharing the lessons learned in the process.</p>

<p>I was refreshing one of our services. Part of this process was to migrate codebase from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3. I’ve done this a few times before and overall had a positive experience. Well, at least until we talk about projects with macro wizardry.</p>

<p>The service in question had no macros at all, but it was at the heart of data ingestion, so performance was not an afterthought.</p>

<p>I did it as usual - updating dependencies, compiler options and some type/syntax changes.</p>

<p>Then after resolving few tricky implicit resolutions and config derivations, project compiled on Scala 3.7.3 🎉</p>

<p>All tests passed, end-to-end flow locally works perfectly fine, so I decided to roll out the changes in a testing environment. Similarly, no issues at all. No concerning logs, all metrics ranging from infrastructure, through JVM up to application level look healthy.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I began a staged rollout. Again, all seem good. I kept observing the service but it looked like my job is done.</p>

<p>Well, as you probably can guess, it wasn’t.</p>

<h2 id="the-mysterious-slowdown">The mysterious slowdown</h2>

<p>After 5-6 hours, Kafka lag started increasing on a few environments. Of course, this wasn’t something new. Most often it is caused by a spike of data. We have pretty advanced machinery to deal with that. Usually the lag resolves by itself without any manual action.</p>

<p>However, this time <em>something</em> was off. Upstream load turned out to be relatively modest, yet we needed much more instances of the service - meaning the processing rate per instance dropped. I was confused to say the least. Why would it decrease the processing rate just on these environments?</p>

<p>Anyway, we decided to rollback the changes - this brought the rate back.</p>

<h2 id="digging-deeper">Digging deeper</h2>

<p>I came back to testing. In particular, load testing. However similarly as on production environments I did not notice regression. So I played around with different payloads and granularity of messages. To my surprise, for more fine-grained, heterogeneous workloads, the processing rate significantly dropped.</p>

<p>Still, I had no idea why it would happen, but my bet was in the dependencies. Therefore, I tried one-by-one, reverting the serialization library, database SDK, base Docker image and even config libraries. None of these made any changes.</p>

<p>This made me pull out the big guns. I profiled the service using <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/tree/master">async-profiler</a> and indeed</p>

<p>CPU profile looked vastly different on Scala 3 than on 2.13.</p>

<p><img src="https://kmaliszewski9.github.io/assets/s213low.png" alt="scala2_13_flamegraph"></p>

<p><img src="https://kmaliszewski9.github.io/assets/s3low.png" alt="scala3_flamegraph"></p>

<p>JVM-level CPU time was now dominated by JIT compiler while application-level by decoding.</p>

<p>Looking at the top of Scala 3 flamegraph I noticed a long quicklens call.</p>

<p><img src="https://kmaliszewski9.github.io/assets/quicklens-flamegraph.png" alt="quicklens_flamegraph"></p>

<p>What used to be transparent (frankly, I didn’t even realize we used the library), now took almost half of the total CPU time. I compared how it looks on Scala 2.13 and it was barely noticeable with around 0.5% samples.</p>

<p>Turns out there was indeed <a href="https://github.com/softwaremill/quicklens/pull/115">a subtle bug</a> making chained evaluations inefficient in Scala 3. This also explained why the JVM spent so much time compiling.</p>

<p>After upgrading the library, performance and CPU characteristics on Scala 3 became indistinguishable from Scala 2.13.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>While the details of the bug are pretty interesting(hats off to the SoftwareMill team for catching it!), that’s not my point here. I want to emphasize that <strong>libraries can behave very differently between Scala versions</strong>, especially when they rely on meta-programming.</p>

<p>Even if your migration is seamless and the service runs fine on Scala 3 - when performance is not just a nice-to-have, do not assume. Know your hotspots and benchmark them. Otherwise, your code will benchmark you, revealing bottlenecks in places you didn’t even know existed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">North Carolina</a>, carrying a scanner gun and a laptop.</p><p>Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.</p><p>Red Baron frozen pizzas, listed on the shelf at $5, rang up at $7.65. Bounty paper towels, shelf price $10.99, rang up at $15.50. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Stouffer’s frozen meatloaf, Sprite and Pepsi, ibuprofen, Klondike Minis – shoppers were overpaying for all of them. Pedigree puppy food, listed at $12.25, rang up at $14.75.</p><p>All told, 69 of the 300 items came up higher at the register: a 23% error rate that exceeded the state’s limit by more than tenfold. Some of the price tags were months out of date.</p><p>The January 2023 inspection produced the store’s fourth consecutive failure, and Coffield’s agency, the state department of agriculture &amp; consumer services, had fined Family Dollar after two previous visits. But North Carolina law caps penalties at $5,000 per inspection, offering retailers little incentive to fix the problem. “Sometimes it is cheaper to pay the fines,” said Chad Parker, who runs the agency’s weights-and-measures program.</p><figure id="2fd73407-8685-4c44-b05b-7b097e235535" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a man carrying a basket " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961a1e86d663b8b66f8998eac95f8c851ff91c42/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Chris Outlaw shops at Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina, on 24 November. </span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The dollar-store industry, including Family Dollar and its larger rival, Dollar General, promises everyday low prices for household essentials. But an investigation by the Guardian found that the prices listed on the shelves at these two chains often don’t materialize at checkout – in North Carolina and around the country. As the cost of living soars across America, the customers bearing the burden are those who can least afford it – customers who often don’t even notice they’re overpaying.</p><p>These overcharges are widespread.</p><p>Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, a Guardian review found. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span, the review found.</p><p>Among these thousands of failed inspections, some of the biggest flops include a 76% error rate in October 2022 at a Dollar General in Hamilton, Ohio; a 68% error rate in February 2023 at a Family Dollar in Bound Brook, New Jersey; and a 58% error rate three months ago at a Family Dollar in Lorain, Ohio.</p><p>Many of the stores that failed state or local government checks were repeat violators. A Family Dollar in Provo, Utah, flunked 28 inspections in a row – failures that included a 48% overcharge rate in May 2024 and a 12% overcharge rate in October 2025.</p><figure id="5d2e0532-685d-44b5-82fc-938aa0ede0ad" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a person holding a price tag " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bec6ad6e188b0e4e54f667d64449b402373583/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A price tag at Family Dollar on King Street in Windsor, North Carolina, on 24 November.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The chains’ pricing disparities are drawing increasing attention. In May, Arizona’s attorney general<a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-secures-consent-judgment-against-family-dollar-resolve" data-link-name="in body link"> announced</a> a $600,000 settlement to resolve a consumer-fraud investigation against Family Dollar. In October, Colorado’s attorney general <a href="https://coag.gov/2025/400k-settlement-with-dollar-general-for-overcharging-customers/" data-link-name="in body link">settled</a> with Dollar General for $400,000 after its stores failed 15 out of 23 state inspections.

I’ve [only] got so much cash on me.”</p><p>Davis, who lives on social security, said she could shop elsewhere, but that would involve paying for a bus ride. “I don’t have money like that,” she said.</p><p>Both Family Dollar and Dollar General declined interview requests and did not answer detailed lists of questions from the Guardian. Instead, both sent the Guardian brief statements.</p><p>“At Family Dollar, we take customer trust seriously and are committed to ensuring pricing accuracy across our stores,” the company said. “We are currently reviewing the concerns raised and working to better understand any potential discrepancies. We continue to be focused on providing a consistent and transparent shopping experience.”</p><p>Dollar General said it was “committed to providing customers with accurate prices on items purchased in our stores, and we are disappointed any time we fail to deliver on this commitment”. In one court case in Ohio, Dollar General’s lawyers argued that “it is virtually impossible for a retailer to match shelf pricing and scanned pricing 100% of the time for all items. Perfection in this regard is neither plausible nor expected under the law.”</p><p>The Guardian’s examination of inspection failures by the two chains was based on record requests to 45 states and more than 140 counties and cities in New York, Ohio and California, along with court documents and public databases.</p><p>In nearly half of US states, information about whether customers are being overcharged was limited or unavailable. Many states do little or nothing to monitor retail stores’ pricing practices. Some, like Maryland, Idaho and Washington, do no random inspections, responding only to consumer complaints. Illinois, South Carolina and others don’t inspect at all. In 2020, auditors in Kansas revealed that these inspections were a low priority in many states. “Consumers can check price accuracy themselves,” they wrote.</p><p>Even in states with tougher enforcement, financial penalties don’t always solve the problem: in the 23 months after Dollar General agreed in November 2023 to pay Wisconsin $850,000, its stores failed 31% of their price inspections.

When a company changes prices, the registers are updated automatically. But the shelf prices are not: someone needs to remove the old labels manually and replace them with new ones. In an industry known for minimal staffing, workers don’t always have time to put up the new shelf tags.</p><p>In many instances, customers may not notice that they are being charged more than what’s listed on the shelf. If they notice at the register, they may decide to put those items back – or ask a store employee to honor the shelf price.</p><p>Dollar General, in its statement, said its store teams “are empowered to correct the matter on the spot”. But customers and current and former employees said that while some dollar stores will correct the price, others refuse to make fixes at the register – and turn away customers who return later and request a refund.</p><p>“Overcharging even by a small amount per item can strain a really tight budget,” said Elizabeth M Harris, acting director of the New Jersey division of consumer affairs. “If you’ve ever gone into any store … with a child like I have, there’s chaos at the checkout counter and you’re not really paying attention.” With items being rung up quickly, she added, “consumers are trusting that the retailer is actually charging them the price that’s displayed.”</p><p>Her state settled in 2023 with Dollar General for $1.2m after finding more than 2,000 items rung up as overcharges across 58 stores.</p><p>Even if the overcharges paid by dollar-store customers are accidental, they still reflect the industry’s decision not to correct a problem it has known about for years, according to Kennedy Smith, a researcher at the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which works to protect communities from negative impacts of big corporations.</p><p>“If they’re called on it, they’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, our mistake,’” Kennedy said. “Until they’re called on it, they’re happy to let those scanner errors bring in the millions.”</p><h2 id="the-cheap-stuff"><strong>‘The cheap stuff’</strong></h2><p>When consumers feel economic pain,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5539547/grocery-prices-tariffs-food-inflation" data-link-name="in body link"> as they do now</a> thanks to rising costs exacerbated by tariffs, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/martin-shkreli-s-price-gouging-scandal-11725521" data-link-name="in body link">price gouging</a> and other inflationary pressures, one place they turn to are dollar stores. These one-stop centers for inexpensive food, clothing and housewares tend to sell in small quantities, one $1 chicken-noodle-soup can at a time. And they are relatively easy to get to: 75% of Americans live within 5 miles of a Dollar General, according to the company.</p><p>The industry’s largest player is flourishing. Todd Vasos, the CEO of Dollar General, told investors in August that his company’s quarterly sales had increased 5% over the same period last year. Some of that growth, he said, came from middle- and higher-income shoppers tightening their belts. But the company’s low-income “core customers” were spending more at the chain too.</p><figure id="c2a4e46f-1750-4013-aff4-98d36457f70d" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a man holding a bag " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a194b0cf1fabf01228ecf2ba68e53eda00653b05/0_0_3360_4200/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="556.25" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Chris Outlaw walks to his car after leaving  Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Those customers have been the industry’s niche from the beginning. When a 48-year-old former tobacco farmer and traveling salesman named James Luther Turner opened JL Turner and Son Wholesale Dry Goods, Shoes, Notions and Hosiery in Scottsville, Kentucky, in 1939, his mission was “to sell the cheap stuff to the poor folks”. (Someone else had cornered the market on “selling the good stuff” to Scottsville’s rich folks.)</p><p>By 1955, Turner and his eldest son, Hurley Calister “Cal” Turner Sr, were overseeing 36 stores in small southern towns. Cal Sr decided that year to co-opt the “Dollar Days” sales at big department stores and to open outlets featuring a single low price of $1. Adopting a name that nodded to the general store, he designed a bold black-and-yellow sign and that June christened the first Dollar General in Springfield, Kentucky.</p><p>Dollar General now operates over 20,000 stores in 48 states – more than any other retailer of any kind in the US. (It has long since abandoned its $1 price limit.) Though it has more than 195,000 employees and net sales of $40.6bn, the company still calls itself “America’s neighborhood general store”.</p><p>Family Dollar began in 1959 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now operates 8,000 stores nationwide. For most of the past decade, it was owned by yet another chain, Dollar Tree, but the two brands divorced last summer.</p><p>What Dollar General and Family Dollar have in common is a conspicuous presence in places that don’t offer a lot of other retail: low-income urban neighborhoods and rural towns like Windsor.</p><p>A predominantly Black county seat of 3,400 on North Carolina’s coastal plain, Windsor used to be a retail hub. “All the streets were full on a weekend,” recalled Russell Parker, a 66-year-old retired pilot. “There were people everywhere, people playing music.” And people spending money: at the fish market, the cobbler, the independent groceries, the automotive-supply store. But today Windsor’s downtown – like many rural main streets – is pocked with empty storefronts. The town never fully recovered from Hurricane Floyd, in 1999. “Every young person that graduates from high school gets on the first thing smokin’ to somewhere else,” Parker said.</p><figure id="15d44d24-f516-4c5a-9159-5715f6f8674d" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-6"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a person on a motorcycle " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b0aca2ed2466aa479bc62ef3cbddf55c477921d/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The King Street area of downtown Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>One supermarket remains on the edge of town.

In the first photo, a sticker said “SALE” in white block letters against a red background. It advertised a markdown from $7.95 to $6.50.

In February 2024, he announced a $400,000 settlement with Family Dollar to resolve similar allegations. Most of that money went to <a href="https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/Newsletters/Consumer-Advocate/February-2024/Dollar-General-settlement-brings-help-to-Ohioans" data-link-name="in body link">charitable organizations</a> that distribute food and personal-care items.</p><p>Both chains agreed in the settlements to tighten their pricing practices. Yost’s office continues to receive complaints. A Dollar General customer in Garfield Heights said in February that he was charged $6.35 for a carton of eggs with a shelf sticker of $5.10, but the “cashier was too busy having a personal call on her cellphone to address the price discrepancy”. The same month, a Family Dollar shopper in Genoa reported being charged $2.65 for cough medicine listed on the shelf at $1.50. “I was told by the cashier that there was nothing that could be done about it,” the complaint said.</p><p>Over in Missouri, state officials are pursuing a lawsuit that accuses Dollar General of “deceptive” pricing practices. The suit, filed in 2023, says 92 of the 147 stores the state checked failed their inspections, with discrepancies as high as $6.50 an item.</p><p>The companies declined to comment on these state lawsuits.</p><p>Dollar General has also been hit with private lawsuits, including several filed by its shareholders. In a document filed in August in federal court in Nashville, lawyers for Dollar General investors argued that understaffing, poor inventory control and overcharging were all interrelated.</p><p>The investors allege that the company deceived them by portraying itself as financially sound. In truth, the court filing says, “Dollar General’s inventory management processes were broken, which caused a massive bloat of excess product to clog the company at both its distribution centers and stores, and its workforce had been slashed.” These problems gave rise to price discrepancies and other “dire consequences”, the court filing asserts.</p><p>The filing includes the stories of 36 former employees who claimed direct knowledge that Dollar General managers and executives knew about the problems. Several reported notifying the top leadership directly. “All the prices were off in the stores,” said one of those ex-employees, a manager who monitored inventory levels in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She claimed to know firsthand, based on calls she participated in, that company vice-presidents and regional directors were aware of the “huge” price mismatches.</p><figure id="82087b84-c807-4451-b76e-aa18d503bc8b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-10"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Price stickers and merchandise on shelves " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab430219ae0daf3a0aa4720056822fb4e9615d1/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Price tags and merchandise inside Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Dollar General, in response, said that the testimony of a handful of ex-workers does not prove that it misled investors. In their “years-long search for fraud”, the company’s lawyers claimed, the shareholders “came up empty”.</p><p>Earlier this year, a federal judge in New Jersey halted a class-action lawsuit against Dollar General filed by a shopper who said he was overcharged for groceries. Dollar General argued that when customers create accounts – for example, by downloading the company’s mobile app – they agree to use arbitration to resolve disputes and forfeit the right to file class-action suits. The judge agreed.</p><p>This victory for Dollar General threw up an obstacle for customers seeking justice. “Who’s going to bring a consumer arbitration with a $225 filing fee over a 50-cent overcharge?” asked Marc Dann, a former Ohio attorney general whose law firm filed the New Jersey case. “They’ve essentially closed the door to the courthouse to people.”</p><p>Dann’s firm did reach a settlement with Dollar General in another case this fall, though the details have not been made public.</p><h2 id="this-endless-cycle"><strong>‘This endless cycle’</strong></h2><p>The dollar-store chains describe themselves as mission-driven companies. “Our stores are conveniently located in neighborhoods, and often in ‘food deserts’ where other stores choose not to locate,” Family Dollar says on<a href="https://corporate.familydollar.com/about-us" data-link-name="in body link"> its website</a>. Dollar General takes pride in offering value to families who, according to CEO Vasos, “have had to sacrifice even on the necessities”.</p><p>The industry’s critics say the cause and effect are reversed. “Dollar stores are often seen as a symptom of economic distress,” said the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s co-executive director, Stacy Mitchell. “What we found is that they’re, in fact, a cause of it.” Sometimes, she said, a chain dollar store will open near an independent grocer and skim off enough of its business that it is forced to close. That limits the availability of fresh produce and forces shoppers to buy more packaged and processed foods.</p><p>In a statement, Dollar General said its stores often “operate along with local grocers and business owners to collectively meet customers’ needs”. It added that 7,000 of its 20,000 stores sell fresh produce and that the company also partners with local food banks “to further help nourish our neighbors in need”.</p><p>The people enduring the effects of hollowed-out local economies – and getting hit with overcharges at dollar-store chains – include residents of Essex county, New York. The county, tucked among the stately pines of the Adirondack Mountains, has a population of 37,000. It has five Dollar Generals and two Family Dollars. All seven regularly fail pricing-accuracy tests. The Dollar General in Port Henry, which sits on the shores of Lake Champlain, was fined $103,550 for failed inspections between November 2022 and June 2025.</p><figure id="17be1aa5-370d-427d-bcc1-c673e6364e1e" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-11"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Katelyn Miller at her home in Port Henry, New York, on 24 November." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/862a0411eb58a6208437ef9a9cdca6f6531e4383/0_0_3300_2200/master/3300.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="465" height="310" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Katelyn Miller at her home in Port Henry, New York, on 24 November.</span> Photograph: Kelly Burgess/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of seven inspections, 279 out of 700 tested items were overcharges – a combined error rate of just under 40%.

With an error rate below the state’s 2% threshold, the store passed its inspection, and it did so again in November 2024.</p><p>But customers still reported problems. Chris Outlaw, the hemodialysis technician, stopped by the Family Dollar earlier this year and noticed a sale: a $1.25 savings on five bags of Cheez Doodles. He bought them but discovered on the way out that he had been charged the regular price. The manager refused to refund the difference, Outlaw said, because he had already walked through the exit door.</p><p>Another time, he saw some discounted socks near the counter that he thought would make good Christmas gifts. “I was like, ‘Oh, I like these socks, so I’ll probably give them to somebody,’” he recalled. “Nice, plushy socks.” But they rang up at a higher price, so he left the store without them.</p><figure id="113302cd-c0e7-465c-9ce5-fd2b974d5c84" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-13"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a person outside of a family dollar store " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6bac1c9575989a15a3c52e0b6e70b95c307c8f/0_0_4200_2800/master/4200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Chris Outlaw looks at his receipt after leaving  Family Dollar’s King Street location in Windsor, North Carolina.</span> Photograph: Cornell Watson/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>During a visit in August, a Guardian reporter found the Windsor Family Dollar closed for much of the afternoon. “Be Back Soon!” read a handwritten sign taped to the door.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        

        <p>The state administration of Schleswig-Holstein is making a remarkable U-turn in its IT strategy and <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schleswig-Holstein-treibt-flaechendeckenden-Einsatz-von-Open-Source-voran-10177595.html?from-en=1">consistently relying on open source</a>. After the migration from proprietary Microsoft software to free solutions <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Schleswig-Holsteins-E-Mail-Systeme-auf-Open-Source-umgestellt-10733720.html?from-en=1">was initially accompanied by problems and criticism</a>, Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter (CDU) can now report a significant success: According to his ministry, the state will save over 15 million euros in license costs for Windows, Microsoft Office &amp; Co. next year alone. It is expected to be similar in the following years.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->




  


<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>In contrast, there would be one-time investments of nine million euros in 2026, <a href="https://www.kn-online.de/schleswig-holstein/open-source-statt-microsoft-schleswig-holstein-spart-millionen-G7SUXTH42BBE3FGJC7VQQU4LTA.html" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">explained the Ministry of Digitalization to the Kieler Nachrichten</a>. These would have to be made for the conversion of workplaces and the further development of solutions with free software in the next 12 months. Given the annual savings, this sum will pay for itself in less than a year. In the past, the state transferred millions to the US company Microsoft, primarily for the use of office software and other programs.</p>
<p>The department sees the departure from this "vendor lock-in" – the dependence on a single large provider – as a clear signal for greater independence and sustainable digitalization. The financial incentive now underscores that digital sovereignty can be not only a political buzzword but also an economic gain.</p>
<h3 id="nav_almost_80__0">Almost 80 percent of licenses canceled</h3>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves: outside the tax administration, almost 80 percent of workplaces in the state administration have already been switched to the open-source office software LibreOffice. Schrödter thus confirms a course that reduces technical and economic dependence on individual manufacturers. The consequence of the conversion was already evident recently, <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Schleswig-Holstein-Fast-80-Prozent-der-Microsoft-Lizenzen-gekuendigt-10960941.html?from-en=1">as Schrödter emphasized in an interview with c't</a>. Regarding the status of Microsoft license cancellations, he said: "We are at almost 80, without the tax administration." For tax matters, the state finance ministers have "given themselves a clear timetable for the switch." Recently, the Christian Democrat also emphasized, according to the Südtiroler Wirtschaftszeitung, that the state has entered a marathon, not just a sprint.</p>
<p>The remaining 20 percent of workplaces are currently still dependent on Microsoft programs such as Word or Excel, as there is a technical dependency on these programs in certain specialized applications. According to Schrödter, however, the successive conversion of these remaining computers is the stated goal.</p>
<h3 id="nav_opposition_sees__1">Opposition sees challenges</h3>
<p>Despite the savings and the almost completed migration in large parts of the administration, the opposition continues to criticize the quality of the conversion. SPD state parliament member Kianusch Stender pointed out to the Kieler Nachrichten: "It may be that on paper 80 percent of workplaces have been converted. But far fewer than 80 percent of employees can now work with them properly." Errors in the migration are "still present." The initial difficulties in introducing the open-source programs have apparently led to ongoing frustration among some employees in certain areas.</p>

<p>The Green state parliament member Jan Kürschner also admitted in an interview with heise online that such a comprehensive conversion would not go without friction. <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Interview-Wie-die-OSS-Umstellung-in-Schleswig-Holstein-laeuft-10629991.html?from-en=1">But he emphasized the long-term nature of the project</a> and the necessity of fundamentally rethinking administrative processes: "With the change, there is an opportunity to truly rethink the administration and free ourselves from old burdens. That is the great added value." If only a one-to-one conversion is made, it might certainly "stumble at one point or another." But those who truly optimize administrative processes will likely find in the end: "Open source is the better way."</p>
<p>The challenge now is to resolve the initial migration problems and acceptance difficulties and to further develop the open-source solutions so that they fully meet the requirements of a modern state administration. The savings achieved give Schleswig-Holstein more financial leeway for this.</p>

		<p>Programs running in windowing environments, <em>applications</em> as we used to know them, have more complicated requirements than those run from a command line. Rather than embed all the resources they require for windows, menus and the rest in a single file, Mac OS broke new ground by putting those into resources stored in the app’s resource fork.</p>

<p>This is QuarkXPress version 4.11 from around 2000, with its resources displayed in the resource editor ResEdit. Executable code was also stored in CODE resources, and every file contained type and creator information to support the illusions created by the Finder.</p>
<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<p>When Mac OS X was designed, it switched to the bundle structure inherited from NeXTSTEP. Instead of this multitude of resources, apps consisted of a hierarchy of directories containing files of executable code, and those with what had in Mac OS been supporting resources. Those app bundles came to adopt a standard form, shown below.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="89632" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/04/the-anatomy-of-a-macos-app/anatomyofapposx/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg" data-orig-size="1240,940" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="AnatomyOfAppOSX" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=940" src="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="713" srcset="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=940&amp;h=713 940w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=300&amp;h=227 300w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=768&amp;h=582 768w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=776 1024w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/anatomyofapposx.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></span></p>
<p>The bundle name has the extension .app, and contains a single directory Contents. Within that, the executable code is in the MacOS directory, which may contain both the main executable for the GUI app and any bundled command tools provided. Another directory contains Resources, including the app’s custom icon, and components of its GUI. In some apps, there’s another directory of Frameworks containing dylibs (libraries).</p>
<p>There are also two important files, Info.plist and PkgInfo. The latter contains the same type and creator information inherited from Classic Mac OS, and apparently isn’t mandatory although it appears universal. The information property list is essential, as it specifies the names of the executable and its icon file in Resources, the minimum version of macOS required, type declarations of the app’s documents, version numbers, and more.</p>
<p>When running a command tool in macOS, its Mach-O executable is launched by <code>launchd</code>, whose purpose is to run code. Launching an app is more demanding, although the app’s executable is still launched by <code>launchd</code>. Before that can happen, macOS starts the launch process using LaunchServices and RunningBoard, which rely on information obtained from Info.plist and other components in the app bundle.</p>
<h4>macOS</h4>
<p>This structure remained stable until the introduction of code signatures in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007. Accommodating those added a directory named _CodeSignature containing the signature in a CodeResources file. That includes code directory hashes (CDHashes) to check the integrity of the contents of the app bundle. Apps distributed by the App Store include a store receipt in another directory, _MASReceipt. Since 2018, when Apple introduced notarization, the ‘ticket’ issued by Apple can be ‘stapled’ into the app bundle as the file CodeResources.</p>
<p>Many apps come with additional items that might in the past have been installed by them in their Library/Application Support folders and elsewhere, but are now included in the app bundle. These can include the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library, containing folders of LaunchDaemons and LoginItems that would previously have been installed in either the main Library folder, or that in the user’s Home folder;</li>
<li>XPCServices, for executable code that the app uses to provide specific services;</li>
<li>Plugins, for some types of app extension (Appex);</li>
<li>Extensions, for other types of app extension, including app intents.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also come across other components, including a version.plist in Apple’s apps.</p>
<p>This centralisation of components in the app bundle has brought several benefits. Being self-contained, apps are easier to install and update, and cleaner to remove. Their components are less likely to go missing, and most of all they’re held within the protection of the app’s signature and notarisation, an important improvement in security.</p>
<p>Assembling these into a diagram shows how the anatomy of an app has grown over the last few years.</p>

<p>Components shown in pale yellow are either mandatory or essentially universal. Those shown in green are found in apps distributed through the App Store, while that shown in blue is the stapled notarisation ticket (optional). You will also see additional folders and components such as Automator workflows, scripts, and others.</p>
<p>There is no difference in structure between apps built for current Intel and Arm architectures. That’s because binaries in the MacOS folder (and executable code in other directories like Frameworks, XPCServices and Plugins) contain platform-specific code in a single Mach-O executable. Thus, an app that’s Universal and runs native on both architectures includes code for both in its single ‘fat’ code file, and they even have separate signatures stored within common files.</p>

    <p data-block-key="il1w2">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transformer architecture</a> revolutionized <a href="https://medium.com/machine-learning-basics/sequence-modelling-b2cdf244c233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sequence modeling</a> with its introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_%28machine_learning%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attention</a>, a mechanism by which models look back at earlier inputs to prioritize relevant input data. However, computational cost increases drastically with sequence length, which limits the ability to scale Transformer-based models to extremely long contexts, such as those required for full-document understanding or genomic analysis.</p><p data-block-key="36kb5">The research community explored various approaches for solutions, such as efficient linear <a href="https://www.d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-modern/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recurrent neural networks</a> (RNNs) and <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/lbourdois/get-on-the-ssm-train" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state space models</a> (SSMs) like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mamba-2</a>. These models offer fast, linear scaling by compressing context into a fixed-size. However, this fixed-size compression cannot adequately capture the rich information in very long sequences.</p><p data-block-key="40m00">In two new papers, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Titans</i></a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>MIRAS</i></a>, we introduce an architecture and theoretical blueprint that combine the speed of RNNs with the accuracy of transformers. Titans is the specific architecture (the tool), and MIRAS is the theoretical framework (the blueprint) for generalizing these approaches. Together, they advance the concept of test-time memorization, the ability of an AI model to maintain long-term memory by incorporating more powerful “surprise” metrics (i.e., unexpected pieces of information) while the model is running and without dedicated offline retraining.</p><p data-block-key="eic3n">The MIRAS framework, as demonstrated by Titans, introduces a meaningful shift toward real-time adaptation. Instead of compressing information into a static state, this architecture actively learns and updates its own parameters as data streams in. This crucial mechanism enables the model to incorporate new, specific details into its core knowledge instantly.</p>

    <p data-block-key="il1w2">An effective learning system requires distinct yet interconnected memory modules, mirroring the <a href="https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/">human brain's separation of short-term and long-term memory</a>.</p><p data-block-key="dpe7v">While attention mechanisms excel for precise, short-term memory, Titans introduces a novel neural <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07174#:~:text=LongMem%20can:%20*%20Memorize%20long%20past%20context,Yan%20*%20Jianfeng%20Gao%20*%20Furu%20Wei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term memory module</a>, that, unlike the fixed-size vector or matrix memory in traditional RNNs, acts as a deep neural network (specifically, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-layer perceptron</a>). This memory module provides significantly higher expressive power, allowing the model to summarize large volumes of information without losing important context. The model isn't simply taking notes; it's understanding and synthesizing the entire story.</p><p data-block-key="e95op">Crucially, Titans doesn’t just passively store data. It actively learns <i>how</i> to recognize and retain important relationships and conceptual themes that connect tokens across the entire input. A key aspect of this ability is what we call the “surprise metric”. In human psychology, we know we quickly and easily forget routine, expected events but remember things that break the pattern — unexpected, surprising, or highly emotional events.</p>

    <p data-block-key="il1w2">In the context of Titans, the "surprise metric" is the model detecting a large difference between what it currently remembers and what the new input is telling it.</p><ul><li data-block-key="a9lns"><i>Low surprise</i>: If the new word is "cat" and the model's memory state already expects an animal word, the gradient (surprise) is low. It can safely skip memorizing the word "cat" in its permanent long-term state.</li><li data-block-key="2t2sa"><i>High surprise</i>: If the model's memory state is summarizing a serious financial report, and the new input is a picture of a banana peel (the unexpected event), the gradient (surprise) will be very high. This signals that the new input is important or anomalous, and it must be prioritized for permanent storage in the long-term memory module.</li></ul><p data-block-key="djj22">The model uses this internal error signal (the gradient) as a mathematical equivalent of saying, "This is unexpected and important!" This allows the Titans architecture to selectively update its long-term memory only with the most novel and context-breaking information, keeping the overall process fast and efficient.</p><p data-block-key="dm2am">Titans refines this mechanism by incorporating two critical elements:</p><ol><li data-block-key="bb101"><i>Momentum</i>: The model considers both "momentary surprise" (the current input) and "past surprise" (the recent context flow). This ensures relevant subsequent information is also captured, even if those tokens are not individually surprising.</li><li data-block-key="b269a"><i>Forgetting (weight decay)</i>: To manage the finite capacity of the memory when dealing with extremely long sequences, Titans employ an adaptive weight decay mechanism. This acts as a forgetting gate, allowing the model to discard information that is no longer needed.</li></ol>

By using this constraint, it ensures that every time the memory state is updated, the changes are controlled and balanced.

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="il1w2">Ablation studies clearly show that the depth of the memory architecture is crucial. When comparing long-term memory modules of the same size but different depths, modules with deeper memories consistently achieve lower perplexity in language modeling. Furthermore, they exhibit better scaling properties, maintaining performance as the sequence length increases significantly.</p>

    <p data-block-key="il1w2">In language modeling and commonsense reasoning tasks, Titans architectures outperform state-of-the-art linear recurrent models (such as Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet) and Transformer++ baselines of comparable sizes. The novel MIRAS variants (MONETA, YAAD, MEMORA) also achieve improved performance compared to these baselines, validating the benefit of exploring robust, non-MSE optimization mechanisms. Importantly, these models maintain efficient, parallelizable training and fast linear inference speeds.</p>

    <p data-block-key="il1w2">The most significant advantage of these new architectures is their ability to handle extremely long contexts. This is highlighted in the <a href="https://github.com/booydar/babilong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BABILong benchmark</a>, a task requiring reasoning across facts distributed in extremely long documents. In this challenging setting, Titans outperforms all baselines, including extremely large models like GPT-4, despite having many fewer parameters.

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="il1w2">The introduction of Titans and the MIRAS framework marks a significant advancement in sequence modeling. By employing deep neural networks as memory modules that learn to memorize as data is coming in, these approaches overcome the limitations of fixed-size recurrent states. Furthermore, MIRAS provides a powerful theoretical unification, revealing the connection between online optimization, associative memory, and architectural design. By moving beyond the standard Euclidean paradigm, this research opens the door to a new generation of sequence models that combine the efficiency of RNNs with the expressive power needed for the era of long-context AI.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2025/12/java-hello-world-llvm-edition.html">https://www.javaadvent.com/2025/12/java-hello-world-llvm-edition.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46181076">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
<p>After exploring Java bytecode in previous years (<a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2022/12/jvm-hello-world.html">2022</a>, <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2023/12/my-first-compiler.html">2023</a>, <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2024/12/peering-through-the-peephole-build-a-peephole-optimiser-using-the-new-java-class-file-api.html">2024</a>), this year we’ll take an unexpected detour for a Java advent: instead of generating Java bytecode, we’ll use Java to build and execute <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM IR</a>, the intermediate language behind compilers like clang.</p>



<p>Using Java’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html">Foreign Function &amp; Memory (FFM) API</a>, we’ll call the LLVM C API, generate a “Hello, World!” program, and even JIT-compile it to native code – all from Java.</p>



<p>The task is simple: create a program that simply prints “Hello, World!”. But we must do this from Java via LLVM.</p>



<h2>What is LLVM?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM Project</a>, a collection of modular compiler and toolchain technologies, began as a research project over 20 years ago at the University of Illinois. It has grown significantly, underpinning many compilers and tools like clang.</p>



<p>The core libraries provide a source &amp; target independent optimizer along with code generation for a multitude of target machines. They are built around the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM IR</a>, an intermediate representation, which we’ll generate &amp; execute from Java.</p>



<h2>Installing LLVM</h2>



<p>To use the LLVM C API from Java, we’ll need LLVM’s shared libraries and headers installed locally. There is an automatic installation script available to easily install LLVM on Ubuntu/Debian systems, for example to install LLVM 20:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ ./llvm.sh 20
</pre></div>


<p>Once we have LLVM installed we can use the LLVM tooling to execute textual-form LLVM IR and we’ll also be able to use the LLVM C API in Java via the FFM API.</p>



<h2>LLVM IR</h2>



<p>LLVM IR is a strongly-typed, SSA-based intermediate language. It abstracts away most machine-specific details, making it easier to represent high-level constructs in a compiler-friendly format. There are three equivalent representations of the IR: an in-memory format, a bitcode format for serialisation and<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html"> a human readable assembly language representation</a>.</p>



<p>The textual form of the LLVM IR for our “Hello, World!” looks like this:</p>


<div><pre title="">@str = private constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

declare i32 @puts(ptr)

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
</pre></div>


<p>Eventually, we’ll generate this via Java but, for now, if you save this in a file called helloworld.ll you can try executing it with the LLVM interpreter, <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lli.html">lli</a>:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ lli helloworld.ll
Hello, World!
</pre></div>


<p>There are a few types of entities used in the helloworld.ll example:</p>



<ul>
<li>A global variable containing the string “Hello World!”</li>



<li>A declaration of the external <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/puts.3.html">libc puts</a> function</li>



<li>A definition of the main function</li>



<li>Instructions to call puts and return an integer exit code</li>
</ul>



<p>You can dive deeper into the <a href="https://jameshamilton.eu/programming/llvm-hello-world">LLVM “Hello, World!” example here</a> if you like before continuing to the next section, where we’ll start using the Java FFM API.</p>



<h2>What is the Java FFM API?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html">Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API</a> enables Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime. The API is a replacement for the older JNI API that enables Java programs to call native libraries in a safer way. The API can be used to call foreign functions and safely access foreign memory that is not managed by the JVM.</p>



<p>A companion to the FFM API is a tool named <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/call-native-functions-jextract.html">jextract</a> that can automatically generate Java bindings from a C header file. <code>jextract</code> parses C header files and automatically generates the Java source code with method handles and type-safe FFM bindings.</p>



<p>We’ll use the <code>jextract</code> tool to generate bindings for the LLVM C API and those bindings will allow us to call the LLVM API from Java.</p>



<h2>Getting started</h2>



<p>First, let’s create a simple project to start. We’ll use maven to build our project but you can use another build tool if you like, it’s not important:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=jvm-llvm-helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
</pre></div>


<p>Once you have a project skeleton, update the pom.xml file to set the Java version &gt;= 22:</p>


<div><pre title=""> &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;25&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;
    &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;25&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;
 &lt;/properties&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Then build and run the program to check everything is OK:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ mvn clean install
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
Hello World!
</pre></div>


<p>The maven generated sample already printed “Hello, World!” but that’s too easy! We’ll remove that and generate it via LLVM in the following sections.</p>



<p>Let’s now create the LLVM bindings using <code>jextract</code> so that we can use the LLVM API.</p>



<h2>Creating LLVM bindings</h2>



<p>We’ll use jextract to generate bindings from the LLVM C API header files. Make sure LLVM is available on your system (see Installing LLVM above) and you’ll also need to download <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/call-native-functions-jextract.html">jextract</a>.</p>



<p>The following jextract command (on Linux) will create Java bindings for the specified LLVM C headers, placing the generated code into the <code>com.example.llvm</code> package within the <code>src/main/java</code> directory, with the main header class named <code>LLVM</code>.</p>


<div><pre title="">$ jextract -l LLVM-20 -I /usr/include/llvm-c-20 \
     -I /usr/include/llvm-20 \
     -t com.example.llvm \
     --output src/main/java \
     --header-class-name LLVM \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Core.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Support.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/ExecutionEngine.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Target.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/TargetMachine.h
</pre></div>


<p>To test the generated bindings, let’s print the LLVM version using the static method generated for LLVM version string constant: edit the sample’s App.java file to print the version using the following:</p>



<p>If you run this, you’ll see the LLVM version printed:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED com.example.App
LLVM version: 20.0.0
</pre></div>


<p>Note the use of <code>--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED</code> to prevent warnings about native code access; I’ll omit this for brevity in later commands.</p>



<h2>Memory Segments</h2>



<p>The <code>LLVM_VERSION_STRING</code> method returns a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/foreign/MemorySegment.html">MemorySegment</a> rather than a Java String. In the FFM API, a <code>MemorySegment</code> represents a contiguous region of memory—either on or off the Java heap—enabling safe, structured access to native memory.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the implementation in the generated source file:</p>


<div><pre title="">   public static MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING() {
    class Holder {
      static final MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING
         = LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA.allocateFrom("20.0.0");
    }
    return Holder.LLVM_VERSION_STRING;
  }
</pre></div>


<p>This method allocates memory containing the version string that contains the version number. The allocated MemorySegment is returned from the method and to get the String back into Java-land we need to call <code>getString(0)</code> on the memory segment which reads a null-terminated string at the given offset (<code>0</code>), using the UTF-8 charset.</p>



<p>Memory segments are managed through arenas (such as the <code>LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA</code> in the code above), which bridge Java’s managed heap and foreign memory spaces by applying familiar resource management patterns like try-with-resources.</p>



<p>Since we’ll need to allocate native memory, let’s declare an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/foreign/Arena.html">Arena</a>:</p>


<div><pre title=""> public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
       // TODO
    }
 }
</pre></div>


<h2>Creating an LLVM module</h2>



<p>As a reminder, we need to recreate the following LLVM IR via the LLVM C API:</p>


<div><pre title="">declare i32 @puts(ptr)

@str = constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
</pre></div>


<p>Let’s start by creating an LLVM module – the container for all functions and globals – and print it so that we can run it through the LLVM interpreter:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // TODO: Fill in the module
            
  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If we execute this now, we’ll see an empty IR module:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"
</pre></div>


<p>If you pass this output through the LLVM interpreter, you’ll see that it tries to execute the module but cannot find the entry point main function:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
</pre></div>


<p>We now have an LLVM module, but it has no executable code – the interpreter rightly complains that main is missing; so let’s add the main function.</p>



<h2>Adding a main function</h2>



<p>The entry point to our program is the function named main which takes no parameters and returns an integer exit code, where a non-negative integer denotes success. We can add a function to the module using the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreModule.html#gaaf70ab92a261e636dc0b2cf30cfede9a">LLVMAddFunction</a> function, along with the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1FunctionType.html">LLVMFunctionType</a> and <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreTypeInt.html#ga71ee1444644798c8750ffb5be6a06819">LLVMInt32Type</a> functions to create the function type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notice that all of these functions return a <code>MemorySegment</code> and all 3 <code>LLVMAddFunction</code> parameters are <code>MemorySegment</code>s.</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

    // TODO: Add the code

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If you execute this now you’ll see a declaration of the main function but it has no body so the LLVM interpreter will produce the same error:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

declare i32 @main()

$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App|lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
</pre></div>


<p>Next we’ll add some instructions to the body of the function.</p>



<h2>Adding an entry basic block</h2>



<p>In order to add code to a function we need to add at least 1 basic block – the entry block. A basic block is a sequence of instructions within a function that executes straight through from start to finish, with no branches in the middle. These blocks form the nodes of the Control-Flow Graph (CFG), and they connect to each other based on how control flows between them.</p>



<p>Basic blocks can be added to a function with the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreValueBasicBlock.html#gaf1760061b837b6b255224f243cfe94c8">LLVMAppendBasicBlock</a> function:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 
	  // TODO: Add the instructions

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If you run the program through <code>lli</code> now, you’ll see a different error:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
lli: &lt;stdin&gt;:6:1: error: expected instruction opcode
}
</pre></div>


<p>That makes sense, we don’t yet have any instructions in our function!</p>



<h2>Building instructions</h2>



<p>To add instructions, we first create an instruction builder using the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#ga0b336d71db0aa80eef35fe0572ca69bb">LLVMCreateBuilder</a> function. This gives us an LLVMBuilder that we can use to insert new instructions into a basic block.</p>



<p>We’ll also use the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#gab9bdbf21d7fd0bc5a2ee669b333ced2a">LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd</a> function to position the builder at the end of the entry block and <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#gab246fd9294b3801060f0ceb972c262d0">LLVMBuildRet</a> to build a return instruction:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>If you run the program and pass the output through <code>lli</code> now, you’ll see nothing happen:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
</pre></div>


<p>Great news – the errors are gone! Checking the return code confirms the program exited successfully, returning 0.</p>





<p>Try changing the 0 to some other number to confirm that the value is indeed coming from the exit code returned by the LLVM IR program!</p>



<h2>Global variables</h2>



<p>A global variable, defined at the top-level in LLVM IR, defines a region of memory with a fixed address that is allocated when the program is loaded, rather than dynamically at runtime. Globals can be declared as constant if their values will never change.</p>



<p>We’ll add the string “Hello, World!” to our LLVM program as a global constant.</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>We don’t use the <code>hello_str</code> yet so running <code>lli</code> would produce the same as before, but you can see the string is now declared in the LLVM IR (prefixed with @ because it is a global, like the main function):</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

@hello_str = private unnamed_addr constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00", align 1

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  ret i32 0
}
</pre></div>


<p>Let’s add the final instruction next – a call to <code>puts</code> to print the string.</p>



<h2>Calling functions</h2>



<p>Before we can call the libc puts function we must declare it in the module by first building the function type and then calling <code>LLVMAddFunction</code> to add it to the module:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>Now that we’ve declared the function we can call it with the <code>@hello_str</code> global as a parameter using the <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMCCoreInstructionBuilder.html#ga40cf5b22d9d28f1f82e76048a69d537a">LLVMBuildCall2</a> function:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>Running the program’s output through <code>lli</code> will finally display the expected result: “Hello, World!”:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Hello, World!
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations, you’ve successfully used the Java FFM API to call the LLVM C API to build an LLVM module that contains code to print “Hello, World!”.</p>



<h2>Just-in-time (JIT) Compilation</h2>



<p>So far, we’ve been printing LLVM IR and letting <code>lli</code> execute it. But LLVM also exposes a JIT compiler API, allowing us to generate and execute machine code in-memory. Let’s see how to JIT our “Hello, World!” directly from Java.</p>



<p>LLVM IR is target independent but once we start compiling to native code we must know which machine we are targeting. We’ll target x86 Linux in the following code; if you’re using ARM, Mac or Windows you’ll need to adjust the code for your machine.</p>



<p>The first step is to initialise and create an LLVM JIT compiler for the target machine:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p><code>LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule</code> sets up a JIT execution engine to compile an LLVM module to native machine code. <code>LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule</code> will return a 1 upon failure and then we can check the error message string for more information but to simplify things we’ll ignore error handling for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Requesting the address of the main function triggers its compilation – LLVM generates the machine code only when it’s first needed, hence the name Just-In-Time compilation. We can retrieve a pointer to the compiled function using <code>LLVMGetPointerToGlobal</code>:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>Now that we’ve compiled the function, we need a way to invoke it from Java. To do this, we use the foreign linker to create a <code>MethodHandle</code> for the JIT-compiled main function. This handle acts as a callable reference to the native code:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>downcallHandle</code> method tells Java how to interpret the native function’s signature – in this case, a function that takes no arguments and returns an int.</p>



<p>Now we can invoke the compiled native function directly from Java, just like a regular method call:</p>


<div><pre title="">public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Execute the main function via the method handle.
    try {
      int result = (int) functionHandle.invoke();
      System.out.println("main() returned: " + result);
    } catch (Throwable e) {
      System.err.println("Error calling JIT function: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
</pre></div>


<p>When <code>functionHandle.invoke()</code> runs, Java crosses into the native world and calls the machine code that was just compiled by the LLVM JIT compiler.</p>



<p>And that’s it, you can now run the Java application without the LLVM interpreter and see the resulting “Hello, World!”:</p>


<div><pre title="">$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
Hello, World!
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations, you’ve now JIT-compiled Hello World, with the help of Java’s FFM API calling LLVM’s C API.</p>



<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>In this Java advent we built and executed native machine code from pure Java and a little help from LLVM – no JNI, no C glue, just memory segments, method handles, and a modern FFI. By the end, we had just a simple program that prints “Hello, World!” but it shows the potential of the Java FFM API and the things you can do when Java and native code work together.</p>



<p>Now see what else you can do, for example, try generating other instructions: print more text, do simple calculations, or even build tiny programs entirely in LLVM from Java.</p>

		<p><em>Homemade&nbsp;1000+ transistor array chip&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In 2018 I made the <a href="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/">first lithographically fabricated integrated circuits</a>&nbsp;in my garage fab. I was a senior in high school&nbsp;when I made the Z1 amplifier, and now I’m a senior in college so there are some long overdue improvements to the amateur silicon process.<a href="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DSC_9414_an.jpg"><br>

The Z1 had&nbsp;6 transistors and was a great test chip to develop all the processes and equipment.&nbsp;The Z2 has 100 transistors on a 10µm <a href="http://www.intel4004.com/sgdm.htm">polysilicon gate</a> process – same technology as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">Intel’s first processor</a>. My chip is a simple 10×10 array of transistors to test, characterize, and tweak the process but this is a huge step closer to more advanced DIY computer chips. The Intel 4004 has 2,200 transistors and I’ve now made 1,200&nbsp;on the same piece of silicon.</p>

<p>Previously, I made chips&nbsp;with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_gate">metal gate process</a>. The aluminum gate has a large work function difference with the silicon channel beneath it which results in a high threshold voltage (&gt;10V). I used these metal gate transistors in a few fun projects like a <a href="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1280249239495479297">guitar distortion pedal</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1263940735923093505">ring oscillator LED blinker</a>&nbsp;but both of these required one or two 9V batteries to run the circuit due to high Vth. By switching to a polysilicon gate process, I get a ton of performance benefits (self aligned gate means lower overlap capacitances) including a much lower Vth which makes these chips compatible with 2.5V and 3.3V logic levels. The new FETs have excellent characteristics:</p>
<pre><strong>NMOS Electrical Properties:</strong>
Vth             = 1.1 V
Vgs MAX         = 8 V
Cgs             = &lt;0.9 pF
Rise/fall time  = &lt;10 ns
On/off ratio    = 4.3e6
Leakage current = 932 pA (Vds=2.5V)
</pre>
<p>I was particularly surprised by the super low leakage current. This value goes up about 100x in ambient room lighting.</p>

<p>Now we know that it’s possible to make really good transistors with impure chemicals, no cleanroom, and homemade equipment. Of course, yield and process repeatability are&nbsp;diminished. I’ll do more testing to collect data on the statistics and variability of FET properties but it’s looking good!</p>

<p>The chip is small, about one quarter the die area of my previous ICs (2.4mm^2) which makes it&nbsp;hard to probe.&nbsp;There’s a simple 10×10 array of N-channel FETs on each chip which will give me a lot of characterization data. Since it’s such a&nbsp;simple&nbsp;design, I was able to lay&nbsp;it out&nbsp;using Photoshop. Columns of 10 transistors share a common gate connection and each row is strung together in series with adjacent transistors sharing a source/drain terminal. It’s similar to NAND flash but I only did this to&nbsp;keep the metal pads large enough so I can reasonably probe them, if every FET had 3 pads for itself they would be too small.</p>

<p>So far I’ve made an opamp (Z1) and a memory-like array (Z2). More interesting&nbsp;circuits are definitely possible even with this low transistor density.&nbsp;The process needs&nbsp;some tweaking&nbsp;but now that I’m able to consistently make good quality transistors I should be able to design more complex digital and analog circuits. Testing each chip is very&nbsp;tedious&nbsp;so I am trying to automate the process and I’ll post more data then. I’ve made 15 chips (1,500 transistors) and know there’s at least one completely functional chip and at least two “mostly functional”, meaning ~80% of the transistors work instead of 100%. No proper yield data yet. The most common defect is a drain or source shorted to the bulk silicon channel, not a leaky or shorted gate like on my Z1 process.</p>

<p>I said before that the gate used to be made out of aluminum and now it’s silicon which makes the chips work a lot better. Silicon comes in three varieties that we care about: amorphous, polycrystalline, and monocrystalline.&nbsp;From left to right, these become more electrically conductive but also much harder to deposit.&nbsp;In fact,&nbsp;monocrystalline Si can’t be deposited, you can only grow it in contact with another mono-Si layer as a seed (epitaxy). Since the gate must be deposited on top of an insulating dielectric, poly is the best we can do. We can heavily dope the polysilicon anyway to make it more conductive.</p>

<p>A typical self-aligned polysilicon gate process&nbsp;requires silane, a&nbsp;toxic and explosive gas, to&nbsp;deposit polycrystalline silicon layers. It may also be possible by sputtering or <a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://sid.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sdtp.10835">evaporating amorphous silicon and annealing with a laser</a>.&nbsp;A major theme of this DIY silicon process is to circumvent expensive, difficult, or dangerous steps. So, I came up with a modified process flow. It’s a variation on the standard self-aligned&nbsp;methods&nbsp;to allow doping via high temperature diffusion rather than ion implantation. The effect is that I’m able to buy a silicon wafer with the&nbsp;polysilicon already deposited on it&nbsp;from the factory and pattern it to make transistors instead of putting my own polysilicon down halfway through the process. This is a nice short term workaround but it would be best to design a polysilicon deposition process using the laser anneal method mentioned above.</p>
<p>Wafers are available with all kinds of materials deposited on them already, so I just had to find one with a thin layer of SiO2 (gate oxide, ~10nm) followed by a thicker polysilicon (300nm). I found a lot of 25 200mm (EPI, prime, [1-0-0], p-type) wafers on eBay for $45 which is essentially a lifetime supply, so email me if you want one. The gate oxide is the most&nbsp;fragile layer and requires the most care during fabrication. Since I bought the wafer with a nice high quality oxide on it already that was capped off and kept clean by the thick polysilicon layer,&nbsp;I was able to eliminate all the&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;cleaning chemicals (sulfuric acid, etc) from the process and still&nbsp;make great transistors. Minimal process chemicals and tools are listed below.</p>

<p>Because I bought the wafer already with gate oxide and polysilicon on it, I can’t grow a field oxide. These thick oxide layers are typically used to mask dopants and require a long high temperature step which would oxidize all of my poly and there would be none remaining. So, my modified process uses an additional masking step (the “gate” mask is typically not found in a self-aligned process) that allows me to use the polysilicon itself as a dopant mask and hard-baked photoresist as the field dielectric. This alternative processing results in the stepped structure you can see in the orange region on the NMOS cross section above.&nbsp;This process subtlety&nbsp;is mentioned here, <a href="https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1426534655197646857?s=20">read this twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>This process isn’t ideal and I want to make some changes so it’s CMOS compatible but it simplifies fabrication and makes it possible with a minimal set of tools. The 1µm dielectric layer (orange) would ideally be CVD SiO2 (it’s possible to build a&nbsp;TEOS oxide reactor at home) but I used a photoresist instead. Most photoresists can be baked around 250°C to form a hard permanent dielectric layer that is&nbsp;an easy alternative to CVD or PECVD oxide. A spin-on-glass/sol-gel could also be used here. SiO2 etching is done with a <a href="https://sam.zeloof.xyz/sio2-patterning/">buffered HF solution made from rust stain remover</a>&nbsp;or RIE.</p>
