<h3>Learn from a real LLM</h3>



<p>Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need implements the forward pass of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2">GPT2</a>&nbsp;(an ancestor of ChatGPT that was state of the art only a few years ago) entirely in Excel using standard spreadsheet functions.</p>



<p>This same Transformer architecture is the foundation for OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude, Google‚Äôs Bard/Gemini, Meta‚Äôs Llama, and many other LLMs.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2: Byte Pair Encoding &amp; Tokenization</h3>



<p>In this lesson we dive into the first phase of GPT, the tokenization phase and the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm used in models like ChatGPT. We cover</p>



<ul>
<li>Detailed walkthrough of the BPE algorithm, including its learning phase and application in language data tokenization. </li>



<li>Spreadsheet Simulation: A hands-on demonstration of the GPT-2‚Äôs tokenization process via a spreadsheet model. </li>

<h3>Downloading</h3>



<p>The sheet is available as an xlsb (Excel binary) file in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ianand/spreadsheets-are-all-you-need/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Releases section</a>&nbsp;of the github repo. You should be able to download and run this file in Excel for Mac or PC.</p>



<h3>Using</h3>



<p>If you‚Äôre quickly trying to orient yourself to the spreadsheet this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjD2n_e9E3w">walk through video</a> may be helpful though it is not oriented to beginners. For beginners, it‚Äôs recommended to start with the lesson videos.</p>



<p>Please realize the implementation is just enough to run very small workloads:</p>



<ul>
<li>Full GPT2 small (124M parameters) model including byte pair encoding, embeddings, multi-headed attention, and multi-layer perceptron stages</li>



<li>Inference/forward pass only (no training)</li>



<li>Context is limited to 10 tokens in length</li>



<li>10 characters per word limit</li>



<li>Zero temperature output only</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>This sheet is very big.</strong>&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is not unusual for Excel to lock up (but only on a Mac) while using this spreadsheet. It is highly recommended to use the manual calculation mode in Excel and the Windows version of Excel (either on a Windows directory or via Parallels on a Mac).</p>



<h3>Issues</h3>



<p>Bugs are not out of the question. Please file issues on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ianand/spreadsheets-are-all-you-need">Github</a></p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>



<h3>What about Google Sheets?</h3>



<p>This project actually started on Google Sheets but the full 124M model was too big and switched to Excel. I‚Äôm still exploring ways to make this work in Google Sheets but it is unlikely to fit into a single file as it can with Excel.</p>



<h3>Why can‚Äôt I chat with it like ChatGPT? It doesn‚Äôt match the output of ChatGPT?</h3>



<p>Aside from the minuscule context length, it also lacks the instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that turn a large language model into a chatbot.</p>



<h3>Why is it called Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need</h3>



<p>The name is a play on the title of the famous&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>&nbsp;paper which first described the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer machine learning architecture</a>&nbsp;that underlies ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and many of the latest Generative AI tools.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>My tech posts often come from kind of a negative place. I wish it wasn‚Äôt like that, but we all know how the mind works: writing with nuance and positivity is a lot harder than fired-up screeds of the ‚Äúsomeone is wrong on the Internet‚Äù variety. I do try to check myself. I know that people come from all kinds of situations and codebases, everyone is doing their best given the conditions they‚Äôre in, and there really is no One True Way to write code. I will at least always try to give a good sense of how I‚Äôd prefer things be done instead, rather than just pointing at something and saying it‚Äôs bad.</p>

<p>But I think there‚Äôs another reason why I come across as negative or angry. And as always with these things it‚Äôs hard to tell if I‚Äôm just jaded and ossified from having spent my entire adult life touching keyboards, or if it has real merit: I feel like the web used to <em>work better</em>. Not in the sense of features or flagship sites‚Äîweb-based email clients and word processors and image editors are all waaay better than they used to be and I would say the high-quality stuff is of higher quality than ever. I‚Äôm not pining for the HTML-only version of GMail, I promise. But if I were to estimate some rough median of ‚Äúhow well do websites work‚Äù I would also say that there‚Äôs an <em>incredible</em> amount of jank out there. My father called me in exasperation last night after trying and failing to book a plane ticket. I find myself having to go over to their house and do things like switch browsers, open private windows, occasionally even open up the Web Inspector to fiddle with the markup, and I hate every second of it. I‚Äôve trained myself out of using the Back button and opening things in new windows, and I will often close and restart order flows rather than try to go back and edit something I messed up. And I just‚Ä¶ WHY. Why is it so hard?</p>

<p>Your web browser is an amazing piece of software. Give it an HTML page and it‚Äôll render and lay it out in milliseconds, and if you let it do what it wants to do (follow a link when it‚Äôs clicked, submit a form with a button, populate input fields, etc) it‚Äôll just <em>work like everyone expects it to</em>. I think that‚Äôs where most of my pathos comes from: I have a lived experience from the Before Times when things were just pages and forms, and it turns out pages and forms get you very, very far.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a web developer, so I know that the number one cause of jank and breakage is another developer having messed with the browser‚Äôs default way of doing things. I can usually figure out what has been tampered with and work around it. But normal people can‚Äôt. They expect the Back button to work, and they expect that the stuff they filled out on the previous page will be there when they click it. And it would! <em>If you would just let the browser do what it wants to do!</em></p>

<p>I could absolutely write cheerier, more charitable and uplifting tech posts. Everything doesn‚Äôt have to be an aggressive ‚Äúdo better‚Äù response to something or someone. But I assure you those posts come from a place of genuine concern: much of the modern web makes me sad and I feel like I‚Äôm screaming into the wind. Every broken contact form or booking site is a <em>truly spectacular</em> own-goal. If your calendar was a bunch of progressively enhanced checkboxes and a submit button, you could be riding off into the sunset and counting money instead of taking support calls from frustrated octogenarians. And it‚Äôs hard for me to shut up about that.</p>

<p>I care. I really do. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm mad sometimes.</p>

<p dir="auto">LaVague is designed to automate menial tasks on behalf of its users. Many of these tasks are repetitive, time-consuming, and require little to no cognitive effort. By automating these tasks, LaVague aims to free up time for more meaningful endeavors, allowing users to focus on what truly matters to them.</p>
<p dir="auto">By providing an engine turning natural language queries into Selenium code, LaVague is designed to make it easy for users or other AIs to automate easily express web workflows and execute them on a browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the key usages we see is to automate tasks that are personal to users and require them to be logged in, for instance automating the process of paying bills, filling out forms or pulling data from specific websites.</p>
<p dir="auto">LaVague is built on open-source projects and leverages open-sources models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for Finland, which packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to 100 MWh of thermal energy for use during those cold polar winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger than a <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/sand-battery-polar-night/" data-cms-ai="0">pilot plant</a> that‚Äôs been running since 2022.</p><p>The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a clever concept. Basically, it‚Äôs a big steel silo of sand (or a similar solid material) that‚Äôs warmed up through a heat exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity from the grid ‚Äì say, that generated during a spike from renewable sources, when it‚Äôs cheap.</p><p>That energy can then be stored for months at a time, with reportedly very little loss, before being extracted as heat on demand. This could theoretically be converted back into electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night says that the most efficient method is to just use the heat itself.</p><p>In a chilly place like Finland, that means feeding it into the local district heating system, which shares heat produced from industry or energy production through the community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or steam to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In this case, the new sand battery would be trialed in the district heating system of the Finnish municipality of Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan L√§mp√∂.</p><div data-align-center="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>If you enjoy this article, I have published a book explaining the
  internals of Git through implementation: <a href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/">Building Git</a>.</p>

<p>‚Äî</p>

<p>As a programmer, you probably use a version control system such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, and
spend an awful lot of your time looking at diffs. You use them to check over
your uncommitted work in progress, to look at what changed in a single commit,
to compare two branches before performing a merge, and so on. Diffs are the
language through which you understand how things have changed in your software.</p>

<p>But as well as being read by people, diffs are used by your version control
system to automate changes. You can email a diff to someone and they can use the
<code>patch</code> or <code>git apply</code> commands to merge it into their working copy. <code>git merge</code>
has to reconcile and merge two or more change histories to produce a single
tree, often reconciling changes within the same file. <code>git add --patch</code> lets you
select individual changes from a working copy file rather than adding the whole
file to the index, and that involves both you the user reading the diffs, and
git selectively applying them to the indexed version of a file. And some version
control systems use the differences between versions as their primary way to
store the project history, rather than storing a snapshot of all the code for
each commit.</p>

<p>So diffs are central to version control, but you might not have thought much
about how they‚Äôre generated. Often when you read a diff, it seems obvious to you
which things should be marked as changes. You have an intuitive mental model of
what it means to insert a new function into a file, or to delete a redundant
one, or to rewrite a section. However, there‚Äôs an awful lot more to diffing than
meets the eye, and there are many ways to do it that produce different results.</p>

<p>Think for a moment about how you‚Äôd calculate a diff, and how you‚Äôd write a
function to do it. You might have noticed that diff programs only show you what
has changed, not what has stayed the same. How would you determine which parts
of a file have not changed? Once you‚Äôve found a difference between them, how
would you find the next line in each version where the text matches up again?
It‚Äôs more complicated than it looks!</p>

<p>In this series of articles, I‚Äôd like to walk you through the default diff
algorithm used by Git. It was developed by Eugene W. Myers, and the <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf">original
paper</a> is available online. While the paper is quite short, it is quite
mathematically dense and is focussed on proving that it works. The explanations
here will be less rigorous, but will hopefully be more intuitive, giving a
detailed walk-through of what the algorithm actually does and how it works.</p>

<p>In this first article, we‚Äôll lay out the basic model of what the algorithm is
trying to achieve and go through an example of how it works out the simplest set
of edits to get from one version to another.</p>

<p>To use the example from the paper, say we want to calculate the difference
between two strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>a</i> = <code>ABCABBA</code></li>
  <li><i>b</i> = <code>CBABAC</code></li>
</ul>

<p>By ‚Äúdifference‚Äù, we mean a sequence of edits that will convert string <i>a</i>
into string <i>b</i>. One possible such sequence is to simply delete each
character in <i>a</i>, and then insert each character in <i>b</i>, or to use
common diff notation:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>- A
- B
- C
- A
- B
- B
- A
</span><span>+ C
+ B
+ A
+ B
+ A
+ C
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>However, we wouldn‚Äôt consider this a good-quality diff since it doesn‚Äôt tell us
very much. Changes to source code typically leave much of a file unmodified and
we really want to see <em>sections</em> of code that were inserted or deleted. A diff
that shows the entire file being removed and replaced with the new version isn‚Äôt
much use to us.</p>

<p>A better diff of these two strings would be:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>- A
- B
</span>  C
<span>+ B
</span>  A
  B
<span>- B
</span>  A
<span>+ C
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This makes the smallest possible number of changes to <i>a</i> in order to
produce <i>b</i>, so it‚Äôs a better visualisation of what really changed. It‚Äôs
not the only possible solution, for example these are also valid:</p>

<div><pre><code>1.  - A       2.  - A       3.  + C
    - B           + C           - A
      C             B             B
    - A           - C           - C
      B             A             A
    + A             B             B
      B           - B           - B
      A             A             A
    + C           + C           + C
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, they are all <em>minimal</em>: they make the smallest number of edits
possible, which in this case is five. What‚Äôs interesting about them is they
differ in which sections they consider to be the same between the strings, and
which order they perform edits in. From looking at diffs, you probably have an
intuitive idea that diffs only show the things that changed, but these examples
show that there are many possible interpretations of the difference between two
files.</p>

<p>So, the purpose of diff algorithms is to provide a strategy for generating
diffs, where the diffs have certain desirable properties. We usually want diffs
to be as small as possible, but there are other considerations. For example,
when you change something, you‚Äôre probably used to seeing deletions followed by
insertions, not the other way round. That is, you‚Äôd rather see solution 2 than
solution 3 above. And, when you change a whole block of code, you‚Äôd like to see
the whole chunk being deleted followed by the new code being inserted, rather
than many deletions and insertions interleaved with each other.</p>

<div><pre><code>Good:   - one         Bad:    - one
        - two                 + four
        - three               - two
        + four                + five
        + five                + six
        + six                 - three
</code></pre></div>

<p>You also probably want to see deleted or inserted code that aligns with your idea
of the code‚Äôs structure, for example if you insert a method, you‚Äôd like that
method‚Äôs <code>end</code> to be considered new, rather than the <code>end</code> of the preceding
method:</p>

<div><pre><code>Good:   class Foo                   Bad:    class Foo
          def initialize(name)                def initialize(name)
            @name = name                        @name = name
          end                             +   end
      +                                   +
      +   def inspect                     +   def inspect
      +     @name                         +     @name
      +   end                                 end
        end                                 end
</code></pre></div>

<p>Myers‚Äô algorithm is just one such strategy, but it‚Äôs fast and it produces diffs
that tend to be of good quality most of the time. It does this by being
<em>greedy</em>, that is trying to consume as many lines that are the same before
making a change (therefore avoiding the ‚Äúwrong <code>end</code>‚Äù problem), and also by
preferring deletions over insertions when given a choice, so that deletions
appear first.</p>

<p>The Myers paper is based on the idea that finding the <em>shortest edit script</em>
(SES) can be modelled as a graph search. Let‚Äôs take our two strings, <i>a</i> =
<code>ABCABBA</code> and <i>b</i> = <code>CBABAC</code>, and build a graph of all the ways we can get
from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) co-ordinates in the grid shown below correspond to
steps in the editing process; at (0,0) we have string <i>a</i>, that is, we have
not started editing. Moving rightward (increasing <i>x</i>) corresponds to
deleting a character from <i>a</i>, for example moving to (1,0) means we‚Äôve
deleted the first <code>A</code> from <i>a</i>. Moving downward (increasing <i>y</i>)
corresponds to inserting a character from <i>b</i>, for example if we now move
from (1,0) down to (1,1), we insert the first <code>C</code> from <i>b</i>, and our edited
string is thus <code>CBCABBA</code>. At position (4,3), we have converted <code>ABCA</code> into
<code>CBA</code>, but we still need to convert <code>BBA</code> into <code>BAC</code>.  The bottom-right position
(7,6) corresponds to converting string <i>a</i> fully into string <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>As well as moving rightward and downward, in some positions we can also move
diagonally. This occurs when the two strings have the same character at the
position‚Äôs indexes, for example the third character in <i>a</i> and the first
character in <i>b</i> are both <code>C</code>, and so position (2,0) has a diagonal leading
to (3,1). This corresponds to consuming an equal character from both strings,
neither deleting nor inserting anything.</p>

<div><pre><code>       A     B     C     A     B     B     A

<p>The idea behind the Myers algorithm is quite simple: we want to get from (0,0)
to (7,6) (the bottom-right) in as few moves as possible. A ‚Äúmove‚Äù is a single
step rightward (a deletion from <i>a</i>) or downward (an insertion from
<i>b</i>). The most number of moves we could take to get from <i>a</i> to
<i>b</i> is 13: the combined length of the two strings.</p>

<p>However, walking diagonal paths is free since they don‚Äôt correspond to making
<em>changes</em>, thus we want to maximise the number of diagonal steps we take and
minimise the number of rightward/downward moves. The examples above show that we
can actually get from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> making only five edits, and Myers
provides a strategy for finding that pathway.</p>

<p>To develop an intuition for how the algorithm works, let‚Äôs start exploring the
graph. To try to find the shortest path to the bottom-right position, we‚Äôll
explore every possible path from (0,0) in tandem until we find a path that
reaches the end. I recommend keeping the above grid handy while you follow this.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start by recording our initial position at (0,0).</p>



<p>We have two options from this position: we can move downward and reach (0,1) or
move rightward and reach (1,0).</p>



<p>Now let‚Äôs consider (0,1). If we move downward from here we reach (0,2), but
there is a diagonal from there to (1,3), and from (1,3) to (2,4), and since
diagonal moves are free we can say that moving downward from (0,1) gets
us to (2,4) at the cost of only one move. Therefore we‚Äôll mark the move from
(0,1) to (2,4) as a single step in our walk.</p>

<p>Moving rightward from (0,1) takes us to (1,1) and again there is a diagonal from
there to (2,2). Let‚Äôs mark both these moves on our walk.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0
 |
 |
0,1 --- 2,2
 |
 |
2,4
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let‚Äôs consider the other branch we took from (0,0), moving rightward to
(1,0). Moving downward from (1,0) takes us to (1,1), which as we just found out
gets us to (2,2). Moving rightward from (1,0) takes us to (2,0), which has a
diagonal to (3,1). Again, we‚Äôll record both these steps.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm recording (2,2) as being visited via (1,0) rather than (0,1) for reasons
that will become clear a little later. For intuition, consider that making a
rightward move first means performing a deletion first, and we generally want
deletions to appear before insertions.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2
 |
 |
2,4
</code></pre></div>

<p>We‚Äôve now fully explored the graph to two moves deep and we can begin on our
third move. Moving downward from (2,4) gets us to (2,5), and from there is a
diagonal to (3,6). Moving rightward from (2,4) takes us to (3,4), where again a
diagonal takes us to (4,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5
 |
 |
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we consider (2,2). Moving rightward from there is as we‚Äôve seen before: we
move to (3,2), and follow the diagonals from there to (5,4).  Moving downward
introduces a new situation, however: this move gets us to (2,3) and there is no
diagonal from there. Now, if we were doing a general-purpose graph search, we‚Äôd
want to record both the result of moving rightward from (2,4) and the result of
moving downward from (2,2), that is:</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2 --- 5,4
 |        \
 |         \
2,4 -       2,3
 |   \
 |    4,5
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, the structure of the particular graphs we‚Äôre examining means that it‚Äôs
sufficient to just store the <em>best</em> position you can reach after a certain set
of edits. The above record shows us that making two insertions then a deletion
(down twice, and then right) gets us to (4,5), whereas making the deletion
first, and then the two insertions, gets us to (2,3). So, we‚Äôll just keep the
(4,5) result and throw the (2,3) away, indicating (4,5) is the best position
reachable after one deletion and two insertions <em>in any order</em>.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1
 |       |
 |       |
0,1     2,2 --- 5,4
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5
 |
 |
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally in our depth-2 scan, we visit (3,1). Moving downward from there goes to
(3,2), which leads diagonally to (5,4), and so we‚Äôll again record this as a move
downward from (3,1) rather than rightward from (2,2). Moving rightward from
(3,1) gives (4,1), which has a diagonal to (5,2).</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the completed record after three moves:</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5
 |
 |
3,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>You‚Äôre probably getting the hang of this by now so let‚Äôs rattle through the
remaining moves. We can‚Äôt move downward from (3,6), and moving rightward from
there gives (4,6), which is also reachable downward from (4,5), so we‚Äôll mark it
as such. Rightward of (4,5) is (5,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4
 |
 |
2,4 --- 4,5 --- 5,5
 |       |
 |       |
3,6     4,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>(5,5) is also downward of (5,4) so we‚Äôll mark that, and moving rightward from
(5,4) gives (6,4), with a diagonal leading to (7,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |
 |               |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5
 |       |
 |       |
3,6     4,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Downward from (5,2) also leads to (7,5), and moving rightward from (5,2) leads
to (7,3), thus completing the fourth row of the scan.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2 --- 7,3
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |
 |               |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5
 |       |
 |       |
3,6     4,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we begin the fifth row. Since we know there are diffs from <i>a</i> to
<i>b</i> requiring only five edits, we expect this row of the scan to find the
bottom-right position, (7,6).</p>

<p>There is nothing downward from (4,6), and rightward of that is (5,6), which is
also downward from (5,5). Rightward of (5,5) is (6,5).</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2 --- 7,3
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |
 |               |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5 --- 6,5
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
3,6     4,6     5,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, moving downward from (7,5) gives (7,6) ‚Äì the final position! This is
certainly better than (6,5), which we reached by going right, right, down, down,
right, and so we replace it in our trace of the moves.</p>

<div><pre><code>0,0 --- 1,0 --- 3,1 --- 5,2 --- 7,3
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
0,1     2,2     5,4 --- 7,5
 |               |       |
 |               |       |
2,4 --- 4,5     5,5     7,6
 |       |       |
 |       |       |
3,6     4,6     5,6
</code></pre></div>

<p>So that‚Äôs the basic idea the algorithm is based on: given two strings, find the
shortest path through a graph that represents the edit space between the two. We
explore every possible route through the graph breadth-first, and stop as soon
as we reach the final position.</p>

<p>In the next article, we‚Äôll look at how Myers actually represents this process,
and start to look at implementing it in code.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a new collaboration, IBM and NASA created a suite of efficient language models by training on scientific literature. Based on the transformer architecture, these models can be used in a variety of applications, from classification and entity extraction to question-answering and information retrieval. These models achieve high performance across a variety of domains and can respond promptly. We have open-sourced the models on Hugging Face for the benefit of the scientific and academic community.</p><p>Transformer-based language models ‚Äî which include <a href="https://aclanthology.org/N19-1423/">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, and IBM‚Äôs Slate and Granite family of models, are invaluable for a range of natural language understanding tasks. What powers these models is a statistical understanding of how language works. They are trained on masked language modeling tasks, which learns by reconstructing sentences with words that have been obscured. Tokenizers, which break down words into units for the model, play a critical role in learning a vast vocabulary. While general-purpose text training is effective with popular tokenizers trained on datasets like Wikipedia or BooksCorpus, scientific domains require specialized tokenizers for terms like "phosphatidylcholine."</p><p>We trained our models on 60 billion tokens on a corpus of astrophysics, planetary science, earth science, heliophysics, and biological and physical sciences data. Unlike a generic tokenizer, the one we developed is capable of recognizing scientific terms such as "axes" and "polycrystalline." More than half of the 50,000 tokens our models processed were unique compared to the open-source RoBERTa model on Hugging Face.</p><p>The IBM-NASA models, trained on domain-specific vocabulary, outperformed the open RoBERTa model by 5% on the popular <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/BLURB/">BLURB</a> benchmark, which evaluates performance on biomedical tasks. It also showed a 2.4% F1 score improvement on an internal scientific question-answering benchmark and a 5.5% improvement on internal Earth science entity recognition tests.</p><p>Our trained encoder model can be fine-tuned for many non-generative linguistic tasks and can generate information-rich embeddings for document retrieval through <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401">retrieval augmented generation</a> (RAG). RAG commonly follows a two-step framework: a retriever model first encodes the question and retrieves relevant documents from a vector database. These documents are then passed to a generative model to answer the question while ensuring fidelity to the retrieved document.</p><p>We built a retriever model on top of our encoder model to produce information-rich embeddings that map the similarity between pairs of text. Specifically, we optimize on a contrastive loss function, pushing the embeddings of an anchor text closer to those of a relevant (‚Äúpositive‚Äù) document, and farther away from a random (‚Äúnegative‚Äù) document.</p><p>These models used about 268 million text pairs, including titles and abstracts, and questions and answers.  As a result, they excel at retrieving relevant passages in a test set of about 400 questions that NASA curated. This is evidenced by a 6.5% improvement over a similarly fine-tuned RoBERTa model, and a 5% improvement over <a href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5">BGE-base</a>, another popular open-source model for embeddings.</p><p>The significant enhancements achieved by our models can be attributed to the specialized training data, custom tokenizer, and training methodology. Consistent with IBM and NASA‚Äôs commitment to open and transparent AI, both models are available on Hugging Face: the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nasa-impact/nasa-smd-ibm-v0.1">encoder model</a> can be further finetuned for applications in the space domain, while the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nasa-impact/nasa-smd-ibm-st">retriever model</a> can be used for information retrieval applications for RAG. We are also collaborating with NASA to enhance science search engine using these models.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Copyright‚Äôs reach is already far too broad, and courts have no business expanding it any further, particularly where that reframing will undermine adversarial interoperability. Unfortunately, a federal district court did just that in the latest iteration of <em>Oracle v. Rimini</em>, concluding that software Rimini developed was a ‚Äúderivative work‚Äù because it was intended to interoperate with Oracle's software, even though the update didn‚Äôt use any of Oracle‚Äôs copyrightable code.</p><p>That‚Äôs a dangerous precedent. If a work is derivative, it may infringe the copyright in the preexisting work from which it, well, derives. For decades, software developers have relied, correctly, on the settled view that a work is not derivative under copyright law unless it is ‚Äúsubstantially similar‚Äù to a preexisting work in both ideas and expression. Thanks to that rule, software developers can build innovative new tools that interact with preexisting works, including tools that improve privacy and security, without fear that the companies that hold rights in those preexisting works would have an automatic copyright claim to those innovations.</p><p>That‚Äôs why EFF, along with a diverse group of stakeholders representing consumers, small businesses, software developers, security researchers, and the independent repair community, filed an <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/eff-rimini-amicus-brief">amicus brief</a> in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explaining that the district court ruling is not just bad policy, it‚Äôs also bad law.&nbsp; Court after court has confronted the challenging problem of applying copyright to functional software, and until now none have found that the copyright monopoly extends to interoperable software absent substantial similarity. In other words, there is no ‚Äúsoftware exception‚Äù to the definition of derivative works, and the Ninth Circuit should reject any effort to create one.</p><p>The district court‚Äôs holding relied heavily on an erroneous interpretation of a 1998 case, <em>Micro Star v. FormGen</em>. In that case, the plaintiff, FormGen, published a video game following the adventures of action hero Duke Nukem. The game included a software tool that allowed players themselves to build new levels to the game and share them with others. Micro Star downloaded hundreds of those user-created files and sold them as a collection. When FormGen sued for copyright infringement, Micro Star argued that because the user files didn‚Äôt contain art or code from the FormGen game, they were not derivative works.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Micro Star, explaining that:</p></div><div><p><em> [t]he work that Micro Star&nbsp;infringes is the [Duke Nukem] story itself‚Äîa beefy commando type named Duke who wanders around post-Apocalypse Los Angeles, shooting Pig Cops with a gun, lobbing hand grenades, searching for medkits and steroids, using a jetpack to leap over obstacles, blowing up gas tanks, avoiding radioactive slime. A copyright owner holds the right to create sequels and the stories told in the [user files] are surely sequels, telling new (though somewhat repetitive) tales of Duke‚Äôs fabulous adventures.</em></p></div><div><p>Thus, the user files were ‚Äúsubstantially similar‚Äù because they<em> functioned as sequels</em> to the video game itself‚Äîspecifically the story and principal character of the game. If the user files had told a different story, with different characters, they would not be derivative works. For example, a company offering a Lord of the Rings game might include tools allowing a user to create their own character from scratch. If the user used the tool to create a hobbit, that character might be considered a derivative work. A unique character that was simply a 21<sup>st</sup> century human in jeans and a t-shirt, not so much.</p><p>Still, even confined to its facts,<em> Micro Star</em>&nbsp;stretched the definition of derivative work. By misapplying <em>Micro Star</em> to purely functional works that do not incorporate <em>any</em> protectable expression, however, the district court rewrote the definition altogether. If the court‚Äôs analysis were correct, rightsholders would suddenly have a new default veto right in all kinds of works that are intended to ‚Äúinteract and be useable with‚Äù their software. Unfortunately, they are all too likely to use that right to threaten add-on innovation, security, and repair. </p><p>Defenders of the district court‚Äôs approach might argue that interoperable software will often be protected by fair use. As copyrightable software is found in everything from phones to refrigerators, fair use is an essential safeguard for the development of interoperable tools, where those tools might indeed qualify as derivative works. But many developers cannot afford to litigate the question, and they should not have to just because one federal court misread a decades-old case.</p></div></div>]]></description>

In response, Jim Habig, LinkedIn‚Äôs vice president of marketing, says: ‚ÄúThis ad didn't meet our goal to create experiences where all professionals feel welcomed and valued, and we are working to replace the spot.‚Äù</p><p>Ageism is ‚Äúan open secret in the tech industry,‚Äù says Maureen Clough, host of <a data-offer-url="https://www.itgetslateearly.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.itgetslateearly.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.itgetslateearly.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>It Gets Late Early</em></a>, a podcast about aging in tech. Even when ageism isn‚Äôt as blatant as the IBM case, she says, it lurks behind common ideas in industry hiring, such as culture fit. ‚ÄúIf you have a company that is predominantly young, white, and male, it‚Äôs going to be harder to get in there,‚Äù Clough says.</p><p>Vern Six, a 58-year-old programmer, says he recently ran into explicit ageism on his job hunt. A recruiter told him that he wouldn‚Äôt be appealing to employers and opined that Six should be chief technology officer at this point in his career, not a software developer, Six says.</p><p>After Six‚Äôs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7167946832742928385/">LinkedIn post</a> about that encounter went viral, he created a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14418151/">LinkedIn group</a> for people to discuss ageism in tech. He says he has often thought his age might play a role in job hunting, but ‚Äúthis was the first time I‚Äôve ever had anybody say it directly.‚Äù</p><p>Industry and government data shows that US tech workers skew younger than the wider US workforce, but definitive data on differences in hiring patterns for older and younger tech workers has been hard to gather. That‚Äôs because so many more senior tech workers get jobs by networking or moving between companies where they know people rather than by cold applying, and that‚Äôs tricky to study and quantify, says Joanna Lahey, a professor of public policy at Texas A&amp;M University who studies age discrimination.</p><p>Older workers may be out of work for longer between jobs because they‚Äôre more likely to seek higher salaries or be selective, says Lahey. But if older workers are excluded from some positions because recruiters assume they wouldn‚Äôt take a lower offer or position or are perceived as not fitting into the company culture, that‚Äôs a problem, she says. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people who have a lot of skills who are unemployed longer than they ought to be. It‚Äôs a loss for them, and it‚Äôs a loss for society.‚Äù</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"></figure><h2>D√©j√† Vu</h2><p>Tech companies have laid off more than 400,000 workers over the past two years, according to <a data-offer-url="https://layoffs.fyi/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://layoffs.fyi/&quot;}" href="https://layoffs.fyi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Layoffs.fyi</a>, which tracks job cuts in the industry.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I made a game. It‚Äôs called BreakTime. It‚Äôs Breakout (aka Brick Breaker) running inside Google Calendar. Your meetings are bricks. It (optionally) declines the meetings you destroy.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a chrome extension. You can install it <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/breaktime/efajcgehdfpliglonbkjmifmibpphafk?hl=en&amp;authuser=0">here</a>. It has no external dependencies; it‚Äôs 1,500 lines of javascript including a little game engine I made for the project.</p>

<p>Making it was a ton of fun. Let me tell you about it.
<!-- excerpt-end --></p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>BreakTime started as an iOS shortcut.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm <em>fascinated</em> with iOS shortcuts. I‚Äôm determined to build something using them. I like <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-11-flappy-bird-finder/">putting games in weird places</a> and using shortcuts to build a game deep inside the iOS walled garden is a goal of mine<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I realized that the calendar shortcut API was pretty powerful - I could build animations by moving events around. I whipped up the bones of what I thought could be a pong demo and <a href="https://twitter.com/itseieio/status/1757415329783795786">tweeted about it</a>.</p>



<p>I floated Breakout as another potential game and my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ianthehenry/status/1757464426616435093">Ian Henry</a> suggested actually declining calendar events.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/iantweet.png" alt=""></p><p> ian i am so grateful for this tweet </p>
    
</div>

<p>And so BreakTime was born.</p>

<h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>

<p>Whipping up a janky prototype of BreakTime was pretty straightforward. The browser needs to know the coordinates of the elements on screen - it has to draw them all! - and you can ask it for those coordinates with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect"><code>getBoundingClientRect</code></a>. This might not work well for elements that aren‚Äôt rectangles but in BreakTime almost everything is a rectangle!</p>

<p>So the prototype was basically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Figure out a dom selector that gives me all the calendar events</li>
  <li>Figure out a dom selector that gives me a play area</li>
  <li>Add a div to represent the ball</li>
  <li>Write some javascript to make the ball bounce around, checking for collisions with the rectangles.</li>
  <li>Inject in some CSS to make the ball div round, fade out events that the ball hit, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looked something like this:</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/breaktime-prototype-1-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/breaktime-prototype-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> why did i make the ball so big </p>
    
</div>

<p>I cut some pretty big corners to get this all working.</p>

<p>To make collision handling trivial I treated the ball as a square instead of as a circle; you can see that this causes some weird looking bounces.</p>

<p>To animate the ball‚Äôs position I set up a <code>setInterval</code> loop that moved the ball every 50 milliseconds, moved it‚Äôs position via the css <code>transform</code> property, and set the ball‚Äôs <code>transition</code> property to <code>linear 50ms</code> - so long as the <code>setInterval</code> loop runs <em>exactly</em> every 50ms this produces relatively smooth movement (which is to say the movement is not very smooth).</p>

<p>And at the time I figured this wouldn‚Äôt get approved as a chrome extension so I planned to make a bookmarklet. This is where the goal of ‚Äúno external dependencies‚Äù came from. To run the prototype I‚Äôd just copy-paste the javascript directly into the browser console.</p>

<p>The whole thing came out to something like 300 lines including the CSS that I was injecting directly from javascript.</p>

<p>Those hacks made the game pretty gross. I waited far too long to unwind them which created some headaches later.</p>

<p>That said, this janky prototype was enough to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itseieio/video/7335551871991418155">do pretty well on tiktok</a> and catch the Google social team‚Äôs attention, which was pretty exciting.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/tiktok-screencap.png" alt=""></p><p> never thought this would be a development highlight </p>
    
</div>

<h2 id="collision-handling">Collision handling</h2>

<p>The response from tiktok convinced me that this was worth pursuing, and I figured the first thing I needed to do was move to a proper system for collision handling.</p>

<p>It turns out that determining whether a circle collides with an (unrotated) rectangle is delightfully elegant! The process is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find the point P on the rectangle that is closest to the circle</li>
  <li>Measure the distance from P to the circle‚Äôs center</li>
  <li>If that distance is smaller than the circle‚Äôs radius you have a collision</li>
</ul>

<p>And finding P is even more elegant. To find the X coordinate of P:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the circle‚Äôs center is to the left of the rectangle, it‚Äôs the left edge of the rectangle</li>
  <li>If the circle‚Äôs center is to the right of the rectangle, it‚Äôs the right edge of the rectangle</li>
  <li>Otherwise, it‚Äôs the X coordinate of the circle‚Äôs center</li>
</ul>

<p>You can repeat the same process for the Y coordinate. Easy!</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/chatgpt.png" alt=""></p><p> chatgpt did a good job here </p>
    
</div>

<p>However, there‚Äôs also the problem of figuring out which <em>side</em> of the rectangle the circle bounced off of. And in my journey to solve this problem from first principles (why!) I went a little off the rails.</p>

<p>The approach I took is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take the circle‚Äôs current position</li>
  <li>Rewind time to the moment of collision</li>
  <li>Compare the center of the circle to the sides of the rectangle - if the circle is (for example) now above the rectangle, bounce off the top</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a ton of edge cases here. And when you get them wrong you get some <em>weird</em> results<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/funnybounce-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/funnybounce.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> that bounce didn't look right... </p>
    
</div>

<p>The big problems I ran into are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ball should only bounce off the left side of a rectangle when moving to the right (and vice-versa)</li>
  <li>The ball should only collide off a side if, after rewinding time, it‚Äôs center is <em>outside</em> of the rectangle</li>
</ol>

<p>These problems were particularly pernicious when handling corner bounces (where we invert both the X and Y direction of the ball). I eventually realized that you should only bounce off a corner when the ball intersects two sides of a rectangle in the same tick.</p>

<p>I feel kinda silly typing this out because it feels obvious now but man, this stuff is <em>finicky</em>. It probably didn‚Äôt help that I wrote most of this code over one late night (I was excited about the game and thought I could finish it in another day or two. I could not).</p>

<p>I‚Äôve since learned that the typical approach here is about looking at the <em>angle</em> of collision instead. But it was a lot of fun to flail through my approach - and I learned a whole lot doing it.</p>

<h2 id="from-jank-to-juice">From jank to juice</h2>

<p>Proper collision detection made the game feel a lot better but it didn‚Äôt <em>look</em> great. I saw two big problems.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The assets (the ball, paddle, and background) looked simplistic and bad</li>
  <li>There was no ‚Äújuice‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p>Game devs use ‚Äújuice‚Äù to refer to all the stuff that makes a game feel <em>alive</em> - objects scaling up and down when they collide, particle effects, screenshake, color, good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening">tweening</a> - stuff that doesn‚Äôt change gameplay but instead enhances how the existing gameplay feels.</p>

<p>One of the best talks on juice is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">‚ÄúJuice it or lose it‚Äù</a>. The talk takes a barebones game and progressively adds more juice (but no gameplay changes) to show how much it changes the feel of the game. Conveniently the example game is a Breakout clone! I cribbed a lot of ideas directly from it.</p>

<p>To motivate myself to get some effects added quickly I signed up to give a 5 minute presentation at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center‚Äôs</a> weekly presentations. I‚Äôm a Recurse alum and always find presenting there motivating.</p>

<p>I brought something like this:</p>
<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/somewhat-juiced-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/somewhat-juiced.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> the color of the ball here really irks me </p>
    
</div>

<p>That looks a lot better! But there‚Äôs still a lot to do. The full set of juice I added includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scaling the ball up and down when it bounces</li>
  <li>Shrinking the paddle when the ball hits it</li>
  <li>Changing the ball‚Äôs color over time (more quickly when it bounces)</li>
  <li>Shaking the screen when an event is destroyed</li>
  <li>Particle effects that match an event‚Äôs color when it shatters</li>
  <li>No background (the background here is ugly)</li>
  <li>Sliding in the gameplay elements at the start</li>
  <li>Blurring the bottom of the screen since there‚Äôs no collision allowed there<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Adding a trail to the ball that traces its path</li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôd take wayyy too much time to talk about how I approached each of these problems. Let‚Äôs talk about two.</p>

<h4 id="particle-effects">Particle effects</h4>

<p>Creating particles for event shattering was delightfully straightforward. I borrowed heavily from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/adding-particle-effects-to-dom-elements-with-canvas/">this CSS tricks post</a>.</p>

<p>The basic idea is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get the bounds of the event to shatter</li>
  <li>Get the background color of the computed style of the event</li>
  <li>Divide the bounds of the event into 30 equal-ish rectangles</li>
  <li>Create colored divs for each of those rectangles using the event‚Äôs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle">computed style</a></li>
  <li>Animate their position, rotation, color, and opacity with some jitter</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs approximately what that looks like.</p>

<p>I did something similar to create particles when the ball bounces against the paddle. And I ended up making a pool of 300 ready-to-use particles that I reused to avoid creating and removing tons of divs (this was probably unnecessary).</p>

<h4 id="screen-shake">Screen Shake</h4>

<p>Screen shake is controversial<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> - too much of it can be nauseating and disorienting. But I‚Äôve found that sprinkling a bit in can really make you feel the impact of a collision. And it turns out that it‚Äôs super easy to add!</p>

<p>My entire implementation is:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>makeScreenShake</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>250</span><span>;</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>And I think it makes a huge difference. Here I‚Äôve changed the game to only start the screenshake after a few collisions:</p>
<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/noscreenshake-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/noscreenshake.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> screenshake starts on the 6th collision </p>
    
</div>

<p>One improvement I could have made here is to have each frame of screenshake depend on the prior frame using a noise generation algorithm (instead of just generating random values). <a href="https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/2d/screen_shake/index.html">This article</a> describes an approach I‚Äôve taken in previous games.</p>

<h4 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h4>
<p>There‚Äôs so much more stuff that I implemented here! I added <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L1184">custom tweening logic</a> for ball/paddle scaling because using CSS tweening would interfere with moving the objects around smoothly. The <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L1010">ball trail</a> adds elements that track the position of the ball over time while slowly fading out. The <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L973">color changing</a> relies on the lovely CSS <code>hue-rotation</code> property.</p>

<p>But this post is super long and there‚Äôs still more to cover. Let‚Äôs keep going!</p>

<h2 id="smoother-animations">Smoother animations</h2>

<p>Remember, my original approach to moving the ball was ‚Äúevery 50ms, move it a fixed amount and rely on the CSS <code>transition</code> property to ensure that that movement is linear.‚Äù</p>

<p>This works ok, but produces unnatural movement if that loop doesn‚Äôt run <em>exactly</em> every 50ms.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/notsmooth-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/notsmooth.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> ignore that bounce off the floor there... </p>
    
</div>

<p>Most of the time this would result in movement that felt just a little bit off, but occasionally you‚Äôd get <em>huge</em> leaps.</p>

<p>To fix this I moved my game loop to rely on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame"><code>requestAnimationFrame</code></a>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you give <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> a function that you want to run immediately before the browser repaints the screen. That callback gets a timestamp representing the amount of time that‚Äôs passed since the previous frame. So if it‚Äôs only been 25ms since the last frame, you only move the ball half as long as if it‚Äôs been 50ms. You end up with a variable frame rate but much smoother animations - especially since the browser will try to sync things up with your monitor‚Äôs refresh rate<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Moving things based on <code>deltaTime</code> is standard practice in games. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGhfUcPjXuE">This video</a> provides a nice overview.</p>

<h2 id="declining-events">Declining events</h2>
<p>I wanted BreakTime to actually be able to decline your events. I think a lot of the joy of a project like this is fully committing to the bit, and the bit here definitely includes ‚Äúnot going to the meetings I destroy.‚Äù</p>

<p>This was a challenge because I didn‚Äôt want any dependencies so I couldn‚Äôt use the calendar API. Instead I needed to script the process of declining the events.</p>

<p>The approach I took relied on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver"><code>MutationObservers</code></a> - an object that watches for changes in the DOM. My observer watches for anything that looks like a calendar dialog, searches that dialog for a ‚Äúdecline‚Äù button, and clicks it.</p>

<p>This was tricky and a little fragile. A few things to highlight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs important to decline events one at a time<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. To handle this I <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L152">use a second observer to wait for all dialogs tied to the current event to clear</a></li>
  <li>Some events don‚Äôt have a decline option (e.g. if they have no guests); the code must handle that gracefully</li>
  <li>Some events are recurring, which means they spawn a second modal on decline (the modal asks whether you want to decline one or all of the events)</li>
</ul>

<p>But the most fragile bit of logic is that I search for buttons based on their text. This means that event declining only works if Google Calendar is in English. The only other approach I could think of was to hardcode the location in the DOM of the buttons which seemed even worse. But I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something smarter I could do here.</p>

<p>The final result is a flurry of events popping up and disappearing, which I think is pretty fun.</p>



<h2 id="moving-to-a-chrome-extension">Moving to a chrome extension</h2>

<p>For some reason I thought there was no chance that I could get this into the Chrome Webstore<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. But my friend <a href="https://www.carolynzhang.com/">Kelin</a> convinced me that I totally could, and I was encouraged by Google‚Äôs social accounts <a href="https://twitter.com/googlecalendar/status/1764769037156843555">tweeting about my stuff</a>.</p>

<p>I was also pretty sick of copy-pasting what had become almost 2,000 lines of javascript and CSS into the browser console every time I wanted to run the game.</p>

<p>It turns out that making an extension is pretty easy! The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world">intro docs</a> are pretty good and I didn‚Äôt need to do anything fancy. Moving to an extension also made me teach me code to run multiple times without refreshing a tab, which I doubt I would have done with a bookmarklet.</p>

<p>Getting the extension approved took under a day - it probably helps that the extension only runs when invoked so its permissions are pretty simple.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>This was one of my favorite projects. I‚Äôm particularly happy that, while it involves embedding a game somewhere it doesn‚Äôt belong, the game makes sense for the medium. I‚Äôm very proud of <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-11-flappy-bird-finder/">Flappy Dird</a> and <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/implementing-wordle-in-the-firefox-address-bar/">Wordle in the Firefox address bar</a> but both of those games are totally unrelated to their constraints - they‚Äôre just the best ideas I had for how to build a game given the constraints I had chosen. This feels different.</p>

<p>Building a little engine for this project was <em>great</em>. It definitely took more time but I learned a ton - there‚Äôs simply no way I‚Äôd understand collisions in the same way if I hadn‚Äôt written the logic myself. And I‚Äôm much handier with the DOM after adding my own particles and scripting event declines.</p>

<p>I also have a ton of people to thank for this project. Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/ianthehenry/status/1757464426616435093">Ian Henry</a> for the initial inspiration, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChanaMessinger/status/1757941634975859132">Chana Messinger</a> for naming the game, <a href="https://kelin.online/">Kelin</a> for convincing me to make a chrome extension, <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> for the encouragement, and <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/">Josh W Comeau</a> for teaching me all of the CSS and Javascript that I know (I knew basically nothing at the start of this year!).</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this post I‚Äôd encourage you to apply to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse</a>, which is the best place in the world to build stuff like this in a supportive environment. And if you want to hear about my future nonsense you should sign up for my <a href="https://eieio.substack.com/">mailing list</a> or follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/itseieio">on twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to be at <a href="https://gdconf.com/">GDC</a> next week to present on <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-12-stranger-video/">stranger video</a> at the Experimental Games Workshop and to meet people - if you‚Äôre going to be there I‚Äôd love to meet up :)</p>

<p>I‚Äôll be back in April with something new and horrifying.</p>

                <p>The ‚ÄúProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act‚Äù would give the President the power to designate an application under the control of a country considered adversarial to the U.S. to be a national security threat. TikTok would be deemed a threat, meaning that the application would effectively be banned unless it cuts all ties with the foreign adversarial country within 180 days through a forced sale. The same could be true for other applications, like WeChat.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a massive problem that current US law allows for all the big social media platforms to harvest and monetize our personal data, including TikTok. Without comprehensive data privacy legislation, this will continue, and this ban won‚Äôt solve any real or perceived problems. User data will still be collected by numerous platforms and sold to data brokers who sell it to the highest bidder‚Äîincluding governments of countries such as China‚Äîjust as it is now.</p>

<p>TikTok raises special concerns, given the surveillance and censorship practices of the country that its parent company is based in, China. But it‚Äôs also used by hundreds of millions of people to express themselves online, and is an instrumental tool for community building and holding those in power accountable. The US government has not justified silencing the speech of Americans who use TikTok, nor has it justified the indirect speech punishment of a forced sale (which may prove difficult if not impossible to accomplish in the required timeframe). It can‚Äôt meet the high constitutional bar for a restriction on the platform, which would undermine the free speech and association rights of millions of people. This bill must be stopped.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>This was a fun nostalgia trip. But it ended up being an attempt to collect and preserve some retro computing history as well‚Ä¶ and I also learned‚Äì or forgot and remembered?‚Äì another interesting quirk of that programming environment from nearly 45 years ago.</p>



<p>In 1981, I had a friend down the street who had an Apple II+. Later that year, my parents hired a tutor for programming lessons. I feel like I owe much of the subsequent course of my life to that time with ‚ÄúMrs. Cathy,‚Äù who had several computers in her home: I remember an Apple II+, a VIC-20, and an IBM PC.</p>



<p>But it wasn‚Äôt until 1983 that we got our own home computer, an Apple //e. One of the programs that came with the computer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand">Lemonade Stand</a>, is shown in the screenshot below.</p>

<p>The game is pretty simple: each morning, based on the weather forecast for the day, you decide how many glasses of lemonade and how many advertising signs to make, and how much to charge for each glass. These decisions and the day‚Äôs weather affect demand, you sell some number of glasses, rinse and repeat.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs about as fun as it sounds‚Ä¶ but I remember being intrigued by the prospect of ‚Äúreverse engineering‚Äù the game. The Applesoft BASIC source code contains the formula for computing the demand and the resulting profit as a function of the player‚Äôs inputs and the weather. We can, in principle, ‚Äúsolve‚Äù for the inputs that would maximize the expected profit. This post is motivated by my failed attempt to do this.</p>



<p><strong>History</strong></p>



<p>All of the code discussed here, both old and new, is available on <a href="https://github.com/possibly-wrong/lemonade">GitHub</a>. Let‚Äôs start with the old code: <code>lemonade.bas</code> is the Applesoft BASIC source by Charlie Kellner, from the .dsk image of my original 5.25‚Ä≥ diskette. I believe this is the earliest Apple version of the game‚Äì for completeness I‚Äôve also included source extracts of two subsequent released versions (<code>lemonade_v4.bas</code> and <code>lemonade_v5.bas</code>), but for our purpose here their behavior is identical, with cosmetic updates to the graphics and sound by Drew Lynch, Bruce Tognazzini, and Jim Gerber.</p>



<p>For comparison, I‚Äôve also extracted the source for <code>selll.bas</code> (as in ‚Äúsell lemonade‚Äù), from the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC, of <em>Oregon Trail</em> fame) Elementary Volume 3 disk <a href="https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/images/educational/mecc/MECC-A704%20Elementary%20Vol.%203.dsk">A704</a>. Although appearing later in 1980, I think this version is somewhat closer to the actual original version of the game written by Bob Jamison in 1973 for the UNIVAC mainframe. That original 1973 source seems to be lost to the mists of antiquity‚Ä¶ but I think <code>selll.bas</code> retains more of its parentage than the Kellner version, which removed some helpful comments explaining the terms in the demand function, mistranslated some variable names and <code>GOTO</code> line numbering resulting in unreachable code, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Maximizing profit</strong></p>



<p>Now for the new code: <code>lemonade_strategy.py</code> implements the profit-maximization described above. It‚Äôs pure brute force: given the objective function below,</p>


<div><pre title="">def expected_profit(glasses, signs, price, cost, r1=1, p_storm=0):
    n1 = 54 - 2.4 * price if price &lt; 10 else 3000 / (price * price)
    demand = min(int(r1 * n1 * (2 - math.exp(-0.5 * signs))), glasses)
    revenue = demand * price
    expense = glasses * cost + signs * 15
    return ((1 - p_storm) * revenue - expense, revenue - expense,
            glasses, signs, price)
</pre></div>


<p>where <code>r1</code> and <code>p_storm</code> are functions of the weather forecast, we simply evaluate the expected profit for all feasible inputs and find the maximum, with the wrinkle that the feasible region‚Äì how many glasses and signs we can possibly make‚Äì also depends on our current assets:</p>


<div><pre title="">max(expected_profit(glasses, signs, price, cost, r1, p_storm)
    for glasses in range(min(1000, assets // cost) + 1)
    for signs in range(min(50, (assets - cost * glasses) // 15) + 1)
    for price in range(101))
</pre></div>


<p>I ended up in this rabbit hole in the usual way, after discussion with a student. My objective wasn‚Äôt really to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù this decades-old game, but just to give an explicit example of how much slower computers were then: this same brute-force approach in Applesoft BASIC, with the Apple //e‚Äôs 1 MHz processor, took nearly 4 hours to compute optimal strategy just for the first sunny day in Lemonsville. That‚Äôs over 200,000 times slower than the above Python code, which runs in a fraction of a second on my decade-old 2.6 GHz laptop‚Äì that is, with a clock speed ‚Äúonly‚Äù 2,600 times faster.</p>



<p><strong>Changing the weather</strong></p>



<p>You can play an Apple version of the game in a browser at the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Lemonade_Stand_1979_Apple">Internet Archive</a>, linked from the game‚Äôs Wikipedia page. I did just that, with my Python script running alongside to compute optimal strategy‚Ä¶ and it didn‚Äôt work.</p>



<p>The first day‚Äôs weather was ‚Äúhot and dry.‚Äù With $2.00 and each glass of lemonade costing 2 cents, the optimal strategy should have been to make 74 glasses, 3 advertising signs, and charge 12 cents per glass, for an expected profit of $6.95. But when I entered these values in the game, I only sold 37 glasses, for a lousy $2.51 profit.</p>



<p>What was going on? It turns out that there are many different copies of <em>Lemonade Stand</em> out there, both at the Internet Archive as well as in various Apple II <a href="https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/">disk image archives</a>‚Ä¶ but the particular one linked from Wikipedia is unique among all of these in that it contains an important modification to the source code appearing in none of the other copies, highlighted below:</p>



<pre>400  REM   WEATHER REPORT<br>410 SC =  RND (1)<br>420  IF SC &lt; <strong><mark>.4</mark></strong> THEN SC = 2: GOTO 460<br>430  IF SC &lt; <strong><mark>.7</mark></strong> THEN SC = 10: GOTO 460<br>440 SC = 7<br>460  <strong><mark>REM</mark></strong>  IF D&lt;3 THEN SC=2</pre>



<p>(You can play the original unmodified version at the Internet Archive <a href="https://archive.org/details/LEMONADE_STAND">here</a>.)</p>



<p>I don‚Äôt know where these changes came from. And I believe these are indeed <em>changes </em>from the original release (i.e., not the other way around). But just these three edits were enough to keep my optimal strategy calculation from producing the correct result. This was strange at first glance, since the above section of code merely computes the randomly generated weather <em>forecast</em> for the day, which is an <em>input </em>to the subsequent profit calculation. In the above modified version, the weather forecast is sunny (<code>SC=2</code>) 40% of the time, cloudy (<code>SC=10</code>) 30% of the time, and hot and dry (<code>SC=7</code>) 30% of the time. The original threshold values are 0.6 and 0.8, corresponding to probabilities (0.6, 0.2, 0.2) of (sunny, cloudy, hot and dry).</p>



<p>The <code>REM</code> in line 460 is a ‚Äúremark‚Äù comment, effectively disabling the original behavior of forcing sunny forecasts for the first two days (when <code>D=1</code> and <code>D=2</code>) of the game. But again, why should this matter? This is all input to the profit calculation, which remains identical to the original, so what is causing the difference in behavior?</p>



<p><strong>Undeclared variables</strong></p>



<p>To make it easier to poke (!) around this problem, I wrote <code>lemonade.py</code>, which is my attempt at a <a href="https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2013/02/03/hunt-the-wumpus/">shot-for-shot remake</a> of the original <code>lemonade.bas</code> in Python, minus the graphics and sound‚Äì that is, just a canonical mode text interface, but an otherwise line-for-line direct translation with identical behavior.</p>



<p>That translation process was an interesting exercise, almost a logic puzzle, converting the unstructured <code>GOTO</code>-based flow control of Applesoft BASIC into structured Python‚Äì I was surprised at the end of it all to find that only a single <code>def</code>ined function and extra temporary Boolean variable were needed, despite all of the <code>GOSUB</code>s.</p>



<p>That translation helped me to understand the cause of the different behavior I was seeing in the original. The problem is in the following section of code, with the offending lines highlighted:</p>



<pre>700  REM   AFTER 2 DAYS THINGS CAN HAPPEN<br><strong><mark>710  IF D &gt; 2 THEN 2000</mark></strong><br>...<br>2000  REM   RANDOM EVENTS<br>2010  IF SC = 10 THEN 2110<br>2030  IF SC = 7 THEN 2410<br>...<br>2410 X4 = 1<br>2430  PRINT "A HEAT WAVE IS PREDICTED FOR TODAY!"<br><strong><mark>2440 R1 = 2</mark></strong><br>2450  GOTO 805</pre>



<p>The variable <code>R1</code> is an input to the profit function. But although the code change in line 460 above allows the first day‚Äôs <em>displayed forecast </em>to be hot and dry‚Äì or anything else other than sunny‚Äì line 710 still prevents actually <em>setting </em><code>R1</code> to reflect that non-sunny forecast when computing profit.</p>



<p>The effect is that, for the first two days, the weather forecast might <em>indicate </em>‚Äúhot and dry,‚Äù or ‚Äúcloudy,‚Äù etc., but it‚Äôs <em>really </em>still sunny for those first two days, just like the original version.</p>



<p>All of which leads to the actual motivation for this post: when I initially tried to reproduce the effect of the three changed lines in the Python version, I got a ‚Äú<code>NameError: name 'D' is not defined</code>‚Äú, due to commenting out line 460 in the BASIC version above: the variable <code>D</code> is never declared or assigned a value <em>prior </em>to line 460.</p>



<p>Python can‚Äôt handle this‚Ä¶ but apparently Applesoft BASIC can. Variables do not need to be declared before use: when evaluating an expression containing a variable not previously assigned, the value of that variable defaults to zero (or the empty string for string variables).</p>



<p>This behavior is actually depended on in a few other places in the game as well. I admit that I <em>think </em>this is new to me‚Äì in all of those early days of learning programming, I don‚Äôt remember ever being aware of nor taking advantage of this ‚Äúfeature.‚Äù And it‚Äôs not a feature of the original Dartmouth BASIC. And I couldn‚Äôt find documentation of it anywhere in the books, manuals, and magazines that I have‚Ä¶ but I did find it written down in the original ‚Äú<a href="https://archive.org/details/Applesoft_Reference_Manual_1978-_bluebook/page/n11/mode/2up">Blue Book</a>‚Äù Applesoft Reference Manual. From page 9: ‚Äú<em>Another important fact is that if a variable is encountered in a formula before it is assigned a value, it is automatically assigned the value zero. Zero is then substituted as the value of the variable in the particular formula.</em>‚Äú</p>

<p dir="auto">We all build software on top of a dynamic set of tools,
frameworks and packages, allowing us to move quickly and only
build what‚Äôs necessary. However, each new wave of dev tooling
innovation results in an entirely new set of dependencies that
need to be managed. What starts as a simple app or microservice
quickly grows complex, and
turns into a expanding and fragmented supply
chain. Flox brings reproducibility and consistency to complex
software development lifecycles.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-434257">


<h3>from the <i>I-can't-drive-55</i> dept</h3>

<p>Last September, Mozilla came out with a <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/">privacy study</a> indicating that the auto industry was <strong>the worst tech industry the organization tracked</strong>. Mozilla found that not only does the industry hoover up a ton of data from your use of vehicles, it collects and monetizes most of the data on your phone. Often without transparency or adequate safeguards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚Äú<strong>All 25 car brands we researched earned our *Privacy Not Included warning label ‚Äî making cars the official worst category of products for privacy that we have ever reviewed.</strong>‚Äú</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to this week, and the New York Times‚Äô Kashmir Hill has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html?unlocked_article_code=1.cE0.jN6D.nfeyIYUoly5W&amp;smid=url-share">a new story</a> exploring how the auto industry is also collecting reams of personal driving data, then sharing it with your insurance company. More specifically, automakers are selling access to the data to Lexis Nexis, which is then crafting ‚Äúrisk scores‚Äù insurance companies then use to adjust rates. Usually upward. </p>
<p>If consumer approval is even obtained, it‚Äôs obtained via fine print buried deep in user agreements either in automakers‚Äô car apps or road-side assistant apps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúAutomakers and data brokers that have partnered to collect detailed driving data from millions of Americans say they have drivers‚Äô permission to do so. But the existence of these partnerships is nearly invisible to drivers, whose consent is obtained in fine print and murky privacy policies that few read.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even law professors, who are surely used to reckless treatment of consumer data at this point, were somehow surprised at the cavalier behavior by the auto industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúI am surprised,‚Äù said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Cornell University. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not within the reasonable expectation of the average consumer, it should certainly be an industry practice to prominently disclose that is happening.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same auto industry that has been fighting tooth and nail against ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù reforms ‚Äî in a bid to protect their lucrative repair monopolies ‚Äî often under the pretense that they‚Äôre just <strong>that</strong> concerned <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/09/11/auto-industry-pushes-bullshit-claim-that-right-to-repair-laws-aid-sexual-predators/">about the consumer privacy ramifications</a>. </p>
<p>Please notice that the <strong>absolute bare minimum</strong> that the auto industry could be doing here is making this tracking and monetization of your data transparent, and <em>they‚Äôre not even doing that</em>. Because they know Congress and U.S. federal regulators, lobbied into apathy over decades, are too corrupt to take meaningful action. At least not at any real, consistent scale. </p>
<p>Again, like countless past scandals, this is the direct byproduct of a country that has proven too corrupt to pass even a baseline privacy law for the internet era. Too corrupt to regulate data brokers. And obsessed with steadily defanging, defunding, under-staffing and curtailing the authority of regulators tasked with overseeing corporations with a broad and reckless disdain for U.S. consumer privacy and safety. </p>
<p>Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-urges-ftc-to-investigate-invasive-data-privacy-practices-of-automakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a>&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. And California regulators are purportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/california-agency-probes-automakers-data-privacy-practices-2023-07-31/#:~:text=The%20California%20Privacy%20Protection%20Agency,which%20companies%20it%20is%20reviewing.">investigating automaker privacy standards</a>. But a grotesquely corrupt Congress means federal inquiries will likely go nowhere (also keep in mind looming Supreme Court rulings are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/supreme-court-chevron-defense-case-00121535">poised to erode federal regulatory authority further</a>). And any inquiries that do materialize will feature fines that are miniscule compared to the money made from the abuses. </p>
<p>The data-hoovering surveillance economy we‚Äôve created is so lucrative, all the financial incentives point in the wrong directions. And the only thing likely to shake U.S. politicians out of their corrupt stupor is a scandal so extreme ‚Äî potentially involving mass fatalities or the leaked data of the rich and powerful ‚Äî that the problem is no longer easy to ignore. And even then, we‚Äôll <strong>still</strong> probably try. </p>

For example where description is very long or nested by many elements. In such cases for now we recommend manually
editing the selectors in cache. These shouldn't be an often case though.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>A short policy memo </span><a href="https://fas.org/publication/update-building-codes-to-use-mass-timber/" rel="">recently posted</a><span> on the Federation of American Scientists‚Äô (FAS) website argues that ‚Äúmass timber can help solve the housing shortage.‚Äù It was posted as part of the </span><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/your-best-ideas-on-increasing-housing" rel="">Housing Ideas Challenge</a><span>, a collaboration between FAS, Matt Yglesias and a few other organizations to generate new, innovative ideas for building more housing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The memo calls for the federal government to incentivize states to adopt the most recent version of the International Building Code. The latest version of the Code includes new provisions for building tall timber buildings. According to the memo, because mass timber allows buildings to be built faster and cheaper, changing state building codes to allow tall mass timber buildings will unlock more housing construction:</p><blockquote><p><em>Compared to concrete and steel, mass timber buildings are faster to build (therefore often cheaper), just as safe in fires, and create fewer CO2 emissions. Single- and multi-family housing using mass timber components could help with the 7.3 million gap of affordable homes.</em></p><p><em>Broader adoption could meaningfully increase productivity and thereby reduce construction costs. A 25-story mass timber building in Milwaukee completed in 2022 took 75% less time compared to traditional construction techniques. Developers have reported cost savings of up to 35% through lower time and labor costs.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>I don‚Äôt have particular objections to accelerating mass timber adoption. Mass timber is an interesting technology, and it has some decided advantages over constructing buildings out of steel or concrete. And in general, I‚Äôm in favor of expanding the palette of technologies available for constructing buildings. </span><strong>That said, there is not much reason to think that accelerating mass timber adoption will meaningfully increase the volume of homebuilding in the US.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mass timber is exactly what it sounds like: construction that uses large, heavy timber elements as the structural frame of the building. In contrast, light-framed timber construction uses small, thin timber elements ‚Äì 2x4s, 2x6s, thin sheets of plywood or OSB ‚Äì as the structural frame.</p><p><span>There‚Äôs a variety of different products that can be used for mass timber construction: Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), Nail Laminated Timber, glue-laminated timber (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glued_laminated_timber" rel="">glulam</a><span>), mass-plywood panels (MPP), and so on. Mass timber products are typically made by taking smaller timber elements (2x4s or 2x6s, sheets of plywood, etc.) and attaching them together to form much larger elements. Glulams, for instance, are made by taking smaller pieces of dimensional lumber (long pieces of lumber such as 2x4s or 2x6s) and gluing them together to form large beams or columns. CLT is likewise made by gluing together layers of dimensional lumber to form large, solid panels that can be used for walls or floors.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png" width="550" height="411.35225375626044" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:896,&quot;width&quot;:1198,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:550,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Mass timber building consisting of glulam beams and columns, and CLT floor panels, via Matt Kantner</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It‚Äôs the large size of the structural elements that makes mass timber an interesting building system. With light-framed wood construction, the risk of fire limits how tall you can safely build; typically 5 stories in the US (hence the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1" rel="">‚Äú5 over 1‚Äù</a><span> construction type so popular in multifamily construction). And some argue that even these limits are too high, based on the fact that the US has a </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/wood-construction-and-the-risk-of" rel="">much higher rate of fire death</a><span> compared to countries that use less light-frame wood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But large mass timber elements behave differently than smaller light-framed ones during a fire. Specifically, with mass timber a layer of charred wood forms around the outside that protects the wood on the inside from further combustion. Size your structural elements correctly, and a mass timber building will survive a fire much longer than a light-framed wood building. This gives more time for people to evacuate to safety, which makes it possible to safely build much taller buildings out of wood. While light-framed wood is typically limited to 5 stories in the US, mass timber buildings have been </span><a href="https://www.thorntontomasetti.com/project/ascent" rel="">built up to 19 stories</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-1-142559053" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p>Besides its better fire performance, there are other reasons to like mass timber. It sequesters a huge amount of carbon because of the volume of wood it uses, so it's far less carbon-intensive than concrete or steel. It‚Äôs often possible to leave mass timber elements exposed in the finished building, which creates an attractive finish for walls or ceilings that some tenants are willing to pay extra for. Because it‚Äôs prefabricated, the structure of a mass timber building is built very fast, and the construction is much quieter than other building methods.</p><p><span>But mass timber has some challenges, particularly cost. Contra the policy memo, mass timber will in general be more expensive than other types of construction, at least in the US.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-2-142559053" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span><a href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/due-diligence/2023/03/01/mass-timber-primed-for-wider-use/" rel="">The article</a><span> the memo cites as evidence that mass timber can reduce construction cost in fact mentions twice that mass timber is generally more expensive than steel or concrete. The evidence of savings presented in the article is a single developer who claimed they saved 35% on a project by using mass timber. Even if this is true (and I‚Äôm skeptical), it‚Äôs not much evidence. Construction costs vary enough between projects that for any two building materials, it's probably possible to find an example of someone who saved money by switching from one to the other. But the overall trend is clear: a </span><a href="https://timberfinance.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-International-Mass-Timber-Report_Faster-Download-1.pdf" rel="">survey of commercial builders</a><span> in the US found that the median mass timber project had a cost premium of 2%, and in some cases as high as 15%.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-3-142559053" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>Mass timber is still somewhat nascent in the US, so it‚Äôs reasonable to believe that costs will come down as more projects are built, designers and developers gain experience, and the supply chain becomes more robust. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it eventually becomes competitive with structural steel or concrete in the US. But the challenge for mass timber as an enabler of housing construction isn‚Äôt with steel or concrete, but with light-framed wood.</p><p><span>In 2022, </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/current.html" rel="">there were</a><span> just over 1 million single family homes built in the US, and 368,000 multifamily units. Of these, the overwhelming majority were built using light-framed wood construction: 94% of the single family homes, and 73% of the multifamily units.</span></p><p><span>This is a problem for the idea of mass timber as a housing enabler, because mass timber has some inherent cost disadvantages compared to light-framed wood construction. First, for a given structure, mass timber will require more material to build it than light-framed wood will. Consider, for instance, the framing for a building‚Äôs floor. Per </span><a href="https://www.smartlam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SmartLam-2020-Cross-Laminated-Timber-Specification-Guide_June_compressed.pdf" rel="">Smartlam‚Äôs span tables</a><span> for their CLT panels, a 5-ply panel supporting residential loading can span 21 feet under typical residential loading. If we were framing the same floor using light-framed wood, one option would be to use wood trusses: for a 21 foot span, under residential loading, we can use 16 inch deep </span><a href="https://alpineitw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/floor-truss-guide-compressed2.pdf" rel="">wood trusses</a><span> spaced at 24 inches on center, with a 3/4 inch thick sheet of plywood on top.</span></p><p>Both CLT and wood trusses are made from dimensional lumber stitched together. But the mass timber framing uses four to five times the volume of wood as the light-framed wood framing.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png" width="967" height="453" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:453,&quot;width&quot;:967,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:18813,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1d297164-5e61-413e-977c-ebd0da32420d_967x453.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Mass timber vs light-framed wood volume of material for a 2-ft wide section of floor framing. The input wood for the CLT is slightly higher than the in-use wood because the CLT is made from dimensional lumber planed down to smaller dimensions.</figcaption></figure></div><p>These calculations get more complex for other parts of the structure. But the basic relationship holds: mass timber uses much more wood than light-framed timber to support the same load.</p><p><span>The second cost disadvantage of mass timber compared to light-framed wood construction is that it adds extra processing steps. To produce construction lumber, trees are cut down and brought to a sawmill, where they‚Äôre cut into dimensional lumber (2x4s, 2x6s, etc) or processed into other timber products such as plywood or OSB. Much light-framed wood construction, such as walls and roof rafters, uses dimensional lumber that comes directly from the sawmill. In other cases, such as with floor trusses, the lumber must go through another processing step between the mill and the construction site, but the equipment for this processing is relatively simple and inexpensive. </span><a href="https://www.woodtechsystems.com/product/2003-alpine-floormaster-floor-truss-machine/" rel="">Here</a><span>, for instance, is a used floor truss machine going for less than the price of a fully loaded F-150.</span></p><p><span>With mass timber, on the other hand, </span><em>all</em><span> of the lumber must go through a second processing step to turn it into mass timber products, and this processing step is more expensive than the comparatively simpler truss fabrication. Fabricating CLT panels, for instance, requires an </span><a href="https://kallesoemachinery.com/system-solutions/clt-system-solutions/" rel="">involved production line</a><span> that includes conveyor belts, jointing machines, gluing machines, presses, planing machinery, and (probably) CNC cutting, the combined cost of which can easily be </span><a href="http://www.wooddesignandbuilding.com/the-evolution-of-clt-manufacturing-in-north-america/" rel="">in the millions</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-4-142559053" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p><span>Because it uses more material and requires more, costlier processing steps, mass timber has some inherent cost disadvantages compared to light-framed wood construction. And because the vast majority of housing in the US is currently built from light-framed wood, there‚Äôs little reason to think that even a highly-developed mass timber supply chain would meaningfully unlock large amounts of housing construction by way of reduced costs.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-5-142559053" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><p><span>Mass timber is of course superior to light-framed wood construction for taller buildings, since its fire resistance means it's safe to use where light-framed wood isn‚Äôt. But most construction (residential or otherwise) isn‚Äôt tall enough for this to matter ‚Äî over 90% of housing in the US is in buildings 3 stories tall or less, and </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/every-building-in-america-an-analysis" rel="">just 2.5% of housing units</a><span> in the US are in buildings seven or more stories tall.</span></p><p><span>Canada‚Äôs experience with mass timber can give us a glimpse of what full-throated support of mass timber might mean for US housing construction. Like the US, Canada has enormous supplies of wood, and builds much of its housing using light-framed wood construction. Canada, especially the province of British Columbia (BC) has led the charge for the use of mass timber in North America. The Canadian forest product non-profit FPInnovations published a widely-used </span><a href="https://web.fpinnovations.ca/download/clt-handbook-2019-full-edition/" rel="">CLT design handbook</a><span> in 2011, and in 2018 Canada built what at the time was the world‚Äôs tallest mass-timber building, the </span><a href="https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house" rel="">18-story Brock Commons</a><span>. Canada‚Äôs national and provincial building codes have steadily increased the height allowance for timber buildings (though they often fall short of what the current version of the IBC allows), and many provinces have passed legislation requiring wood be the first material considered for publicly funded projects. Many prominent mass timber manufacturers and designers, such as </span><a href="https://seagatemasstimber.com/" rel="">Seagate</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nordic.ca/en" rel="">Nordic</a><span>, </span><a href="https://eqcanada.com/" rel="">Equilibrium</a><span>, </span><a href="https://mg-architecture.ca/" rel="">Michael Green Architecture</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://structurecraft.com/" rel="">Structurecraft</a><span> are located in Canada. As of 2022, the province of BC alone </span><a href="https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house" rel="">had constructed</a><span> nearly as many mass timber buildings as the entire US.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-6-142559053" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p><span>But government enthusiasm and a robust ecosystem hasn‚Äôt translated into large volumes of residential mass timber construction. Per the 2021 </span><a href="https://d1ied5g1xfgpx8.cloudfront.net/pdfs/40364.pdf" rel="">State of Mass Timber in Canada report</a><span>, between 2007 and 2021 Canada constructed nearly 500 mass timber projects, but just 39 of these were residential projects. This is a tiny fraction of the thousands of apartment buildings built in Canada using other construction methods over the same time period.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-7-142559053" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p>Like in the US, mass timber is still somewhat nascent in Canada, and I expect the number of mass timber buildings to continue to trend upward over time and costs to continue to fall. Nevertheless, the small residential penetration of mass timber in Canada should give pause to anyone who expects it to drive increased volumes of housing construction in the US.</p><p>It's also worth noting that not adopting the latest building code doesn't necessarily prevent mass timber buildings from being built now, though it certainly makes it easier. Older codes have provisions that allow for shorter mass timber buildings (called Type IV construction), and they can also be built using the code provisions that current light-framed wood structures use (Type III or Type V construction). The updated codes are specifically required only for tall mass timber buildings, or where the mass timber will be left exposed in the final condition.&nbsp;</p><p>But even here, it‚Äôs often possible to get taller mass timber buildings constructed without updating the code. Because the most recent version of the IBC has allowances for tall mass timber buildings, building officials are often willing to accept them even if their state code doesn‚Äôt technically allow them. Several tall mass timber buildings in the US, such as Ascent in Milwaukee, have been built without the state adopting the 2021 IBC‚Äôs mass timber provisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, just because a state has adopted the 2021 IBC doesn‚Äôt mean that there won‚Äôt be permitting roadblocks for tall mass timber buildings. Building officials are cautious by nature, and they‚Äôre often reluctant to allow taller wood buildings without very careful consideration, despite what the code says. And what they say goes. Adopting the most recent IBC would reduce the permitting barriers to mass timber adoption, and I‚Äôm in favor of it, but it‚Äôs not like flipping a switch where suddenly mass timber buildings are now possible.</p><p><span>I like mass timber; I </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/another-day-in-katerradise" rel="">spent several years</a><span> at a startup that was trying to make mass produced mass-timber construction happen. It's good for a lot of things, particularly for low-carbon construction, and I'm happy that it's slowly becoming more popular in the US. I think it can ultimately become a popular, competitive construction technology. But it won't jumpstart US homebuilding.</span></p><p><em><span>Thanks to Matt Kantner of </span><a href="https://eqcanada.com/" rel="">Equilibrium Consulting</a><span> for reading a draft of this.

<p>The Internal Revenue Service's free tax filing service, Direct File, is now available in 12 states for taxpayers with simple tax returns. The service, available in English and Spanish, underwent "weeks of successful testing" before the launch, the US Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2172">said today</a>.</p>
<p>"Direct File provides a free, secure option for taxpayers with simple tax situations in 12 states to file their taxes directly with the IRS," the Treasury Department said. "Direct File is easy to use, with no hidden junk fees, and works as well on a smartphone as it does on a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Direct File shows taxpayers the math so they can be sure that their return is accurate, and they are getting the refund they are entitled to."</p>
<p>You can check whether you qualify to use the system at <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">directfile.irs.gov</a>. Based on the eligibility restrictions in the IRS program, the Treasury Department said it "estimates that one-third of all federal income tax returns filed could be prepared using Direct File."</p>
<p>In the 12 eligible states combined, the department estimates that 18.7 million taxpayers are eligible for Direct File. That includes a high of 5.2 million taxpayers in California and a low of 80,000 in Wyoming. "Thousands of taxpayers across all 12 states have already successfully filed returns during the pilot's testing phase," the Treasury Department said.</p>
<p>The government is calling this year's version of Direct File a pilot program. It will presumably expand to more states and perhaps have fewer restrictions on who can file in future years.</p>
<h2>State tax options vary</h2>
<p>Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York worked with the IRS to integrate their state taxes into the Direct File pilot, the IRS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/irs-to-offer-free-tax-filing-in-competition-against-much-criticized-turbotax/">said in October 2023</a>. The pilot is also available in eight states without an income tax: Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The IRS originally said that Alaska, which also has no income tax, was slated to be part of the pilot. But the state was not included in the end. "The Direct File pilot does not support reporting the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend for federal income tax reporting purposes," the IRS was <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/01/12/alaska-excluded-from-free-irs-direct-tax-filing-pilot-program/">quoted as saying</a> in January.</p>
<p>There are different options for state taxes depending on what state you live in. There's a <a href="https://www.fileyourstatetaxes.org/">free state filing tool</a> for Arizona and New York that integrates with IRS Direct File. Users in California and Massachusetts will be <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/state">directed</a> to their respective state's online tax tools for filing state taxes.</p>
<h2>What you can and can‚Äôt file</h2>
<p>Direct File supports employment income, unemployment compensation, Social Security benefits, and $1,500 or less in interest income. But there are many limits that would prevent taxpayers from using the system.</p>
<p>Income types that cannot be reported with Direct File include income from payment apps, online marketplaces, or payment cards; income from independent contractor and gig work; income from rent, prizes, and awards; income from pension and retirement account distributions; allocated tips and unreported tips; and alimony.</p>
<p>Direct File is further <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/income">limited by the amount of income</a>. You can't use Direct File if your wages were over $200,000, or $160,200 if you had more than one employer. Direct File also isn't available to those who use the filing status "Married Filing Separately" and had wages of more than $125,000. For a married couple filing a joint return, there is a combined wage limit of $250,000.</p>
<p>There's another limit related to how you obtain health insurance. Direct File won't work if you bought health insurance from a HealthCare.gov marketplace or if you withdrew money from a health savings account. Other types of health insurance are supported.</p>
<p>Direct File supports the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Credit for Other Dependents but does not support other types of credits. Itemized deductions also are not supported, though the IRS says that about 90 percent of people filing federal taxes use the standard deduction.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from this 1937 video explanation of how wire photos were transmitted to newspapers, but a double stunt sequence featuring an airplane and a death-defying photographer was not anywhere on my bingo card. This starts kinda slow but it picks up once they get into the completely fascinating explanation of how they sent photographs across the country using ordinary telephone lines. The whole setup was portable and they just hacked into a wire on a telephone pole, asked the operator to clear the line, and sent a photo scan via an analog modem. Ingenious!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirephoto">The Wikipedia page about wire photos</a> is worth a read ‚Äî French designers argued that the technology was responsible for an early form of fast fashion.</p>

<blockquote><p>After World War II at haute couture shows in Paris, Frederick L. Milton would sketch runway designs and transmit his sketches via B√©linographe to his subscribers, who could then copy Parisian fashions. In 1955, four major French couturiers (Lanvin, Dior, Patou, and Jacques Fath) sued Milton for piracy, and the case went to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. Wirephoto enabled a speed of transmission that the French designers argued damaged their businesses.</p></blockquote>

    </div><p>Imported giant sequoia trees are well adapted to the UK, growing at rates close to their native ranges and capturing large amounts of carbon during their long lives, finds a new study led by UCL researchers with colleagues at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>


										      
																																	<p>The new research, published in <i>Royal Society Open Science</i>, found that the most massive species of redwood trees, Sequoiadendron giganteum, known as the giant sequoia, can potentially pull an average of 85 kilograms of carbon out of the atmosphere per year. Though introduced to the UK 160 years ago, this is the first time the trees' growth rate and resilience in the UK have been analyzed.</p>
<p>There are an estimated half a million redwoods in the UK and more are being planted, partly due to their public appeal. In the wild, they are endangered with fewer than 80,000 giant sequoias remaining in their native California range.</p>
<p>Lead author Ross Holland, formerly a Master's student at the UCL Department of Geography and now at East Point Geo, said, "Giant sequoias are some of the most massive organisms on Earth and in their native range make up some of the most carbon-dense forests in the world due to their great age. We found that UK redwoods are well adapted to the UK and able to capture a large amount of carbon dioxide. We hope that these findings can help guide decisions on future tree planting and management."</p>

<p>The researchers emphasize that the most effective way to mitigate <a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag">climate change</a> is by reducing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+emissions/" rel="tag">carbon emissions</a> from burning fossil fuels. Trees can help by absorbing carbon emissions, but they also provide other important climate, ecosystem and well-being benefits.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Giant sequoias grow quickly and are also some of the longest-lived organisms in the world, keeping up their rapid growth throughout their 3,000-plus year lives. They can grow up to 90 meters tall, and while not quite the tallest in the world (that title goes to their closely-related cousin the coastal redwood), their wide trunks grow out, giving them the greatest volumes. In addition, they're fire resistant, able to survive blazes that would wipe out forests of other tree species.</p>
<p>The trees grow best in their native range in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, so the researchers wanted to gauge how they fare under UK climates, which are milder and with a wider range of rainfall. They compiled the first dedicated map of giant sequoias in the UK, mapping nearly 5,000 individual known trees.</p>
<p>The team visited three groves of trees, located at Wakehurst, the wild botanic garden of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in Sussex, Havering Country Park in Essex, and Benmore Botanical Garden in Scotland. They set up terrestrial laser scanners to map the trees in 3D, enabling them to measure the heights and volumes very accurately and to create 3D models of 97 representative trees.</p>

<p>Co-author Dr. Phil Wilkes, formerly of UCL and now at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said, "Using the latest laser scanning technology has allowed us to accurately 'weigh' these massive trees without having to cut them down. This means we can measure many more trees as well as revisit them in the future."</p>

																																			<p>The tallest tree they found measured about 180 feet tall (54.87 meters)‚Äîgiant compared with most native UK species, but dwarfed by their American counterparts. This is in part because of the UK sequoias' youth: the oldest giant sequoias in the UK are those at Benmore, the earliest dating to 1863.</p>
<p>Knowing when the trees were planted allowed the team to calculate their average growth rates under the varying climate conditions between the three UK sites. They found that the trees at Kew and Benmore grew at similar rates as their US counterparts, although growing slightly taller and slimmer at Benmore compared to Wakehurst, while at Havering the trees grew more slowly, likely due to less rainfall in the region and competition from dense local woodland.</p>
<p>Though giant sequoia stack up well for sequestering carbon, the researchers caution that planting trees requires long-term commitment, and consideration needs to be given to how well they will thrive in the UK's changing climate in the next 160 years and beyond.</p>

<p>Senior author, Professor Mat Disney (UCL Geography), said, "These results give us an important baseline for estimating how well giant sequoias are doing in the UK climate. Currently, these trees are probably more important for their aesthetic and historical interest than they are for solving the climate crisis. But as more are planted we need to know how they will grow.</p>
<p>"The history of these trees in Britain is fascinating‚Äîinitially as symbols of wealth and power, through to now being widely planted in parks and woodlands. They are iconic, but there is almost no work on how fast they grow or how well they will do in the UK's changing climate. I find it amazing to see these giants dotted across the landscape and see how rapidly they are growing."</p>
