<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div font-family="TiemposText" font-weight="400"><div><p>“He was very kind to write this very nice review of it,” Sadri reflected, “and that exploded interest, and caused our servers all to melt down.”</p></div><div><p>As launch day went on, usage didn’t taper off. The demand for Pipes required vastly more resources than it had available, and Yahoo put all hands on deck to support keeping the nascent system running.</p></div><div><p>Ho remembers “just sitting in my chair the entire <!-- -->[<!-- -->launch<!-- -->]<!-- --> day until late in the evening, just bringing up machines.” Yahoo’s data-center team started shifting servers that they had already prepped for deployment for other groups into service for Pipes.</p></div><div><p>“Every time it came up, everybody jumped on it and it crashed again, and everybody cycled back into a waiting state,” said Trevor, the lead engineer. “It felt bad at the time, but in retrospect, it was awesome.”</p></div><div><p>Raffel said Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang told him to use his name to get whatever he needed to keep Pipes running then: “I’d never done that before. I certainly haven’t done that since.”</p></div><div><p>The beta launch’s popularity caught the team so off guard that they hadn’t even prepared a crash page. (Though that soon changed: Trevor said that the first thing they created after the beta launch was a page that read something like “our pipes are clogged.”)</p></div><div><p>In the days and weeks following, the team started to see more of the loose threads they hadn’t been able to stitch up in the sudden sprint to an unexpectedly momentous launch. Among a variety of issues, once someone created a Pipe, it ran forever.</p></div><div><p>There was no end-time built in or a need for someone to login to refresh or request a feed. (Even if there had been, RSS newsreaders polled for updates automatically.) Raffel said the team didn’t consider “just how many zombie things would get generated. <!-- -->[<!-- -->...<!-- -->]<!-- --> We kind of put ourselves in a situation where, fairly quickly, we had a lot of usage from things that may or may not actually <!-- -->[<!-- -->have been<!-- -->]<!-- --> real users.”</p></div><div><p>Still, many others agreed with O’Reilly’s sentiments. The <em>InfoWorld</em> writer turned <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2007/02/12/annotate-the-web-then-rewire-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft evangelist Jon Udell</a> blogged about a week after the beta launch, “The dominant way in which most people will ‘program’ the web is by writing metadata, not code, and we’ll need an interface as friendly and powerful as Pipes to help them do that.”</p></div><div><p>Yahoo threw more servers at Pipes, the programmers optimized the least inefficient code, and within a few months, Pipes’ reliability stabilized. But just as it was rising it was also—already—nearly fixed in amber.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/18hgbyl/i_benchmarked_six_go_sqlite_drivers_and_found_you/" rel="nofollow">reddit</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">I traced it back to a <a href="https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/commit/c667a1f469f28879a044807f8ed83e36645977ba">new feature</a>,

(a 4x larger, PLRU bit cache), released a new version, and ran the numbers again (different machine, configuration).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The results of the new experiment are below</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">This work is sponsored by Monibot - Easy Server and Application Monitoring.
Try out Monibot at <a href="https://monibot.io/?ref=go-sqlite-bench" rel="nofollow">https://monibot.io</a>.
It's free.</p>
<p dir="auto">For benchmarks I used the following libraries:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">craw, <code>crawshaw.io/sqlite</code>, a CGO-based solution. This is not a <code>database/sql</code> driver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">mattn, <code>github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3</code>, a CGO-based solution. This library is
(still) the de-facto standard and widely used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">modernc, <code>modernc.org/sqlite</code>, a pure Go solution. This is a newer library,
based on the SQLite C code re-written in Go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">ncruces, <code>github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3</code>, a pure Go solution based on WASM (?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">sqinn, <code>github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn-go</code>, a solution without CGO. It uses
<code>github.com/cvilsmeier/sqinn</code> to access SQLite database files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">zombie, <code>github.com/zombiezen/go-sqlite</code>, a rewrite of the crawshaw driver, using the
modernc libraries. This is not a <code>database/sql</code> driver.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The test setup is as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>OS: Debian/GNU Linux amd64 version 12.3</li>
<li>CPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz, 4 physical cores, 8 logical cores</li>
<li>RAM: 16GB</li>
<li>Disk: 1TB NVME SSD</li>
<li>go version go1.21.5 linux/amd64</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The benchmark was run on 2023-12-09, with then-current library versions.
See go.mod for library versions. Each test was run once for warmup.
The second run was then recorded.</p>
<p dir="auto">A general note on benchmarks:</p>
<p dir="auto">Do not trust benchmarks, write your own. This specific benchmark is modelled
after my very own database usage scenarios. Your scenarios may be totally
different.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Database Schema</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="hcfe-content" role="main">            <article class="page" sc-render-smart-button="false" itemscope=""> <div data-stats-ve="35"><p>If you work with Usenet groups in Google Groups, support for these groups is ending soon.</p>

<h2>What’s changing?</h2>

<p>Starting on February 22, 2024, you can no longer use Google Groups (at groups.google.com) to post content to Usenet groups, subscribe to Usenet groups, or view new Usenet content. You can continue to view and search for historical Usenet content posted before February 22, 2024 on Google Groups.</p>

<p>In addition, Google’s Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) server and associated peering will no longer be available, meaning Google will not support serving new Usenet content or exchanging content with other NNTP servers.</p>

<p>This change will not impact any non-Usenet content on Google Groups, including all user and organization-created groups. Most of the current Google Groups content&nbsp; is not Usenet content and will not be affected.</p>

<h2>What do I need to do?</h2>

<p>If you don’t actively engage with Usenet content, you don’t need to do anything. Current Usenet users will need to do two things before February 22, 2024 if they want to continue engaging with Usenet content:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Find a new Usenet client. </strong>Several free and paid alternatives are available, both web-based and application-based. To find a client, do a web search for "how do I find a usenet text client"</li>
  <li><strong>Find a new public Usenet server. </strong>The new client you choose will likely have a default server or a set of curated options for you. If not, to find a server, do a web search for "public NNTP servers."</li>
</ol>

<p>Because Usenet is a distributed system, <strong>you do not need to migrate data</strong>. All of the Usenet content you can access today on Google Groups should already be synced to the new server you choose. After you select a new client and server, you can reselect the groups you’re interested in.</p>

<h2>Why is Google Groups support for Usenet ending?</h2>

<p>Over the last several years, legitimate activity in text-based Usenet groups has declined significantly because users have moved to more modern technologies and formats such as social media and web-based forums. Much of the content being disseminated via Usenet today is binary (non-text) file sharing, which Google Groups does not support, as well as spam.</p>

  <p id="ch3SNe">The Stanford Prison Experiment, one of the most famous and compelling psychological studies of all time, told us a tantalizingly simple story about human nature. </p>
<p id="2DE2Gk">The study took paid participants and assigned them to be “inmates” or “guards” in a mock prison at Stanford University. Soon after the experiment began, the “guards” began mistreating the “prisoners,” implying evil is brought out by circumstance. The authors, in their conclusions, suggested innocent people, thrown into a situation where they have power over others, will begin to abuse that power. And people who are put into a situation where they are powerless will be driven to submission, even madness. </p>
<p id="buIC1G">The Stanford Prison Experiment has been <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278144932_Coverage_of_the_Stanford_Prison_Experiment_in_Introductory_Social_Psychology_Textbooks">included</a> in many, many introductory psychology textbooks and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1475725714568007">is often cited uncritically</a>. It’s the subject of movies, documentaries, books, television shows, and <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe/catalog/gf026hb5740">congressional testimony</a>.</p>
<p id="m7VLu5">But its findings were wrong. Very wrong. And not just due to its questionable ethics <a href="https://twitter.com/david_m_amodio/status/1006958007983460361">or lack of concrete data</a> — but because of deceit. </p>
<p id="cmyBh2">A new <a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62">exposé</a> published by Medium based on previously unpublished <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/14/17464516/stanford-prison-experiment-audio">recordings</a> of Philip Zimbardo, the Stanford psychologist who ran the study, and interviews with his participants, <a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62">offers</a> convincing evidence that the guards in the experiment were coached to be cruel. It also shows that the experiment’s most memorable moment — of a prisoner descending into a screaming fit, proclaiming, “I’m burning up inside!” — was the result of the prisoner acting. “I took it as a kind of an improv exercise,” one of the guards told reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/benzblum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ben Blum</a>. “I believed that I was doing what the researchers wanted me to do.” </p>
<p id="sk2QDd">The findings have long been subject to scrutiny — many think of them <a href="https://twitter.com/david_m_amodio/status/1006958007983460361">as more of a dramatic demonstration</a>, a sort-of academic reality show, than a serious bit of science. But these new revelations incited an immediate response. “We must stop celebrating this work,” personality psychologist Simine Vazire <a href="https://twitter.com/siminevazire/status/1006070517772607488">tweeted</a>, in response to the <a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62">article</a>. “It’s anti-scientific. Get it out of textbooks.” Many other psychologists have expressed similar sentiments. </p>
<p id="8V75RZ">(<strong>Update</strong>: Since this article published, the journal <em>American Psychologist</em> has<a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/2019-letexier.pdf"> published a thorough debunking</a> of the Stanford Prison Experiment that goes beyond what Blum found in his piece. There’s even more evidence that the “guards” knew the results that Zimbardo wanted to produce, and were trained to meet his goals. It also provides evidence that the conclusions of the experiment were predetermined.) </p>
<p id="c8SIec">Many of the classic show-stopping experiments in psychology have lately turned out to be wrong, fraudulent, or outdated. And in recent years, social scientists have begun to reckon with the truth that their old work needs a redo, the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis">replication crisis</a>.” But there’s been a lag — in the popular consciousness and in how psychology is taught by teachers and textbooks. It’s time to catch up. </p>

<p id="4jOET1">The Zimbardo prison experiment is not the only classic study that has been recently scrutinized, reevaluated, or outright exposed as a fraud. Recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment">science journalist Gina Perry</a> found that the infamous “Robbers Cave“ experiment in the 1950s — in which young boys at summer camp were essentially manipulated into joining warring factions — was a do-over from a failed previous version of an experiment, which the scientists never mentioned in an academic paper. That’s a glaring omission. It’s wrong to throw out data that refutes your hypothesis and only publicize data that supports it. </p>
<p id="tXLsi4">Perry has also revealed inconsistencies in another major early work in psychology: the Milgram electroshock test, in which participants were told by an authority figure to deliver seemingly lethal doses of electricity to an unseen hapless soul. Her investigations show some <a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/electric-schlock-65377">evidence of</a> researchers going off the study script and possibly coercing participants to deliver the desired results. (Somewhat ironically, the new revelations about the prison experiment also show the power an authority figure — in this case Zimbardo himself and his “warden” — has in manipulating others to be cruel.)</p>
<p id="13AnP0">Other studies have been reevaluated for more honest, methodological snafus. Recently, I wrote about the “marshmallow test,” a series of studies from the early ’90s that suggested the ability to delay gratification at a young age <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/6/17413000/marshmallow-test-replication-mischel-psychology">is correlated with success later in life</a>. New research finds that if the original marshmallow test authors had a larger sample size, and greater research controls, their results would not have been the showstoppers they were in the ’90s. I can list so many more textbook psychology findings that have either not replicated, or are currently in the midst of a serious reevaluation. </p>
<p id="2sg5OI">Like: </p>
<ul>
<li id="OMhdEa">Social priming: People who read “old”-sounding words (like “nursing home”) were more likely to walk slowly — showing how our brains can be subtly “primed” with thoughts and actions.</li>
<li id="yPoABY">The facial feedback hypothesis: Merely activating muscles around the mouth caused people to become happier — demonstrating how our bodies tell our brains what emotions to feel.</li>
<li id="Bqa2bI">Stereotype threat: Minorities and maligned social groups don’t perform as well on tests due to anxieties about becoming a stereotype themselves. </li>
<li id="i75kyS">Ego depletion: The idea that willpower is a finite mental resource.</li>
</ul>
<p id="KsruDx">Alas, the past few years<a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis"> have brought about a reckoning</a> for these ideas and social psychology as a whole. </p>
<p id="L7bU4Q">Many psychological theories have been debunked or diminished in rigorous replication attempts. Psychologists are now realizing it's <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005">more likely</a> that false positives will make it through to publication than inconclusive results. And they’ve realized that experimental methods commonly used just a few years ago aren’t rigorous enough. For instance, it used to be commonplace for scientists to publish experiments that sampled about 50 undergraduate students. Today, scientists realize this <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005">is a recipe for false positives</a>, and strive for sample sizes in the hundreds and ideally from a more representative subject pool.  </p>
<p id="tKajYd">Nevertheless, in so many of these cases, scientists have moved on and corrected errors, and are still doing well-intentioned work to understand the heart of humanity. For instance, work on one of psychology’s oldest fixations — dehumanization, the ability to see another as less than human — continues with methodological rigor, <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/3/7/14456154/dehumanization-psychology-explained">helping us understand</a> the modern-day maltreatment of Muslims and immigrants in America.  </p>
<p id="06Yvsy">In some cases, time has shown that flawed original experiments offer worthwhile reexamination. The original Milgram experiment was flawed. But at least its study design — which brings in participants to administer shocks (not actually carried out) to punish others for failing at a memory test — is basically repeatable today with some ethical tweaks.</p>
<p id="TYA1u7"><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060">And</a> it seems like Milgram’s conclusions may hold up: In a recent study, many people found demands from <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060">an authority figure to be a compelling</a> reason to shock another. However, it’s possible, due to something known as the file-drawer effect, that failed replications of the Milgram experiment have not been published. Replication attempts at the Stanford prison study, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.bbcprisonstudy.org/pdfs/bjsp(2006)tyrannny.pdf">have been a mess</a>.</p>
<p id="dTlTu4">In science, too often, the first demonstration of an idea becomes the lasting one — in both pop culture and academia. But this isn’t how science is supposed to work at all! </p>
<p id="dC0VT9">Science is a frustrating, iterative process. When we communicate it, we need to get beyond the idea that a single, stunning study ought to last the test of time. Scientists know this as well, but their institutions have often discouraged them from replicating old work, instead of the pursuit of new and exciting, attention-grabbing studies. (Journalists are <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process">part of the problem too</a>, imbuing small, insignificant studies with more importance and meaning than they’re due.)  </p>
<p id="PylPjK">Thankfully, there are researchers thinking very hard, and very earnestly, on trying to make psychology a more replicable, robust science. There’s even a whole <a href="https://osf.io/jtcu9/">Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science</a> devoted to these issues.</p>
<p id="8z2Cpw">Follow-up results <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/14/11219446/psychology-replication-crisis">tend to be less dramatic than original findings</a>, but they are more useful in helping discover the truth. And it’s not that the Stanford Prison Experiment has no place in a classroom. It’s interesting as history. Psychologists like Zimbardo and Milgram were highly influenced by World War II. Their experiments were, in part, an attempt to figure out why ordinary people would fall for Nazism. That’s an important question, one that set the agenda for a huge amount of research in psychological science, and is still echoed in papers today. </p>
<h3 id="ZLgDN1">Textbooks need to catch up </h3>
<p id="3yADvM">Psychology has changed tremendously over the past few years. Many studies used to teach the next generation of psychologists have been intensely scrutinized, and found to be in error. But troublingly, <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/theres-a-problem-with-a-bunch-of-psychology-textbooks.html">the textbooks have not been updated accordingly</a>.</p>
<p id="WVNuea">That’s the conclusion of a <a href="http://christopherjferguson.com/Education%20or%20Indoctrination.pdf">2016 study</a> in <em>Current Psychology. “</em>By and large,” the study explains (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p id="PhzjQV">introductory textbooks have difficulty accurately portraying controversial topics with care or, in some cases, simply avoid covering them at all. ... <strong>readers of introductory textbooks may be unintentionally misinformed on these topics.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p id="f0osHA">The study authors — from Texas A&amp;M and Stetson universities — gathered a stack of 24 popular introductory psych textbooks and began looking for coverage of 12 contested ideas or myths in psychology.</p>
<p id="DtAEZl">The ideas — like stereotype threat, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1281386/">Mozart effect</a>, and whether there’s a “narcissism epidemic” among millennials — have not necessarily been disproven. Nevertheless, there are credible and noteworthy studies that cast doubt on them. The list of ideas also included some urban legends — like the one about the brain only using 10 percent of its potential at any given time, and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/her-shocking-murder-became-the-stuff-of-legend-but-everyone-got-the-story-wrong/2016/06/29/544916d8-3952-11e6-9ccd-d6005beac8b3_story.html?utm_term=.e061b368fd71">debunked</a> story about how bystanders refused to help a woman named Kitty Genovese while she was being murdered.</p>
<p id="bXTNSJ">The researchers then rated the texts on how they handled these contested ideas. The results found a troubling amount of “biased” coverage on many of the topic areas.</p>

<p id="IGYwOa">But why wouldn’t these textbooks include more doubt? Replication, after all, is a cornerstone of any science. </p>
<p id="chk6i9">One idea is that textbooks, in the pursuit of covering a wide range of topics, aren’t meant to be authoritative on these individual controversies. But something else might be going on. The study authors suggest these textbook authors are trying to “oversell” psychology as a discipline, to get more undergraduates to study it full time. (I have to admit that it might have worked on me back when I was an undeclared undergraduate.) </p>
<p id="mAobmd">There are some caveats to mention with the study: One is that the 12 topics the authors chose to scrutinize are completely arbitrary. “And many other potential issues were left out of our analysis,” they note. Also, the textbooks included were printed in the spring of 2012; it’s possible they have been updated since then. </p>
<p id="gWz0Tl">Recently, I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/B_resnick/status/1006197663908487168">on Twitter</a> how intro psychology professors deal with inconsistencies in their textbooks. Their answers were simple. Some say they decided to get rid of textbooks (which save students money) and focus on teaching individual articles. Others have another solution that’s just as simple: “You point out the wrong, outdated, and less-than-replicable sections,” <a href="https://twitter.com/lakens">Daniël Lakens</a>, a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, said. He offered a useful example of one of the slides he uses in class.</p>

<p id="TOyfMv">Anecdotally, Illinois State University professor Joe Hilgard said he thinks his students appreciate “the ‘cutting-edge’ feeling from knowing something that the textbook didn’t.” (Also, who really, earnestly reads the textbook in an introductory college course?) </p>

<p id="3QgI6I">And it seems this type of teaching is catching on. A (not perfectly representative) <a href="https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/va7jg/?action=download%26mode=render">recent survey of</a> 262 psychology professors found more than half said replication issues <a href="https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/va7jg/?action=download%26mode=render">impacted their teaching</a>. On the other hand, 40 percent said they hadn’t. So whether students are exposed to the recent reckoning is all up to the teachers they have.  </p>
<p id="lpA4to">If it’s true that textbooks and teachers are still neglecting to cover replication issues, then I’d argue they are actually underselling the science. To teach the “replication crisis” is to teach students that science strives to be self-correcting. It would instill in them the value that science ought to be reproducible.</p>
<p id="xCWDnp">Understanding human behavior is a hard problem. Finding out the answers shouldn’t be easy. If anything, that should give students more motivation to become the generation of scientists who get it right.</p>
<p id="osnF3b">“Textbooks may be missing an opportunity for myth busting,” the <em>Current Psychology</em> study’s authors write. That’s, ideally, what young scientist ought to learn: how to bust myths and find the truth. </p>

And we rely on help from our readers: Advertising and grants cover the majority of our costs, but we count on contributions to help us close the gaps in our budget.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><em>Earlier this week, I sent this note to HashiCorp employees and am posting it here to let the entire HashiCorp community know about my plans:</em></p>
<p>I have some bittersweet news to share with you all today: I've decided to move on from HashiCorp, and I'll soon no longer be an employee with the company. I recently celebrated 11 years since starting HashiCorp, and as I reflect back on the last decade I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend that part of my life.</p>
<p>My departure from HashiCorp is something I’ve been thinking about and planning for a long time. Ever since founding HashiCorp, I've felt it's important to build a company where I'm not required for day-to-day operations and where other leaders can carry the torch over time. I have been very intentional about this as time went on: stepping down from being CEO in 2016, iterating over time on a culture of leadership autonomy that didn't require my involvement to make decisions, and finally <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/mitchell-s-new-role-at-hashicorp">departing the leadership team and board of directors in 2021</a>. Since then, I've had the pleasure of working where I’m happiest — as a full-time, hands-on engineer.</p>
<p>My passion as an engineer reaches beyond infrastructure and I always knew that at some point — when the company and I were ready — I'd move on and take on new, different challenges. My family recently welcomed our first child, and while reflecting during my time off I felt now was a fitting time to complete this transition. The world of cloud automation and infrastructure tooling is still ripe with opportunities and growth, but after nearly 15 years of working exclusively on tooling in this space, I'm ready to dabble in new areas.</p>
<p>While my departure from HashiCorp is exactly what I've planned for, it's still a poignant moment. Nearly my entire adult life has revolved around the company. Many of my most formative memories happened in the context of this company. There are far too many to recount here, but I'd like to highlight just a few.</p>
<p>Years before we started HashiCorp, Armon [Dadgar, HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO] and I would talk about cloud, automation, and distributed systems incessantly. We were teenagers, and we'd playfully — not seriously — say things like, "What if one day the biggest companies used our software?" At one point, though, we took the first step and made some of our ideas into actual code. Next thing we knew, we had thousands of users. So, we took another step and started a company. A little later we took the next step and decided to raise funding. And that’s how HashiCorp became what it is today: we took many small little steps like this until we found that that playful, teenage idealism had become reality.</p></section><div><p><img alt="Mitchell and Armon in 2013" loading="lazy" width="3264" height="1736" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1671228946-2013-mitchell-armon.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1671228946-2013-mitchell-armon.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Mitchell and Armon in 2013.</p></div><section><p>As we got going, I felt like some “firsts” were particularly significant. The <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashiconf-2015-wrap-up">first HashiConf in 2015</a> will always be a special memory. It was the first time that the digital world really firmly crossed over into the physical world for me, and it was hard to believe that any of it was real. I knew that our download numbers were high and I knew I interacted daily with community members online, but it's something entirely different to see hundreds of people willingly choose to physically show up. I felt incredibly proud, but it was also one of the earliest moments that I felt a real weight of responsibility. I felt the internal struggle of wanting to build, but also needing to shepherd this company Armon and I were creating. I'm so thankful to all of those early adopters and employees who joined us for that first event.</p></section><div><p><img alt="First HashiConf" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1281" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1702507478-first-hashiconf-2015.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1702507478-first-hashiconf-2015.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1702507478-first-hashiconf-2015.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>The audience at HashiConf 2015.</p></div><section><p>Just a few short years later, our first internal, full-company offsite was the next major "whoa" experience for me. We had more people present than at that first HashiConf! I started this company with Armon, focused on my excitement around the technology, but moments like this taught me how important the people are, too. The people and our shared experiences are what I now look back on most fondly.</p>
<p>There are many more similarly impactful moments throughout my history with HashiCorp, and I'm so grateful for all of them. Although it may sometimes seem like some events are bigger than others, I value each experience (even the tough ones) as a necessary step toward achieving each individual milestone.</p>
<p>I've worked alongside Armon for almost 15 years (since before HashiCorp!), and worked with Dave [McJannet, HashiCorp CEO] for over 7. We led the company together up until I stepped off the leadership team in 2021. Beyond being coworkers, we’ve grown to be close friends. I continue to trust their leadership and will miss working with them dearly.</p></section><div><p><img alt="Mitchell, Dave and Armon" loading="lazy" width="1832" height="1218" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1702495672-screenshot-2023-12-13-at-2-26-55-pm.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1702495672-screenshot-2023-12-13-at-2-26-55-pm.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F2885%2F1702495672-screenshot-2023-12-13-at-2-26-55-pm.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Armon, Mitchell, and Dave.</p></div><section><p>The controversial worldviews such as <em>multi-cloud</em> that we founded this company on are now mainstream and <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/state-of-the-cloud/2021">broadly accepted</a>. The software that I helped start is used industry-wide from hobbyists to professionals at the world's largest companies. And, most recently, the <a href="https://solutionshub.epam.com/blog/post/programming-language-popularity-on-github">GitHub Octoverse report</a> found that HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) has once again emerged as one of the top languages used in open source projects. These are just some of the examples that show the impact, growth, and promising future HashiCorp continues to have in the industry. This is all beyond what I could've hoped for, and I'm leaving proud of the small role I played in making this happen.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, nearly my entire adult life has revolved around HashiCorp. This company has made such an impact on not just my life, but on the lives of so many, including our passionate community, our valued customers, our many close ecosystem partners, and our amazing employees. Thanks to all of you for your energy and your trust. Finally, my heartfelt wishes go out to the entire company. I will be cheering you on, grateful to have contributed to the journey of shaping HashiCorp, and excited to see what you will do next.</p>
<p>All the best.</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT</B>:</font> <BR>The Journal of Universal Rejection is pleased to announce the <a href="http://www.universalrejection.org/conference/"> Conference of Universal Rejection</a>.
</BIG></P>-->

<big> <b>About the Journal</b><a name="about"></a> </big>

<p><big>The founding principle of the Journal of Universal Rejection (JofUR) is rejection. Universal rejection. That is to say, all submissions, regardless of quality, will be rejected. Despite that apparent drawback, here are a number of reasons you may choose to submit to the JofUR:</big></p>
<big> </big>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><big>You can send your manuscript here without suffering waves of anxiety regarding the eventual fate of your submission. You know with 100% certainty that it will not be accepted for publication.</big></li>
	<li><big>There are no page-fees.</big></li>
	<li><big>You may claim to have submitted to the most prestigious journal (judged by acceptance rate).</big></li>
	<li><big>The JofUR is one-of-a-kind. Merely submitting work to it may be considered a badge of honor.</big></li>
	<li><big>You retain complete rights to your work, and are free to resubmit to other journals <i>even before our review process is complete.</i></big></li>
	<li><big>Decisions are often (though not always) rendered within hours of submission.</big></li>
</ul>

<big> <b>Instructions for Authors</b><a name="instructions"></a> </big>

<p><big>The JofUR solicits any and all types of manuscript: poetry, prose, visual art, and research articles. You name it, we take it, and reject it. Your manuscript may be formatted however you wish. Frankly, we don't care.</big></p>
<big> </big>

<p><big>After submitting your work, the decision process varies. Often the Editor-in-Chief will reject your work out-of-hand, without even reading it! However, he might read it. Probably he'll skim. At other times your manuscript may be sent to anonymous referees. Unless they are the Editor-in-Chief's wife or graduate school buddies, it is unlikely that the referees will even understand what is going on. Rejection will follow as swiftly as a bird dropping from a great height after being struck by a stone. At other times, rejection may languish like your email buried in the Editor-in-Chief's inbox. But it will come, swift or slow, as surely as death. Rejection.</big></p>
<big> </big>

<p><big>Submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:j.universal.rejection@gmail.com">j.universal.rejection@gmail.com</a>. Small files only, please. Why not just send the first couple pages if it is long? If you are lucky, your eventual rejection letter will appear on the Journal's blog. Please let us know in your cover letter if you would not mind being identified, otherwise most identifying information will be redacted.</big></p>

				<h2>GM CEO claimed investment would not have been possible, except for corporate welfare</h2>
		</p>

		

			
	</div><div data-field="body">
		<p>General Motors Corp. will lay off 900 workers from Orion Assembly in January 2024.</p>
<p>The company&nbsp;received&nbsp;roughly $824 million in corporate welfare from Michigan lawmakers less than two years ago, in January 2022. Taxpayers spent&nbsp;$600 million to create 4,000 jobs, up to $158 million for renewable energy projects&nbsp;(as the factory would build electric vehicles), and $66.1 million in site readiness.</p>
<p>“The Michigan Economic Development Corporation also authorized a State Education Tax abatement to be used in conjunction with the locally approved Orion Township abatement in support of the GM expansion,” the state announced at the time.</p>
<p>Orion Township threw in property tax abatements.</p>
<p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joined GM CEO Mary Barra in the announcement, touting the good-paying jobs the plant would create.</p>
<p>"GM's $7 billion investment in Michigan —&nbsp;the largest in their history —&nbsp;will create and retain 5,000 good-paying jobs and enable us to build on our legacy as the place that put the world on wheels," <a target="" href="https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/news/press-releases/2022/01/25/secures-historic-7-billion-investment-by-gm-to-create-thousands-of-manufacturing-jobs-">Whitmer said</a> at the time.</p>
<p>"When it comes to investing in Michigan, GM and I have the same philosophy: 'Everybody In.' Michigan's future is bright, and I will continue working with anyone to make transformational investments in our economy, create good-paying jobs, and empower working families."</p>
<p>Barra runs the no. 21 company on the Fortune 500 list. But in her public statement, she said the Orion investment would not have been possible&nbsp;if not for corporate welfare.</p>
<p>"These important investments would not have been possible without the strong support from the governor, Michigan Legislature, Orion Township, the City of Lansing, Delta Township,” Barra said, before mentioning the United Auto Workers union.</p>
<p>UAW officials spoke of the General Motors investment&nbsp;as one that would “benefit families for decades to come.”</p>
<p>Two years later, 911 Orion Township factory workers will start the year in need of work.</p>

As a few on this list may recall, it is 25 years ago today that the
"IBM secure mailer" had its public beta release. This was accompanied
by a nice article in the New York Times business section.

There is some literature at <a href="https://www.postfix.org/press.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.postfix.org/press.html</a> that
attests how this project accelerated open-source adoption by a very
large company.

At the time there were several efforts by people inside IBM to do
open-source projects, but it was the NY Times article that brought
open source on the radar of the CEO. He then tasked people to come
up with an open-source strategy for IBM.

As for the name Postfix, my colleagues and I had come up with
multiple names that were rejected each time (I still have some
Internet domains names from that time). We decided that this was
not going to work, released it as "IBM secure mailer", and then,
after IBM was no longer in control, changed the name to Postfix.

That was a long time ago. Postfix has evolved as the Internet has
changed. I am continuing the overhaul of this software, motivated
by people like you on this mailing list.

<!-- cache hit 53:single/related:f609da48f8c974c21f5a1a7129fdec49 --><!-- empty -->
<p>A friend of mine had been using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/beeper-mini-on-android-claims-to-have-reverse-engineered-imessage-compatibility/">Beeper's iMessage-for-Android app, Beeper Mini</a> to keep up on group chats where she was the only Android user. It worked great until last Friday, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/beeper-minis-imessage-app-for-android-is-broken-possibly-by-apple/">it didn't work at all</a>.</p>
<p>What stung her wasn't the return to being the Android interloper in the chats again. It wasn't the resulting lower-quality images, loss of encryption, and strange "Emphasized your message" reaction texts. It was losing messages during the outage and never being entirely certain they had been sent or received. There was a gathering on Saturday, and she had to double-check with a couple people about the details after showing up inadvertently early at the wrong spot.</p>
<p>That kind of grievance is why, after Apple on Wednesday appeared to have blocked what Beeper described as "~5% of Beeper Mini users" from accessing iMessages, both co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1735131934484029914">Eric Migicovksy</a> and the app told users <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1735315504880123995">they understood if people wanted out</a>. The app had already suspended its plans to charge customers $1.99 per month, following the first major outage. But this was something more about "how ridiculously annoying this uncertainty is for our users," Migicovsky posted.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Fighting on two fronts</h2>
<p>But Beeper would keep working to ensure access and keep fighting on other fronts. Migicovsky pointed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">Epic's victory at trial against Google's Play Store</a> ("big tech") as motivation. "We have a chance. We're not giving up." Over the weekend, Migicovsky reposted shows of support from Senators <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1734983766492184886">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1734363711769546873">Amy Klobuchar</a> (D-Minn.), who have focused on reigning in and regulating large technology company's powers.</p>
<p>Apple previously issued a (somewhat uncommon) statement about Beeper's iMessage access, stating that it "took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage." Citing privacy, security, and spam concerns, Apple stated it would "continue to make updates in the future" to protect users. Migicovsky previously denied to Ars that Beeper used "fake credentials" or in any way made iMessages less secure.</p>
<p>I asked Migicovsky by direct message if, given Apple's stated plan to continually block it, there could ever be a point at which Beeper's access was "settled," or "back up and running," as he put it in his post on X (formerly Twitter). He wrote that it was up to the press and the community. "If there's enough pressure on Apple, they will have to quit messing with us." "Us," he clarified, meant both Apple's customers using iMessage and Android users trying to chat securely with iPhone friends.</p>
<p>"That's who they're penalizing," he wrote. "It's not a Beeper vs. Apple fight, it's Apple versus customers."</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>$\textit{Magic: The Gathering}$ is a popular and famously complicated trading card game about magical combat. In this paper we show that optimal play in real-world $\textit{Magic}$ is at least as hard as the Halting Problem, solving a problem that has been open for a decade. To do this, we present a methodology for embedding an arbitrary Turing machine into a game of $\textit{Magic}$ such that the first player is guaranteed to win the game if and only if the Turing machine halts. Our result applies to how real $\textit{Magic}$ is played, can be achieved using standard-size tournament-legal decks, and does not rely on stochasticity or hidden information. Our result is also highly unusual in that all moves of both players are forced in the construction. This shows that even recognising who will win a game in which neither player has a non-trivial decision to make for the rest of the game is undecidable. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for a unified computational theory of games and remarks about the playability of such a board in a tournament setting.

But we think the prices from the big cloud vendors like AWS, Azure, GCP get too high, with closed source solutions that lock users in. It gets worse once credits expire.</p><p>The cloud evolved over the years towards a few players that charge high premiums, for increasingly complex products for standard, essential services. Each player optimizing for their walled-gardens leaves customers stuck across incompatible clouds. </p><p>We believe a simpler, portable, and open version of the cloud will make a lasting difference.</p></div><h3>The Solution</h3><div><p>Ubicloud is an open and portable alternative, reduces your costs, and returns control of your infrastructure back to you. We started with VMs, virtual networking, block storage (non-replicated), and powerful IAM. We are now adding Managed PostgreSQL, in preview.</p><p><strong>Open and Portable</strong><br>There are two parts to our release today: First, for the first time, we are making the control plane for a managed PostgreSQL solution open, using the Elastic v2 license for it. While PostgreSQL has been open and portable since its inception, managed cloud services that simplify its management have remained closed source until now. </p><p>We’ve built several of those services ourselves as the Ubicloud founding team, including the PostgreSQL services at Citus Data, Microsoft and Heroku. Our open implementation emphasizes transparency and portability:<br> <a href="https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud">https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud</a></p><p><strong>Costs 3x less</strong><br>Second, we are previewing a managed version of Ubicloud PostgreSQL, which costs 3x less compared to AWS RDS, Azure PostgreSQL, and other major providers:</p></div><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64f9d9b4e737e7b37d4e39a4/6579045bf4a0d1ee95387b2a_Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%202.03.46%E2%80%AFAM.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 94vw, (max-width: 1439px) 72vw, 864px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64f9d9b4e737e7b37d4e39a4/6579045bf4a0d1ee95387b2a_Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%202.03.46%E2%80%AFAM-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64f9d9b4e737e7b37d4e39a4/6579045bf4a0d1ee95387b2a_Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%202.03.46%E2%80%AFAM-p-800.png 800w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64f9d9b4e737e7b37d4e39a4/6579045bf4a0d1ee95387b2a_Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%202.03.46%E2%80%AFAM-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64f9d9b4e737e7b37d4e39a4/6579045bf4a0d1ee95387b2a_Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%202.03.46%E2%80%AFAM.png 1266w" alt=""></p><p>Pricing <a href="https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/managed-postgresql/price-performance">scales</a> linearly from our &lt;standard-2&gt; to &lt;standard-16&gt; instances, with billing in minutely increments.</p><h3>Key features and performance</h3><div><p>We run our open and portable Ubicloud PostgreSQL control plane, on Hetzner data centers in Germany.

Even in its earliest and current version, it can be particularly useful when:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>You are already using Hetzner data centers, where there is currently no managed PostgreSQL offering.<br></li><li>Your cloud PostgreSQL bill is going up; and you want to offload your dev and/or analytics-heavy instances to a fast, inexpensive cloud&nbsp;</li></ul></div><p id="create-vm"><h3>Getting started</h3></p><div><p>We’d love to have you try Ubicloud Postgres, and share your feedback with us. For our managed Postgres service, we are offering the first 10 companies that sign up 50% off for the first 3 months. We will also be happy to take a look at your PostgreSQL setup, and give you any feedback for improving your Postgres usage.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use our docs to get started; then send us an email at support@ubicloud.com to claim your credit.<a href="https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/managed-postgresql/quickstart-copy"><br>‍</a><a href="https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/managed-postgresql/quickstart">https://www.ubicloud.com/docs/managed-postgresql/quickstart<p>‍</p></a>To talk about your PostgreSQL setup on RDS, Heroku, other providers, and see whether complementing it with Ubicloud PostgreSQL makes sense, you can set up time with the founders <a href="https://calendly.com/ubicloud/postgres">here.</a> <a href="https://calendly.com/ubicloud/postgres"><p>‍</p></a>Building an open cloud, with all its key services, will require your help.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://davidkcaudill.medium.com/?source=post_page-----52c408bd048b--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="David Caudill" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*Lgz4VQ83FheZMmP7.jpg" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy" data-testid="authorPhoto"></p></div></a></div><figure></figure><p id="4ee8">Over many years, “DevOps” practitioners applied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Theory Of Constraints</a> to our problems, ruthlessly optimizing our delivery pipelines and practices. Manual release management? Hell no, automate that. Deployment? Automate that too. Image management? 🔨 No thanks. Rolling back after we trebuchet a flaming dumpster into production? Automated. Whatever low value activity we could find in the process of getting code from product backlog to customer hands was a bottleneck to be removed or optimized.</p><p id="0707">The end result of this was that the<strong> slowest part of software delivery is testing.</strong> Since testing is <em>why continuous delivery exists</em>, that should have been good enough. Yes, we can make our tests faster, more automated, parallelized, etc. But when the highest value activity of a given practice is the bottleneck, you’re optimal. You have achieved “the best possible problem”.</p><p id="8725">Those habits and behaviors of optimization didn’t stop there. We kept on chopping. 🪓 We squished our integration and end to end tests down to unit tests to parallelize. At the personnel level, we pushed out anybody whom we believed could not code, indiscriminately, at the function level. We decided that <em>testing </em>might not be the bottleneck…the QA team was. The industry began to treat the people in these roles worse and worse. Expectations for them went up, salaries went down(while everyone else’s seemed to be going up!), we contracted the role, we offshored it, pretty much anything we could do to try and stop employing QA Engineers.</p><p id="ffd4">This created a self-reinforcing spiral, in which anyone “good enough at coding” or fed up with being treated poorly would leave QA. Similarly, others would assume anyone in QA wasn’t “good enough” to exit the discipline. No one recommends the field to new grads. Eventually, the whole thing seemed like it wasn’t worth it any more. Our divorce with QA was a cold one — companies just said “we’re no longer going to have that function, figure it out.” It was<strong> incredibly disrespectful</strong> and demoralizing to folks who had spent their career in QA. It also caused a lot of problems, because producing low quality software is actually a huge headache.</p><p id="5a65">You can probably see where this is going by now: <strong>developers did not figure this out. </strong>Most orgs have no idea who should be doing what in terms of software quality. Those who have kept the function are struggling to find a place for it, because of the damage already done to the discipline.</p><blockquote><p id="414c">It turns out, the “One Weird Trick” to faster software delivery was not “fire your testers”.</p></blockquote><p id="28eb">Wrecking this discipline was one of the <strong>worst kind of management mistakes </strong>— a choice to destroy something that took decades to develop, and one where the impact might not be felt for years. By the time your org has felt it, you’re likely <em>years</em> away from a meaningful fix.</p><p id="3132">The parts of the broken QA role we were handed are all still broken, and on the metaphorical workbench. The division of labor simply did not happen. Unsurprisingly, developers did not readily assume the duties of the role without any additional compensation, recognition, or reward. Those of us who can still remember working with a high functioning QA team can impersonate <em>some</em> of those behaviors, but newer engineers and managers have no idea what any of that was about, and aren’t able to tell what’s missing. The guiding principle in the following advice is that <strong>quality assurance is work. </strong>Just like any other work, assuming “somebody” will do it, <a href="https://itrevolution.com/product/making-work-visible/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">letting it be invisible</a>, is a recipe for failure. Denial is not a strategy.</p><p id="daa9">It’s 2023 and it feels silly to have to write this down, but my experience suggests that I absolutely <strong>must.</strong></p></div><div><h2 id="cc56">Here is the work to be done in order to manage quality in your software practice:</h2><p id="8b0c"><strong>Defect Tracking: </strong>there <em>needs </em>to be a way for your users to send you information about a bug, and for your developers to log a bug. What is a bug? A bug is an individual ticket that describes <em>what’s wrong and how bad it is. </em>It doesn’t describe the work to fix it, only the defect itself, how to reproduce it, and its impact. In recent years I have been surprised to find that <strong>most </strong>dev teams I work with simply do not track these. These teams have an ocean of excuses: “We won’t ever fix it.” “That’s not my job.” “I don’t want to fix anything, I get rewarded for new features.” None of these is good enough to justify the low quality results that are produced by this approach.</p><figure><figcaption>Just managing the list of bugs is WORK.</figcaption></figure><p id="0d4b"><strong>Triage: </strong><em>Bug triage</em> is the process by which your engineering organization assigns, prioritizes, cleans up, categorizes, deduplicates, and otherwise cares for the bugs coming in to your organization. Having a consistent standard for what a high/medium/low severity bug looks like will help your org in a number of ways. We used to call this “bug hygiene”. Similarly, just the task of deciding what team this bug belongs to is <strong>work. </strong>A high functioning organization can do things like: degrade quality gracefully in the presence of layoffs, hand off a category of bugs to a new team in the event of a reorganization, or jettison all bugs for a feature that’s been cut.</p><figure><figcaption>You can ignore the triage process if your team never deals with external stressors or reorganizes. That was a joke.</figcaption></figure><p id="19e6"><strong>Defect Investigation: </strong>Reproduction, or “repro”, is a critical part of managing bugs. In order to expedite fixes, somebody has to do the legwork to translate “I tried to buy a movie ticket and it didn’t work” into “character encoding issues broke the purchase flow for a customer with a non-English character in their name”. Similarly, the questions of “how many times does this happen?” and “what is the user impact?” need a real human to spend a minute answering them.</p><figure><figcaption>Defect investigation is the application of engineering rigor to your backlog of bugs.</figcaption></figure><p id="2510"><strong>Focus: </strong>There is real value in having people at your company whose focus is on the quality of your end product. Quality might be “everybody’s job”…but it should also be “somebody’s job”. The push/pull of Quality vs Velocity <strong>needs</strong> an advocate for quality in the discussion — and that dynamic is vital to producing better results. Your testing tools, your test <em>quality, </em>test plans… all of these need an opinionated party to argue in favor of doing the best possible job.</p><figure></figure><p id="61db"><strong>End to End Testing: </strong>One of the biggest, most common problems I see in the engineering orgs I work with is ownership of the <em>system. </em>Increases in architectural complexity have been done to try and keep teams and applications small. That’s a perfectly rational strategy, but it leaves a gap around…<em>literally the most important thing about your application. </em>In my experience, the average team no longer does this, because it’s too hard.</p><figure><figcaption>Does anyone in your organization actually USE the product before it ships?</figcaption></figure></div><div><p id="641a">It’s easy to look at that list and say <em>“but we’re agile, lean, dynamic, we don’t need to do these things! We’ve moved past this.” </em>But I think that if you look harder, what you’ll find is that this work is probably happening in your organization already — <em>poorly. </em>And imagine if<em> literally </em>any other field tried to make that claim to you. Your car, your bank, your doctor…”we don’t do quality assurance” is just not a great thing to hear or say.<em> </em>Failure to recognize and organize these activities will lead to a really dreadful situation. Tell me if this sounds familiar:</p><p id="b2b8">The most conscientious employees in your organization are the most bitter. They see the quality issues, they often address them, and they get no recognition for doing so. When they speak up about quality concerns, they get treated like mouthbreathers who want to slow down. They watch the “move fast and break things” crowd get rewarded time after time, while they run around angrily cleaning up their messes. To these folks, it feels like giving a damn is a huge career liability in your organization. <strong>Because it is.</strong></p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

 </article><p>B cells also drive some autoimmune disorders by making antibodies that attack healthy tissue. In 2019, researchers showed that CAR T cells that recognize B cells reduced symptoms in mice with a disease similar to lupus, an autoimmune disorder that affects a variety of organs<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Around the same time, researchers at University Hospital Erlangen in Germany were setting up their own CAR-T centre to provide cancer treatment. During a meeting at the centre, a rheumatologist asked the cancer specialists for advice about a young woman with a form of lupus called systemic lupus erythematosus. Several of her organs were failing; her doctors estimated that she did not have long to live. The young woman insisted that they try something new.</p><h2>High-risk approach</h2><p>The team thought of the mouse study but baulked at trying it in people. CAR-T therapy can have severe side effects, and recipients must first undergo intensive chemotherapy that kills off many of their existing immune cells. “At the beginning we were quite scared,” said team member Fabian Müller, an oncologist at the Friedrich–Alexander University of Erlangen–Nuremberg, at a press conference before he presented the work at the San Diego meeting. The woman was adamant that they try.</p><p>That first participant — and the others who followed — experienced relatively minor adverse effects, Müller reported at the conference. The Erlangen team eventually used the method to treat two other autoimmune disorders: systemic sclerosis and idiopathic inflammatory myositis.

 </article><p>Other groups have since taken up the approach and reported similar results.

Researchers are beginning to wonder how long the final list will be. “We’re just at the beginning,” says Marcela Maus, who designs CAR-T therapies against cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “There is so much that can be done that was unthinkable just a decade ago.”</p><p>At this stage, however, it’s unclear how much of this success is due to the CAR-T therapy as opposed to the chemotherapy that killed many of the participants’ pre-existing immune cells, cautions Ruella. That might have helped to wipe out the errant B cells.</p><p>For now, Müller lapses into a dreamy smile as he marvels over the remarkable recoveries he has seen: the man who struggled to walk 10 metres before his treatment and now routinely walks 10 kilometres around town, for example. “These are young people that have been spending more time with their doctors than with their friends,” he says. “They would describe their breakfast as a handful of pills that they are just shoving in.”</p><p>“And it’s all gone,” he says. “From the physician perspective, it’s pretty much the most pleasing thing.”</p>

I’ve been asked to interview her plenty of times, and finally decided to do so.</p><p>Some notes</p><p>The banking programming world is a completely different world than what most of us are used to, and for the next couple of hours after posting this I’ll accept whatever questions you may have for her, but keep in mind that some questions may not be answered due to security concerns. I’ll be posting this to HN &amp; Reddit and will answer questions over there as well.</p><p>I won’t write this as a Q&amp;A, but more like I’m telling you her story.</p><p>UPDATE: I’ve added Q&amp;A of some FAQ to the bottom of the post!</p><p>1991</p><p>The year she started internal training at Nordea, which back then was known as Nordbanken (The North Bank) but changed name to Nordea in 2001. During the training she had to take various tests, most notably an IQ-test to see if she had the intelligence to work within this field. Other tests includes a psychological checkup to make sure she had the psyche to handle that line of work and a multitasking test which she failed horribly where she got the score 22/100. She did very good on the other tests and among the 16 available positions, she managed to get one.</p><p>The position in question was an IBM Mainframe COBOL programmer, which to this day, 25 years later still work as for the same bank.</p><p>This position is the most important one in the bank, at least from a technical standpoint. If, let’s say, my mother and everyone on her team would quit their job, the bank would go under within a matter of weeks if they’re lucky. They have a rotation of people on her team being available 24/7. I remember when I was younger and she had to take a taxi to work in the middle of the night on a Sunday to fix a dead-lock problem.</p><p><strong>COBOL…</strong></p><p>…is not a fancy programming language like your functional Haskell or concurrent Golang— it’s an imperative, procedural language and since 2002, object-oriented. There’s nothing wrong with the language itself, the problem is that barely anyone knows it — at least not in the context of mainframe programming. My mother is the next youngest person on her team, and she’s born 1964, and the youngest person being 2 years younger. Since almost all of the largest banks in the world runs on IBM Mainframe with COBOL as the primary programming language, this is a global issue. The smaller banks however are better off which usually runs something like Java without mainframes.</p><p>My mother used to ask me if I wanted to learn, but since working with the more fancier stuff like Postgres, Redis, Node, Crystal, PHP, among others, I’ve always answered “Never, ever!”. I am still very interested in what she do, but these types of systems gives off the probably worst enterprisy-feeling that you can imagine, which I’d like to avoid.</p><p>I can only imagine the fat paycheck a 20-year old mainframe programmer would get though, because your age in this case would be invaluable.</p><p><strong>Databases</strong></p><p>Their primary database is called IMS, which is an hierarchical database built by IBM for the Apollo program. Internally they call it DL/1 which is short for Database Language One. They are trying to migrate to DB2 which is a relational database that speaks normal SQL, but considering the sheer volume of data that Nordea is storing, this is a task that is going to take years. It’s not as simple as just moving the data from IMS into DB2, they also have to update their modules to load &amp; save data from DB2 instead of IMS and they have thousands of modules, many of which were developed by programmers that have either passed away or have retired.</p><p>Each transaction is stored in DB2. They’re avoiding writing to IMS as much as possible, only reading data from it until their newly purchased system is fully integrated and they can start storing data there.</p><p>IMS is extremely old and very slow (for some tasks).</p><p>Searching for data can take hours. Hah, and here we are, arguing that MySQL delivers 2ms better query speed than Postgres. That’s a bit ironic.</p><p>They also use a flat-file structure for a lot of tasks, which themselves has different flavors that IMS supports. One such example is GSAM which has forced my mother to take a taxi into work many times due to modules working on the same GSAM-file at the same time, producing deadlocks.</p><p>Let’s talk about the size of their databases for a moment. DB2 is only storing data about transactions, and each transaction is different in size depending on what type of account the transaction goes to/from. Private accounts like my personal bank account is orders of magnitude more simple than bank accounts used by business. Each transaction is somewhere between 2KB to 500 bytes, so let’s say the average is 1KB.</p><p>At the moment, their DB2 database holds 11 billion transactions, and the law requires them to save each transaction for 10 years, having settled for 11 years. At the moment, transactions are only 7 years old and the amount of transactions is estimated to grow roughly 5–8% each year, until they hit the 11 year mark where they can nuke transactions that are older than 11 years.</p><p>So at the moment, the DB2 database holds about 10TB of data, and that data is only transactions. In 4 years, it’ll be somewhere around 13–14TB of data.</p><p>IMS holds most other information. That kind of data differs a lot in size, so it’s hard to estimate how large it is, but I guess it’s much larger than their DB2 database.</p><p>They also store some data on tapes, where their programs tell a machine to load/save data from a specific tape, which is pretty cool!</p><p>IDE</p><p>Everyone has some form of IDE or text editor, right? Well, yes they do. The IDE is called ISPF which is like an entire OS. ISPF can be extended, and the part we would call an IDE is an extension to ISPF which is called Endevor.</p><p>ISPF is directly connected to the mainframe, and there’s no such thing as a local development environment here.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif" width="636" height="343" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:343,&quot;width&quot;:636,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Roughly 80% of their systems are batch jobs. These are jobs that runs at a certain time or interval, doing some processing on their data or sends data to other banks/agencies/etc. For example when I buy a can of Coke, the money is withdrawn from my account balance, however the money is not actually transferred anywhere until one of their batch jobs does so. These jobs are usually executed during the night, which is usually why it takes a day before transactions between banks are completed. Transactions to the same bank are usually instant because it executes immediately.</p><p>Batch jobs are working with datasets on a gigabyte-, sometimes terrabyte-level and can in some cases take hours to complete. I’d love to see how IBMs mainframes all of a sudden starts working at full capacity the second the clock turns 00:00 in their datacenters, would be pretty cool!</p><p><strong>The problems banks are facing</strong></p><p>Banks that run on mainframes have quite a lot of issues that they need to take care of, but unfortunately time is scarce.</p><p>Programmers are getting older, not many wants to learn and the time before a new employee can stand on their own feet is 2–3 years, and even then there are a lot of gray areas for them.</p><p>There are programs that are decades old that nobody even knows what they do and the person who wrote it is long gone.</p><p>Many banks are trying to purchase shiny new systems to replace what they currently have, while almost all of their programmers are saying “this is not going to work, you cannot replace this monster that we have here”.</p><p>The reason their systems has become so huge is partially because they made the mistake early on to tailor their own system towards other systems. A great example here is how we build RESTful services, where programs that wants to get data from us have to tailor their system to match ours. This is not the case with some banks, instead they’re sending data to other systems (such as the tax agency) which may at any point update their systems which in turn breaks the current system the bank are using to send the data.</p><p>Banking systems are also extremely advanced. A personal bank account differs a lot from a business bank account, and there are at least 50 different types of bank accounts for each of them. And in Nordeas case, they also have the Swedish government accounts, which are different from both personal and business accounts. I think they have the Finnish government accounts and maybe a portion of Denmarks as well, which differs too.</p><p><span>It’s going to be very interesting to hear what Nordea and other banks will do these upcoming years, and what new tech they’ll be implemented on.</span><br><span>I may have forgot to ask something, so if you have any questions go ahead and ask, I’ll be forwarding them to her and write down her response for the next couple of hours.</span></p><p><strong><span>Why did you choose to work with IBM Mainframe COBOL programming?</span><br></strong><span>- I’ve always wanted to “work with computers”, but I wasn’t aiming for this specific job. I saw an ad in the papers and applied and got the job. I had a bit of computer background before I applied though.</span></p><p><strong>What is the worst thing that you’ve seen on a day?</strong><br><span>- My co-worker forgot to add a dot to the end of a statement for a module in the most critical part of our system which we call “The Cash Register”. It is the part that handles all the money. The result was that the entire bank was down for 16 hours straight due to the module continiuing executing statements when it actually should’ve stopped after that statement. It basically overloaded our systems, a self-DOS of sorts.</span></p><p><strong>What do you think will happen in the future for banks that run on the same infrastructure as Nordea?</strong><br><span>- Most banks has acknowledged that we need to replace the older mainframes with something more modern. Nordea has bought a new system which it has promised to replace the current one within 4 years, but Nordea takes care of multiple countries and a more reasonable number is 4 years per country, so 16 years in total.</span><br><span>Banks and finance that haven’t acknowledged this is going to have a very rough time ahead of them. I still think we’ll live on IBM infrastructure though.</span></p><p><strong>What were the challenges you’ve faced as a female programmer that started in the 90's?</strong><br><span>- No problem at all. I’ve got a couple of female co-workers, but most are men. It doesn’t bother me that much.</span></p><p><strong>You’ve been working for the same entity and possibly the same code base for more than 20 years. Does it ever gets old?</strong><br><span>- Yeah it definitely gets tiring after a while, like most other lines of work becomes. But during my time here I’ve build many completely new systems for various things in finance, and that has always been fun. Unfortunately from now on we will never build anything new, only maintain what we currently have and wait for the new system we’ve purchased to replace the current one.</span></p><p><strong>How scary is it to write code for a bank?</strong><br><span>- It is very scary, especially when we push changes to production which happens on Sundays. Whenever we push new changes to production, huge parts of the system has to be taken offline. One of those parts is the entire IMS. During that period anything can happen, but we have a very robust test environment so it usually goes through smoothly.</span></p><p><strong>Have you caused any huge mistakes for the bank?</strong><br><span>- Definitely have, quite a large mistake I did back in 1997, when my youngest son (that’s me, the writer) just started pre-school and my parental leave was over. We have a system for saving money for retirement. Those type of bank accounts wasn’t locked back then, and the law says you cannot withdraw money from that account before you’re 55 years old. Since the accounts wasn’t locked, it was possible to withdraw money if you had the bank account number, so the solution was simple; not give the customer their bank account number.</span><br><span>I managed to screw up by modifying a module that added their bank account number to the mail that was sent out to customers. So what happened was that customers started withdrawing money (which was not taxed yet!) from their retirement savings account before they were allowed to.</span><br><span>This triggered a huge inspection, the Swedish government stepped in, the financial inspection and the media were all over it. That was me.</span></p><p><strong>What’s your working environment like?</strong><br><span>- We’ve recently moved to a more “hip” location. We used to have personal desks, but now we have this “pick whatever spot is avaiable” open area. I dislike it a lot.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger came out swinging at Nvidia's CUDA technology, claiming that inference technology will be more important than training for AI as he launched </p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-u-h-series-specs-skus" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/intel-core-ultra-meteor-lake-u-h-series-specs-skus"><u>Intel Core Ultra</u></a><p> and </p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-emerald-rapids-5th-gen-xeon-platinum-8592-review-64-cores-320mb-of-l3-and-350w-tdp" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-emerald-rapids-5th-gen-xeon-platinum-8592-review-64-cores-320mb-of-l3-and-350w-tdp"><u>5th Gen Xeon</u></a><p> datacenter chips in an event here in New York City. Taking questions at the NASDAQ, Gelsinger suggested that Nvidia’s CUDA dominance in training wouldn't last forever.</p><p>

"You know, the entire industry is motivated to eliminate the CUDA market," Gelsinger said. He cited examples such as MLIR, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google">Google</a>, and OpenAI, suggesting that they are moving to a "Pythonic programming layer" to make AI training more open.</p><p>

"We think of the CUDA moat as shallow and small," Gelsinger went on. "Because the industry is motivated to bring a broader set of technologies for broad training, innovation, data science, et cetera."</p><p>

But Intel isn't relying just on training. Instead, it thinks inference is the way to go.</p></div><p>"As inferencing occurs, hey, once you've trained the model… There is no CUDA dependency," Gelsinger continued. "It's all about, can you run that model well?" He suggested that with Gaudi 3, shown on stage for the first time, that Intel will be up to the challenge, and will be able to do it as well with Xeon and edge PCs. Not that Intel won't compete in training, but "fundamentally, the inference market is where the game will be at," Gelsinger said.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="Intel Gaudi 3, shown on stage for the first time" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="Intel Gaudi 3, shown on stage for the first time" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB.jpg" alt="Intel Gaudi 3, shown on stage for the first time" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NdkzqapuTGSSq2agzqZkrB-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><div><p>He also took the opportunity to push OpenVINO, the standard that Intel has gathered around for its AI efforts, and predicted a world of mixed computing, some that occurs in the cloud, and others that happen on your PC.</p><p>

Sandra Rivera, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center and AI Group at Intel, added that Intel's scale from the data center to the PC may make it a partner of choice, as it can produce at volume.</p><p>

"We're going to compete three ways for 100% of the datacenter AI TAM." Gelsinger said, tacking onto Rivera's comment. "With our leadership CEOs, leadership accelerators, and as a foundry. Every one of those internal opportunities is available to us: The TPUs, the inferentias, the trainiums, et cetera. We're going to pursue all of those. And we're going to pursue every commercial opportunity as well, with NVIDIA, with AMD, et cetera. We're going to be a foundry player."</p><p>

It's a bold strategy, and Gelsinger appeared confident as he led his team through presentations today. Can he truly take on CUDA? Only time will tell as applications for the chips Intel launched today — and that his competitors are also working on — become more widespread.</p></div>

<p>Today, Mozilla announced more than 450 new extensions (software that adds new features or functionality to the browser) to users on Firefox for Android at Mozilla’s <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/">Addons.mozilla.org (AMO) Android page</a>. This milestone marks the launch of a new open extension ecosystem on mobile where developers are now free to create and publish extensions and users can easily access and install them on Firefox for Android.</p>



<p>“Extensions were first created as a way for people to customize their own internet experience, from <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/madonna-firefox-theme-designer/">artists designing themes</a> to developers who wanted to make extensions to improve people’s web experience,” said Vicky Chin, Vice President of Engineering at Firefox. “We’re thrilled to bring this experience to Firefox for Android, where we’re the only major Android browser to support an open extension ecosystem. In the coming months, we plan to enable more extensions for people to choose from and customize their own mobile internet experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Our journey to an open extension ecosystem to benefit all</h2>



<p>Browser extensions have become an essential part of everyone’s daily internet experience. Nearly half of all Firefox desktop users have installed an extension to customize their online experience. Extensions provide a wide array of powerful features — from privacy tools like anti-trackers and ad blockers, to productivity tools, tab managers, translators and so much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Built on Mozilla’s mission for an open and accessible internet for all, Firefox works with an independent community of developers to offer extensions for people who want more <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/extensions-addons/become-a-better-writer-with-these-five-extensions-for-firefox/">personal agency</a> out of their online experience. On desktop, there are thousands of extensions to help you become a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/extensions-addons/become-a-better-writer-with-these-five-extensions-for-firefox/">better writer</a>, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-tips/land-your-next-job-with-these-firefox-extensions/">land a job</a> or clean up a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/extensions-addons/extensions-for-cleaning-up-a-chaotic-desktop/">chaotic desktop</a>. While the new Android ecosystem will take time to develop the robust diversity of content that desktop extensions offer, quite a few major desktop extensions are already available on Firefox for Android, such as privacy focused content blockers <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/">Ghostery</a>, anti-tracking gem <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/">Privacy Badger</a> and color customizer <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark Reader</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, we <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/08/10/prepare-your-firefox-desktop-extension-for-the-upcoming-android-release/">announced</a> that we had completed building the infrastructure needed to support an open extension ecosystem on Firefox for Android. We were ready for the next chapter: adding extensions. Since then, we’ve been working with developers to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/09/27/test-firefox-android-extensions-and-help-developers-prepare-for-an-open-mobile-ecosystem-in-december/">test</a> and make hundreds of extensions compatible on mobile. So, are you ready to customize your mobile browsing experience to make it faster, safer or simply more fun? Look no further with today’s release of extensions on Firefox for Android.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Extensions to help while you’re on the go, just in time for the holidays&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We depend on our mobile devices for many things — quick informational searches, reading articles, listening to music, looking for recipes (like cookies for the annual cookie holiday exchange). So, we understand the value of having experiences that are simple, predictable and offer the time to focus. Here are some extensions available today to help achieve that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/midnight-lizard-quantum/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm%20_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search"><strong><em>Midnight Lizard</em></strong></a><strong><em> – Read easier&nbsp;</em><br></strong>We look at our mobile devices in so many different environments. Whether it’s outside with the sun or inside a dimly lit room, our eyes work hard to adjust. Midnight Lizard is one of those extensions your eyes will feel the difference and thank you. It can change the colors of the page, increase or decrease the brightness and contrast. Add a blue light filter, screen shader and of course, the ever-popular night mode. Midnight Lizard will keep your eyes in good shape!</li>



<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/dark-background-light-text/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search"><strong><em>Dark Background and Light Text</em></strong></a><strong><em> – Keep it simple</em><br></strong>This extension is well-loved by thousands of users for its simplicity. It’s helpful for folks who prefer to work in dark mode, or those with low vision where reading dark text on a white background is challenging. You’re free to customize it so that all web pages are rendered in this elegant way, or just select pages.</li>



<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/worldwide-radio/"><strong><em>Worldwide Radio</em></strong></a><strong><em> – Get into the groove</em><br></strong>Access more than 50,000 radio stations from all over the world right from your Firefox for Android browser. In the mood for a bit of Brazilian Samba? How about some traditional Indian Hindustani? Techno beats from Berlin? The world’s music and real time talk radio is literally at your fingertips.</li>
</ul>



<h2>A big thank you to our developer community</h2>



<p>We would like to thank all the developers who worked with us to make their extensions compatible for this launch of the open extension ecosystem on Firefox for Android. Hundreds attended our webinars and brought incredible creative energy to this project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The opportunity for innovation is vast,” said Giorgio Natili, Firefox Director of Engineering. “It’s thrilling to see extension developers embrace this moment and create novel browsing experiences and features for Firefox for Android users. People don’t have to browse the mobile web in a strictly singular way anymore. With extensions, you’re free to change the way Firefox for Android looks and behaves. It’s only going to get better as more developers innovate within this exciting new space.”</p>



<p>As more developers create mobile optimized content, you can expect a wave of new Firefox for Android extensions to emerge in the coming months. In the meantime, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">download</a> the latest Firefox for Android and shape your own internet experience with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/android/">Android extensions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<h2>TL;DR: Upper Case Is Default for Latin Scripture.</h2>
<p>Latin script is based on upper case and designed around that. Lower case is a later add on (see below) for cursive. Default use case for Latin script is Upper Case.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Character Encoding</h2>
<p>Early codes and machinery used for writing didn't have any case at all, only letters. Lower and upper case glyphs are eye candy, usually not conveying any  substantial meaning. That's why neither <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Morse</a> nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Braille</a> carry them. Same goes for any other early transmission code, like the the ITA2 used for teletypes.</p>
<p>After all, there is no need to have two sets when they are fully complementary. It wasn't until the mid 1960s that, with the upcoming ASCII encoding, lower case became a choice to be used.</p>
<h2>Printing Requires a Choice</h2>
<p>The whole point of choosing what case to be used only arises with the need for displaying those letters in print, or later on screen. Here using upper case is only natural, as</p>
<p><strong>Upper Case is</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>most commonly accepted</strong></p>
<p>across Europe, independent of culture and writing style due being the oldest form.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>best readable</strong>,</p>
<p>due being a two line script (*1) developed for best readability (*2) - a feature that comes quite handy with low quality output (*3).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>most inclusive</strong> / <strong>least offensive</strong> one.</p>
<p>Writing all all upper case will always be proper, while writing all lower may be offending to some - like when addressing a person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Then There Was Data</h2>
<p>When it comes to data handling it's important to remember that letters were only added as afterthought. Punch card, the most original mean of data storage, had at first only numbers. Next some punctuation (decimal point, currency sign, hash, etc) were added, while letters were the last major modification.</p>
<p>Same goes for equipment to print from punch cards (printing tabulators) or on punch cards (interpreters). They originally also could only do numbers and punctuation, while letters were added last. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_Accounting_Machine" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Powers</a> first in 1921, while IBM followed in 1931. Of course, when printed they were done so in upper case.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the mid 1960s that lower case became a distinct, additional set on punch cards and mainframes.</p>
<h2>But I Type Lower Case</h2>
<p>Not really. Early machinery, no matter if teletype or terminal, did not produce lower or upper case when typed, but just letters, as there was no case (see above). This single case was usually displayed as uppercase (reasoning see above).</p>
<p>The Apple II is eventually the last major application of that principle. pressing a letter always produced only a single code, no matter if Shift was pressed or not and this letter was displayed in upper case.</p>
<p>Similar worked next to all early computing equipment. When terminals allowing entry of lower and upper case letters became a thing, mainframes still only got a single case delivered as communication equipment (terminal controllers, I/O handler) simply converted both to the single encoding the host used.</p>
<p>That way terminals with lower case and such without would by default be operated all equal, allowing a smooth transition and high degree of compatibility.</p>
<h2>Then Why is Unix Lower Case?</h2>
<p>The main purpose of low end machines of the 1970s was about to get any work done - translation layers like common in mainframes were a luxury one could do without. Unix being a prime example as it was all about getting a certain functionality to production. Combine this with now widely available (ASCII based) lowercase enabled terminals and one gets lower case as default input. Including all the hassles of case sensitive input.</p>
<p>CP/M and in turn MS-DOS being a nice counter example as here the command line is by default translated to upper case, simplifying handling.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>There is no single reason and especially not one constructed as an afterthought. It was an evolutionary process influenced by need, capabilities and usage.</p>
<hr>
<h2>History is Upper Case</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Latin, developed around <strong>7th century BC</strong> was originally a two line script(*1).</p>
</li>
<li><p>By the <strong>first century AD</strong> papyri show sloppy written letters forming lower case (minuscule), which developed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_cursive" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Roman Cursive</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Until the <strong>8th century</strong> those forms of  developed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Carolingian Minuscule</a> like today's lower case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It took another 3-500 years (<strong>11th/13th century</strong>) until Gothic script (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Blackletter</a>) finalized them to what we know today.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rules of when to use upper and lower case only became widely accepted during the <strong>16th/17th century</strong>, not at least by development of the printing press.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The English way of writing mostly lower case is even more recent and dates to the <strong>early 18th century</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom Line: Thruout history it was Upper Case first.</p>
<hr>
<p>*1 - Two line scripts, like old Greek and Latin, uses a single case with all letters of the same height, limited between those two lines. Lower case needs three lines, or four with descender (itself a later, Gothic addition). Might remind you about school, doesn't it :))</p>
<p>*2 - Roman Majuscule developed to be readable from distance and off of low quality material. Roman Minuscule are a form of short hand trading readability for space usage and speed in writing(*4). More appropriate for notes and private correspondence than official exchange.</p>
<p>*3 - Note that your keyboard is (most likely) also labelled with upper case letters. A convention done since early typewriter days. They are until today more easy to identify than lower case - so not (only) heritage.</p>
<p>*4 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ligatures</a> make a great point here. They were a further evolution promoting increasing density and speed of cursive - and almost exclusive found with lower case letters. While usually not considered letters in their own, typesetters had dedicated letters for each ligature.</p>

            <guid>38643923</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:15:27 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2023/12/14/language-rankings-update/">https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2023/12/14/language-rankings-update/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38643923">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>As the inbound DMs and emails attest, at least a few of you out there having been waiting for RedMonk to drop our latest version of the programming language rankings. Our apologies about the delay: here’s our update on the process.</p>
<p>Normally we run these rankings twice a year, with the goal of using publicly available data sets to track if there are any meaningful changes in how people are using programming languages. We correlate cumulative language usage as seen through non-forked PRs on public GitHub repos against questions asked on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>These metrics have always told an incomplete story at best. There are languages that were under- or over-represented by using public GitHub repos; there are communities that were under- or over-represented by looking at discussions happening in Stack Overflow. These metrics were not perfect by any means, but the two large, publicly facing datasets created an interesting decade plus long trend for RedMonk to track over time.</p>
<p>Our last set of queries, however, provided us with data that required further investigation.</p>
<h2>Stack Overflow</h2>
<p>We’ve been internally discussing how we’re going to address the impact of AI-based code assistants on our language rankings since GitHub released Copilot in October 2021. However, it was when ChatGPT hit the market on November 30, 2022 and went from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">0 to 100M users in two months</a> that we started seeing undeniable impacts on our source data.</p>
<p>We’d already seen questions asked falling off from their peak. However, when we pulled data for our June 2023 rankings the collective decline was notable.</p>
<p>The below chart takes questions asked on Stack Overflow about the top 20 programming languages (as determined from <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2023/05/16/language-rankings-1-23/">RedMonk’s analysis dated January 2023</a>) and look backed at historical semi-annual trends.</p>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime.png" alt="Bar chart showing number of questions tagged on Stack Overflow for our top 20 languages. Questions peak in 2016-17 and begin to fall sharply in last year" width="100%" height="1000" srcset="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime.png 1000w, https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime-520x520.png 520w, https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime-150x150.png 150w, https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime-768x768.png 768w, https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime-480x480.png 480w, https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime-300x300.png 300w, https://redmonk.com/rstephens/files/2023/12/stackovertime-627x627.png 627w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the number of questions asked using these 20 Stack Overflow tags* declined almost 20% from the prior period. And this is just our first full period running these numbers post-ChatGPT. A cursory query about YTD indicates an even more stark change.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that developer’s ability to instantaneously ask questions of a non-judgmental AI assistant that will give answers in context is going to have a marked negative impact on the usefulness of the public datasets provided by Stack Overflow.</p>
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>While we expected a change in Stack Overflow, we were not expecting significant anomalies in our data from GitHub (and to the extent that we were anticipating changes, we expected them to be upwards. The narrative about AI code assistants aiding development velocity and <a href="https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2023/06/27/ai-is-for-tinkerers/">benefitting tinkerers</a> has been prevalent.)</p>
<p>However, the data we saw from GitHub Archive actually showed a roughly 25% decline in pull requests in 1H2023 as compared to 2H2022 PRs that we were not expecting.</p>
<p>The dataset we use is a public dataset on BigQuery, and so we asked questions of both Google in terms of how the data was pulled in and of the GitHub team to see if they had seen similar changes on in their internal data.</p>
<p>In the end, the change appears to not be an error in the available data and is largely lacking an explanation. The best guess thus far is that there was an overhang in increased activity from the pandemic and this is a return to expected activity, but we have no way of confirming whether that storyline is accurate.</p>
<p>As of now this is not a declining trend we expect to continue, but these are numbers we will continue to watch with interest.</p>
<h2>What Next?</h2>
<p>The advent and rise of AI-based code assistants are already impacting the data that populates RedMonk’s language rankings. As questions and knowledge sharing moves from public forums to private tools, our ability to ascertain meaningful trends from said public data will be indefinitely altered.</p>
<p>We will continue to track these trends and make determinations about how this change in sample size will impact our ability to perform the rankings.</p>
<p>As of now, look for our next rankings in January 2024.</p>
<hr>

				<p><span>After years of battles over Bills C-11 and C-18, few Canadians will have the appetite for yet another troubling Internet bill. But given a bill that envisions government-backed censorship, mandates age verification to use search engines or social media sites, and creates a framework for court-ordered website blocking, there is a need to pay attention. <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/S-210/third-reading">Bill S-210</a>, or the </span><em><span>Protecting Young Persons from Exposure to Pornography Act</span></em><span>, was passed by the Senate in April after Senators were reluctant to reject a bill framed as protecting children from online harm. The same scenario appears to be playing out in the House of Commons, where yesterday a majority of the House <a href="https://x.com/HoCChamber/status/1735038570753102106?s=20">voted for the bill at second reading</a>, sending it to the Public Safety committee for review. The bill, which is the brainchild of <a href="https://x.com/mivillej/status/1735041108764188967?s=20">Senator Julie Miville-Duchêne</a>, is not a government bill. In fact, government ministers voted against it. Instead, the bill is backed by the Conservatives, Bloc and NDP with a smattering of votes from backbench Liberal MPs. Canadians can be forgiven for being confused that after&nbsp;months of championing Internet freedoms, raising fears of censorship, and expressing concern about CRTC overregulation of the Internet, Conservative MPs were quick to <a href="https://x.com/GarnettGenuis/status/1735043817965764793?s=20">call out</a> those who <a href="https://x.com/annarobertsmp/status/1735080924012818833?s=20">opposed the bill </a>(the House sponsor is Conservative MP Karen Vecchio).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appeared before the <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2022/02/age-verification-requirements-for-twitter-or-website-blocking-for-reddit-my-appearance-on-bill-s-210-at-the-senate-standing-committee-on-legal-and-constitutional-affairs/"><span>Senate committee that studied the bill in February 2022</span></a>, where I argued that “</span><span>by bringing together website blocking, face recognition technologies, and stunning overbreadth that would capture numerous mainstream services, the bill isn’t just a slippery slope, it is an avalanche.” As I did then, I should preface criticism of the bill by making it clear that underage access to inappropriate content is indeed a legitimate concern. I think the best way to deal with the issue includes education, digital skills, and parental oversight of Internet use including the use of personal filters or blocking tools if desired. Moreover, if there are Canadian-based sites that are violating the law in terms of the content they host, they should absolutely face investigation and potential charges. </span></p>
<p><span>However, Bill S-210 goes well beyond personal choices to limit underage access to sexually explicit material on Canadian sites. Instead, it envisions government-enforced global website liability for failure to block underage access, backed by website blocking and mandated age verification systems that are likely to include face recognition technologies. The government establishes this regulatory framework and is likely to task the CRTC with providing the necessary administration. While there are surely good intentions with the bill, the risks and potential harms it poses are significant.</span></p>
<p><span>The basic framework of Bill S-210 is that it creates an offence for any organization making available sexually explicit material to anyone under the age of 18 for commercial purposes. The penalty for doing so is $250,000 for the first offence and up to $500,000 for any subsequent offences. Organizations (broadly defined under the Criminal Code) can rely on three potential defences:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The organization instituted a “</span><span>prescribed age-verification method” to limit access. It would be up to the government to determine what methods qualify with due regard for reliability and privacy. There is a major global business of vendors that sell these technologies and who are vocal proponents of this kind of legislation.</span></li>
<li><span>The organization can make the case that there is “legitimate purpose related to science, medicine, education or the arts.” </span></li>
<li><span>The organization took steps required to limit access after having received a notification from the enforcement agency (likely the CRTC).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The enforcement of the bill is left to the designated regulatory agency, which can issue notifications of violations to websites and services. Those notices can include the steps the agency wants followed to bring the site into compliance. This literally means the government via its regulatory agency will dictate to sites how they must interact with users to ensure no underage access. If the site fails to act as instructed within 20 days, the regulator can apply for a court order mandating that Canadian ISPs block the site from their subscribers. The regulator would be required to identify which ISPs are subject to the blocking order. </span></p>
<p><span>The website blocking provisions are focused on limiting user access and can therefore be applied to websites anywhere in the world with Canadian ISPs required to ensure that the sites are rendered inaccessible. And what about the risk of overblocking? The bill not only envisions the possibility of blocking lawful content or limiting access to those over 18, it expressly permits it. Section 9(5) states that if the court determines that an order is needed, it may have the effect of preventing access to “material other than sexually explicit material made available by the organization” or limiting access to anyone, not just young people. This raises the prospect of full censorship of lawful content under court order based on notices from a government agency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that isn’t bad enough, there are two additional serious concerns. First, the bill is not limited to pornography sites. Rather, it applies to any site or service that makes sexually explicit materials available. This would presumably include search engines, social media sites such as Twitter, or chat forums such as Reddit, where access to explicit material is not hard to find. If the bill was limited solely to sites whose primary purpose is the commercial distribution of sexually explicit material, it might be more defensible. As it stands now, the overbroad approach leaves this bill vulnerable to constitutional challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>Second, consider the way sites are supposed to comply with the law, by establishing age verification systems. This effectively means that sites will require their users to register with commercial age verification systems in order to run a search or access some tweets. And the age verification systems raise real privacy concerns, including mandated face recognition as part of the verification process.</span></p>
<p>Senate private members bills rarely become law, but this bill is suddenly on the radar screen in a big way. The bill should not have come this far and should not be supported. Creating safeguards for underage access to inappropriate content is a laudable goal, but not at the cost of government-backed censorship, mandated face recognition, and age-approval requirements to use some of the most popular sites and services in the world.</p>

  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">By searching for “functions” written in computer code, FunSearch made the first discoveries in open problems in mathematical sciences using LLMs</p><p data-block-key="7k21c">Large Language Models (LLMs) are useful assistants - they excel at combining concepts and can read, write and code to help people solve problems. But could they discover entirely new knowledge?</p><p data-block-key="c3ioi">As LLMs have been shown to “hallucinate” factually incorrect information, using them to make verifiably correct discoveries is a challenge. But what if we could harness the creativity of LLMs by identifying and building upon only their very best ideas?</p><p data-block-key="c9jsm">Today, in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper published in Nature</a>, we introduce FunSearch, a method to search for new solutions in mathematics and computer science. FunSearch works by pairing a pre-trained LLM, whose goal is to provide creative solutions in the form of computer code, with an automated “evaluator”, which guards against hallucinations and incorrect ideas. By iterating back-and-forth between these two components, initial solutions “evolve” into new knowledge. The system searches for “functions” written in computer code; hence the name FunSearch.</p><p data-block-key="79msm">This work represents the first time a new discovery has been made for challenging open problems in science or mathematics using LLMs. FunSearch discovered new solutions for the cap set problem, a longstanding open problem in mathematics. In addition, to demonstrate the practical usefulness of FunSearch, we used it to discover more effective algorithms for the “bin-packing” problem, which has ubiquitous applications such as making data centers more efficient.</p><p data-block-key="6hrod">Scientific progress has always relied on the ability to share new understanding. What makes FunSearch a particularly powerful scientific tool is that it outputs programs that reveal <i>how</i> its solutions are constructed, rather than just what the solutions are. We hope this can inspire further insights in the scientists who use FunSearch, driving a virtuous cycle of improvement and discovery.</p><h2 data-block-key="cqrj5">Driving discovery through evolution with language models</h2><p data-block-key="3lfpb">FunSearch uses an evolutionary method powered by LLMs, which promotes and develops the highest scoring ideas. These ideas are expressed as computer programs, so that they can be run and evaluated automatically. First, the user writes a description of the problem in the form of code. This description comprises a procedure to evaluate programs, and a seed program used to initialize a pool of programs.</p><p data-block-key="33p7f">FunSearch is an iterative procedure; at each iteration, the system selects some programs from the current pool of programs, which are fed to an LLM. The LLM creatively builds upon these, and generates new programs, which are automatically evaluated. The best ones are added back to the pool of existing programs, creating a self-improving loop. FunSearch uses <a href="https://ai.google/discover/palm2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google’s PaLM 2</a>, but it is compatible with other LLMs trained on code.</p>

      <p data-block-key="8b2b2">The FunSearch process. The LLM is shown a selection of the best programs it has generated so far (retrieved from the programs database), and asked to generate an even better one. The programs proposed by the LLM are automatically executed, and evaluated. The best programs are added to the database, for selection in subsequent cycles. The user can at any point retrieve the highest-scoring programs discovered so far.</p>

              <div>
  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">Discovering new mathematical knowledge and algorithms in different domains is a notoriously difficult task, and largely beyond the power of the most advanced AI systems. To tackle such challenging problems with FunSearch, we introduced multiple key components. Instead of starting from scratch, we start the evolutionary process with common knowledge about the problem, and let FunSearch focus on finding the most critical ideas to achieve new discoveries. In addition, our evolutionary process uses a strategy to improve the diversity of ideas in order to avoid stagnation. Finally, we run the evolutionary process in parallel to improve the system efficiency.</p><h2 data-block-key="293lm">Breaking new ground in mathematics</h2><p data-block-key="c10fe">We first address the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_set" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cap set problem</a>, an open challenge, which has vexed mathematicians in multiple research areas for decades. Renowned mathematician Terence Tao once described it as his <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/02/23/open-question-best-bounds-for-cap-sets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">favorite open question</a>. We collaborated with Jordan Ellenberg, a professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and author of an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09223" rel="noopener" target="_blank">important breakthrough on the cap set problem</a>.</p><p data-block-key="6gov3">The problem consists of finding the largest set of points (called a <i>cap set</i>) in a high-dimensional grid, where no three points lie on a line. This problem is important because it serves as a model for other problems in extremal combinatorics - the study of how large or small a collection of numbers, graphs or other objects could be. Brute-force computing approaches to this problem don’t work – the number of possibilities to consider quickly becomes greater than the number of atoms in the universe.</p><p data-block-key="2vb6l">FunSearch generated solutions - in the form of programs - that in some settings discovered the largest cap sets ever found. This represents the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1027365901231" rel="noopener" target="_blank">largest increase</a> in the size of cap sets in the past 20 years. Moreover, FunSearch outperformed state-of-the-art computational solvers, as this problem scales well beyond their current capabilities.</p>

              <div>
  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">These results demonstrate that the FunSearch technique can take us beyond established results on hard combinatorial problems, where intuition can be difficult to build. We expect this approach to play a role in new discoveries for similar theoretical problems in combinatorics, and in the future it may open up new possibilities in fields such as communication theory.</p><h2 data-block-key="cc0t2">FunSearch favors concise and human-interpretable programs</h2><p data-block-key="ektms">While discovering new mathematical knowledge is significant in itself, the FunSearch approach offers an additional benefit over traditional computer search techniques. That’s because FunSearch isn’t a black box that merely generates solutions to problems. Instead, it generates programs that describe <i>how</i> those solutions were arrived at. This show-your-working approach is how scientists generally operate, with new discoveries or phenomena explained through the process used to produce them.</p><p data-block-key="6f8qq">FunSearch favors finding solutions represented by highly compact programs - solutions with a low Kolmogorov complexity†. Short programs can describe very large objects, allowing FunSearch to scale to large needle-in-a-haystack problems. Moreover, this makes FunSearch’s program outputs easier for researchers to comprehend. Ellenberg said: “FunSearch offers a completely new mechanism for developing strategies of attack. The solutions generated by FunSearch are far conceptually richer than a mere list of numbers. When I study them, I learn something”.</p><p data-block-key="jp5n">What’s more, this interpretability of FunSearch’s programs can provide actionable insights to researchers. As we used FunSearch we noticed, for example, intriguing symmetries in the code of some of its high-scoring outputs. This gave us a new insight into the problem, and we used this insight to refine the problem introduced to FunSearch, resulting in even better solutions. We see this as an exemplar for a collaborative procedure between humans and FunSearch across many problems in mathematics.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="4lvaj">Addressing a notoriously hard challenge in computing</h2><p data-block-key="a8qqv">Encouraged by our success with the theoretical cap set problem, we decided to explore the flexibility of FunSearch by applying it to an important practical challenge in computer science. The “bin packing” problem looks at how to pack items of different sizes into the smallest number of bins. It sits at the core of many real-world problems, from loading containers with items to allocating compute jobs in data centers to minimize costs.</p><p data-block-key="1n4qj">The online bin-packing problem is typically addressed using algorithmic rules-of-thumb (heuristics) based on human experience. But finding a set of rules for each specific situation - with differing sizes, timing, or capacity – can be challenging. Despite being very different from the cap set problem, setting up FunSearch for this problem was easy. FunSearch delivered an automatically tailored program (adapting to the specifics of the data) that outperformed established heuristics – using fewer bins to pack the same number of items.</p>

              <div>
  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">Hard combinatorial problems like online bin packing can be tackled using other AI approaches, <a href="https://deepmind.google/impact/optimizing-computer-systems-with-more-generalized-ai-tools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">such as neural networks</a> and reinforcement learning. Such approaches have proven to be effective too, but may also require significant resources to deploy.

<p>14th December 2023</p>

<p>Dropbox added some <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/view-edit/dropbox-ai-how-to">new AI features</a>. In the past couple of days these have attracted a firestorm of criticism. Benj Edwards rounds it up in  <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/dropbox-spooks-users-by-sending-data-to-openai-for-ai-search-features/">Dropbox spooks users with new AI features that send data to OpenAI when used</a>.</p>
<p>The key issue here is that people are worried that their private files on Dropbox are being passed to OpenAI to use as training data for their models—a claim that is strenuously denied by Dropbox.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Dropbox built some sensible features—summarize on demand, “chat with your data” via Retrieval Augmented Generation—and did a moderately OK job of communicating how they work... but when it comes to data privacy and AI, a “moderately OK job” is a failing grade. Especially if you hold as much of people’s private data as Dropbox does!</p>
<p>Two details in particular seem really important. Dropbox have an <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/ai-principles">AI principles document</a> which includes this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Customer trust and the privacy of their data are our foundation. We will not use customer data to train AI models without consent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also have a checkbox hidden <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/account/ai">deep in their settings</a> that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2023/dropbox-third-party.png" alt="Third-party AI: Use artificial intelligence (Al) from third-party partners so you can work faster in Dropbox. We only use technology partners we have vetted. Your data is never used to train their internal models, and is deleted from third-party servers within 30 days. Learn more. There is a toggle set to On."></p>
<p>I took that screenshot on my own account. It’s toggled “on”—but I never turned it on myself.</p>
<p>Does that mean I’m marked as “consenting” to having my data used to train AI models?</p>
<p>I don’t think so: I think this is a combination of confusing wording and the eternal vagueness of what the term “consent” means in a world where everyone agrees to the terms and conditions of everything without reading them.</p>
<p>But a LOT of people have come to the conclusion that this means their private data—which they pay Dropbox to protect—is now being funneled into the OpenAI training abyss.</p>
<h4 id="people-dont-believe-openai">People don’t believe OpenAI</h4>
<p>Here’s copy from that Dropbox preference box, talking about their “third-party partners”—in this case OpenAI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your data is never used to train their internal models, and is deleted from third-party servers within 30 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s increasing clear to me like people simply <strong>don’t believe OpenAI</strong> when they’re told that data won’t be used for training.</p>
<p>What’s really going on here is something deeper then: AI is facing a crisis of trust.</p>
<p>I quipped <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1735086765814542802">on Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“OpenAI are training on every piece of data they see, even when they say they aren’t” is the new “Facebook are showing you ads based on overhearing everything you say through your phone’s microphone”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I meant by that.</p>
<h4 id="facebook-dont-spy-microphone">Facebook don’t spy on you through your microphone</h4>
<p>Have you heard the one about Facebook spying on you through your phone’s microphone and showing you ads based on what you’re talking about?</p>
<p>This theory has been floating around for years. From a technical perspective it should be easy to disprove:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile phone operating systems don’t allow apps to invisibly access the microphone.</li>
<li>Privacy researchers can audit communications between devices and Facebook to confirm if this is happening.</li>
<li>Running high quality voice recognition like this at scale is extremely expensive—I had a conversation with a friend who works on server-based machine learning at Apple a few years ago who found the entire idea laughable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-technical reasons are even stronger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook say they aren’t doing this. The risk to their reputation if they are caught in a lie is astronomical.</li>
<li>As with many conspiracy theories, too many people would have to be “in the loop” and not blow the whistle.</li>
<li>Facebook don’t need to do this: there are much, much cheaper and more effective ways to target ads at you than spying through your microphone. These methods have been working incredibly well for years.</li>
<li>Facebook gets to show us thousands of ads a year. 99% of those don’t correlate in the slightest to anything we have said out loud. If you keep rolling the dice long enough, eventually a coincidence will strike.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the thing though: <em>none of these arguments matter</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever experienced Facebook showing you an ad for something that you were talking about out-loud about moments earlier, you’ve already dismissed everything I just said. You have personally experienced anecdotal evidence which overrides all of my arguments here.</p>
<p>Here’s a Reply All podcast episode from Novemember 2017 that explores this issue: <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/z3hlwr">109 Is Facebook Spying on You?</a>. Their conclusion: Facebook are not spying through your microphone. But if someone already believes that there is no argument that can possibly convince them otherwise.</p>
<p>I’ve experienced this effect myself—over the past few years I’ve tried talking people out of this, as part of my own personal fascination with how sticky this conspiracy theory is.</p>
<p>The key issue here is the same as the OpenAI training issue: people <strong>don’t believe</strong> these companies when they say that they aren’t doing something.</p>
<p>One interesting difference here is that in the Facebook example people have personal evidence that makes them believe they understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>With AI we have almost the complete opposite: AI models are weird black boxes, built in secret and with no way of understanding what the training data was or how it influences the model.</p>
<p>As with so much in AI, people are left with nothing more than “vibes” to go on. And the vibes are bad.</p>
<h4 id="this-really-matters">This really matters</h4>
<p>Trust is really important. Companies lying about what they do with your privacy is a very serious allegation.</p>
<p>A society where big companies tell blatant lies about how they are handling our data—and get away with it without consequences—is a very unhealthy society.</p>
<p>A key role of government is to prevent this from happening. If OpenAI are training on data that they said they wouldn’t train on, or if Facebook are spying on us through our phone’s microphones, they should be hauled in front of regulators and/or sued into the ground.</p>
<p>If we believe that they are doing this without consequence, and have been getting away with it for years, our intolerance for corporate misbehavior becomes a victim as well. We risk letting companies get away with real misconduct because we incorrectly believed in conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Privacy is important, and very easily misunderstood. People both overestimate and underestimate what companies are doing, and what’s possible. This isn’t helped by the fact that AI technology means the scope of what’s possible is changing at a rate that’s hard to appreciate even if you’re deeply aware of the space.</p>
<p>If we want to protect our privacy, we need to understand what’s going on. More importantly, we need to be able to trust companies to honestly and clearly explain what they are doing with our data.</p>
<p>On a personal level we risk losing out on useful tools. How many people cancelled their Dropbox accounts in the last 48 hours? How many more turned off that AI toggle, ruling out ever evaluating if those features were useful for them or not?</p>
<h4 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do about it?</h4>
<p>There is something that the big AI labs could be doing to help here: tell us how you are training!</p>
<p>The fundamental question here is about training data: what are OpenAI using to train their models?</p>
<p>And the answer is: we have no idea! The entire process could not be more opaque.</p>
<p>Given that, is it any wonder that when OpenAI say “we don’t train on data submitted via our API” people have trouble believing them?</p>
<p>The situation with ChatGPT itself is even more messy. OpenAI say that they DO use ChatGPT interactions to improve their models—even those from paying customers, with the exception of the “call us” priced <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise">ChatGPT Enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>If I paste a private document into ChatGPT to ask for a summary, will snippets of that document be leaked to future users after the next model update? Without more details on HOW they are using ChatGPT to improve their models I can’t come close to answering that question.</p>
<p>Clear explanations of how this stuff works could go a long way to improving the trust relationship OpenAI have with their users, and the world at large.</p>
<p>Maybe take a leaf from large scale platform companies. They publish public post-mortem incident reports on outages, to regain trust with their customers through transparency about exactly what happened and the steps they are taking to prevent it from happening again. Dan Luu has collected a <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems">great list of examples</a>.</p>
<h4 id="opportunity-local-models">An opportunity for local models</h4>
<p>One consistent theme I’ve seen in conversations about this issue is that people are much more comfortable trusting their data to local models that run on their own devices than models hosted in the cloud.</p>
<p>The good news is that local models are consistently both increasing in quality and shrinking in size.</p>
<p>I figured out how to run Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/111577242044966329">on my laptop</a> last night—the first local model I’ve tried which really does seem to be equivalent in quality to ChatGPT 3.5.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/">Phi-2</a> is a fascinating new model in that it’s only 2.7 billion parameters (most useful local models start at 7 billion) but claims state-of-the-art performance against some of those larger models. And they trained it for around $35,000.</p>
<p>While I’m excited about the potential of local models, I’d hate to see us lose out on the power and convenience of the larger hosted models over privacy concerns which turn out to be incorrect.</p>
<p>The intersection of AI and privacy is a critical issue. We need to be able to have the highest quality conversations about it, with maximum transparency and understanding of what’s actually going on.</p>
<p>This is hard already, and it’s made even harder if we straight up disbelieve anything that companies tell us. Those companies need to earn our trust. How can we help them do that?</p>

        <p>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has seen the remains of a supernova explosion in a new light. The remnants, called <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Cassiopeia-A">Cassiopeia A</a> (or Cas A for short), lie 11,000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Cassiopeia.</p>

<p>In April of this year, Webb <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-james-webb-telescopes-stunning-new-snapshot-of-an-exploded-star-180981973/">imaged</a> the stellar remains in <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-121">mid-infrared light</a>. Now, the newly released snapshot shows Cas A’s colorful, orb-like wisps<strong> </strong>captured using Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam).</p>

<p>“With NIRCam’s resolution, we can now see how the dying star absolutely shattered when it exploded, leaving filaments akin to tiny shards of glass behind,” <a href="https://www.physics.purdue.edu/people/faculty/dmilisav.php">Danny Milisavljevic</a>, an astronomer at Purdue University who led the research, says in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-stuns-with-new-high-definition-look-at-exploded-star/">statement</a> from NASA. “It’s really unbelievable after all these years studying Cas A to now resolve those details, which are providing us with transformational insight into how this star exploded.”</p><center><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To: You, From: The Universe </p><p>This stunning new Webb image is a gift from a past star.

<p>Stars burn with fusion, which propels energy outward from their cores. But when aging, giant stars run out of fuel, their own gravity overwhelms fusion’s outward push. The star <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/supernovae?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1702397839656">collapses</a> in an explosion that spews its materials across the cosmos. Heavy elements in the universe are often <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190318111945.htm">formed during supernovae</a>.</p>

<p>The light from Cassiopeia A’s explosion reached Earth about 340 years ago. Scientists estimate that in its early days, the star that yielded the explosion had a mass <a href="https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2017/casa_life/">16 times that of the sun</a>, but it shrank to about five times the size of the sun before it blew. Since the explosion occurred thousands of light-years from Earth, it took thousands of years for its light to reach us.</p>

<p>Previously, the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, Chandra X-Ray Observatory and other telescopes had imaged Cas A, according to NASA. Chandra’s study revealed the amounts of different elements produced by the explosion. The supernova has spat out <a href="https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2017/casa_life/">10,000 times the mass of the Earth in sulfur</a>, 20,000 times Earth’s mass in silicon, 70,000 Earth masses of iron and a million Earth masses of oxygen.</p>

<p>Webb’s NIRCam detects wavelengths of light that are broader than visible light and thus can’t be seen by the human eye. So, to compose the new image, researchers translated the infrared light in different colors.</p>

<p>The bright orange and light pink areas in the new image represent the supernova’s inner shell and are made up of sulfur, oxygen, argon and neon from the star. Dust and molecules that will one day form new stars are in this gas, per NASA.</p>

<p>The researchers also compared the new image to the mid-infrared one from earlier this year. Orange and red in April’s image represent the edge of the remnant’s main inner shell, while this detail looks like wisps of smoke in the new picture. This boundary denotes where the supernova explosion collides with surrounding material that isn’t hot enough to be detected in near-infrared.</p>

<p>A green loop of light in the mid-infrared image (which astronomers had nicknamed the “Green Monster”) is also not visible in Webb’s new view. Holes in that part of the image are outlined in ionized gas, appearing white and purple in the near-infrared image. This could be from the explosion pushing through and shaping gas from the star, according to NASA.</p>

<p>With this new look at Cas A, Webb captured another intriguing feature: A blob that appears in the bottom right of the image is an example of a light echo, where light from the supernova is warming far-away dust. As that dust cools, it glows. This light echo, nicknamed Baby Cas A, is about 170 light-years behind the main supernova remnant.</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>Cruise, the embattled</span> GM self-driving car subsidiary, is laying off 900 employees, or about 24% of its workforce, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The layoffs are part of a plan to slash costs and attempt to revamp the company following an October 2 incident that left a pedestrian stuck under and then dragged by one of its robotaxis.</p>
<p>An email, penned by newly minted president and CTO Mo Elshenawy, was sent this morning to the entire 3,800-person workforce. The email, which TechCrunch has viewed, began with a resigned tone: “We knew this day was coming, but that does not make it any less difficult—especially for those whose jobs are affected,” Elshenawy wrote. Workers were expected to be informed within the hour or receiving the company wide email, as to whether they would be losing their job.</p>
<p>GM, which acquired Cruise in 2016, was rewarded by shareholders for the cutbacks. GM shares rose 4.8% to $35.64 following the news.</p>
<p>Cruise is targeting non-engineering jobs in the layoffs, particularly those people who worked in the field, commercial operations and corporate staffing, according to the email. The company has also ended additional assignments of contingent workers who supported its driverless operations. Engineering, a category that makes up the bulk of the Cruise workforce, is largely being preserved, according to the content of the email and discussions with internal sources.</p>
<p>The email continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Today, we are making staff reductions that will affect 24% of full-time Cruisers, through no fault of their own.&nbsp; We are simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale. As a result, we are reducing our employee counts in operations and other areas. These impacts are largely outside of engineering, although some Tech positions are impacted also.</span></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Workers will remain on the payroll through February 12 and will be eligible for an additional 8 weeks of pay, with long-term employees offered an additional 2 weeks’ pay per every year at Cruise over 3 years, according to the email to staff. Anyone laid off will also receive their 2023 bonus (eligible target payout) on Jan. 5, 2024. Other parts of the severance package includes health benefits through the end of May, two months contribution into their 401(k) plan and continued time on payroll through March 24 for immigrants in lieu of a lump-sum severance payment to allow visa holders additional time to help transition and manage their immigration status.</p>
<p>The company also said that all employees, regardless of whether they were laid off, will receive&nbsp; their January 15th vesting through its employee share-selling program.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Cruise issued a statement confirming the layoffs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">“We shared the difficult news that we are reducing our workforce, primarily in commercial operations and related corporate functions,” the emailed statement reads. “These changes reflect our decision to focus on more deliberate commercialization plans with safety as our north star. We are supporting impacted Cruisers with strong severance and benefits packages and are grateful to the departing employees who played important roles in building Cruise and supporting our mission.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The layoffs come just a day after nine senior leaders (SLT) at Cruise, who worked in its commercial operations, legal and policy departments, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/cruise-leaders-booted-following-initial-safety-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were dismissed</a> by the company’s board. COO Gil West and David Estrada, who was head of government affairs, were among that group.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elshenawy reiterated the company would be narrowing and refocusing its efforts, information shared last month following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/cruise-co-founder-and-ceo-kyle-vogt-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> resignation of co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt</a> and some executive shuffling that included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/gm-inserts-exec-at-cruise-as-safety-review-expands-manual-self-driving-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointing Craig Glidden</a>, GM’s EVP of legal and policy and a Cruise board member, as chief administrative officer at Cruise. Jon McNeill, a member of GM’s board, was also named vice chairman of the Cruise board. McNeill, who joined the Cruise board recently and was previously chief operating officer at Lyft and president of Tesla, now serves alongside GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise executives said at the time they wanted to take a measured business approach that preserves cash and improves safety culture in an attempt to put GM’s troubled autonomous vehicle subsidiary on the right path. The first steps in that rebuilding plan, which included pausing production on its Origin robotaxi, were laid out in an internal email sent to employees in late November by Elshenawy, who was executive vice president of engineering at Cruise and ascended into the president role after co-founder and Vogt resigned.</p>
<p>Elshenawy repeated that intent in the Thursday morning email stating that the company was “simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale.”</p>
<p>Cruise used all-electric Chevy Bolt vehicles, which have been specifically manufactured to support its self-driving system, in its robotaxi fleet. The company intended to shift towards a custom-built autonomous vehicle called the Origin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The layoffs have been largely expected at Cruise for weeks now. Last month. Barra reiterated plans for Cruise to be more “deliberate” when operations eventually resume at the troubled self-driving vehicle subsidiary. For GM, that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/gm-to-slash-spending-at-cruise-by-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slashing spending</a> at Cruise “by hundreds of millions of dollars” in 2024, an action that most expected would result in widespread layoffs.</p>
<p>GM and the Cruise board have been scrambling ever since the October 2 incident put the company in the crosshairs of state, local and federal agencies. However’s Cruise’s robotaxi operations in San Francisco have been criticized by the public and city officials almost immediately after the California Public Utilities Commission issued the company in August the final permit required to operate commercially. Videos of Cruise robotaxis blocking traffic and driving into a construction site were shared on social media. But it was a crash with an emergency response vehicle that began to chip away at the company’s seemingly impenetrable exterior.</p>

<p>Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University have&nbsp;<a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2023/04/12/fathers-alcohol-consumption-before-conception-linked-to-brain-and-facial-defects-in-offspring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already shown</a>&nbsp;that paternal drinking habits prior to conception can have a negative effect on fetal development — with&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI167624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semen from men who regularly consume alcohol</a>&nbsp;impacting placenta development, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-associated brain and facial defects, and even IVF outcomes.</p>
<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article published</a>&nbsp;this month in <em>Andrology</em>, the lab of Dr. Michael Golding has now demonstrated that it takes much longer than previously believed, longer than a month, for the effects of alcohol consumption to leave the father’s sperm.</p>
<p>“When someone is consuming alcohol on a regular basis and then stops, their body goes through withdrawal, where it has to learn how to operate without the chemical present,” said Golding, a professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences’ Department of Veterinary Physiology &amp; Pharmacology. “What we discovered is that a father’s sperm are still negatively impacted by drinking even during the withdrawal process, meaning it takes much longer than we previously thought for the sperm to return to normal.”</p>

<h2 id="h-the-dangers-of-paternal-drinking">The Dangers Of Paternal Drinking</h2>
<p>One of the major risks associated with alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy is FAS, which causes abnormal facial features, low birth weight and/or height, attention and hyperactivity issues, and poor coordination.</p>
<p>Currently, doctors are required to confirm only that the mother has consumed alcohol — not the father — to diagnose a child with FAS.</p>
<p>“For years, there’s really been no consideration of male alcohol use whatsoever,” Golding said. “Within the last five to eight years, we’ve started to notice that there are certain conditions where there’s a very strong paternal influence when it comes to alcohol exposure and fetal development.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>“With this project, we wanted to see how long it would take for the effects of alcohol on sperm to wear off,” he said. “We thought it would be a relatively quick change back to normal, but it wasn’t. The withdrawal process took over a month.”</p>
<p>When drinking alcohol, an individual’s liver experiences oxidative stress, leading the body to overproduce certain chemicals, which then interrupts normal cellular activity. Golding’s team discovered that withdrawal causes the same kind of oxidative stress, effectively lengthening the duration of alcohol’s effects on the body beyond what was previously thought.</p>
<p>“During withdrawal, the liver experiences perpetual oxidative stress and sends a signal throughout the male body,” Golding said. “The reproductive system interprets that signal and says, ‘Oh, we are living in an environment that has a really strong oxidative stressor in it. I need to program the offspring to be able to adapt to that kind of environment.’ But Golding suspects that the adaptations to the sperm aren’t beneficial — they lead to problems like FAS.”</p>
<p>He also noted that it doesn’t take excessive alcohol use for a person to experience withdrawal.</p>
<p>“In the models we’re using, even drinking three to four beers after work several days a week can induce withdrawal when the behavior ceases,” Golding said. “You may not feel inebriated, but your body is going through chemical changes.”</p>
<h2 id="h-changing-the-narrative">Changing The Narrative</h2>
<p>Golding’s work is vital to improving pregnancy outcomes by changing&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/for-decades-mothers-have-borne-the-brunt-of-scrutiny-for-alcohol-use-during-pregnancy-new-research-points-to-dads-drinking-as-a-significant-factor-in-fetal-alcohol-syndrome-216601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the conversation about who is responsible</a>&nbsp;for alcohol-related birth defects, since society has historically placed all blame on mothers, even when they do not consume alcohol during their pregnancy.</p>
<p>“There’s psychological trauma associated with the question, ‘Did you drink while you were pregnant?’ It’s also difficult for physicians to have that conversation,” he said. “But if they don’t, then FAS doesn’t get diagnosed right away and the child may not get the support that they need until later in life.”</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s crucial that couples planning on getting pregnant know how far in advance to stop drinking in order to prevent birth defects.</p>
<p>While Golding and his lab will continue to research the effects of paternal drinking to help doctors advise couples, he suggests that fathers abstain from alcohol at least three months prior to conceiving, given this groundbreaking discovery.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of work to be done to get a hard answer, but we know that sperm are made over the course of 60 days, and the withdrawal process takes at least one month,” he said. “So, my estimate would be to wait at least three months.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">When Barbara and Belvett Richards learned that the police had killed their son, they couldn’t understand it. How, on that September day in 2017, did their youngest child come to be shot in his own apartment by officers from the New York Police Department?</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Miguel Richards, who was 31, grew up in Jamaica and had moved to New York about a year earlier after coming to the United States through a work-study program. His father’s friend gave him a job doing office work, and he rented a room in the Bronx. But he started to struggle, becoming reclusive and skipping days of work. His mother, with whom he was particularly close, pleaded with him to return to Jamaica. “It’s as if I sensed something was going to happen,” she says. “I was calling him, calling him, calling him: ‘Miguel, come home. Come home.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">His parents knew he had never been violent, had never been arrested and had never had any issues with the police. What details they managed to gather came from the Bronx district attorney: Richards’ landlord, who hadn’t seen him for weeks, asked the police to check on him. The officers who responded found Richards standing still in his own bedroom, holding a small folding knife. And 15 minutes later, they shot him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Richards’ death marked a historic turning point. It was the first time a killing by officers was recorded by a body camera in New York. The new program was announced just months before as heralding a new era of accountability. Now, a week after the shooting, the department posted on its website a compilation of footage from four of the responding officers. The video, the department said in an introduction to the presentation, was produced “for clear viewing of the event as a totality.” And as far as the department was concerned, the narrative was clear. Sometimes “the use of deadly force is unavoidable,” the police commissioner at the time, James O’Neill, wrote in an internal message. The level of restraint shown by all officers, he said, is “nothing short of exceptional.” And, he added, “releasing footage from critical incidents like this will help firmly establish your restraint in the use of force.”</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">Richards’ parents were not convinced. Belvett watched footage at the district attorney’s office. What he saw, and what was released, did not, in fact, show that the use of deadly force was unavoidable. He later learned that the department had not released all the footage. What else didn’t they know about their son’s death?</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">When body-worn cameras were introduced a decade ago, they seemed to hold the promise of a revolution. Once police officers knew they were being filmed, surely they would think twice about engaging in misconduct. And if they crossed the line, they would be held accountable: The public, no longer having to rely on official accounts, would know about wrongdoing. Police and civilian oversight agencies would be able to use footage to punish officers and improve training. In an outlay that would ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the technology represented the largest new investment in policing in a generation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Yet without deeper changes, it was a fix bound to fall far short of those hopes. In every city, the police ostensibly report to mayors and other elected officials. But in practice, they have been given <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3364&amp;context=vlr">wide latitude</a> to run their departments as they wish and to police — and protect — themselves. And so as policymakers rushed to equip the police with cameras, they often failed to grapple with a fundamental question: Who would control the footage? Instead, they defaulted to leaving police departments, including New York’s, with the power to decide what is recorded, who can see it and when. In turn, departments across the country have routinely delayed releasing footage, released only partial or redacted video or refused to release it at all. They have frequently failed to discipline or fire officers when body cameras document abuse and have kept footage from the agencies charged with investigating police misconduct.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Even when departments have stated policies of transparency, they don’t always follow them. Three years ago, after George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers and amid a wave of protests against police violence, the New York Police Department <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/438-20/mayor-de-blasio-new-body-camera-footage-policy">said</a> it would publish footage of so-called critical incidents “within 30 days.” There have been 380 such incidents since then. The department has released footage within a month just twice.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">And the department often does not release video at all. There have been 28 shootings of civilians this year by New York officers (through the first week of December). The department has released footage in just seven of these cases (also through the first week of December) and has not done so in any of the last 16.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Asked about the department’s limited release of footage, a spokesperson pointed to a caveat, contained in an <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/public_information/bwc-release-oo-54-20.pdf">internal order</a>, that footage can be withheld because of laws or department policy. “The NYPD remains wholly committed to its policy of releasing such recordings as quickly and responsibly as circumstances and the law dictate,” the spokesperson wrote. “Though transparency is of the utmost importance, so too is the Police Department’s commitment to preserving privacy rights.” The department did not say which policies require the withholding of footage and did not address other questions about its record on the cameras. (Mayor Eric Adams’ spokesperson did not make him available for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">For a snapshot of disclosure practices across the country, we conducted a review of civilians killed by police officers in June 2022, roughly a decade after the first body cameras were rolled out. We counted 79 killings in which there was body-worn-camera footage. A year and a half later, the police have released footage in just 33 cases — or about 42%.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">This article is the product of more than six months spent investigating how the police have undermined the promise of transparency and accountability that accompanied the body-camera movement. We interviewed dozens of department insiders, government lawyers, policing experts and advocates and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal reports, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and dozens of hours of surveillance-camera and body-camera footage, including some that the New York Police Department fought against disclosing. The reporting reveals that without further intervention from city, state and federal officials and lawmakers, body cameras may do more to serve police interests than those of the public they are sworn to protect.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">To Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who is now a professor at the Joseph F. Rice School of Law at the University of South Carolina, body cameras represent the latest chapter in America’s quest for a technological fix to the deeply rooted problem of unchecked state power. “Dash cams were supposed to solve racial profiling,” he says. “Tasers and pepper spray were supposed to solve undue force. We have this real, almost pathological draw to ‘silver bullet’ syndrome. And I say that as a supporter of body-worn cameras.” He later added, “We just said to police departments: ‘Here’s this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.’ It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re going to use it in a way that most benefits them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Jeff Schlanger, a former New York deputy commissioner who had an oversight role during the implementation of body-worn cameras and left the department in 2021, believes that the police have often failed to use the cameras for accountability and that political leaders need to do more. “Mayors, City Council members, all locally elected officials,” he says, “should be losing sleep over the lack of meaningful independent oversight of the police.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">When full footage has been released, often by prosecutors or after public pressure, it often contradicts initial police accounts. In 2015, a white officer in Cincinnati killed a Black man during a traffic stop. The officer said his life was in danger. But his body-camera video showed that was a lie, and he was prosecuted for murder. (Charges were dropped after two mistrials.) And in Philadelphia this August, an officer shot and killed a man after, the police said, he lunged at officers with “a weapon.” In fact, footage released by the district attorney — who charged the officer with murder — shows that the man was sitting in his own car.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">In New York, Miguel Richards’ parents weren’t the only ones who had doubts about the department’s claims that the shooting was unavoidable. The footage the department released stopped right when the officers fired at Richards. It didn’t include the minutes after the shooting, and it didn’t include footage from other police units that responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Ruth Lowenkron, a disability rights lawyer who specializes in mental health issues, wanted to see it all. Working for New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a legal-advocacy nonprofit, she and her colleagues, along with activists, had begun pushing the city to find an alternative to using the police as first responders to people in crisis. On her second day on the job, a sergeant shot and killed a 66-year-old woman who had schizophrenia and was holding a baseball bat in her Bronx apartment. The department’s own investigators concluded that the sergeant escalated the situation and caused the shooting.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">Now, watching the video the department released of Richards’ shooting, Lowenkron feared that the same thing happened to him. The department’s edited footage showed the officers making a few attempts to connect with Richards early in the encounter. “What’s your name, man?” one officer asked. But they were also barking increasingly terse commands. “You are seconds away from getting shot,” one officer said. “Do you want to die?” A few minutes later, as one of them warned that Richards might have a gun, the officers fired.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Lowenkron filed a records request, certain that there was more to the story. In releasing the partial footage, the police commissioner had vowed that the “NYPD is committed to being as transparent as possible.” But nearly three weeks after her request, Lowenkron received a different message from one of the department’s records officers: “I must deny access to these records.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"><strong>Body-worn cameras</strong> were adopted by police departments across the country in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests in 2014, sparked when Michael Brown was killed by the police in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer who shot Brown was not equipped with a camera, and there was a dispute about what happened in the last moments of Brown’s life. Amid deep schisms over race, justice and policing, there was at least agreement that police interactions should be recorded. Brown’s mother pressed for the technology to become standard equipment. “Please,” she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WTc1DOlMrc&amp;t=242s">begged</a> Missouri legislators, “let police-worn body cameras be a voice of truth and transparency.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">President Barack Obama put the cameras at the center of his <a href="http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/12/01/building-trust-between-communities-and-local-police">plans</a> to restore trust in policing. Cities quickly began spending millions on the devices, expenditures that continue today for storage and software. Los Angeles has spent nearly $60 million since getting cameras in 2016. In Philadelphia, where footage is rarely released, the cameras have cost taxpayers about $20 million. New York City has spent more than $50 million. But whether citizens benefit from the cameras they’re paying for is often up to the police, who have often been able to keep footage hidden from the public in even the most extreme cases. In 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama, an officer unleashed his police dog on a burglary suspect without warning, severing the Black man’s femoral artery and killing him. The police and the city have <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2023/02/unlike-in-memphis-montgomery-police-fight-release-of-brutal-bodycam-footage.html">refused</a> to release footage for five years, arguing that it could cause “civil unrest” and that the officers could face “embarrassment.” But a lawyer for the man’s family, which is suing the city, got a copy of the transcript in the discovery process and entered it into the court record. “Did you get a bite?” an officer asked the one who had the dog, according to the document. “Sure did, heh, heh,” the K-9 officer responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">The secrecy undercuts the deterrent effect on officer behavior that many had presumed body cameras would produce. Three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck, body-camera video caught him kneeling on the necks of others. In 2017, Chauvin dragged a handcuffed Black woman out of her house, slammed her to the ground and then pressed his knee into her neck for nearly five minutes. Three months later, Chauvin hit a 14-year-old Black boy at least twice in the head with a heavy flashlight, choked him and pushed him against a wall. The boy cried out in pain and passed out. Chauvin pushed a knee into his neck for 15 minutes as the boy’s mother, reaching to help him, begged, “Please, please do not kill my son!”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">The footage was left in the control of a department where impunity reigned. Supervisors had access to the recordings yet cleared Chauvin’s conduct in both cases. Minneapolis fought against releasing the videos, even after Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal civil rights violations in one of the cases. A judge finally ordered the city and the police to release the tapes this April, six years after Chauvin abused the boy. “Chauvin should have been fired in 2017,” says Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented both of the victims. If the police had done that, “the city never burns. We’d have a downtown still. It’s a parade of horribles. All to keep something secret.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">A Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1587661/download">report</a> from this summer found that the secrecy and impunity was all part of a larger pattern in the Minneapolis Police Department. Shootings, beatings and other abuse had routinely been captured on video. But the department didn’t make the footage public or mete out punishment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">There was a similar dynamic in Memphis, Tennessee, where officers in a street-crimes unit regularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/memphis-police-scorpion.html">abused</a> residents. They wore body cameras but faced no consequences until the case of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death this January by officers in the unit, attracted national attention. The footage showed that some of the officers took their cameras off. Others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/07/us/memphis-officers-tyre-nichols.html">knew</a> they were being recorded and pummeled Nichols anyway. It was only after public outcry that the department took the rare step of releasing footage, which contradicted initial police accounts and led to state and federal charges for five officers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Some politicians have often quietly enabled obstacles to this kind of accountability. When South Carolina became the first state in the nation to require the use of cameras in 2015, Nikki Haley, the governor at the time, made the <a href="https://www.wistv.com/story/29289442/south-carolinas-body-camera-bill-is-now-law/">announcement</a> with the family of Walter Scott standing behind her. Scott was a Black man who, two months earlier, was stopped by the police for a broken taillight and was shot in the back and killed when he tried to run away. A witness filmed the shooting, and that video contradicted official police accounts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">“This is going to make sure Walter Scott did not die without us realizing that we have a problem,” Haley said as she signed the legislation. What the governor didn’t say was that the same law stipulated that footage from cameras is “not a public record subject to disclosure,” thus relieving police departments from any obligation to release it. And indeed, little footage has ever become public in South Carolina.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">In 2021, York County sheriff’s deputies responding to a call for a wellness check found a young man sitting in his pickup truck with his mother standing next to him. They fired at him nearly 50 times. The sheriff, who refused to release body-camera footage, said the man pointed a shotgun at deputies. When the man, who survived, obtained the footage after suing, it showed no such thing. So far this year, the police in South Carolina have killed at least 19 people. The police have released footage in only three of those cases. When we asked one department, the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office, why it had not, a spokesperson pointed to the law, writing, “We never release that footage.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">The pattern has become so common across the country — public talk of transparency followed by a deliberate undermining of the stated goal — that the policing-oversight expert Hans Menos, who led Philadelphia’s civilian police-oversight board until 2020, coined a term for it: the “body-cam head fake.” And there is no place that illustrates this as well as New York City, the home of the world’s largest municipal police force, some 36,000 officers strong.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"><strong>New York’s adoption</strong> of body-worn cameras started with a moment of unintentional inspiration. In 2013, Judge Shira Scheindlin was hearing testimony in a federal lawsuit in which multiple advocacy groups claimed that the Police Department’s aggressive “stop and frisk” policy was racially biased and unconstitutional. One day during the trial, an expert witness for the city mentioned a new tool for accountability — body-worn cameras — in passing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">“My head snapped when I heard the words,” Scheindlin recalled this year. “I thought, ‘That could be a useful remedy!’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Two months later, Scheindlin issued a historic <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/assets/Floyd-Remedy-Opinion-8-12-13.pdf">ruling</a> that New York’s stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional. She ordered the Police Department to begin piloting body-worn cameras, writing that they were “uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional harms at issue in this case.” Scheindlin laid out three ways the cameras would help: “First, they will provide a contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks.” She continued, “Second, the knowledge that an exchange is being recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties. Third, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is their word against the police.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">But in a preview of obstacles that would follow, the department was slow to roll out the devices, even as they were becoming common in other cities. More than two years after Scheindlin’s ruling, the department hired researchers at New York University to conduct a survey about what residents wanted from a body-camera project. The community’s answers were overwhelming and clear: transparency and disclosure.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Officers, however, wanted the opposite. They were concerned that the recordings would “show a different side of the story than what would otherwise be told,” according to a separate NYU survey. To Scheindlin and the plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk case, that was exactly the point.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">When the department released its policy in April 2017, it was clear whose opinions held more sway. No video would automatically become public. Anyone that requested it would have to go through an opaque, often slow-moving Freedom of Information process — in which the department itself would be the arbiter of what would be released (though the courts could review that decision).</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">The policy blunted the technology’s potential for accountability in other ways. Officers could decide when to start filming, instead of at the beginning of all interactions as the public wanted. And while the public had little access to footage, the police had privileged access: Officers who were the subjects of complaints would be allowed to watch the footage before having to give any statements — something that could allow them to tailor their accounts to the video.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">The policy was “so flawed that the pilot program may do little to protect New Yorkers’ civil rights,” Ian Head and Darius Charney of the Center for Constitutional Rights <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/dont-let-the-nypd-co-opt-body-cameras.html">wrote</a> in a guest essay in The New York Times. “Instead, it might shield police officers from accountability when they engage in misconduct.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Still, on April 27, 2017, Commissioner James O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio held a news conference at a precinct in Washington Heights to celebrate the rollout of body-worn cameras. Stepping up to the lectern, O’Neill said he was initially skeptical of the cameras but had become a believer. “I’m totally convinced now that this is the way forward,” he said. “These cameras have a great potential to de-escalate.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Then the mayor went to the lectern. Officers had long felt that de Blasio, a self-proclaimed progressive, was too supportive of Black Lives Matter protests and not sufficiently supportive of the police. That sentiment turned into rage when a man espousing hatred of the police murdered two officers in late 2014. Hundreds of police officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funerals. Ever since, de Blasio had been working to repair the relationship.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">“This is an historic day for New York City,” de Blasio said, with O’Neill by his side. “This is the first day of the era of body-worn cameras, and that means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability that will benefit everyone.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Five months later, officers killed Miguel Richards, making his case the first in which the potential of body-camera video would be tested. But Ruth Lowenkron, the public-interest attorney who filed a request for the footage, was getting little from the Police Department. After it rejected her initial request, she appealed the decision. The department sent her some redacted footage but again rejected her request for all of it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">Disclosing the full footage would be an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” the department wrote. Whose privacy — the dead man’s or the officers’ — was not explained. Releasing the full footage, the department insisted, could “endanger the life or safety of any person.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">The letter came from the department’s legal unit, led by its deputy commissioner, Larry Byrne, who was known for his fierce advocacy for the department. From the outset of the body-worn-camera program, Byrne made it clear that he was resistant to widespread release of footage. “They are not public records in the sense that, because the officer turns the camera on, they are now in the public domain,” Byrne <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/27/nypd-ready-to-hit-record-on-body-camera-pilot?ref=bklyner.com">told</a> NY1 in 2015. In fact, he insisted, “most of this footage” would never be made public.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Lowenkron kept requesting the Richards footage and kept getting rejected or sent redacted video. In July 2018, she and her colleagues decided to file a lawsuit in state court demanding the full footage. They even got a former Police Department lawyer, Stuart Parker, to help litigate the suit pro bono. The department’s various explanations for its denials “pissed me off,” Parker recalls. He retired from the department as an assistant commissioner in 2016, the year before cameras were widely rolled out. But he had been excited by their potential and was frustrated by the department’s kneejerk secrecy. “There’s a good side to the department,” he says, “but there’s always been a self-serving dark side to it too.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">In response to the suit, the department argued in legal filings that it had blurred the footage “in order to protect the privacy of both Richards and his family.” But Lowenkron and her team had obtained affidavits from Richards’ parents saying that the department never asked them whether they wanted the footage released or redacted. And what the Richardses wanted, they said, was for the full footage to be released to the public.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"><strong>Public disclosure</strong> of footage isn’t the only path to hold officers in New York accountable for misconduct. For 70 years, the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board had been vested with the responsibility to investigate New Yorkers’ allegations against the police. From the start, though, its powers were weak. The agency was actually part of the Police Department, and its board consisted of three deputy police commissioners. The department fought efforts over the years to make the agency independent. In the face of a plan in the mid-1960s to include civilians on the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the head of the largest police union, then called the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said, “I’m sick and tired of giving in to minority groups with their whims and their gripes and shouting.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">The agency eventually became independent in 1993 after stiff opposition months before from off-duty officers. Thousands of them — along with Rudy Giuliani, then a mayoral aspirant after losing the previous election — staged a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/the-forgotten-city-hall-riot.html">huge protest</a> outside City Hall, with many of them going on to block the Brooklyn Bridge. After the changes, the review board still relied on an often noncooperative Police Department for records, and its investigations frequently petered out amid competing accounts. And like many civilian oversight boards across the country, in the rare cases when it substantiated misconduct, it could only recommend discipline to the police commissioner, who could and often did ignore it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Many civilians, whom the board relied on to initiate complaints, had long grown skeptical of the agency’s ability to ensure that officer misconduct had consequences. But the advent of body-camera video promised to fundamentally change how the agency worked. For the first time, staff members would have an objective record of the incidents they investigated. That was Nicole Napolitano’s hope when she joined the review board as its new director of policy and advocacy in September 2017 — the same year body cameras were rolled out in New York and one week after officers killed Richards. “We talked about it in detail” at the agency, she says of the initial footage of the Richards shooting. “We thought, ‘Look at what body-worn cameras can show us.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Napolitano, who is married to a retired detective, knew it would be a challenge. As a senior policy manager in the Office of the Inspector General for the New York Police Department, she had seen how the department could simply ignore the recommendations in her reports. Napolitano hoped she would have more direct impact in her new, more senior position at the review board. But what she hadn’t appreciated was how much the police controlled the literal tools of their own oversight.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">As with most civilian boards across the country, the agency did not have its own access to footage. Like the public, it, too, had to rely on the cooperation of the department. To try to obtain footage, the board had to navigate a baroque multistep process. Written requests were submitted to a department “liaison” unit, which in turn forwarded them to the legal unit for review. Then the department had to locate the footage, which was a significant undertaking because it wasn’t cataloging the footage in any systematic way. Unlike in many other cities, the department’s cameras had no GPS location data. If a civilian making a complaint didn’t know an officer’s name or badge number, investigators and even the department could have a hard time finding footage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">Perhaps most problematic for Napolitano, though, was the fact that the review board’s investigators had to agree to a strict set of conditions before watching videos of incidents. If they spotted other, unrelated misconduct, they were not allowed to investigate it. “If you were setting up a system to be shitty,” one agency insider says, “this is the system you’d create.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">At times, the department’s animosity toward the board was palpable. Napolitano remembers one meeting in 2017 between board officials and Kerry Sweet, then a top official at the department’s legal bureau who helped oversee the body-camera rollout. As other police brass shuffled in, Sweet said they had missed a chance to “bomb the room” when only board officials were there, which would have “solved everything.” (Sweet, who has since retired, says he doesn’t recall saying that, but added, “On reflection, it should have been an airstrike.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">Napolitano and her colleagues noticed an even more troubling trend: The department would often tell the review board that the footage it requested didn’t exist — only for the civilian agency to later discover that wasn’t true. According to an analysis the agency put out in early 2020, this happened in nearly 1 of every 5 cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">Napolitano thought there was a straightforward solution to the department’s stonewalling: The review board should be able to directly log in to the department’s system where footage is stored. That’s how it worked with civilian oversight boards in a few other major American cities, including Chicago, which revamped civilian oversight after Laquan McDonald was killed in 2014 and the city tried to withhold footage that contradicted officers’ accounts. Chicago’s oversight board now not only has direct access to videos but also regularly releases footage publicly, and its investigators have used it to successfully push for officers to be fired for misconduct. Napolitano didn’t see a reason for it to be otherwise in New York. So in her first semiannual report, at the end of 2017, she noted the challenges of getting footage — and called on the city to give the review board direct access. Both the department and City Hall, Napolitano says, “freaked” out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">“It was a rough time for de Blasio when it came to public safety,” Napolitano added, referring to the mayor’s tenuous relationship with the police. “In a dispute between CCRB and NYPD, City Hall always chose the NYPD. Always.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">“I don’t agree,” de Blasio says. “The tension between the CCRB and the NYPD is natural and built-in. I decided each issue on the merits and according to my values.” He went on, “The blunter truth is when a progressive challenges the police culture and the police unions and the status quo of American policing, the left is not going to have their back. You’re not getting that thank-you card. And the right will viciously attack.”</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0"><strong>While the department</strong> fought Lowenkron and Napolitano on the release of body-camera footage, there was one group that had access to all of it and could use it to check for misconduct: the department’s own investigators. After every police shooting, detectives with the Force Investigation Division review the incident to see whether officers complied with department policy. The Richards case was the first time body-worn-camera footage could let them see what actually happened in a killing by officers. As investigators dug through the video and interviewed officers in the weeks and months after the shooting, they saw a far more complicated picture than the one the police commissioner painted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">As the tape began, one officer, Mark Fleming, beamed his flashlight into the far side of Richards’ nearly bare, unlit bedroom. Richards was standing perfectly still in the dark, seemingly catatonic, wearing a blue polo shirt and sunglasses and holding a knife in his left hand.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">Department guidelines for dealing with people in crisis who do not pose an immediate threat say officers should try to “isolate and contain” the person. “The primary duty of all members of the service is to preserve human life,” department policy states. Officers are also instructed to wait for a supervisor’s permission before trying to subdue someone in crisis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">At first, it appeared that the officers who encountered Richards were following their training. “Look, we could shut the door,” Officer Redmond Murphy suggested to his partner. But Fleming, who had served more years in the department, quickly rejected the idea. He kept telling Richards to drop the knife, and he radioed for an officer with a Taser.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">Two officers from the specially trained Emergency Services Unit, which deals with people experiencing mental health crises, arrived. Then Murphy said he thought he saw something, perhaps a gun, in Richards’ right hand, which was obscured behind a backpack on the bed. “Hold up,” one of the ESU officers told Fleming and Murphy before heading back downstairs to grab protective gear. “I don’t know if it’s a toy or a gun,” Murphy quickly added.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">As the specialists went downstairs, the officer with the Taser, Jesus Ramos, went upstairs and joined Fleming and Murphy outside Richards’ room. “Do you want to take him down now?” Ramos asked them. “Yeah,” they both answered.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">At nearly the same moment, a radio command came from headquarters, emphasizing department guidelines. “Isolate and contain,” the dispatcher told the officers. “Use nonlethal force whenever possible.” As Ramos lifted his Taser and stepped into the room, Fleming — who later said Richards was raising his arm — fired his gun. Murphy fired, too. It’s impossible to see that moment in the grainy, shaky footage. The clearest angle would most likely have been Fleming’s camera, but it was covered by his arm as he held his flashlight.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">Fleming and Murphy fired 16 times, hitting Richards seven times, including twice in the chest, rupturing his aorta. As gunshots rang out, the supervisor they were supposed to wait for arrived. (None of the officers responded to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">The internal investigators asked the officers to explain. “We kind of handle everything on our own,” Murphy offered. An internal investigator pressed Fleming about what had “situationally changed” and prompted the decision to “take him at that point.” Fleming said everything changed once his partner said Richards might have a gun. “I perceived that his intentions were lethal,” Fleming said. But his answers suggested that he hadn’t fully grasped Richards’ mental state. “Why would any sane person hide a fake gun?” Fleming asked.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">When the investigators asked why the two officers did not broadcast that Richards was an “EDP” — or an emotionally disturbed person — with a knife, as protocol dictates, Murphy told them he and Fleming had handled people in crisis before. Asked why they made the decision to use force, Murphy simply said, “We wanted to, like, end it.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">While the Force Investigation Division ultimately concluded that the officers had been “justified” in shooting — because they were facing an “individual armed with a knife and an imitation firearm” — the investigators also said that Fleming and Murphy should still be punished. Richards, their September 2018 internal report <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24216933-final-internal-investigation-report">noted</a>, “was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.” And the officers violated policy by not asking permission from their supervisor before they acted. The department’s full investigative record was first reported by the independent journalist Michael Hayes in his 2023 book, “The Secret Files.” The review recommended that the officers face disciplinary charges that could ultimately result in their firing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">But in New York, as in almost all cities in the United States, the police commissioner has <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-unchecked-power/">absolute power</a> over punishment. In March 2019, O’Neill, who had extolled the promise of body cameras just two years earlier, overruled his own investigators. He decided that neither Fleming nor Murphy would be punished for killing Richards. Instead, the commissioner docked them three vacation days for something else they did: stopping for pizza before responding to the call for the wellness check. (O’Neill did not respond to questions or requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">It would be another three months before anyone outside the department would see the full footage. That June, a New York judge ruled that the “public is vested with an inherent right to know” and ordered the department to turn over the recordings to Lowenkron’s organization.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">She received a package with a DVD a month later from the department. Bracing herself, she sat down to view it on her computer. The footage that the department publicly released cut off when the officers fired. Lowenkron now saw the aftermath: Richards collapsed to the floor, crumpled and bleeding in the same spot where he had been standing rigidly seconds before.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">“He’s still alive,” Fleming said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.1">“Holy shit,” Murphy replied. “Just fucking cuff him.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.2">The officers then flipped over Richards, severely injured, so roughly that his head could be heard bouncing off the floor.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">They searched around the room for the firearm they thought Richards had. Eventually, Fleming found a palm-size, silver-colored plastic toy gun. “It’s some fucking little thing,” he said. (The video does not show Richards holding the toy gun.) More than three minutes passed before anyone administered any type of aid to the dying man. It was an Emergency Services Unit specialist who retrieved medical equipment after hearing the shots.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">Outside the apartment building, more video recorded other officers milling about. One told a colleague, “They were just hurling fucking shots.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">Lowenkron was shocked. Officers had shot a young man and roughly handled him as he bled to death. “The utter disrespect,” Lowenkron says. “It was a horror movie.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">New York Lawyers for the Public Interest would go on to share the footage with journalists. It would also use the footage in a webinar for mental health advocates in November 2020. “The point,” Lowenkron told me, “was to get more people engaged on this issue: transforming New York and this country’s response to people in crisis.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">But by then, for another man in distress, it was too late.</p>

<hr>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.1"><strong>In April 2019,</strong> one month after O’Neill decided against punishing the officers for the Richards shooting, another officer shot and killed a man named Kawaski Trawick.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.0">The circumstances were remarkably similar to those in the Richards case. Trawick was also a young Black man who lived in the Bronx and was experiencing a mental health crisis in his own apartment. He was also holding a knife when the police arrived. And he was also shot soon afterward. At the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Napolitano was immediately struck by the parallels: “I remember reading the headline on Trawick and thinking, ‘Didn’t I read this already?’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">This time, though, the victim’s family filed a complaint with the review board, providing an opening for civilian investigators to use body-worn-camera footage to make a case that the department and others couldn’t ignore.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">But despite repeated requests over many months, the department wouldn’t share the footage — or any other records — with the review board, leaving the oversight agency effectively unable to begin its own investigation of the case. The refusal was in line with the department’s longstanding practice to withhold footage from the board until the department’s internal investigation was over, a process that often takes more than a year. Such delays can effectively torpedo the review board’s investigations: Under New York civil-service law, any disciplinary cases against police officers must be brought within 18 months of the incident.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">In the Trawick case, the review board obtained the full body-camera video in January 2021 — more than a year and a half after the killing — and only after a state judge ordered the department to hand it over to Lowenkron’s organization, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, which had sued for it. The judge determined that the department had been withholding the footage <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/judge-says-nypd-illegally-withheld-footage-in-police-shootings">“in bad faith.”</a></p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">What it <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/it-wasnt-the-first-time-the-nypd-killed-someone-in-crisis-for-kawaski-trawick-it-only-took-112-seconds">showed</a> was even more damning than what was captured in the Richards shooting. As the police entered his apartment, Trawick demanded to know, “Why are you in my home?” One officer, Herbert Davis, who was Black and more experienced, then tried to stop his white junior counterpart, Brendan Thompson, from using force. “We ain’t gonna tase him,” Davis said in the video.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Thompson didn’t listen. Instead, he fired his Taser at Trawick, sending roughly 50,000 volts pulsing through him. As Trawick started rushing toward the officers, Thompson lifted his gun and prepared to fire. “No, no — don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t,” Davis said, pushing his partner’s arm down. But Thompson fired four shots, hitting Trawick twice and killing him almost instantly, 112 seconds after they arrived at the apartment. (Davis and Thompson did not reply to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">There was also troubling footage of the aftermath of the shooting. Officers swarmed outside Trawick’s apartment. “Who’s injured?” a sergeant asked. Two officers replied in near unison: “Nobody. Just a perp.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">With all that in hand, the review board completed its investigation in June 2021. The agency, through one of the few powers it had gained over the years, can file and prosecute disciplinary cases against officers — which triggers a Police Department trial, after which a departmental judge sends a provisional decision to the police commissioner, who makes the final call.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">This September, the police judge overseeing the Trawick case recommended that there should be no discipline. Her reason had nothing to do with the shooting itself; in fact, the judge <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/09/25/no-discipline-recommended-cops-killing-kawaski-trawick/">wrote</a> that she had “serious doubts” about the decisions of the officer who killed Trawick. But the review board, she said, had failed to file charges within the 18-month statute of limitations, as outlined under state law. In the end, the department’s refusal to give the footage to the review board had effectively run out the clock on any chance the officers would be punished.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">“That should not be tolerated,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “Both CCRB and NYPD are city agencies. This is something the mayor needs to resolve.”</p>

<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="107.0"><strong>In the wake of</strong> George Floyd’s murder in 2020, huge demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality rolled across the country and the world. It was a global reckoning brought on by footage — the video, recorded by a teenager on her smartphone for more than eight minutes, showing Derek Chauvin ending Floyd’s life.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">Napolitano and her team at the review board had collected data showing how footage could make a difference in New York too. Access to body-camera footage roughly doubled the likelihood that agency investigators would be able to decide a case on its merits rather than dismiss it as inconclusive. But the backlog was growing. That May, the board filed 212 requests with the Police Department for body-worn-camera footage — and the department sent only 33 responses. (While the pandemic slowed the work of all city agencies, the backlog predated it.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">“The withholding of footage stops investigations and prevents the CCRB from providing adequate and meaningful oversight of the NYPD,” an internal agency memo <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6980787-CCRB-Memo-on-Body-Cam-Footage.html">warned</a>. “The situation for New York City oversight of the police has steadily grown worse during the duration of a BWC program intended primarily to aid oversight.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">Napolitano campaigned internally for a law that would take away the department’s absolute control over footage and give the review board its own access. That November, she was let go, along with three other staff members who had sent pointed emails and memos about the department’s withholding of footage. The four filed a lawsuit claiming that their firing violated their First Amendment rights and received an undisclosed settlement. A review-board spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency has “publicly and repeatedly called on legislators to support the fight for direct access. No employee has ever been fired for supporting direct access to BWC footage.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">This spring, the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, and the New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams, sponsored a bill that would give the review board direct access to footage so that it wouldn’t be beholden to the department for cooperation during investigations. “There are difficult split-second decisions that have to happen” in policing, Williams told me. “But if we’re not able to look at the same thing, if we have to take the word of the NYPD, that doesn’t make this conversation any easier.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">The Police Department has opposed the bill. A department official insisted at a City Council hearing in March that the department “does not fear transparency.” But the official argued that it would be an “insurmountable obstacle” to give the review board direct access while following state confidentiality laws. The bill has been stalled for months.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">The city, meanwhile, paid out at least $121 million in settlements last year for lawsuits alleging misconduct by police officers — the highest total in five years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">With footage remaining in the control of the Police Department, body-worn cameras have made little difference to the public. This year, a federal court monitor wrote a scathing <a href="https://www.nypdmonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NST-Report.pdf">report</a> about persistent problems with stop-and-frisk, the unconstitutional policing tactic that prompted Scheindlin to order the department to adopt body cameras a decade ago. The monitor found that contrary to Scheindlin’s expectations, police supervisors weren’t using footage to flag misconduct. In a sample of cases the monitor looked at, supervisors reviewing footage of stop-and-frisk encounters concluded that 100% of the cases they looked at were proper stops. The court monitor reviewed the same footage and found that 37% of the stops were unconstitutional.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">“It was an experiment,” Scheindlin says, one that didn’t anticipate issues like control over footage. Scheindlin, who stepped down from the bench in 2016, says she now believes that the Police Department should no longer be the sole custodian of its own video. “That troubles me,” she says. “It should always be somebody independent.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">In interviews with a half-dozen former commanders and high-level officials, most of whom were involved in the body-camera program itself, they said that despite its public pronouncements, the department hasn’t committed to using footage for accountability. “Body cams are essential, if done right,” says a high-ranking commander who just retired and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in law enforcement. “They are a game changer.” He added, “If there’s a problem, you flag — and potentially there’s discipline. But that’s not happening in most cases.” Instead, he says, body cameras have become “an exercise in just work they have to do. It’s a culture thing.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">Rudy Hall has a particularly useful vantage point. He was part of the team that rolled out the body cameras, visiting police departments around the country to see how they were using the technology, and has gone on to work for the federal monitor overseeing the department’s compliance with Scheindlin’s now-decade-old order on stop-and-frisk. “I watch a lot of body-cam videos,” Hall told me. “I have absolutely seen supervisors approve problematic conduct.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">“Body-worn cameras have not been exploited the way they should be,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early-warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes. But there weren’t a lot of discussions about it. The NYPD needs to do a lot better.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">One of the most comprehensive studies of the use of body cameras, a 2019 meta-analysis led by researchers at George Mason University, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331981847_Research_on_body-worn_cameras">recommended</a> that police departments consider using footage the way sports teams use game tape, to regularly review and improve performance. That’s essentially what the New Orleans Police Department did after the U.S. Department of Justice put it under federal oversight about a decade ago in response to the police killings of several Black men and persistent police violence. Body cameras were a “critical engine for us to continuously evaluate performance,” says Danny Murphy, who ran a unit at the department overseeing compliance with the federal mandate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">Four auditors were hired to join the police force and comb through footage. They looked to make sure that officers were using their cameras and that supervisors were flagging any problematic behavior. “If officers know they’re being viewed, if supervisors know they’re being reviewed, it creates a pressure for accountability,” says Murphy, who left the department four years ago. A 2020 report from the city’s civilian oversight agency — which has direct access to footage — noted a reduction in both the use of force and citizen complaints, which the department attributed to “the use of the body-worn cameras and the increased scrutiny and oversight these cameras provide leadership.” The police in New Orleans also regularly and quickly release video from shootings and other major incidents. But in the end, it’s the police chief who has the final say on discipline.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">During his tenure at the New York Police Department, Schlanger had, in fact, started a kind of internal oversight system similar to the one in New Orleans. Schlanger and other senior officials would meet with each of the department’s 77 precincts every six months and look at body-camera footage to identify problematic trends and officers. “It was CompStat for constitutional policing,” Schlanger says, referring to the department’s data-heavy program for tracking crime. “If we saw a precinct doing poorly, we’d work to help them. It made a difference.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">The department quietly ended the review program last year.</p>

<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="124.0"><strong>A civil suit on behalf</strong> of Miguel Richards’ estate was filed against the city in 2018. New York is seeking the dismissal of the case. A judge has been considering the request for two and a half years. “I want answers,” his mother told me, “and haven’t been able to get them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">The three officers involved in the Richards shooting were honored in 2018 by the largest New York police union, the Police Benevolent Association, which gave them its Finest of the Finest award for “extremely brave and tactically sound action” in the Richards shooting, noting that “the officers had no choice but to open fire.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">The officers were later deposed in the lawsuit. One of them, Mark Fleming, said in his testimony in September 2020 that he had learned a lesson: that the Emergency Services Unit — whose help he told department investigators he didn’t need — is in fact better equipped and trained to deal with situations that involve people having a mental health crisis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">It’s not clear what, if any, lessons the department itself has taken in. Since Richards’ death in 2017, when cameras were widely rolled out, officers have killed at least 11 people in crisis. There is no evidence that officers have been punished in any of the cases.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">On a Sunday morning in the Bronx this spring, there was another shooting. Santo de la Cruz called a city emergency line. His son, 42-year-old Raul de la Cruz, was in the middle of a schizophrenic episode and had posted a disturbing video on Facebook that morning. Wearing camouflage clothing and a hat with a patch of an Israeli flag, Raul complained about racist police officers. His father called 311, avoiding 911 because he was afraid of what would happen if the police showed up. “I thought they would send someone capable of dealing with a situation like that,” he says in Spanish. “Because I was calling for a sick person, not to send the police to shoot him up.” But it was the police who arrived, with body cameras rolling. And Raul was holding a knife.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">The officers shot him <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-cops-shoot-critically-injure-man-having-medical-episode-in-bronx">28 seconds</a> after arriving. He was hospitalized for more than a month before being released, having lost a kidney and part of his liver. A department commander cited the body-camera footage when he gave a brief news conference the day of the shooting to describe what happened. “This situation was fast, volatile and dangerous,” he said. The officers’ “quick response saved at least one civilian and protected themselves.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="131.0">But the department has not released the footage or commented in the eight months since.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">Lowenkron’s colleagues at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest have once again requested the video, so far to no avail. The department has also withheld the footage from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, per the practice of sharing records with the agency only after its own investigation is done.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="134.0">On Dec. 5, weeks after we sent questions to the department about that practice, the department signed a memorandum of understanding with the board to send footage to it within 90 days of a request.</p>

          <p>This project aimed to create a visual aid that helped players learn how to think about the game, not just how to play it. By breaking down the game mechanics into smaller components, I designed cards that acted as a small multiple, allowing players to make comparisons between fighting moves to better understand them. I engaged with the Tekken subreddit community for feedback. This was the first time in my process where I designed something so openly and with the public.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Tekken is a Japanese fighting game that has been around since the late 80’s. It continues to boast a strong community of players and remains competitive with other leading titles on the market. If you’ve never heard of Tekken before, the video below will give you an idea of what it’s like:</p>

<p>

</p>

<p><strong>Problem being solved:</strong> Many players learning the game have a hard time understanding how to build tactics and develop a gameplan. Many existing guides online teach players the technical aspects of the game, but fail to provide enough context of how certain moves work in gameplay. Fighting moves are usually taught in isolation and not relative to each other. This project aims to help players compare different moves to better understand them.</p>
<p><strong>Target audience:</strong> Beginners who have some familiarity of Tekken and have already chosen a character to specialize in.</p>
<p><strong>Key objective:</strong> To design a physical visual aid for players to use while learning Tekken. Players are equipped to learn one character and develop a better understanding on how to think about fighting games.</p>

      NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft has experienced a computer glitch that’s causing a bit of a communication breakdown between the 46-year-old probe and its mission team on Earth.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8c0009356hlywn77g3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Engineers are currently trying to solve the issue as the aging spacecraft explores uncharted cosmic territory along the outer reaches of the solar system.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8c000a356h1cbh0sch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Voyager 1 is currently the farthest spacecraft from Earth at about 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) away, while its twin Voyager 2 has traveled more than 12 billion miles (20 billion kilometers) from our planet. Both are in interstellar space and are the only spacecraft ever to operate beyond the heliosphere, the sun’s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond the orbit of Pluto.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8c000b356hdvggcggb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Initially designed to last five years, the Voyager probes are the two longest-operating spacecraft in history. Their exceptionally long lifespans mean that both spacecraft have provided additional insights about our solar system and beyond after achieving their preliminary goals of flying by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune decades ago.
  </p>

      But their unexpectedly lengthy journeys have not been without challenges.

      Voyager 1 has three onboard computers, including a flight data system that collects information from the spacecraft’s science instruments and bundles it with engineering data that reflects the current health status of Voyager 1. Mission control on Earth receives that data in binary code, or a series of ones and zeroes.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8c000e356ht0v7aess@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      But Voyager 1’s flight data system now appears to be stuck on auto-repeat, in a scenario reminiscent of the film “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/health/groundhog-day-movie-lessons-covid-wellness/index.html">Groundhog Day</a>.”

      The mission team first noticed the issue November 14, when the flight data system’s telecommunications unit began sending back a repeating pattern of ones and zeroes, like it was trapped in a loop.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8e000h356hm5pq8yw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      While the spacecraft can still receive and carry out commands transmitted from the mission team, a problem with that telecommunications unit means no science or engineering data from Voyager 1 is being returned to Earth.
  </p>

      The Voyager team sent commands over the weekend for the spacecraft to restart the flight data system, but no usable data has come back yet, according to <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2023/12/12/engineers-working-to-resolve-issue-with-voyager-1-computer/" target="_blank">NASA</a>.

      NASA engineers are currently trying to gather more information about the underlying cause of the issue before determining the next steps to possibly correct it, said Calla Cofield, media relations specialist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission. The process could take weeks.

      The last time Voyager 1 experienced a similar, but not identical, issue with the flight data system was in 1981, and the current problem does not appear to be connected to other glitches the spacecraft has experienced in recent years, Cofield said.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8e000l356hq6tc0yo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      As both Voyager probes experience new trials, mission team members have only the original manuals written decades ago to consult, and those couldn’t account for the challenges the spacecraft are facing as they age.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8e000m356h5moakwiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The Voyager team wants to consider all of the potential implications before sending more commands to the spacecraft to make sure its operations aren’t impacted in an unexpected way.
  </p>

      Voyager 1 is so far away that it takes 22.5 hours for commands sent from Earth to reach the spacecraft. Additionally, the team must wait 45 hours to receive a response.
  </p>

      As the aging twin Voyager probes continue exploring the cosmos, the team has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/29/world/voyager-2-operations-scn/index.html">slowly turned off instruments</a> on these “senior citizens” to conserve power and extend their missions, Voyager’s project manager Suzanne Dodd <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/10/world/nasa-voyager-probes-power-scn/index.html">previously told CNN</a>.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8f000q356h8lrze2fb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Along the way, both spacecraft have encountered <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/world/nasa-voyager-1-issue-scn/index.html">unexpected issues</a> and dropouts, including a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/03/world/nasa-voyager-2-antenna-upgrade-scn-trnd/index.html">seven-month period</a> in 2020 when Voyager 2 couldn’t communicate with Earth. In August, the mission team used a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/04/world/nasa-voyager-2-communications-restored-scn/index.html">long-shot “shout” technique</a> to restore communications with Voyager 2 after a command inadvertently oriented the spacecraft’s antenna in the wrong direction.
  </p>

      While the team hopes to restore the regular stream of data sent back by Voyager 1, the mission’s main value lies in its long duration, Cofield said. For example, scientists want to see how particles and magnetic fields change as the probes fly farther away from the heliosphere. But that dataset will be incomplete if Voyager 1 can’t return information as it continues on.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clq43hn8f000s356hv20dvhsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The mission team has been creative with its strategies for extending the power supply on both spacecraft in recent years to allow their record-breaking missions to continue.

      “The Voyagers are performing far, far past their prime missions and longer than any other spacecraft in history,” Cofield said. “So, while the engineering team is working hard to keep them alive, we also fully expect issues to arise.”
