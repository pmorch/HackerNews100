            <span>Abstract:</span>In 1953, Enrico Fermi criticized Dyson's model by quoting Johnny von Neumann: "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk." So far, there have been several attempts to fit an elephant using four parameters, but as the problem has not been well-defined, the current methods do not completely satisfy the requirements. This paper defines the problem and presents an attempt.

Managing this rapid growth while meeting the ever-increasing data demands of critical product and analytics use cases, especially our recent Notion AI features, meant building and scaling Notion’s data lake. Here’s how we did it. </p><p>Everything you see in Notion—texts, images, headings, lists, database rows, pages, etc—despite differing front-end representations and behaviors, is modeled as a "block" entity in the back end and stored in the Postgres database with a consistent structure, schema, and associated metadata (learn more about <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion">Notion's data model</a>).</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data Lake initial image" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4rrziPDb4W1MWIJd9DU75F/ea42dabcf0bd96470958a47e4f80c1d2/Data_Lake_0.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Everything in Notion is a block, and these blocks are made up of data.

At the start of 2021 we had more than 20 billion block rows in Postgres, and this figure has since grown to more than two hundred billion blocks—a data volume of hundreds of terabytes, even when compressed.</p><div><p>To manage this data growth while enhancing the user experience, we’ve strategically expanded our database infrastructure from one Postgres instance to a more complex sharded architecture. We began in 2021 by <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sharding-postgres-at-notion">horizontally sharding our Postgres database into 32 physical instances, each comprising 15 logical shards</a>, and continued in 2023 by <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/the-great-re-shard">increasing the number of physical instances to 96, with five logical shards per instance</a>.

As the demands on both online and offline data increased, we realized it was essential to build a dedicated data infrastructure to handle offline data without interfering with online traffic.</p><div><p id="notion’s-data-warehouse-architecture-in-2021"><h2><span>Notion’s data warehouse architecture in 2021</span></h2></p></div><p>In 2021, we initiated this dedicated data infrastructure with a simple ELT (Extract, Load, and Transform) pipeline that used the third-party tool Fivetran to ingest data from the Postgres WAL (Write Ahead Log) to Snowflake and set up 480 hourly-run connectors for the 480 shards to write to the same number of raw Snowflake tables. We then merged these tables into a single large table for analytics, reporting, and machine learning use cases.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 2" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4eEtecJis4Q6Pb3PjC9yzf/3eeb2c4c820328192cde31262ec6ff99/Data_Lake_2.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4eEtecJis4Q6Pb3PjC9yzf/3eeb2c4c820328192cde31262ec6ff99/Data_Lake_2.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/4eEtecJis4Q6Pb3PjC9yzf/3eeb2c4c820328192cde31262ec6ff99/Data_Lake_2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></figure></div> <div><p><h3 id="scaling-challenges"><br>Scaling challenges</h3></p></div><p>As our Postgres data grew, we encountered several scaling challenges.</p><p><strong>Operability</strong></p><p>The overhead of monitoring and managing 480 Fivetran connectors, along with re-syncing them during Postgres re-sharding, upgrade, and maintenance periods, became extremely high, creating a significant on-call burden for team members.</p><p><strong>Speed, data freshness and cost</strong> </p><p>Ingesting data to Snowflake became slower and more costly, primarily due to Notion's unique update-heavy workload. Notion users update existing blocks (texts, headings, titles, bullet lists, database rows, etc) much more often than they add new ones. This causes block data to be predominantly update-heavy—90% of Notion upserts are updates. Most data warehouses, including Snowflake, are optimized for insert-heavy workloads, which makes it increasingly challenging for them to ingest block data.</p><p><strong>Use case support</strong></p><p>Data transformation logic became more complex and heavy, surpassing the capabilities of the standard SQL interface offered by off-the-shelf data warehouses. </p><div><ul><li><p>One important use case is constructing denormalized views of Notion’s block data for key products (e.g., AI and Search). Permission data, for example, ensures that only the right people can read or change a block (<a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/data-model-behind-notion">this blog</a> discusses Notion’s block permission model). But a block’s permission isn’t statically stored in the associated Postgres—it has to be constructed on the fly via expensive tree traversal computation.</p></li><li><p>In the following example, <code>block_1</code>, <code>block_2</code>, and <code>block_3 </code>inherit permissions from their immediate parents (<code>page_3 </code>and  <code>page_2</code>) and ancestors (<code>page_1 </code>and <code>workspace_a). </code>To build permission data for each of these blocks, we must traverse its ancestor tree all the way up to the root (<code>workspace_a</code>) in order to ensure completeness. With hundreds of billions of blocks whose ancestor depths ranged from a few to dozens, this kind of compute was very costly and would simply time out in Snowflake.</p></li></ul></div><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 3" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=1920,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png 1x, https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png 2x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/MydQ7FIKshSG7yHcqUBBh/730a7be57bebd5670132b0aa404cfbc2/Data_Lake_3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Constructing permission data for each block requires traversing the entire ancestor tree.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p>Because of these challenges, we started to explore building our data lake.</p><div><p id="building-and-scaling-notion’s-in-house-data-lake"><h2><span>Building and scaling Notion’s in-house data lake</span></h2></p></div><p>Here were our objectives for building an in-house data lake:</p><div><ul><li><p>Establish a data repository capable of storing both raw and processed data at scale.</p></li><li><p>Enable fast, scalable, operable, and cost-efficient data ingestion and computation for any workload—especially Notion's update-heavy block data.</p></li><li><p>Unlock AI, Search, and other product use cases that require denormalized data.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, while our data lake is a big step forward, it's important to clarify what it's not intended to do:</p><div><ul><li><p>Completely replace Snowflake. We’ll continue to benefit from Snowflake’s operational and ecosystem ease by using it for most other workloads, particularly those that are insert-heavy and don’t require large-scale denormalized tree traversal.</p></li><li><p>Completely replace Fivetran. We’ll continue taking advantage of Fivetran’s effectiveness with non-update heavy tables, small dataset ingestion, and diverse third-party data sources and destinations.</p></li><li><p>Support online use cases that require second-level or stricter latency.

We ingest incrementally updated data from Postgres to Kafka using Debezium CDC connectors, then use <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/">Apache Hudi</a>, an open-source data processing and storage framework, to write these updates from Kafka to S3. With this raw data we can then do transformation, denormalization (e.g., tree traversal and permission data construction for each block), and enrichment, then store the processed data in S3 again or in downstream systems to serve analytics and reporting needs, as well as AI, Search, and other product requirements.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 4" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/47gLr3QRSWQ9MpPbvE54Nf/2d232b1d4a0ea226f07852d6d824b490/Data_Lake_4.png 1x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/47gLr3QRSWQ9MpPbvE54Nf/2d232b1d4a0ea226f07852d6d824b490/Data_Lake_4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Notion’s in-house data lake is built on Debezium CDC connector, Kafka, Hudi, Spark, and S3.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p>Next we’ll describe and illustrate the design principles and decisions we arrived at after extensive research, discussion, and prototyping work.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-1-choosing-a-data-repository-and-lake"><strong>Design decision 1: Choosing a data repository and lake</strong></h3></p></div><p>Our first decision was to use S3 as a data repository and lake to store all raw and processed data, and position data warehouse and other product-facing data stores such as ElasticSearch, Vector Database, Key-Value store, etc as its downstream. We made this decision for two reasons:</p><div><ul><li><p>It aligned with Notion’s AWS tech stack, e.g., our Postgres database is based on AWS RDS and its export-to-S3 feature (described in later sections) allows us to easily bootstrap tables in S3.</p></li><li><p>S3 has proven its ability to store large amounts of data and support various data processing engines (like Spark) at low cost.</p></li></ul></div><p>By offloading heavy ingestion and compute workloads to S3 and only ingesting highly cleaned and business-critical data to Snowflake and product-facing data stores, we significantly improved data compute scalability and speed and reduced cost.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-2-choosing-our-processing-engine"><strong>Design decision 2: Choosing our processing engine</strong></h3></p></div><p>We chose Spark as our main data processing engine because as an open-source framework, it could be rapidly set up and evaluated to verify that it met our data transformation needs. Spark has four key benefits:</p><div><ul><li><p>Spark’s wide range of built-in functions and UDFs (User Defined Functions) beyond SQL enable complex data processing logics like tree traversal and block data denormalization, as described above.</p></li><li><p>It offers a user-friendly PySpark framework for most lighter use cases, and advanced Scala Spark for high-performance, heavy data processing.</p></li><li><p>It processes large-scale data (e.g., billions of blocks and hundreds of terabytes) in a distributed manner, and exposes extensive configurations, which allows us to fine-tune our control over partitioning, data skewness, and resource allocation. It also enables us to break down complex jobs into smaller tasks and optimize resourcing for each task, which helps us achieve reasonable runtime without over-provisioning or wasting resources.</p></li><li><p>Finally, Spark’s open-source nature offers cost-efficiency benefits.</p></li></ul></div><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-3-preference-for-incremental-ingestion-over-snapshot-dump">Design decision 3: Preference for incremental ingestion over snapshot dump</h3></p></div><p>After finalizing our data lake storage and processing engine, we explored solutions for ingesting Postgres data to S3. We wound up considering two approaches: incremental ingestion of changed data and periodic full snapshots of Postgres tables. In the end, based on performance and cost comparisons, we opted for a hybrid design:</p><div><ul><li><p><strong>During normal operations, incrementally ingest and continuously apply changed Postgres data to S3.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>In rare cases, take a full Postgres snapshot once to bootstrap tables in S3.</strong></p></li></ul></div><p>The incremental approach ensures fresher data at lower cost and with minimal delay (a few minutes to a couple hours, depending on table size). Taking a full snapshot and dumping to S3, by contrast, takes more than 10 hours and costs twice as much, so we do so infrequently, when bootstraping new tables in S3.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-4-streamlining-incremental-ingestion"><strong>Design decision 4: Streamlining incremental ingestion</strong></h3></p></div><div><ul><li><p><strong>Kafka CDC Connector for Postgres → to → Kafka</strong></p></li></ul></div><p>We chose the Kafka Debezium CDC (Change Data Capture) connector to publish incrementally changed Postgres data to Kafka, similar to Fivetran’s data ingestion method. We chose it together with Kafka for their scalability, ease of setup, and close integration with our existing infrastructure. </p><div><ul><li><p><strong>Hudi for Kafka → to → S3</strong></p></li></ul></div><div><p>To ingest the incremental data from Kafka to S3, we considered three excellent data lake and ingestion solutions: <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/">Apache Hudi</a>, <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/">Apache Iceberg</a>, and <a href="https://delta.io/">DataBricks Delta Lake</a>. In the end we chose Hudi for its excellent performance with our update-heavy workload and its open-source nature and native <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+39+Deltastreamer+source+for+debezium+CDC+logs">integration with Debezium CDC messages</a>.</p></div><p>Iceberg and Delta Lake, on the other hand, weren’t optimized for our update-heavy workload when we considered them in 2022. Iceberg also lacked an out-of-box solution that understands Debezium messages; Delta Lake does have one, but it isn’t open source. We would have had to implement our own Debezium consumer if we’d gone with either of those solutions.</p><div><p><h3 id="design-decision-5-ingest-raw-data-before-processing"><strong>Design decision 5: Ingest raw data before processing</strong></h3></p></div><p>Finally, we decided to ingest raw Postgres data to S3 without on-the-fly processing in order to establish a single source of truth and simplify debugging across the entire data pipeline. Once raw data is in S3, we then do transformation, denormalization, enrichment, and other types of data processing. We store intermediate data in S3 again and only ingest highly cleaned, structured, and business-critical data to downstream systems for analytics, reporting, and product needs.</p><div><p id="scaling-and-operating-our-data-lake"><h2><span>Scaling and operating our data lake</span></h2></p></div><p>We experimented with many detailed setups in order to tackle the scalability challenges associated with Notion’s ever-increasing data volume. Here's what we tried and how it went:</p><p><strong>1. CDC connector and Kafka setup</strong></p><p>We set up one Debezium CDC connector per Postgres host and deploy them in an AWS EKS cluster. Because of the maturity of Debezium and EKS management and Kafka's scalability, we’ve only had to upgrade the EKS and Kafka clusters a few times in the past two years. As of May 2024, it smoothly handles tens of MB/sec of Postgres row changes.</p><p>We also configure one Kafka topic per Postgres table and let all connectors consuming from 480 shards write to the same topic for that table. This setup significantly reduced the complexity of maintaining 480 topics for each table and simplified downstream Hudi ingestion to S3, significantly reducing operational overhead.</p><p><strong>2. Hudi setup</strong></p><p>We used <a href="https://hudi.apache.org/docs/0.10.0/hoodie_deltastreamer/">Apache Hudi Deltastreamer</a>, a Spark-based ingestion job, to consume Kafka messages and replicate the state of Postgres table in S3. After several rounds of performance tuning, we established a fast, scalable ingestion setup to ensure data freshness. This setup provides a delay of just a few minutes for most tables, and up to two hours for the largest one, the block table (see graphic below).</p><div><ul><li><p>We use the default COPY_ON_WRITE Hudi table type with UPSERT operation, which suits our update-heavy workload.</p></li><li><p>To manage data more effectively and minimize write amplification (i.e., the number of files updated per batched ingestion run), we fine-tuned three configurations: </p><div><ul><li><p>Partition/shard data using the same Postgres shard scheme, i.e., the  <code>hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field: db_schema_source_partition</code> config. This partitions the S3 dataset into 480 shards, from <code>shard0001 </code>to <code>shard0480,</code> making it more likely that a batch of incoming updates map to the same set of files from the same shard.</p></li><li><p>Sort data based on the last updated time (event_lsn), i.e., the <code>source-ordering-field: event_lsn</code> config. This is based on our observation that more recent blocks are more likely to get updated, which allows us to prune files with only outdated blocks.</p></li><li><p>Set the index type to be bloom filter, i.e., the  <code>hoodie.index.type: BLOOM</code></p><p> config, to further optimize the workload.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div role="button" aria-label="Lightbox öffnen"><figure><p><span><span></span><img alt="Data lake image 5" role="img" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" srcset="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/2lSK1kBy9dHNg9UF5HU4gs/72ddf2a3cf506ccaed49ce75af8d536f/Data_Lake_5.png 1x" src="https://www.notion.so/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,width=3840,quality=100/https://images.ctfassets.net/spoqsaf9291f/2lSK1kBy9dHNg9UF5HU4gs/72ddf2a3cf506ccaed49ce75af8d536f/Data_Lake_5.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><p>Hudi Deltastreamer setup for the block table.</p></figcaption></figure></div> <p><strong>3. Spark data processing setup</strong>For the majority of our data processing jobs we utilize PySpark, whose relatively low learning curve makes it accessible to many team members. For more complex jobs such as tree traversal and denormalization, we leverage Spark’s superior performance in several key areas:</p><div><ul><li><p>We benefit from the performance efficiency of the Scala Spark.</p></li><li><p>We manage data more effectively by handling large and small shards separately (remember we kept the same 480 shards scheme in S3 to be consistent with Postgres); small shards have their entire data loaded into the Spark task container memory for fast processing, whereas large shards that exceed memory capacity are managed through disk reshuffling.</p></li><li><p>We utilize multi-threading and parallel processing to speed up processing of 480 shards, allowing us to optimize runtime and efficiency.</p></li></ul></div><p><strong>4. Bootstrap setup</strong></p><p>Here's how we bootstrap new tables:</p><div><ul><li><p>We first set up Debezium Connector to ingest Postgres changes to Kafka.</p></li><li><p>Starting from timestamp <code>t</code>, we kick off a AWS RDS-provided export-to-S3 job to save the latest snapshot of Postgres tables to S3. We then create a Spark job to read those data from S3 and write them to the Hudi table format.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we ensure that all changes made during the snapshotting process are captured by setting up Deltastreamer to read from Kafka messages from <code>t</code>. This step is crucial for maintaining data completeness and integrity.</p></li></ul></div><p>Thanks to the scalability of Spark and Hudi, these three steps usually complete within 24 hours, allowing us to perform re-bootstrap with manageable time to accommodate new table asks and Postgres upgrade and re-sharding operations.</p><div><p id="the-payoff-less-money-more-time-stronger-infrastructure-for-ai"><h2><span>The payoff: less money, more time, stronger infrastructure for AI</span></h2></p></div><p>We started developing our data lake infrastructure in the spring of 2022 and completed it by that fall. Due to the infra's inherently scalable nature, we were able to continually optimize and expand the Debezium EKS clusters, Kafka clusters, Deltastreamer, and Spark job to keep up with Notion's 6-to-12 month data doubling rate without significant overhauls. The payoff was significant:</p><div><ul><li><p>Moving several large, crucial Postgres datasets (some of them tens of TB large) to data lake gave us a net savings of over a million dollars for 2022 and proportionally higher savings in 2023 and 2024.</p></li><li><p>For these datasets, the end-to-end ingestion time from Postgres to S3 and Snowflake decreased from more than a day to a few minutes for small tables and up to a couple of hours for large ones. Re-syncs, when necessary, can be completed within 24 hours without overloading live databases.</p></li><li><p>Most importantly, the changeover unlocked massive data storage, compute, and freshness savings from a variety of analytics and product asks, enabling the successful rollout of Notion AI features in 2023 and 2024. Stay tuned for a detailed post on our Search and AI Embedding RAG Infra built on top of the data lake!</p></li></ul></div><p>We’d like to thank OneHouse and the Hudi open source community for their tremendous and timely support. Great open source support was crucial to our ability to spin up the data lake in just a few months.</p><p><i>As our needs grow and diversify, we continue to enhance our data lake by building automated and self-service frameworks to empower more engineers to manage and develop product use cases based on the data.</i></p><p><i>Interested in helping us build the next generation of Notion’s data management?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thasso.xyz/2024/07/13/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html">https://thasso.xyz/2024/07/13/setting-up-an-x86-cpu.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40959742">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>People say there are things that are complex and there are things that are just complicated. Complexity is considered interesting, complicatedness is considered harmful. The process of setting up an x86_64 CPU is mostly complicated.</p><p>I’ll describe one way to go from a boot sector loaded by the BIOS with the CPU in 16-bit real mode to the CPU set up in 64-bit long mode. The setup is pretty bare-bones and there’s tons more to do.</p><p>To follow along, you need the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual</a>, an assembler (I used <a href="https://www.nasm.us/">nasm</a>), and <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>. If you don’t have an x86_64 CPU, you should still be able to run everything I describe by emulating an x86 CPU in QEMU. I assume you know x86 assembly and the syntax that nasm uses. I like the <a href="https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/">nasm tutorial by Ray Toal</a> for getting started.</p><p>I was surprised by how readable some of the Intel manual is. The initial chapters in volume 1 do a really good job at providing an overview of the system and explaining the terms used throughout the other volumes. But volume 3: System Programming Guide is most relevant to this discussion. There is an overview of all the operating modes in volume 3, section 2.2 Modes of Operation. The path we’re taking is highlighted in red.</p><p><img src="https://thasso.xyz/public/figures/x86-mode-transitions.png" alt="Overview of x86 mode transitions"></p><p>For everything up to 32-bit mode, take a look at <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf">“Writing a Simple Operating System – from Scratch”</a>. It’s unfinished but still very good.</p><h2 id="starting-point-bios"> Starting Point: BIOS <a href="#starting-point-bios"></a></h2><p>After a reset, the x86 CPU is in “real mode”. That mode has a default operand size of 16 bits. You get a 20-bit address space and thus the ability to address 1MB of memory by using segmentation. Real mode is pretty much a backward compatibility mode for the Intel 8086 chip from 1978.</p><p>After the BIOS the first code that runs is that in the boot sector. The BIOS searches the system for a disk where the first sector ends in the magic number <code>0xaa55</code> (i.e., the byte <code>0x55</code> followed by the byte <code>0xaa</code>). It loads that “boot sector” to memory at address <code>0x7c00</code>.</p><p>So the BIOS gives us 512 bytes to work with. We need to use these bytes in order to bootstrap the rest of the bootloader. <a href="https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp">One can fit a surprising amount of stuff in 512 bytes</a>, but it’s easiest to just load some more data from disk first. Fortunately, routines defined by the BIOS remain available to us as long as we’re in real mode.</p><h2 id="boot-sector-setup"> Boot Sector Setup <a href="#boot-sector-setup"></a></h2><p>Let’s set up a simple boot sector. It will just print a message to the screen using BIOS routines and then hang. This way, we know that the tooling works.</p><p>This is the assembly we need:</p><div><pre><code><span>;; src/boot_sector.s</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The linker script <code>linker.ld</code> is important because it makes sure that the code in our boot sector is relocated to the right address in the final image. Specifically, the bootloader loads the boot sector to address <code>0x7c00</code> in memory. So that’s the base address to relocate the boot sector to. In addition, the linker will add the magic number at the end of the boot sector. Other guides I’ve seen do both the offset and the magic number inside the boot sector assembly source file by using features of the assembler, but that’s somewhat hackish.</p><pre><code># linker.ld

Stage 1 is the code in the boot sector. It is everything that the BIOS loads for us. The sole purpose of stage 1 is to load stage 2 into memory. Stage 1 does this by using BIOS-provided routines to load stage 2 into memory.</p><p>In stage 2, we’ll switch from 16-bit real mode to 32-bit protected mode. In protected mode, we can’t use BIOS routines anymore. Without BIOS routines, loading sectors from a disk would become much more involved. So we’ll load a number of sectors from disk into memory and hope for the best. Of course, this is an unsafe technique, but it works for now.</p><p>This is how one can access the disk using BIOS.

In protected mode, segmentation is used by default to implement memory protection. Before switching to protected mode, you need to define a Global Descriptor Table (GDT) that contains segment descriptors for all the segments you want to define. Usually, paging is used in favor of segmentation. In fact, in 64-bit long mode, you need to use paging. But for the initial switch to protected mode, segmentation is required.</p><p>The Intel manual describes the “flat model” as a very simple segmentation model that can be implemented in the GDT. The “flat model” comprises a code segment and a data segment. Both of these segments are mapped to the entire linear address space (their base addresses and limits are identical). Using the simplest of all models is fine, since we just want to get to long mode and abandon segmentation in favor of paging.</p><p>The GDT is defined as a contiguous structure in memory. You fill a chunk of memory with the right data and give the CPU the address and the length of the memory chunk. The format of the GDT structure is described in the Intel manual.</p><p>From section “3.4.5 Segment Descriptors”:</p><p><img src="https://thasso.xyz/public/figures/segment-descriptor-layout.png" alt="Screenshot of segment descriptor layout"></p><p>The GDT is just an array of segment descriptors with a “null descriptor” at the start that’s used to catch invalid translations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
        We are trying to build the simplest git collaboration tool. The goal is to make
        self-hosting a git server as simple as running an SSH server -- all without
        sacrificing external collaborators time and energy.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <code>git format-patch</code> isn't the problem and pull requests aren't the solution.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        We are combining mailing list and pull request workflows. In order to build the
        simplest collaboration tool, we needed something as simple as generating patches
        but the ease-of-use of pull requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is not to create another code forge here. The goal is to create a very
        simple self-hosted git solution with the ability to collaborate with external
        contributors. All the code owner needs to setup a running git server:
      </p>

      <ul><li>A single golang binary</li></ul>

      <p>
        All an external contributor needs is:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An SSH keypair</li>
        <li>An SSH client</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>the problem</h2>

      <p>
        Email is great as a decentralized system to send and receive changes (patchsets)
        to a git repo. However, onboarding a new user to a mailing list, properly
        setting up their email client, and then finally submitting the code contribution
        is enough to make many developers give up. Further, because we are leveraging
        the email protocol for collaboration, we are limited by its feature-set. For
        example, it is not possible to make edits to emails, everyone has a different
        client, those clients have different limitations around plain text email and
        downloading patches from it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Github pull requests are easy to use, easy to edit, and easy to manage. The
        downside is it forces the user to be inside their website to perform reviews.
        For quick changes, this is great, but when you start reading code within a web
        browser, there are quite a few downsides. At a certain point, it makes more
        sense to review code inside your local development environment, IDE, etc. There
        are tools and plugins that allow users to review PRs inside their IDE, but it
        requires a herculean effort to make it usable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, self-hosted solutions that mimic a pull request require a lot of
        infrastructure in order to manage it. A database, a web site connected to git,
        admin management, and services to manage it all. Another big point of friction:
        before an external user submits a code change, they first need to create an
        account and then login. This adds quite a bit of friction for a self-hosted
        solution, not only for an external contributor, but also for the code owner who
        has to provision the infra. Often times they also have to fork the repo within
        the code forge before submitting a PR. Then they never make a contribution ever
        again and keep a forked repo around forever. That seems silly.
      </p>

      <h2>introducing patch requests (PR)</h2>

      <p>
        Instead, we want to create a self-hosted git "server" that can handle sending
        and receiving patches without the cumbersome nature of setting up email or the
        limitations imposed by the email protocol. Further, we want the primary workflow
        to surround the local development environment. Github is bringing the IDE to the
        browser in order to support their workflow, we want to flip that idea on its
        head by making code reviews a first-class citizen inside your local development
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        We see this as a hybrid between the github workflow of a pull request and
        sending and receiving patches over email.
      </p>

      <p>
        The basic idea is to leverage an SSH app to handle most of the interaction
        between contributor and owner of a project. Everything can be done completely
        within the terminal, in a way that is ergonomic and fully featured.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notifications would happen with RSS and all state mutations would result in the
        generation of static web assets so it can all be hosted using a simple file web
        server.
      </p>

      <h3>format-patch workflow</h3>

      <p>
        The fundamental collaboration tool here is <code>format-patch</code>. Whether you a
        submitting code changes or you are reviewing code changes, it all happens in
        code. Both contributor and owner are simply creating new commits and generating
        patches on top of each other. This obviates the need to have a web viewer where
        the reviewing can "comment" on a line of code block. There's no need, apply the
        contributor's patches, write comments or code changes, generate a new patch,
        send the patch to the git server as a "review." This flow also works the exact
        same if two users are collaborating on a set of changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This also solves the problem of sending multiple patchsets for the same code
        change. There's a single, central Patch Request where all changes and
        collaboration happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could figure out a way to leverage <code>git notes</code> for reviews / comments, but
        honestly, that solution feels brutal and outside the comfort level of most git
        users. Just send reviews as code and write comments in the programming language
        you are using. It's the job of the contributor to "address" those comments and
        then remove them in subsequent patches. This is the forcing function to address
        all comments: the patch won't be merged if there are comment unaddressed in
        code; they cannot be ignored or else they will be upstreamed erroneously.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>There's lots of innovation going on in security - we're  inundated with a steady stream of new stuff and it all sounds like it works just great. Every couple of months I'm invited to a new computer security conference, or I'm asked to write a foreword for a new computer security book. And, thanks to the fact that it's a topic of public concern and a "safe issue" for politicians, we can expect a flood of computer security-related legislation from lawmakers. So: computer security is definitely still a "hot topic." But why are we spending all this time and money and still having problems?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the <em><strong>six dumbest ideas in computer security</strong></em>. What are they? They're the <em><strong>anti-</strong></em>good ideas. They're the braindamage that makes your $100,000 ASIC-based turbo-stateful packet-mulching firewall transparent to hackers. Where do <em><strong>anti-</strong></em>good ideas come from? They come from misguided attempts to do the impossible - which is another way of saying "trying to ignore reality." Frequently those misguided attempts are sincere efforts by well-meaning people or companies who just don't fully understand the situation, but other times it's just a bunch of savvy entrepreneurs with a well-marketed piece of junk they're selling to make a fast buck. In either case, these dumb ideas are the fundamental reason(s) why all that money you spend on information security is going to be wasted, unless you somehow manage to avoid them. </p>
<p>For your convenience, I've listed the dumb ideas in descending order from the most-frequently-seen. If you can avoid falling into the the trap of the first three, you're among the few true computer security elite. </p>
<h2>#1) Default Permit</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>This dumb idea crops up in a lot of different forms; it's incredibly persistent and difficult to eradicate. Why? Because it's so attractive. Systems based on "Default Permit" are the computer security equivalent of empty calories: tasty, yet fattening.</p>
  <p>The most recognizable form in which the "Default Permit" dumb idea manifests itself is in firewall rules. Back in the very early days of computer security, network managers would set up an internet connection and decide to secure it by turning off incoming telnet, incoming rlogin, and incoming FTP. Everything else was allowed through, hence the name "Default Permit." This put the security practitioner in an endless arms-race with the hackers. Suppose a new vulnerability is found in a service that is not blocked - now the administrators need to decide whether to deny it or not, hopefully, before they got hacked. A lot of organizations adopted "Default Permit" in the early 1990's and convinced themselves it was OK because "hackers will never bother to come after us." The 1990's, with the advent of worms, should have killed off "Default Permit" forever but it didn't. In fact, most networks today are still built around the notion of an open core with no segmentation. That's "Default Permit."</p>
  <p>Another place where "Default Permit" crops up is in how we typically approach code execution on our systems. The default is to permit anything on your machine to execute if you click on it, unless its execution is denied by something like an antivirus program or a spyware blocker. If you think about that for a few seconds, you'll realize what a dumb idea that is. On my computer here I run about 15 different applications on a regular basis. There are probably another 20 or 30 installed that I use every couple of months or so. I still don't understand why operating systems are so dumb that they let any old virus or piece of spyware execute without even asking me. That's "Default Permit."</p>
  <p>A few years ago I worked on analyzing a website's security posture as part of an E-banking security project. The website had a load-balancer in front of it, that was capable of re-vectoring traffic by URL, and my client wanted to use the load-balancer to deflect worms and hackers by re-vectoring attacks to a black hole address. Re-vectoring attacks would have meant adopting a policy of "Default Permit" (i.e.: if it's not a known attack, let it through) but instead I talked them into adopting the opposite approach. The load-balancer was configured to re-vector any traffic <strong><em>not</em></strong> matching a complete list of correctly-structured URLs to a server that serves up image data and 404 pages, which is running a special locked-down configuration. Not surprisingly, that site has withstood the test of time quite well.</p>
  <p>One clear symptom that you've got a case of "Default Permit" is when you find yourself in an arms race with the hackers. It means that you've put yourself in a situation where what you don't know <em><strong>can</strong></em> hurt you, and you'll be doomed to playing keep ahead/catch-up.</p>
  <p>The opposite of "Default Permit" is "Default Deny" and it is a <em><strong>really</strong></em> good idea. It takes  dedication, thought, and understanding to implement a "Default Deny" policy, which is why it is so seldom done. It's not that much harder to do than "Default Permit" but you'll sleep much better at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>#2) Enumerating Badness</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Back in the early days of computer security, there were only a relatively small number of well-known security holes. That had a lot to do with the widespread adoption of "Default Permit" because, when there were only 15 well-known ways to hack into a network, it was possible to individually examine and think about those 15 attack vectors and block them. So security practitioners got into the habit of "Enumerating Badness" - listing all the bad things that we know about. Once you list all the badness, then you can put things in place to detect it, or block it.</p>
  <p><strong>Figure 1: </strong>The "Badness Gap"<br>
  <img src="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/apps.gif" width="600" height="400">  </p>
  <p>Why is "Enumerating Badness" a dumb idea? It's a dumb idea because sometime around 1992 the amount of Badness in the Internet began to vastly outweigh the amount of Goodness. For every harmless, legitimate, application, there are dozens or hundreds of pieces of malware, worm tests, exploits, or viral code. Examine a typical antivirus package and you'll see it knows about 75,000+ viruses that might infect your machine. Compare that to the legitimate 30 or so apps that I've installed on my machine, and you can see it's rather dumb to try to track 75,000 pieces of Badness when even a simpleton could track 30 pieces of Goodness. In fact, if I were to simply track the 30 pieces of Goodness on my machine, and allow nothing else to run, I would have simultaneously solved the following problems:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Spyware</li>
  <li>Viruses</li>
  <li>Remote Control Trojans</li>
  <li>Exploits that involve executing pre-installed code that you don't use regularly</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to all the marketing hype around disclosing and announcing vulnerabilities, there are (according to some industry analysts) between 200 and 700 new pieces of Badness hitting the Internet every month. Not only is "Enumerating Badness" a dumb idea, it's gotten dumber during the few minutes of your time you've bequeathed me by reading this article. </p>
  <p>Now, your typical IT executive, when I discuss this concept with him or her, will stand up and say something like, "That sounds great, but our enterprise network is <em>really</em> complicated. Knowing about all the different apps that we rely on would be impossible! What you're saying sounds reasonable until you think about it and realize how absurd it is!" To which I respond, "How can you call yourself a 'Chief Technology Officer' if you have no idea what your technology is doing?" A CTO isn't going to know detail about every application on the network, but if you haven't got a vague idea what's going on it's impossible to do capacity planning, disaster planning, security planning, or virtually any of the things in a CTO's charter.</p>
  <p>In 1994 I wrote a firewall product that needed some system log analysis routines that would alert the administrator in case some kind of unexpected condition was detected. The first version used "Enumerating Badness" (I've been dumb, too) but the second version used what I termed "<a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/papers/ai/index.html">Artificial Ignorance</a>" - a process whereby you <em>throw away the log entries you know aren't interesting</em>. If there's anything left after you've thrown away the stuff you know isn't interesting, then the leftovers <em>must</em> be interesting. This approach worked amazingly well, and detected a number of very interesting operational conditions and errors that it simply never would have occurred to me to look for. </p>
  <p>"Enumerating Badness" is the idea behind a huge number of security products and systems, from anti-virus to intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, application security, and "deep packet inspection" firewalls. What these programs and devices do is<em> outsource</em> your process of knowing what's good. Instead of you taking the time to list the 30 or so legitimate things you need to do, it's easier to pay $29.95/year to someone else who will try to maintain an exhaustive list of all the evil in the world. Except, unfortunately, your badness expert will get $29.95/year for the antivirus list, another $29.95/year for the spyware list, and you'll buy a $19.95 "personal firewall" that has application control for network applications. By the time you're done paying other people to enumerate all the malware your system could come in contact with, you'll more than double the cost of your "inexpensive" desktop operating system.</p>
  <p>One clear symptom that you have a case of "Enumerating Badness" is that you've got a system or software that needs signature updates on a regular basis, or a system that lets past a new worm that it hasn't seen before. The cure for "Enumerating Badness" is, of course, "Enumerating Goodness." Amazingly, there is virtually no support in operating systems for such software-level controls. I've tried using Windows XP Pro's Program Execution Control but it's oriented toward "Enumerating Badness" and is, itself a dumb implementation of a dumb idea. </p>
  <p>In a sense, "Enumerating Badness" is a special dumb-case of "Default Permit" - our #1 dumb computer security idea. But it's so prevalent that it's in a class by itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>#3) Penetrate and Patch </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>There's an old saying, "You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear." It's pretty much true, unless you wind up using so much silk to patch the sow's ear that eventually the sow's ear is completely replaced with silk. Unfortunately, when buggy software is fixed it is almost always fixed through the addition of new code, rather than the removal of old bits of sow's ear.</p>
  <p>"Penetrate and Patch" is a dumb idea best expressed in the BASIC programming language:</p>
  <pre>10 GOSUB LOOK_FOR_HOLES
20 IF HOLE_FOUND = FALSE THEN GOTO 50<br>30 GOSUB FIX_HOLE<br>40 GOTO 10<br>50 GOSUB CONGRATULATE_SELF<br>60 GOSUB GET_HACKED_EVENTUALLY_ANYWAY<br>70 GOTO 10  </pre>
  <p>In other words, you attack your firewall/software/website/whatever from the outside, identify a flaw in it, fix the flaw, and then go back to looking. One of my programmer buddies refers to this process as "turd polishing" because, as he says, it doesn't make your code any less smelly in the long run but management might enjoy its improved, shiny, appearance in the short term. In other words, the problem with "Penetrate and Patch" is not that it makes your code/implementation/system <em>better by design</em>, rather it merely makes it <em>toughened by trial and error</em>. Richard Feynman's "<a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/feynman.html">Personal Observations on the Reliability of the Space Shuttle</a>" used to be required reading for the software engineers that I hired. It contains some profound thoughts on expectation of reliability and how it is achieved in complex systems. In a nutshell its meaning to programmers is: "Unless your system was <em>supposed to be hackable </em> then it shouldn't be hackable."</p>
  <p>"Penetrate and Patch" crops up all over the place, and is the primary dumb idea behind the current fad (which has been going on for about 10 years) of vulnerability disclosure and patch updates. The premise of the "vulnerability researchers" is that they are helping the community by finding holes in software and getting them fixed before the hackers find them and exploit them. The premise of the vendors is that they are doing the right thing by pushing out patches to fix the bugs before the hackers and worm-writers can act upon them. Both parties, in this scenario, are being dumb because if the vendors were writing code that had been designed to be secure and reliable then vulnerability discovery would be a tedious and unrewarding game, indeed!</p>
  <p>Let me put it to you in different terms: <em><strong>if "Penetrate and Patch" was effective, we would have run out of security bugs in Internet Explorer by now</strong></em>. What has it been? 2 or 3 a month for 10 years? If you look at major internet applications you'll find that there are a number that consistently have problems with security vulnerabilities. There are also a handful, like PostFix, Qmail, etc, that were engineered to be compartmented against themselves, with modularized permissions and processing, and - not surprisingly - they have histories of amazingly few bugs. The same logic applies to "penetration testing." There are networks that I know of which have been "penetration tested" any number of times and are continually getting hacked to pieces. That's because their design (or their security practices) are so fundamentally flawed that no amount of turd polish is going to keep the hackers out. It just keeps managers and auditors off of the network administrator's backs. I know other networks that it is, literally, pointless to "penetration test" because they were designed from the ground up to be permeable only in certain directions and only to certain traffic destined to carefully configured servers running carefully secured software. Running a "penetration test" for Apache bugs is completely pointless against a server that is running a custom piece of C code that is running in a locked-down portion of an embedded system. So, "Penetrate and Patch" is pointless either because you know you're going to find an endless litany of bugs, or because you know you're not going to find anything comprehensible. Pointless is dumb. </p>
  <p>One clear symptom that you've got a case of "Penetrate and Patch " is when you find that your system is always vulnerable to the "bug of the week." It means that you've put yourself in a situation where every time the hackers invent a new weapon, it works against you. Doesn't that sound dumb? Your software and systems should be <em>secure by design</em> and should have been <em>designed with flaw-handling in mind</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2> #4) Hacking is Cool</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the best ways to get rid of cockroaches in your kitchen is to scatter bread-crumbs under the stove, right? Wrong! That's a dumb idea. One of the best ways to discourage hacking on the Internet is to give the hackers stock options, buy the books they write about their exploits, take classes on "extreme hacking kung fu" and pay them tens of thousands of dollars to do "penetration tests" against your systems, right? Wrong! "Hacking is Cool" is a really dumb idea.</p>
  <p>Around the time I was learning to walk, Donn Parker was researching the behavioral aspects of hacking and computer security. He says it better than I ever could:<br>
    <em>"Remote computing freed criminals from the historic requirement of proximity to their crimes. Anonymity and freedom from personal victim confrontation increased the emotional ease of crime, i.e., the victim was only an inanimate computer, not a real person or enterprise. Timid people could become criminals. The proliferation of identical systems and means of use and the automation of business made possible and improved the economics of automating crimes and constructing powerful criminal tools and scripts with great leverage."</em></p>
  <p>Hidden in Parker's observation is the awareness that <strong><em>hacking is a social problem</em></strong>. It's not a technology problem, at all. "<em>Timid people could become criminals.</em>" The Internet has given a whole new form of elbow-room to the badly socialized borderline personality. The #4th dumbest thing information security practitioners can do is implicitly encourage hackers by lionizing them. The media plays directly into this, by portraying hackers, variously, as "whiz kids" and "brilliant technologists" - of course if you're a reporter for CNN, anyone who can install Linux probably <em>does</em> qualify as a "brilliant technologist" to you. I find it interesting to compare societal reactions to hackers as "whiz kids" versus spammers as "sleazy con artists." I'm actually heartened to see that the spammers, phishers, and other scammers are adopting the hackers and the techniques of the hackers - this will do more to reverse society's view of hacking than any other thing we could do.</p>
  <p>If you're a security practitioner, teaching yourself how to hack is also part of the "Hacking is Cool" dumb idea. Think about it for a couple of minutes: teaching yourself a bunch of exploits and how to use them means you're investing your time in learning a bunch of tools and techniques that are going to go stale as soon as everyone has patched that particular hole. It means you've made part of your professional skill-set dependent on "Penetrate and Patch" and you're going to have to be part of the arms-race if you want that skill-set to remain relevant and up-to-date. Wouldn't it be more sensible to learn how to design security systems that are hack-proof than to learn how to identify security systems that are dumb? </p>
  <p>My prediction is that the "Hacking is Cool" dumb idea will be a dead idea in the next 10 years. I'd like to fantasize that it will be replaced with its opposite idea, "Good Engineering is Cool" but so far there is no sign that's likely to happen. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>#5) Educating Users</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Penetrate and Patch" can be applied to human beings, as well as software, in the form of user education. On the surface of things, the idea of "Educating Users" seems less than dumb: education is always good. On the other hand, like "Penetrate and Patch" <em><strong>if it was going to work, it would have worked by now</strong></em>. There have been numerous interesting studies that indicate that a significant percentage of users will trade their password for a candy bar, and the Anna Kournikova worm showed us that nearly 1/2 of humanity will click on anything purporting to contain nude pictures of semi-famous females. If "Educating Users" is the strategy you plan to embark upon, you should expect to have to "patch" your users every week. That's dumb. </p>
  <p>The real question to ask is not "can we educate our users to be better at security?" it is "why do we need to educate our users at all?" In a sense, this is another special case of "Default Permit" - why are users getting executable attachments at all? Why are users expecting to get E-mails from banks where they don't have accounts? Most of the problems that are addressable through user education are self-correcting over time. As a younger generation of workers moves into the workforce, they will come pre-installed with a healthy skepticism about phishing and social engineering.</p>
  <p>Dealing with things like attachments and phishing is another case of "Default Permit" - our favorite dumb idea. After all, if you're letting all of your users get attachments in their E-mail you're "Default Permit"ing anything that gets sent to them. A better idea might be to simply quarantine all attachments as they come into the enterprise, delete all the executables outright, and store the few file types you decide are acceptable on a staging server where users can log in with an SSL-enabled browser (requiring a password will quash a lot of worm propagation mechanisms right away) and pull them down. There are freeware tools like MIMEDefang that can be easily harnessed to strip attachments from incoming E-mails, write them to a per-user directory, and replace the attachment in the E-mail message with a URL to the stripped attachment. Why educate your users how to cope with a problem if you can just drive a stake through the problem's heart? </p>
  <p>When I was CEO of a small computer security start-up we didn't have a Windows system administrator. All of the employees who wanted to run Windows had to know how to install it and manage it <em>themselves</em>, or they didn't get hired in the first place.   My prediction is that in 10 years users that need education will be out of the high-tech workforce entirely, or will be self-training at home in order to stay competitive in the job market. My guess is that this will extend to knowing not to open weird attachments from strangers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>#6) Action is Better Than Inaction </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>IT executives seem to break down into two categories: the "early adopters" and the "pause and thinkers." Over the course of my career, I've noticed that <em>dramatically</em> fewer of the "early adopters" build successful, secure, mission-critical systems. This is because they somehow believe that "Action is Better Than Inaction" - i.e.: if there's a new whizzbang, it's better to install it <em>right now</em> than to wait, think about it, watch what happens to the other early adopters, and then deploy the technology once it's fully sorted-out and has had its first generation of experienced users. I know one senior IT executive - one of the "pause and thinkers" whose plan for doing a wireless roll-out for their corporate network was "wait 2 years and hire a guy who did a successful wireless deployment for a company larger than us." Not only will the technology be more sorted-out by then, it'll be much, much cheaper. What an utterly brilliant strategy!</p>
  <p>There's an important corollary to the "Action is Better Than Inaction" dumb idea, and it's that:<br>
  "<em><strong>It is often easier to not do something dumb than it is to do something smart.</strong></em>"<br>
  Sun Tzu didn't <em>really</em> write that in "<em>The Art of War</em>" but if you tell IT executives that he did, they'll take you much more seriously when you counsel a judicious, thoughtful approach to fielding some new whizzbang. To many of my clients, I have been counselling, "hold off on outsourcing your security for a year or two and then get recommendations and opinions from the bloody, battered survivors - if there are any."</p>
  <p>You can see the "Action is Better Than Inaction" dumb idea all over corporate networks and it tends to correlate with senior IT managers that make their product-purchasing decisions by reading Gartner research reports and product glossies from vendors. If you find yourself in the chain of command of such a manager, I sincerely hope you've enjoyed this article because you're probably far better acquainted with dumbness than I am.</p>
  <p>One extremely useful piece of management kung-fu to remember, if you find yourself up against an "early adopter" is to rely on your peers. Several years ago I had a client who was preparing to spend a ton of money on a technology <em>without testing it operationally</em>. I suggested offhandedly to the senior IT manager in charge that he should send one of his team to a relevant conference (in this case, <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa05" target="_blank">LISA</a>) where it was likely that someone with hands-on experience with the technology would be in attendance. I proposed that the manager have his employee put a message on the "meet and greet" bulletin board that read:<br>
  "Do you have hands-on experience with <em><strong>xyz</strong></em> from <em><strong>pdq.com</strong></em>? If so, I'm authorized to take you to dinner at Ruth's Chris if you promise to give me the low-down on the product off the record. Contact, etc..." The IT manager later told me that a $200 dinner expense saved them over $400,000 worth of hellish technological trauma.</p>
  <p>It really is easier to not do something dumb than it is to do something smart. The trick is, when you avoid doing something dumb, to make sure your superiors know you navigated around a particularly nasty sand-bar and that you get appropriate credit for being smart. Isn't that the ultimate expression of professional kung-fu? To get <strong><em>credit</em></strong> for <em><strong>not</strong></em> doing <em><strong>anything</strong></em>?!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Minor Dumbs</h2>
<p>These dumb ideas didn't quite merit status as "The Dumb<em>est</em>" ideas in computer security, but they're pretty dumb and deserve mention in passing:</p>
<div> 
  <ul>
    <li>"We're Not a Target" - <em>yes, you are</em>. Worms aren't smart enough to realize that your web site/home network isn't interesting.</li>
    <li>"Everyone would be secure if they all just ran &lt;security-flavor-of-the-month&gt;" - <em>no, they wouldn't</em>. Operating systems have security problems because they are complex and system administration is not a solved problem in computing. Until someone manages to solve system administration, switching to the flavor-of-the-month is going to be <em>more</em> damaging because you're making it harder for your system administrators to gain a level of expertise that only comes with time. </li>
    <li>"We don't need a firewall, we have good host security" - <em>no, you don't</em>. If your network fabric is untrustworthy every single application that goes across the network is potentially a target. 3 words: Domain Naming System.</li>
    <li>"We don't need host security, we have a good firewall" - <em>no, you don't</em>. If your firewall lets traffic through to hosts behind it, then you need to worry about the host security of those systems.</li>
    <li>"Let's go production with it now and we can secure it later" - <em>no, you won't</em>. A better question to ask yourself is "If we don't have time to do it correctly now, will we have time to do it over once it's broken?" Sometimes, building a system that is in constant need of repair means you will spend years investing in turd polish because you were unwilling to spend days getting the job done right in the first place.</li>
    <li>"We can't stop the occasional problem" - <em>yes, you can</em>. Would <em>you</em> travel on commercial airliners if you thought that the aviation industry took this approach with your life? I didn't think so. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h2>Goodbye and Good Luck</h2>
<p>I've tried to keep this light-hearted, but my message is serious. Computer security is a field that has fallen far too deeply in love with the whizzbang-of-the-week and has forsaken common sense. Your job, as a security practitioner, is to question - if not outright challenge - the conventional wisdom and the status quo. After all, if the conventional wisdom was working, the rate of systems being compromised would be going <em><strong>down</strong></em>, wouldn't it?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There is no reasonable expectation of privacy in one’s Google location data. It’s willingly shared with Google. <a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/224489.P.pdf">United States v. Chatrie</a>, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 16692 (4th Cir. July 9, 2024) (2-1):</p><div>
<p>Location History is turned off by default, so a user must take several affirmative steps before Google begins tracking and storing his Location History data. First, he must enable location sharing on his mobile device. Second, he must opt in to the Location History setting on his Google account, either through an internet browser, a Google application (such as Google Maps), or his device settings (for Android devices). Before he can activate the setting, however, Google always presents him language that explains the basics of the service. Third, he must enable the “Location Reporting” feature on his mobile device. And fourth, he must sign in to his Google account on that device. Only when a user follows these steps will Google begin tracking and storing his Location History data. Roughly one-third of active Google users have enabled Location History.</p>



<p>Even after a user opts in, he maintains some control over his location data. He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained. So, for instance, he could decide he only wants to keep data for certain dates and to delete the rest. Or he could decide to delete everything. Google also allows him to pause (i.e., disable) the collection of future Location History data. Whatever his choice, Google will honor it. From start to finish, then, the user controls how much Google tracks and stores his Location History data.</p>



<p>Once a user enables Location History, Google constantly monitors his location through GPS, even when he isn’t using his phone. And if he has an Android phone, he can turn on another setting—”Google Location Accuracy”—that enables Google to determine his location using more inputs than just GPS, such as Wi-Fi access points and mobile networks. As a result, Location History can be more precise than other location-tracking mechanisms, including cell-site location information. But whether Google Location Accuracy is activated or not, Location History’s power should not be exaggerated. In the end, it is only an estimate of a device’s location. So when Google records a set of location coordinates, it includes a value (measured in meters) called a “confidence interval,” which represents Google’s confidence in the accuracy of the estimate. Google represents that for any given location point, there is a 68% chance that a user is somewhere within the confidence interval.</p>



<p>Google stores all Location History data in a repository called the “Sensorvault.” The Sensorvault assigns each device a unique identification number and maintains all Location History data associated with that device. Google then uses this data to build aggregate models to assist applications like Google Maps.</p>



<p>In 2016, Google began receiving “geofence warrants” from law enforcement seeking to access location information. A geofence warrant requires Google to produce Location History data for all users who were within a geographic area (called a geofence) during a particular time period. Since 2016, geofence requests have skyrocketed in number: Google claims it saw a 1,500% increase in requests from 2017 to 2018 and a 500% increase from 2018 to 2019. Concerned with the potential threat to user privacy, Google consulted internal counsel and law enforcement agencies in 2018 and developed its own three-step procedure for responding to geofence requests. Since then, Google has objected to any geofence request that disregards this procedure.</p>



<p>Google’s procedure works as follows: At Step One, law enforcement obtains a warrant [*8] that compels Google to disclose an anonymous list of users whose Location History shows they were within the geofence during a specified timeframe. But Google does not keep any lists like this on-hand. So it must first comb through its entire Location History repository to identify users who were present in the geofence. Google then gives law enforcement a list that includes for each user an anonymized device number, the latitude and longitude coordinates and timestamp of each location point, a confidence interval, and the source of the stored Location History (such as GPS or Wi-Fi). Before disclosing this information, Google reviews the request and objects if Google deems it overly broad.</p>



<p>At Step Two, law enforcement reviews the information it receives from Google. If it determines that it needs more, then law enforcement can ask Google to produce additional location coordinates. This time, the original geographical and temporal limits no longer apply; for any user identified at Step One, law enforcement can request information about his movements inside and outside the geofence over a broader period. Yet Google generally requires law enforcement to narrow its request for this more expansive location data to only a subset of the users pinpointed in Step One.</p>



<p>Finally, at Step Three, law enforcement determines which individuals are relevant to the investigation and then compels Google to provide their account-identifying information (usually their names and email addresses). Here, too, Google typically requires law enforcement to taper its request from the previous step, so law enforcement can’t merely request the identity of every user identified in Step Two.</p>
</div><p>Bloomberg: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/geofence-warrant-decision-exposes-hole-in-fourth-amendment-law">Geofence Warrant Decision Exposes Hole in Fourth Amendment Law</a> by Cassandre Coyer &amp; Tonya Riley (“A split appeals court opinion clearing the government’s acquisition of users’ mobile-device location data from Google of constitutional scrutiny will likely spark more friction between emerging technologies and the scope of law enforcement searches, attorneys warned. [¶] The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s ruling in US v. Chatrie concluded, over a dissent, that the use of such geofencing doesn’t constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.”)</p></div>]]></description>

<p>Warp is designed for spatial computing and comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write
programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics, and geometry processing. In addition, Warp kernels
are differentiable and can be used as part of machine-learning pipelines with frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX.</p>
<p>Below are some examples of simulations implemented using Warp:</p>

<h2>Quickstart<a href="#quickstart" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to install Warp is from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/warp-lang">PyPI</a>:</p>

<p>The binaries hosted on PyPI are currently built with the CUDA 11.8 runtime.
Users requiring a newer CUDA runtime in Warp can build Warp from source or
install wheels hosted on GitHub as described in <a href="https://nvidia.github.io/warp/installation.html#github-installation"><span>Installing from GitHub Releases</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Additional Examples<a href="#additional-examples" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/tree/main/warp/examples">warp/examples</a> directory in
the Github repository contains a number of scripts categorized under different subdirectories
that show how to implement different simulation methods using the Warp API. Most examples
will generate USD files containing time-sampled animations in the
same directory as the example.
Before running examples, users should ensure that the <code><span>usd-core</span></code>, <code><span>matplotlib</span></code>, and <code><span>pyglet</span></code> packages are installed using:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>usd</span><span>-</span><span>core</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>pyglet</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Examples can be run from the command-line as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>python</span> <span>-</span><span>m</span> <span>warp</span><span>.</span><span>examples</span><span>.&lt;</span><span>example_subdir</span><span>&gt;.&lt;</span><span>example</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Most examples can be run on either the CPU or a CUDA-capable device, but a handful require a CUDA-capable device. These are marked at the top of the example script.</p>
<p>USD files can be viewed or rendered inside NVIDIA
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse">Omniverse</a>,
Pixar’s UsdView, and Blender. Note that Preview in macOS is not
recommended as it has limited support for time-sampled animations.</p>
<p>Built-in unit tests can be run from the command-line as follows:</p>

<h2>Omniverse<a href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Omniverse extensions for Warp are available in the extension registry inside
Omniverse Kit or USD Composer.
The <code><span>omni.warp.core</span></code> extension installs Warp into the Omniverse Application’s
Python environment, which allows users to import the module in their scripts and nodes.
The <code><span>omni.warp</span></code> extension provides a collection of OmniGraph nodes and sample
scenes demonstrating uses of Warp in OmniGraph.
Enabling the <code><span>omni.warp</span></code> extension automatically enables the <code><span>omni.warp.core</span></code> extension.</p>

<p>Versions take the format X.Y.Z, similar to <a href="https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/development-cycle/#devcycle">Python itself</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increments in X are reserved for major reworks of the project causing disruptive incompatibility (or reaching the 1.0 milestone).</p></li>
<li><p>Increments in Y are for regular releases with a new set of features.</p></li>
<li><p>Increments in Z are for bug fixes. In principle there are no new features. Can be omitted if 0 or not relevant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> but less strict around backward compatibility.
Like with Python, some breaking changes can be present between minor versions if well documented and gradually introduced.</p>

(AP) — <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally and said afterward that he was shot in the ear. The barrage of gunfire set off panic among thousands of attendees and a dramatic scene in which a bloodied Trump was surrounded by Secret Service and then escorted to his SUV as he pumped his first in a show of defiance. </p><p>Trump’s campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing “fine” after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.</p><p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his social media site.</p><p>Rallygoers screamed in panic. Shouts of “Get down!” rang through the crowd. At least one attendee was dead and two spectators were critically injured, authorities said. The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter — who it said attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue, a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania — and that Trump was safe.</p><p>The attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. It came in a deeply polarized political atmosphere, just four months from the presidential elections and days before Trump is to be officially named the Republican nominee at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/republican-national-convention">his party’s convention</a></span> — which his campaign said would proceed as planned. </p>
    


<p>“There’s no place in America for this type of violence,” President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump as the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in remarks. “It’s sick. It’s sick.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Two officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. They said the shooter was not an attendee at the rally and was killed by U.S. Secret Service agents. </p><p>The officials said the shooter was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team. The heavily armed tactical team travels everywhere with the president and major party nominees and is meant to confront any active threats while other agents focus on safeguarding and evacuating the person at the center of protection.</p><p>Law enforcement recovered an AR-style rifle at the scene, according to a third person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Many Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment. They pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on July 8, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.”</p><p>There was no immediate information on the shooter or their motivations.</p>
    

    

    

<h2>A rally disrupted by gunfire</h2><p>Trump was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the apparent shots began just after 6:10 p.m. It took two minutes from the moment of the first shot for Trump to be placed in a waiting SUV.</p><p>As Trump was talking, a popping sound was heard, and the former president put his right hand up to his right ear, as people in the stands behind him appeared to be shocked.</p>



<p>As the first pop rang out, Trump said, “Oh,” and grabbed his ear as two more pops could be heard and he crouched down. More shots were heard then.</p><p>Someone could be heard saying near the microphone at Trump’s lectern, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents tackled the former president. They piled atop him to shield him with their bodies, as is their training protocol, as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.</p><div data-align-center="">

Video showed Trump turning back to the crowd and raising a fist right before he was put into a vehicle. </p><h2>Witnesses heard multiple gunshots and ducked for cover</h2><p>“Everybody went to their knees or their prone position, because we all knew, everyone becoming aware of the fact this was gunfire,” said Dave McCormick, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, who was sitting to Trump’s right on stage. </p><p>As he saw Trump raise his fist, McCormick said, he looked over his shoulder and noticed someone had been hit while sitting in the bleachers behind the stage. </p><p>Eventually, first responders were able to carry the injured person out of a large crowd so he could get medical care, McCormick said. </p><p>Reporters covering the rally heard five or six shots ring out and many ducked for cover, hiding under tables. After the first two or three bangs, people in the crowd looked startled, but not panicked. An AP reporter at the scene reported the noise sounded like firecrackers at first or perhaps a car backfiring.</p><p>When it was clear the situation had been contained and that Trump would not be returning to speak, attendees started filing out of the venue. One man in an electric wheelchair got stuck on the field when his chair’s battery died. Others tried to help him move.</p><div data-override-title="true" data-hide-title="false" data-align-center="" data-carousel-enhancement="">

        </div><p>Police soon told the people remaining to leave the venue and Secret Service agents told reporters to get “out now. This is a live crime scene.”</p><p>Two firefighters from nearby Steubenville, Ohio, who were at the rally told the AP that they helped people who appeared injured and heard bullets hitting broadcast speakers.</p><p>“The bullets rattled around the grandstand, one hit the speaker tower and then chaos broke. We hit the ground and then the police converged into the grandstands, said Chris Takach.</p><p>“The first thing I heard is a couple of cracks,” Dave Sullivan said.</p><p>Sullivan said he saw one of the speakers get hit and bullets rattling and, “we hit the deck.”</p><p>He said once Secret Service and other authorities converged on Trump, he and Takach assisted two people who may have been shot in the grandstand and cleared a path to get them out of the way.</p><p>“Just a sad day for America,” Sullivan said.</p><p>“After we heard the shots got fired, then the hydraulic line was spraying all around, you could see the hydraulic fluid coming out of it. And then the speaker tower started to fall down,” Sullivan said. “Then we heard another shot that, you could hear, you knew something was, it was bullets. It wasn’t firecrackers.”</p><h2>Political violence again shakes America</h2><p>The perils of campaigning took on a new urgency after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in California in 1968, and again in 1972 when Arthur Bremer shot and seriously hurt George Wallace, who was running as an independent on a campaign platform that has sometimes been compared to Trump’s. That led to increased protection of candidates, even as the threats persisted, notably against Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008.</p><p>Presidents, particularly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, have even greater layers of security. Trump is a rarity as both a former president and a current candidate.</p><p>Biden was briefed on the incident, the White House said. He received an updated briefing from Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.</p><p>He told reporters after 8 p.m. that he hadn’t been able to reach Trump yet but was briefed that the former president was “doing well.”</p><p>“I hope I get to speak to him tonight,” he said. </p><p>Mayorkas, whose department oversees the Secret Service, said officials were engaged with the Biden and Trump campaigns and “taking every possible measure to ensure their safety and security.”</p><p>Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., posted a photo on X of Trump, his fist raised and his face bloody in front of an American flag, with the words: “He’ll never stop fighting to Save America.”</p><p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the three men on Trump’s shortlist for vice president, all quickly sent out statements expressing concern for the former president, with Rubio sharing an image taken as Trump was escorted off stage with his fist in the air and a streak of blood on his face along with the words “God protected President Trump.”</p><p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement on X that he had been briefed on the situation and Pennsylvania state police were on hand at the rally site.</p><p>“Violence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable. It has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States,” he said.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Colvin, Balsamo and Price reported from New York. Long reported from Washington.

<p>The incident unfolded as Trump was giving a speech at the rally in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, he appeared to fall to the ground clutching his ear.</p><p>He was quickly surrounded by armed security and stayed down for around a minute. Screams from the audience rang out as the scene unfolded.</p><p>Trump then rose to his feet, pumped his fist in the air, and shouted "fight", before being whisked off stage and into a vehicle.</p><p>He was quickly driven away from the scene. Video appeared to show blood coming from his ear as he left the stage.</p><p>The US Secret Service said Trump was now "safe" and that it had implemented protective measures around him.</p>     <div data-component-name="sdc-article-strapline">
