          <p>We’re Fly.io, we’re a new public cloud that lets you put your compute where it matters: near your users. Today we’re announcing that you can do this with GPUs too, allowing you to do AI workloads on the edge. Want to find out more? Keep reading.</p><h2 id="ai-is-pretty-fly"><a href="#ai-is-pretty-fly" aria-label="Anchor"></a>AI is pretty fly</h2>
<p>AI is apparently a bit of a <em>thing</em> (maybe even <em>an thing</em> come to think about it). We’ve seen entire industries get transformed in the wake of ChatGPT existing (somehow it’s only been around for a year, I can’t believe it either). It’s likely to leave a huge impact on society as a whole in the same way that the Internet did once we got search engines. Like any good venture-capital funded infrastructure provider, we want to enable you to do hilarious things with AI using industrial-grade muscle.</p>

<p>Fly.io lets you run a full-stack app - or an entire dev platform based on the <a href="https://fly.io/docs/machines/">Fly Machines API</a> - close to your users. Fly.io GPUs let you attach an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">Nvidia A100</a> to whatever you’re building, harnessing the full power of CUDA with more VRAM than your local 4090 can shake a ray-traced stick at. With these cards (or whatever you call a GPU attached to SXM fabric), AI/ML workloads are at your fingertips. You can <a href="https://fly.io/blog/transcribing-on-fly-gpu-machines/">recognize speech</a>, segment text, summarize articles, synthesize images, and more at speeds that would make your homelab blush. You can even set one up as your programming companion with <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder">your model of choice</a> in case you’ve just not been feeling it with the output of <em>other</em> models changing over time.</p>

<p>If you want to find out more about what these cards are and what using them is like, check out <a href="https://fly.io/blog/what-are-these-gpus-really/">What are these “GPUs” really?</a> It covers the history of GPUs and why it’s ironic that the cards we offer are called “Graphics Processing Units” in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="fly-io-gpus-in-action"><a href="#fly-io-gpus-in-action" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Fly.io GPUs in Action</h2>
<p>We want you to deploy your own code with your favorite models on top of Fly.io’s cloud backbone. Fly.io GPUs make this really easy.</p>

<p>You can get a GPU app running <a href="https://ollama.ai/">Ollama</a> (our friends in text generation) in two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put this in your <code>fly.toml</code>:
</li></ol>
<div>
  <pre><code><span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>"sandwich_ai"</span>
<span>primary_region</span> <span>=</span> <span>"ord"</span>
<span>vm.size</span> <span>=</span> <span>"a100-40gb"</span>

<span>[build]</span>
  <span>image</span> <span>=</span> <span>"ollama/ollama"</span>

<span>[mounts]</span>
  <span>source</span> <span>=</span> <span>"models"</span>
  <span>destination</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/root/.ollama"</span>
  <span>initial_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>"100gb"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>fly apps create sandwich_ai &amp;&amp; fly deploy</code>.
</li></ol>

<p>If you want to read more about how to start your new sandwich empire, check out <a href="https://fly.io/blog/scaling-llm-ollama/">Scaling Large Language Models to zero with Ollama</a>, it explains how to set up Ollama so that it <em>automatically scales itself down</em> when it’s not in use.</p>
<h2 id="the-speed-of-light-is-only-so-fast"><a href="#the-speed-of-light-is-only-so-fast" aria-label="Anchor"></a>The speed of light is only so fast</h2>
<p>Being able to spin up GPUs is great, but where Fly.io really shines is inference at the edge.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have an app that lets users enter ingredients they have in their kitchen and receive a sandwich recipe. Your users expect their recipes <em>instantly</em> (or at least as fast as the other leading apps). Seconds count when you need an emergency sandwich.</p>
<div><p>


It’s depressingly customary in the AI industry to cherry-pick outputs. This was not cherry-picked. I used <a href="https://ollama.ai/library/yi:34b">yi:34b</a> to generate this recipe. I’m not sure what a taco salad sandwich is, but I might be willing to try it.</p>
</div>
<p><img alt="A conversation between a user and an artificial intelligence. The user asks: &quot;What kind of sandwich can I make with an egg, a taco shell, and a pound of ground beef?&quot; The AI responds: &quot; You can make a breakfast taco or a taco salad sandwich with the ingredients you have. Here's how to prepare each: for the breakfast taco. Cook the pound of ground beef in a pan until browned. Season with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices like chili powder or taco seasoning. While the beef is cooking, fry an egg (or scramble it if you prefer) in another pan. Warm up the taco shell in the oven or microwave according to the package instructions. Assemble the taco by placing the ground cooked beef in the taco shell followed by the fried egg. You can also add any additional toppings like diced onions avocados, avocado, salsa or cheese if you have them. Serve with a side of hot sauce or sour cream if desired. For the taco salad sandwich: Prepare the ground beef as in the breakfast taco recipe above. Instead of frying an egg, you can cook it sunny side up or over easy depending on your preference. Crumble the taco shell into small pieces and mix them with the cooked ground beef. Assemble the sandwich by layering the crumbled taco shell mixture and ground beef in two slices of bread. Top with the fried egg and any additional toppings you like such as shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, or sliced olives. Serve with a side of salsa or ranch dressing if desired. Both options are hardy and can be easily customized based on your taste preferences. Enjoy!&quot;" src="https://fly.io/blog/fly-io-has-gpus-now/assets/sandwich-recipes.webp"></p>

<p>In the previous snippet, we deployed our app to ord (<code>primary_region = "ord"</code>). The good news is that our model returns a result really quickly and users in Chicago get instant sandwich recipes. It’s a good experience for users near your datacentre, and you can do this on any half decent cloud provider.</p>

<p>But surely people outside of Chicago need sandwiches too. Amsterdam has sandwich fiends as well. And sometimes it takes too long to have their requests leap across the pond. The speed of light is only so fast after all. Don’t worry, we’ve got your back. Fly.io has GPUs in datacentres all over the world. Even more, we’ll let you run <em>the same program</em> with the same public IP address and the same TLS certificates in any regions with GPU support.</p>

<p>Don’t believe us? See how you can scale your app up in Amsterdam with one command:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>fly scale count 2 --region ams
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It’s that easy.</p>
<h2 id="actually-on-demand"><a href="#actually-on-demand" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Actually On-Demand</h2>
<p>GPUs are powerful parallel processing packages, but they’re not cheap! Once we have enough people wanting to turn their fridge contents into tasty sandwiches, keeping a GPU or two running makes sense. But we’re just a small app still growing our user base while also funding the latest large sandwich model research. We want to only pay for GPUs when a user makes a request.</p>

<p>Let’s open up that <code>fly.toml</code> again, and add a section called <code>services</code>, and we’ll include instructions on how we want our app to scale up and down:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code><span>[[services]]</span>
  <span>internal_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>8080</span>
  <span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>"tcp"</span>
  <span>auto_stop_machines</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>auto_start_machines</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>min_machines_running</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now when no one needs sandwich recipes, you don’t pay for GPU time.</p>
<h2 id="the-deets"><a href="#the-deets" aria-label="Anchor"></a>The Deets</h2>
<p>We have GPUs ready to use in several US and EU regions and Sydney. You can deploy your sandwich, music generation, or AI illustration apps to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">Ampere A100s</a> with 40gb of RAM for $2.50/hr
</li><li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">Ampere A100s</a> with 80gb of RAM for $3.50/hr
</li><li><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/l40/">Lovelace L40s</a> are coming soon (pricing TBD)
</li></ul>

<p>By default, anything you deploy to GPUs will use eight heckin’ <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/epyc-server-cpu-family">AMD EPYC</a> CPU cores, and you can attach volumes up to 500 gigabytes. We’ll even give you discounts for reserved instances and dedicated hosts if you ask nicely.</p>

<p>We hope you have fun with these new cards and we’d love to see what you can do with them! Reach out to us on X (formerly Twitter) or <a href="https://community.fly.io/">the community forum</a> and share what you’ve been up to. We’d love to see what we can make easier!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/mozilla-downsizes-as-it-refocuses-on-firefox-and-ai-read-the-memo/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/mozilla-downsizes-as-it-refocuses-on-firefox-and-ai-read-the-memo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39362481">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/a-new-chapter-for-mozilla-laura-chambers-expanded-role/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing</a> a new interim CEO earlier this month, Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox browser, is making some major changes to its product strategy, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>Specifically, Mozilla plans to scale back its investment in a number of products, including its VPN, Relay and, somewhat remarkably, its Online Footprint Scrubber, which launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/mozilla-monitors-new-service-removes-your-personal-info-from-data-broker-sites-automatically/">only a week ago</a>. Mozilla will also shut down <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubs</a>, the 3D virtual world it <a href="https://blog.mozvr.com/introducing-hubs-a-new-way-to-get-together-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> back in 2018, and scale back its investment in its <a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mozilla.social</a> Mastodon instance. The layoffs will affect roughly 60 employees. Bloomberg previously reported <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firefox-maker-mozilla-cutting-60-191639445.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the layoffs.</a></p>
<p>Going forward, the company said in an internal memo, Mozilla will focus on bringing “trustworthy AI into Firefox.” To do so, it will bring together the teams that work on Pocket, Content and AI/Ml.</p>
<p>Mozilla started expanding its product portfolio in recent years, all while its flagship product, Firefox, kept losing market share. And while the organization was often sharply criticized for this, its leadership argued that diversifying its product portfolio beyond Firefox was necessary to ensure Mozilla’s survival in the long run. Firefox, after all, provided the vast majority of Mozilla’s income, but it also meant the organization was essentially dependent on Google to continue this deal. With these changes, it now looks like Mozilla may refocus on Firefox once more, something that will surely make many hardcore Firefox fans quite happy.</p>
<p>Here is the full internal memo:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Scaling back investment <a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a></strong>: With&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a>, we made a big bet in 2023 to build a safer, better social media experience, based on Mastodon and the Fediverse. Our initial approach was based on a belief that Mozilla needed to quickly reach large scale in order to effectively shape the future of social media. It was a noble idea but one we struggled to execute. While we resourced&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a>&nbsp;heavily to pursue this ambitious idea, in retrospect a more modest approach would have enabled us to participate in the space with considerably greater agility. The actions we’re taking today will make this strategic correction, working through a much smaller team to participate in the Mastodon ecosystem and more rapidly bring smaller experiments to people that choose to live on the&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="http://mozilla.social/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">mozilla.social</a>&nbsp;instance.</p>
<p><strong>Protection Experimentation &amp; Identity (PXI)</strong>: We’re scaling back investment in some of our standalone consumer products in the Security and Privacy space. We are reducing investment in market segments that competitors crowd and where it is challenging to deliver a differentiated offering. Specifically, we plan to reduce our investments in VPN, Relay, and Online Footprint Scrubber. We will maintain investment in products addressing customer needs in growing market segments.</p>
<p><strong>Hubs</strong>: Since early 2023, we have experienced a shift in the market for 3D virtual worlds. With the exception of gaming, education, and a handful of niche use cases, demand has moved away from 3D virtual worlds. This is impacting all industry players. Hubs’ user and customer bases are not robust enough to justify continuing to dedicate resources against the headwinds of the unfavorable shift in demand. We will wind down the service and communicate a graceful exit plan to customers.</p>
<p><strong>Right-sizing the People Team</strong><br>
Given the reduction in staffing and lower headcount budget moving forward in MozProd, some roles have been consolidated in the People and other support services orgs so that we are offering the right level of support to our product portfolio. Optimizing our org to sharpen focus.</p>
<p>In 2023, generative AI began rapidly shifting the industry landscape. Mozilla seized an opportunity to bring trustworthy AI into Firefox, largely driven by the Fakespot acquisition and the product integration work that followed. Additionally, finding great content is still a critical use case for the internet. Therefore, as part of the changes today, we will be bringing together Pocket, Content, and the AI/ML teams supporting content with the Firefox Organization. More details on the specific organizational changes will follow shortly. Within MozProd, there are no changes within MDN, Ads, or Fakespot. There are also no changes to Legal/Policy, Finance &amp; Business Operations, Marketing, or Strategy &amp; Operations.</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I’m going to lay out some fascinating facts, and let you decide whether we are likely to dim the sun within the next 10 years.</p><p>Firstly, it’s much easier to artificially dim the sun than most people imagine.</p><p>100 planes injecting sulfur particles into the stratosphere would dim the sun by about 1%, and cool the earth by about 1°C.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/FNKxDvFN2dsBKjnHBGn31nQFgSxL8Ob50wXGQ8c8Fr8V9ocWvEJJ3Depj08MKlZRTftHmEw8XjLbKUIlbBT1rFa3EZ7FivhAGpUX-nS3v1HT6qPO8ZHxpKu-Oc7gbD7RJ4pE0M8csC_2BlEHqVviems" alt="" loading="lazy" width="666" height="457"><figcaption><a href="https://ben-james.notion.site/Sources-geoengineering-925832b122304a3b83c5d889acdea2fd?ref=climate.benjames.io">Sources</a></figcaption></figure><p>For context, our current sulfur dioxide emissions (from fossil fuels) <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/so-emissions-by-world-region-in-million-tonnes?ref=climate.benjames.io">are</a> &gt;10x bigger than the 1.2m tons shown above. The difference is the height of injection. We’d be putting sulfur into the <em>stratosphere</em>, which is higher up than our normal sulfur emissions in the <em>troposphere</em>.</p><p>Spraying a form of sulfur from a plane is incredibly cheap. A full programme <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e7/meta?ref=climate.benjames.io">would cost less</a> than $20b per year. That’s <strong>much</strong> cheaper than carbon removal ($600b per year,<em> </em>to remove just 10% of annual emissions @ $100 / tCO2).</p><p>Modifying the earth like this is called geoengineering, and blocking out the sun with particles is called <strong>Solar Radiation Management (SRM)</strong>.</p><h2 id="srm-awoke-in-2023">SRM awoke in 2023</h2><p>Interest in SRM spiked in 2023, after years of being too controversial to discuss.

It cooled the earth by <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/news/volcano-watch-pinatubo-effect-can-geoengineering-mimic-volcanic-processes?ref=climate.benjames.io">around 0.5°C</a>, and lasted for around <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/1510/global-effects-of-mount-pinatubo?ref=climate.benjames.io">two years</a>.</li><li>We already put sulfur into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. The sulfur that we’ve emitted so far is already reflecting sunlight, and is currently “masking” <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf?ref=climate.benjames.io">about 0.5°C of warming</a>. Without these particles, we’d already be at 1.8°C warming, not <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/?ref=climate.benjames.io">1.3°C</a>.</li></ol><p>In 2020, the International Maritime Organisation introduced limits on the sulfur content of shipping fuel. It reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by about 8 million tons in its first year - about 10% of the global total.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/F39rdFdSBFguRtWFaPpY4HOSWeqqytXmssL5o7borhUOQUUtS3PETnP7VGvsVAsBHA1JbcTQKXLTDSQGW55RfyGCpRieV35ms81F_XaTJ99wOPHwlHeaMRAqwnEQcuWU5FBmTjNLYdZXOWZnLW9Tu2Y" alt="" loading="lazy" width="726" height="462"><figcaption>Src: <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/?ref=climate.benjames.io">CarbonBrief</a></figcaption></figure><p>This reduction in sulfur emissions has “un-masked” warming that was already there. It’s one of the reasons for the jump in warming in 2023 (though it doesn’t fully explain the abnormality).</p><h4 id="instant-effect">Instant effect</h4><p>Because SRM acts almost instantly, we’d need to phase it in gradually. If we began blasting maximum sulfur tomorrow, we’d cause a sharp fall in temperature that would be a nasty shock to the climate.</p><p>A better plan is to use sulfur to pause our warming at its current level (<a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/?ref=climate.benjames.io">about 1.3 °C</a>) whilst we slash emissions. Eventually SRM would become redundant as methane’s warming falls off, and carbon removal takes effect.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xAXIhmrdzEFZoqH_V00_M0aiSGrbVNC1Go1yBboTfvXXQxdiMHBjwNwRJI7I_9mYD0WIAR24E1bD-xV6bTfB2h75fCMTa1IcuuTcu8_Jygd6NuI0SudNXestPzAYGopfFiOWJD7OZEOg00W7FHOMKjA" alt="" loading="lazy" width="689" height="431"></figure><p>Sulfur disappears from the atmosphere quickly - it rains out after about a year. This means that once we’ve started SRM, it’s dangerous to suddenly stop. We need to keep spraying particles, all the time. If we suddenly stopped, the warming would spring back rapidly, causing a bad temperature shock. The correct way to stop is a gradual phase out.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/n5M4khdhMEN_Jad0vDJxJ5w3FyWgYN5btp5WGDa_FNMjqi0yI2RfiUKxDx7QjPhSIv3-0glODN_JqLe6PIxNwT0tVGuuRAXlZ_z7OJQL7mO0UbVyDKDG_X06BOHF2BHkpCiYHzCNO0VacEqJjXBo_aA" alt="" loading="lazy" width="716" height="262"><figcaption>Piles of sulfur in Canada - a by-product of sweetening oil from Alberta.

Cooling the planet does not remove the CO2 which has accumulated in our atmosphere. It doesn’t stop that CO2 from acidifying the oceans and irreversibly destroying marine biodiversity.</li><li>SRM could make us complacent about dramatically cutting emissions.</li><li>Sulfur increases acid rain (harmful to many life forms) and will likely harm the ozone.</li><li>If SRM is poorly implemented, it could dramatically change weather and rainfall patterns. For example, if sulfur is not injected near the equator, it will not evenly mix into the stratosphere, causing uneven cooling and heating.</li></ol><p>Shifted weather and rainfall patterns are one of the scariest possibilities of SRM. Even if deployed “correctly”, it’s unclear how SRM would affect rainfall and monsoons. Our <a href="https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/sites/hwpi.harvard.edu/files/sgrp/files/irvine_etal_ncc_solar_geoengineering.pdf?m=1564406944&amp;ref=climate.benjames.io">current research</a> suggests that <em>when deployed in the correct locations and volumes</em>, SRM significantly moderates climate hazards everywhere, and significantly exacerbates them nowhere. But we will not know until we try.</p><p>Crucially, the biggest problems with SRM are probably not yet known. The side effects of putting sulfur into the stratosphere could be some of the most consequential unknowns in human history. Clearly, that’s a huge reason to do more research. But still - no matter how much research is done, when humanity tries to bend nature to its will, we can be sure that unintended consequences won’t be far behind.</p><h2 id="srm-will-be-deployed-without-your-consent">SRM will be deployed without your consent</h2><p>Geoengineering will not happen by international consensus.

Imagine you are the leader of a country close to the equator. Crop failures, extreme heat, and city-destroying cyclones mean that your people are without drinkable water, have nowhere to sleep, and cannot feed their children. Mass social unrest and physical violence become normal for your country. SRM is the only action that you can take to turn off the disasters, and prevent your government being overthrown.</p><p>Because SRM is so cheap, it’s completely feasible that one country could do this alone. (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50998056?ref=climate.benjames.io">The Ministry for the Future</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57094295-termination-shock?ref=climate.benjames.io">Termination Shock</a> imagine interest from India, Singapore, Venice, Texas and The Netherlands)</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to turn on the SRM machines will not be made by climate scientists, or carefully calculated risks. It will be made on the basis of nations rising or falling - by starving populations, revolutionaries, and leaders with their back against a wall.</p><p><strong>The conditions only have to align for one country, at one time, to begin geoengineering.</strong></p><h4 id="a-billionaire">A billionaire</h4><p>There are three important things to know about billionaires:</p><ol><li>The business interests of many billionaires face total decimation at the hand of climate-induced conflict and destabilisation.</li><li>Many billionaires attribute their success to being hyper-logical, no-BS, getting shit done, and acting upon contrarian beliefs (sometimes this is even correct). The appeal of SRM to this mindset needs no explanation 🤠</li><li>Some billionaires want to use their money for good. The great challenge of the billionaire is how to convert a fortune into a timeless legacy.</li></ol><p><strong>It doesn’t matter if 99.9% of billionaires think that geoengineering is a terrible idea. It only takes one person rich enough to implement it.</strong></p><h2 id="every-year-srm-inches-towards-%E2%80%9Cthe-logical-choice%E2%80%9D">Every year, SRM inches towards “the logical choice”.</h2><p>Deploying SRM in 2024 is probably not the logical choice. But it’s not long before that changes.</p><h4 id="taking-climate-catastrophe-off-the-table">Taking climate catastrophe off the table</h4><p>The further that we depart from our current temperature, the more we risk runaway changes that we can't control. We don’t know much about when tipping points will occur - we just know that they are out there.</p><p>Why risk the arctic permafrost melting? Why risk losing the Greenland ice sheet? Why risk the tipping points that we don’t even know about?</p><p>These risks increase every year that our emissions are above zero - including every year that we are dramatically reducing emissions.

People also talk about cannons that launch sulfur rockets, and (more practically) high-altitude balloons filled with sulfur and hydrogen/helium.</p><p>It’s easy to imagine a world where amateur enthusiasts launch large sulfur balloons from their backyard, just like hobbyists launch weather balloons today. Scientifically, this would be a terrible idea (remember, we only want to inject sulfur near the equator, in a controlled way). But it’s easy to see the individual appeal of offsetting the warming of<em> hundreds of thousands of people</em> with just a few balloons.</p><h4 id="is-it-only-sulfur-that-will-work">Is it only sulfur that will work?</h4><p>No. In fact, sulfur is unideal for a lot of reasons (it causes acid rain, could harm the ozone, and in general is not friendly to humans). But it mimics the “natural” effects of volcanoes, and our human sulfur emissions already do a lot of cooling, so we know <em>some </em>things about its effects on the atmosphere.</p><p>One promising alternative is calcium carbonate (chalk). Unlike sulfur, it is alkaline, not acidic - which means that it would accelerate the healing of the ozone hole as a co-benefit. <a href="https://nephewjonathan.substack.com/p/diy-geoengineering-the-whitepaper?ref=climate.benjames.io">Here’s a long blog post</a> on the details of calcite geoengineering. </p><p>Harvard has been trying to run a small <a href="https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/frank-keutsch-stratospheric-controlled-perturbation-experiment?ref=climate.benjames.io">experiment called SCoPEx</a> to investigate calcium geoengineering. Despite being a fairly basic experiment (injecting less than a kg of calcium into the atmosphere from a balloon), the project has been stuck in approval committees for several years, because of the controversy of researching geoengineering.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>SRM might not make sense in your mind (it certainly doesn’t in mine).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-layout="tutorial"><a id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a><p>For a long time, centering an element within its parent was a surprisingly tricky thing to do. As CSS has evolved, we've been granted more and more tools we can use to solve this problem. These days, we're spoiled for choice!</p><p>I decided to create this tutorial to help you understand the trade-offs between different approaches, and to give you an arsenal of strategies you can use, to handle centering in all sorts of scenarios.</p><p>Honestly, this turned out to be <em>way more interesting</em> than I initially thought<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->😅. Even if you've been using CSS for a while, I bet you'll learn at least 1 new strategy!</p><div id="centering-with-auto-margins"><h2><a name="centering-with-auto-margins-1" id="centering-with-auto-margins-1" href="#centering-with-auto-margins-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering with auto margins</h2></div><p>The first strategy we'll look at is one of the oldest. If we want to center an element horizontally, we can do so using margins set to the special value <code>auto</code>:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template><!--/$--><p>First, we need to constrain the element's width; by default, elements in Flow layout will expand horizontally to fill the available space, and we can't really center something that is full-width.</p><p>I <em>could</em> constrain the width with a fixed value (eg. <code>200px</code>), but really what I want in this case is for the element to shrinkwrap around its content. <code>fit-content</code> is a magical value that does exactly this. Essentially, it makes “width” behave like “height”, so that the element’s size is determined by its contents.</p><p><strong>Why am I setting <code>max-width</code> instead of <code>width</code>?</strong> Well, my goal is to stop the element from expanding horizontally. I want to clamp its maximum size. If I used <code>width</code> instead, it would lock it to that size, and the element would overflow when the container is really narrow. If you drag that “Container Width” slider all the way to the left, you can see that the element shrinks with its container.</p><p>Now that our element is constrained, we can center it with <em>auto margins</em>.</p><p>I like to think of auto margins like <em>Hungry Hungry Hippos</em>. Each auto margin will try to gobble up as much space as possible. For example, check out what happens if we <em>only</em> set <code>margin-left: auto</code>:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:1"></template><!--/$--><p>When <code>margin-left</code> is the only side with auto margins, <em>all</em> of the extra space gets applied as margin to that side. When we set both <code>margin-left: auto</code> <em>and</em> <code>margin-right: auto</code>, the two hippos each gobble up an equal amount of space. This forces the element to the center.</p><p><em>Also:</em> I've been using <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code> because they're familiar, but there's a better, more-modern way to do this:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:2"></template><!--/$--><p><code>margin-inline</code> will set both <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code> to the same value (<code>auto</code>). It has <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_margin-inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very good browser support</a>, having landed in all major browsers several years ago.</p><p>Even though this centering method has been around forever, I still find myself reaching for it on a regular basis! It's particularly useful when we want to center a single child, without affecting any of its siblings (for example, an image in-between paragraphs in a blog post).</p><p>Let's continue on our centering journey.</p><div id="centering-with-flexbox"><h2><a name="centering-with-flexbox-2" id="centering-with-flexbox-2" href="#centering-with-flexbox-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering with Flexbox</h2></div><p>Flexbox is designed to give us a <em>ton</em> of control when it comes to distributing a group of items along a primary axis.

But what if we want to center an element in a different context? Certain elements like dialogs, prompts, and GDPR banners need to be centered within the viewport.</p><p>This is the domain of <em>positioned layout,</em> a layout mode used when we want to take something out of flow and anchor it to something else.</p><p>Here's what this looks like:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:5"></template><!--/$--><p>Of all the strategies we'll discuss, this one is probably the most complex. Let's break it down.</p><p>We're using <code>position: fixed</code>, which anchors this element to the viewport. I like to think of the viewport like a pane of glass that sits in front of the website, like the window of a train that shows the landscape scrolling by. An element with <code>position: fixed</code> is like a ladybug that lands on the window.</p><p>Next, we're setting <code>inset: 0px</code>, which is a shorthand that sets <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code> all to the same value, <code>0px</code>.</p><p>With only these two properties, the element would stretch to fill the entire viewport, growing so that it's 0px from each edge. This can be useful in some contexts, but it's not what we're going for here. We need to constrain it.</p><p>The exact values we pick will vary on the specifics of each situation, but in general we want to set default values (with <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>), as well as max values (<code>max-width</code> and <code>max-height</code>), so that the element doesn't overflow on smaller viewports.</p><p><strong>There's something interesting here:</strong> we've set up an impossible condition. Our element can't be 0px from the left <em>and</em> 0px from the right <em>and</em> only 12rem wide (assuming the viewport is wider than 12rem). We can only pick 2:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:6"></template><!--/$--><p><strong>The CSS rendering engine resolves this tension by prioritizing.</strong> It will listen to the <code>width</code> constraint, since that seems important. And if it can't anchor to the left <em>and</em> the right, it'll pick an option based on the page's language; so, in a left-to-right language like English, it'll sit along the left edge.</p><p><em>But!</em> When we bring our old friend <code>margin: auto</code> into the equation, something interesting happens. It changes how the browser resolves the impossible condition; instead of anchoring to the left edge, <em>it centers it</em>.</p><p>And, unlike auto margins in <em>Flow</em> layout, we can use this trick to center an element both horizontally <em>and</em> vertically.</p><!--$?--><template id="B:7"></template><!--/$--><p>It's a lot to remember, but there are 4 key ingredients for this trick.</p><ol><li><p>Fixed positioning</p></li><li><p>Anchoring to all 4 edges with <code>inset: 0px</code></p></li><li><p>Constrained width and height</p></li><li><p>Auto margins</p></li></ol><p>We can use the same trick to center something in a single direction. For example, we can build a GDPR cookie banner that is horizontally centered, but anchored near the bottom of the viewport:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:8"></template><!--/$--><p>By omitting <code>top: 0px</code>, we remove the impossible condition in the vertical direction, and our banner is anchored to the bottom edge. As a nice touch, I used the <code>calc</code> function to clamp the max width, so that there's always a bit of buffer around the element.</p><p>I also swapped <code>margin: auto</code> for <code>margin-inline: auto</code>, which isn't strictly necessary, but feels more precise.</p><div id="centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes"><h3><a name="centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes-4" id="centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes-4" href="#centering-elements-with-unknown-sizes-4"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering elements with unknown sizes</h3></div><p>This “fixed position” strategy requires that we give the element a fixed <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>; otherwise, the element will stretch to fill the entire viewport!</p><p>Sometimes, though, we don't want to give the element a fixed size. We want it to be sized based on its contents.</p><p>We can solve this problem using a clever trick with transforms:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:9"></template><!--/$--><p>This works because <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> percentages are based on the <em>viewport’s</em> size, while <code>transform</code> is based on the <em>element’s</em> size. You can think of this as a two-step process:</p><ol><li><p>Using <code>top</code> and <code>left</code>, position the modal so that its top-left corner is right in the center of the viewport.</p></li><li><p>Using <code>transform</code>, slide the element up and back by half of its <em>own</em> size.</p></li></ol><p>Honestly, this isn't my favourite approach. It feels like a hack, and there are some unintuitive consequences; for example, the element can't grow beyond 50% of the viewport’s size. As a result, I don't find myself reaching for this approach super often.</p><div id="centering-with-css-grid"><h2><a name="centering-with-css-grid-5" id="centering-with-css-grid-5" href="#centering-with-css-grid-5"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>Centering with CSS Grid</h2></div><p>The most terse way I know to center something both horizontally and vertically is with CSS Grid:</p><!--$?--><template id="B:a"></template><!--/$--><p>The <code>place-content</code> property is a shorthand for both <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-content</code>, applying the same value to both rows and columns.

In Flexbox, these percentages are calculated based on the parent element, <code>.container</code>, which is what we want.</p><p>In CSS Grid, however, the percentages are <em>relative to the grid cell.</em> We're saying that the child element should be 50% as wide as its column, and 50% as tall as its row.</p><p>Now, we haven't actually given the row/column an explicit size; we haven't defined <code>grid-template-columns</code> or <code>grid-template-rows</code>.

Until now.</p><p>As I write this in early 2024, browser vendors are in the process of implementing <code>align-content</code> in Flow layout, so that it controls the “block” direction alignment of content. It's still early days; this new behaviour is only available in Chrome Canary (<a href="chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features">behind a flag</a>) and Safari Technical Preview.</p><p>(I should note, the demo above is fake.

Temporary chats won't appear in history, won't use memory, and won't be used to train our models. Learn more about temporary chats in our <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Help Center</a>.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--><!--[--><div id="custom-instructions-also-allow-chatgpt-to-be-more-helpful" data-heading=""><p><h2>Custom instructions also allow ChatGPT to be more helpful</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Custom Instructions</a> continue to allow you to provide ChatGPT with direct guidance on what you’d like it to know about you and how you’d like it to respond. For explicit information or instructions, you can add it to your Custom Instructions. For information shared via conversations, ChatGPT can remember relevant details for you.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="evolving-our-privacy-and-safety-standards" data-heading=""><p><h2>Evolving our privacy and safety standards</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Memory brings additional privacy and safety considerations, such as what type of information should be remembered and how it’s used. We’re taking steps to assess and mitigate biases, and steer ChatGPT away from proactively remembering sensitive information, like your health details - unless you explicitly ask it to.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="team-and-enterprises-customers-can-work-more-efficiently" data-heading=""><p><h2>Team and Enterprises customers can work more efficiently</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>For Enterprise and Team users, memory can be useful when using ChatGPT for work. It can learn your style and preferences, and build upon past interactions. This saves you time and leads to more relevant and insightful responses. For example:</p><ul><li>ChatGPT can remember your tone, voice, and format preferences, and automatically apply them to blog post drafts without needing repetition.</li><li>When coding, you tell ChatGPT your programming language and frameworks. It can remember these preferences for subsequent tasks, streamlining the process.</li><li>For monthly business reviews, you securely upload your data to ChatGPT and it creates your preferred charts with three takeaways each.</li></ul><p>As with any ChatGPT feature, you’re in control of your organization’s data. Memories and any other information on your workspace are excluded from training our models. Users have control on how and when their memories are used in chats. In addition, Enterprise account owners can turn memory off for their organization at any time.</p><p>Enterprise and Team users will have access to memory as part of our wider rollout.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="gpts-will-also-have-memory" data-heading=""><p><h2>GPTs will also have memory</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>GPTs will have their own distinct memory. Builders will have the option to enable memory for their GPTs. Like your chats, memories are not shared with builders. To interact with a memory-enabled GPT, you will also need to have memory on. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-z77yDe7Vu-books" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Books GPT</a> helps you find your next read. With memory enabled, it remembers your preferences, such as favorite genres or top books, and tailors recommendations accordingly, without needing repeated inputs.</li></ul><p>Each GPT has its own memory, so you might need to repeat details you’ve previously shared with ChatGPT. For example:</p><ul><li>If you're using the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-SnF78wo4p-artful-greeting-ai-cards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Artful Greeting Card GPT</a> to create a birthday card for your daughter, it won’t know her age or that she loves jellyfish. You’ll need to tell it the relevant details.</li></ul><p>Memory for GPTs will be available when we roll it out more broadly.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

Minnesota doesn’t generally have a reputation as a hotbed for technology, so readers shouldn’t be surprised to hear that reports of Wi-Fi jammers used to assist burglaries in the U.S. go back several years.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🤔 Why BoCoEL?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Large language models are expensive and slow behemoths, and evaluating them on gigantic modern datasets only makes it worse.</p>
<p dir="auto">If only there is a way to just select a meaningful (<em>and small</em>) subset of the corpus and obtain a highly accurate evaluation.....</p>
<p dir="auto">Wait, sounds like <a href="#bo">Bayesian Optmization</a>!</p>
<p dir="auto">Bocoel works in the following steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Encode individual entry into embeddings (way cheaper / faster than LLM and reusable).</li>
<li>Use Bayesian optimization to select queries to evaluate.</li>
<li>Use the queries to retrieve from our corpus (with the encoded embeddings).</li>
<li>Profit.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The evaluations generated are easily managed by the provided manager utility.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🚀 Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>🎯 Accurately evaluate large language models with just tens of samples from your selected corpus.</li>
<li>💂‍♂️ Uses the power of Bayesian optimization to select an optimal set of samples for language model to evaluate.</li>
<li>💯 Evalutes the corpus on the model in addition to evaluating the model on corpus.</li>
<li>🤗 Support for <code>GPT2</code>, <code>Pythia</code>, <code>LLAMA</code> and more through integration with huggingface <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index" rel="nofollow">transformers</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index" rel="nofollow">datasets</a></li>
<li>🧩 Modular design.</li>
<li>🔎 Efficient representation of the corpus / dataset such as N-sphere representation or whitening of the latent space to agument evaluation quality.</li>

<p dir="auto">Simply put, Bayesian optimization aims to optimize either the exploration objective (the purple area in the image) or the exploitation object (the height of the black dots). It uses Gaussian processes as a backbone for inference, and uses an <strong>acquisition function</strong> to decide where to sample next. See <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an a more in-depth introduction.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since <em>Bayesian optimization works well with expensive-to-evaluate black-box model (paraphrase: LLM)</em>, it is perfect for this particular use case. Bocoel uses Bayesian optimization as a backbone for exploring the embedding space given by our corpus, which allows it to select a good subset acting as a mini snapshot of the corpus.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🏎️ Performance Implications</h2>
<p dir="auto">LLMs are painfully slow, especially generative ones (which is what is usually referred to as LLM), since sequence generation is sequential by nature.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite <code>bocoel</code>'s requirement to use an embedder to encode the entire corpus, embedders are faster than LLMs by orders of magnitude and the time is gained back by practically any savings in evaluating LLMs.</p>

From years [decades] of coaching skilled journeyman programmers, I have observed the absence of those patterns. I have seen what a difference introducing the patterns can make.</p><p>Here are ways effective programmers get the most out of their precious 3e9 seconds on the planet.</p><p>The theme here is scaling your brain. The journeyman learns to solve bigger problems by solving more problems at once. The master learns to solve even bigger problems than that by solving fewer problems at once. Part of the wisdom is subdividing so that integrating the separate solutions will be a smaller problem than just solving them together.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Slicing</strong><span>. Take a big project, cut it into thin slices, and rearrange the slices to suit your context. I can always slice projects finer and I can always find new permutations of the slices that meet different needs.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>One thing at a time</strong><span>. We’re so focused on efficiency that we reduce the number of feedback cycles in an attempt to reduce overhead. This leads to difficult debugging situations whose expected cost is greater than the cycle overhead we avoided.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Make it run, make it right, make it fast</strong><span>. (Example of One Thing at a Time, Slicing, and Easy Changes)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Easy changes</strong><span>. When faced with a hard change, first make it easy (warning, this may be hard), then make the easy change. (e.g. slicing, one thing at a time, concentration, isolation). Example of slicing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concentration</strong><span>. If you need to change several elements, first rearrange the code so the change only needs to happen in one element.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Isolation</strong><span>. If you only need to change a part of an element, extract that part so the whole subelement changes.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Baseline Measurement</strong><span>. Start projects by measuring the current state of the world. This goes against our engineering instincts to start fixing things, but when you measure the baseline you will actually know whether you are fixing things.</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Call your shot</strong><span>. Before you run code, predict out loud exactly what will happen.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concrete hypotheses</strong><span>. When the program is misbehaving, articulate exactly what you think is wrong before making a change. If you have two or more hypotheses, find a differential diagnosis.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove extraneous detail</strong><span>. When reporting a bug, find the shortest repro steps. When isolating a bug, find the shortest test case. When using a new API, start from the most basic example. “All that stuff can’t possibly matter,” is an expensive assumption when it’s wrong.</span></p><ul><li><p>E.g. see a bug on mobile, reproduce it with curl</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Multiple scales</strong><span>. Move between scales freely. Maybe this is a design problem, not a testing problem. Maybe it is a people problem, not a technology problem [cheating, this is always true].</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Symmetry</strong><span>. Things that are almost the same can be divided into parts that are identical and parts that are clearly different.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Aesthetics</strong><span>. Beauty is a powerful gradient to climb. It is also a liberating gradient to flout (e.g. inlining a bunch of functions into one giant mess).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rhythm</strong><span>. Waiting until the right moment preserves energy and avoids clutter. Act with intensity when the time comes to act.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Tradeoffs</strong><span>. All decisions are subject to tradeoffs. It’s more important to know what the decision depends on than it is to know which answer to pick today (or which answer you picked yesterday).</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Fun list</strong><span>. When tangential ideas come, note them and get back to work quickly. Revisit this list when you’ve reached a stopping spot.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Feed Ideas</strong><span>. Ideas are like frightened little birds. If you scare them away they will stop coming around. When you have an idea, feed it a little. Invalidate it as quickly as you can, but from data not from a lack of self-esteem.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/fresh-work-80155/1186004658099063" rel="">80/15/5</a><span>. Spend 80% of your time on low-risk/reasonable-payoff work. Spend 15% of your time on related high-risk/high-payoff work. Spend 5% of your time on things that tickle you, regardless of payoff. Teach the next generation to do your 80% job. By the time someone is ready to take over, one of your 15% experiments (or, less frequently, one of your 5% experiments) will have paid off and will become your new 80%. Repeat.</span></p></li></ul><p>The flow in this outline seems to be from reducing risks by managing time and increasing learning to mindfully taking risks by using your whole brain and quickly triaging ideas.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia is releasing an early version of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fai-on-rtx%2Fchat-with-rtx-generative-ai%2F">Chat with RTX</a> today, a demo app that lets you run a personal AI chatbot on your PC. You can feed it YouTube videos and your own documents to create summaries and get relevant answers based on your own data. It all runs locally on a PC, and all you need is an RTX 30- or 40-series GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM.</p><p>I’ve been briefly testing out Chat with RTX over the past day, and although the app is a little rough around the edges, I can already see this being a valuable part of data research for journalists or anyone who needs to analyze a collection of documents.</p><p>Chat with RTX can handle YouTube videos, so you simply input a URL, and it lets you search transcripts for specific mentions or summarize an entire video. I found this ideal for searching through video podcasts, particularly for finding specific mentions in podcasts over the past week amid rumors of Microsoft’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">Xbox strategy shift</a>.</p><p>It wasn’t perfect for searching YouTube videos, though. I tried to search through the transcript of a <em>Verge</em> YouTube video, and Chat with RTX downloaded the transcript for a completely different video. It wasn’t even one that I had queried before, so there are clearly bugs in this early demo.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Chat with RTX is great at searching your local documents." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/376x181/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/384x184/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/415x199/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/480x230/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/540x259/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/640x307/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/750x360/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/828x398/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1080x518/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1200x576/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1440x691/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1920x922/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2048x983/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283482/BQXE3at.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Chat with RTX is great at searching your local documents.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>When it worked properly I was able to find references in videos within seconds. I also created a dataset of <em>FTC v. Microsoft</em> documents for Chat with RTX to analyze. When I was covering the court case last year, it was often overwhelming to search through documents at speed, but Chat with RTX helped me query them nearly instantly on my PC.</p><p>For example, the chatbot did a good job summarizing Microsoft’s entire Xbox Game Pass strategy from internal documents revealed at the trial:</p><div><blockquote><p>Based on the provided context information, Xbox Game Pass is a content subscription service in gaming that provides access to a library of games for a single monthly fee. It is envisioned as a platform that empowers players to play their games anywhere and allows publishers to reach players everywhere. The service is supported by Project xCloud and Xbox Series X, and it aims to create a fertile ground for publishers to monetize their games. The primary strategic objective for the Gaming CSA is to scale Xbox Game Pass, and it is believed that there is a significant subscriber opportunity globally, with a potential of 750 million subscribers. The service faces three primary content dynamics, including the need for differentiated content, expanding beyond console, and limited content supply.</p></blockquote></div><p>I’ve also found this useful to scan through PDFs and fact-check data. Microsoft’s own Copilot system doesn’t handle PDFs well within Word, but Nvidia’s Chat with RTX had no problem pulling out all the key information. The responses are near instant as well, with none of the lag you usually see when using cloud-based ChatGPT or Copilot chatbots.</p><p>The big drawback to Chat with RTX is that it <em>really </em>feels like an early developer demo. Chat with RTX essentially installs a web server and Python instance on your PC, which then leverages Mistral or Llama 2 models to query the data you feed it. It then utilizes Nvidia’s Tensor cores on an RTX GPU to speed up your queries.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Chat with RTX isn’t always accurate, though." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/376x181/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/384x184/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/415x199/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/480x230/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/540x259/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/640x307/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/750x360/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/828x398/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1080x518/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1200x576/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1440x691/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/1920x922/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2048x983/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1229/2400x1152/filters:focal(1280x615:1281x616):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25283483/5UYNJFi.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Chat with RTX isn’t always accurate, though.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>It took around 30 minutes for Chat with RTX to install on my PC, which is powered by an Intel Core i9-14900K processor with an RTX 4090 GPU. The app is nearly 40GB in size, and the Python instance takes up around 3GB of RAM out of the 64GB available on my system.

It also creates JSON files inside the folders you ask it to index, so I wouldn’t recommend using this on your entire Documents folder in Windows. </p><p>I love a good tech demo, though, and Nvidia has certainly delivered that here. It shows the promise of what an AI chatbot can do locally on your PC in the future, especially if you don’t want to have to subscribe to something like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/15/24038711/microsoft-copilot-pro-office-ai-apps">Copilot Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/29/23937497/chatgpt-plus-new-beta-all-tools-update-pdf-data-analysis">ChatGPT Plus</a> just to analyze your personal files.</p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>Before we dive deeper into their problems, it's worth saying that dating apps have helped many people find love. According to a survey of Americans by <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a479b1d13b896b24f13f4b29ff2add1efc1188e7bb77549cf9923f944163fc7a19abeb240af654fa34995d804b949502ee">Pew Research Center published last year</a>, "one-in-ten partnered adults — meaning those who are married, living with a partner or in a committed romantic relationship — met their current significant other through a dating site or app." </p>   <p>But there's an awkward tension at the heart of the dating app business model. They are for-profit tech companies that want to attract as many users as possible and inevitably make money from them. But at the same time, true success for their users — at least for the large population looking for more than just hookups — means that they find love and get off the apps. For each successful match, the dating app loses not just one, but two customers! </p>   <p>Call it the dating app paradox: Dating apps are supposed to be matching lovebirds together, but once they do, the lovebirds fly away — and take their money with them.</p>   <p><strong><em>[Editor's note: This is an excerpt of </em></strong><strong>Planet Money</strong><strong><em>'s newsletter. You can </em></strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/money"><strong><em>sign up here</em></strong></a><strong><em>.]</em></strong></p>   <p>Of all the dating apps, Hinge — a Match Group property that has grown increasingly popular in recent years — is perhaps the most illustrative of the dating app paradox. Hinge markets itself as "the dating app designed to be deleted." How many other companies market themselves this way? Hinge is literally touting success as constantly losing customers. Their social and business missions are in a messy relationship, to say the least.</p>   
   <h3>A viral theory for why dating apps are so bad</h3>   <p>Last month, TikTok user bianca (@infinitebs), who calls herself an "amateur sociologist &amp; silly goose" on her profile, released a <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a4d72c2f4754c01436df5387ae7caacbb0f965c795b3891db6c382e22d56b9d7d9d54f038ac057b017268795cc4c436ab9">viral TikTok video</a> in which she argues that, basically, Hinge is the latest dating app to inevitably fall victim to the core contradiction between its missions of matchmaking and moneymaking. </p>   <p>Hinge, like many other dating apps, has a "freemium" business model, which means you can sign up and use the basic app for free, but extras — like a higher-visibility profile or the ability to message people who have not shown interest in you — cost money. </p>   <p>According to a <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a4549a0172481d038b5f39baf8cfddd65ba209562ae13c6dd50ee093b6e11c59583faa2b5b2c47bbda30d303f73f1cab75">poll published by Pew last year</a>, about a third of Americans who have used dating apps have paid to do so. Morgan Stanley <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a42152fed3a01eb13219e5282bbe917e77b283dc8ed3082e1798b8c253d57ec2935dcdcb5ae8437fd3a03cccc09dc6d0b0">found</a> that dating app users who choose to pay end up spending "between $18 and $19 per month on either subscriptions or a la carte purchases." </p>   <p>But the dating app companies — and their investors — are apparently not satisfied with the number of users who are choosing to pay for their services. With their stock prices in the gutter and their investors clamoring for more revenue, many dating apps have been shifting gears to entice more free users to become paid users.</p>   <p>Like <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a49eb285a4db1da9cf97369769743e73580f85c68e0b46eebf74aa78aa678acaa3ecf9f883a26192527f0f186bda444fac">many</a> other <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a4ae211d45981cda1b3fb1efc0073e4fdcc3e8386dc20a8d0f0b578c7e6dd0d62e0aa8c58db85d08c111fe31248eddffa2">users</a>, Bianca is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/16uodaq/online_dating_has_gotten_worse_recently/?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20240202&amp;utm_term=9250242&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=8562679&amp;orgid=128&amp;utm_att1=">not happy</a> with that. Hinge, she argues, has "hit the inflection point" where its free version is "absolute trash." In its mission to make money, it has been using tricks and schemes — like, she says, putting desirable matches "behind a paywall" — to convince more of its users to pony up and use premium features.</p>   <p>Dating apps aren't alone in seemingly getting worse when they try to make money. In fact, last year journalist Cory Doctorow <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=256751f68502a2a47cab8f5cccbe97c82a50f03aebe7e87369b7a8987174b5a67ff55c99ed28aae3f6830daf3b0275d697772bfd1830b8f4">coined a term</a> for this pattern: "enshittification." Basically, Doctorow says tech platforms start off trying to make their user experiences really good because their first goal is to try to become popular and achieve scale. But over time, they inevitably pursue their ultimate goal of making money, which ends up making the whole user experience "enshittified." </p>   
   <p>Historically at least, daters could find an easy solution if a dating app put its moneymaking interest ahead of its interest in matchmaking and ruined the user experience. That fix: healthy competition. Lovebirds would flock to another app. For example, as Bianca notes in her video, when Tinder went downhill, users headed to Bumble and then eventually to Hinge.  </p>   <p>But unlike previous sagas in the dating app wars, Bianca asserts, a new better app has failed to overtake Hinge. The result: "Dating apps have never been worse than they are now." Bianca is <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/2024/01/29/dating-app-not-working-flop-hinge-tinder-349245?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20240202&amp;utm_term=9250242&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=8562679&amp;orgid=128&amp;utm_att1=">hardly alone</a> in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93k9jd/why-dating-sucks-we-asked-experts?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20240202&amp;utm_term=9250242&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_id=8562679&amp;orgid=128&amp;utm_att1=">asserting</a> that dating apps are now worse than ever. </p>   <p>So if we accept that we've now entered the dark ages of app dating, why isn't competition working anymore? It's possible that new apps are failing to rise and topple the reigning ones because of monopolistic strategies of companies like Match Group, which has been systematically acquiring rivals, including Hinge back <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962ff1a0dea4036eafd3a4279286351fa794fc7efba5de18fd700cf8caf5c4df98899cf6e37ffe834233b40bed324313d9d8">in 2018</a>. </p>   <p>Match Group, of course, denies that its acquisition strategy hurts healthy competition in the dating app market. And it also rejects what we've been calling the dating app paradox. It doesn't see a contradiction between its goals of matchmaking and moneymaking. It sees its social and business missions as in a stable, beautiful marriage. </p>   <p>"Our goal is to make meaningful connections for every single person on our platforms," says a Match Group spokesperson. "Our business model is driven by providing users with great experiences, so they champion our brands and their power to form life-changing relationships. Unlike many other tech platforms, our business is not driven by keeping users engaged on the apps, but by successful outcomes. We receive wedding invitations and hear Match Group love stories every day, and we celebrate those."</p>   <p>Match Group argues, in other words, that its business incentives are aligned with the interests of its users looking for lasting love. But are they really? Sure, app executives may get warm, fuzzy feelings about receiving wedding invitations from their clients. Matched couples may even tell their single friends, helping to convince new people to join their apps. </p>   
   <p>However, we can imagine a dating app business model where its incentives are much more closely aligned with users' hopes of finding love. Imagine the app gets paid only when people successfully match and leave the app! Now that would eliminate the dating app paradox. </p>   <h3>Adverse selection in the dating app market?</h3>   <p>It's possible there's another classic economics problem behind the cycle of dating app degradation. Daters looking for a life partner inevitably confront serious information problems. The people on these apps, after all, are usually complete strangers — and the only information you have about them is what they choose to put on their profiles. That may be fine for people just looking for hookups. But a core challenge for daters looking for true love on these apps: How do you sift through the players and commitment-phobes and find the gems? </p>   <p>Economist George Akerlof won a Nobel Prize for <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962f30dec45c736679f9b464d0c333485e418224bfd6a99ad474094357c965aa3a4a862a616b2d11e186b4deee8ca245a75a">his work</a> explaining how information problems like this can ruin a market. (Fun fact: Akerlof is U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's husband. Now that's a worthy match!) Akerlof famously used the example of used cars to explain how bad information can result in market failures. </p>   <p>It's well known that as soon as you drive a new car off the lot, its value drops precipitously. For a long time, economists explained this phenomenon by claiming that people just place a premium on having a brand-new car. </p>   <p>But Akerlof offered a different explanation: Buyers of used cars lack vital information about what they're buying. When you buy a used car, there's always the chance it could be a lemon. Because of this risk of buying a piece of junk, Akerlof theorized, buyers become unwilling to pay top dollar for them. It's too risky. They treat every car like a potential lemon and demand a discount, even if the cars they're buying may actually look and run great.</p>   
   <p>And that creates a problem for the sellers of used cars that are actually good. These sellers are like, "What the heck?! I <em>know</em> my car isn't a lemon! It's worth way more than what you're willing to pay!" And so they refuse to sell their used car and they exit the market. The result is a market where lemons become more prevalent. </p>   <p>It's a vicious spiral where, as buyers become more suspicious that every car is a lemon, they demand further price markdowns and owners of good used cars become even more unwilling to sell at the lower price. Ultimately, the whole market gets destroyed. Because buyers have a hard time determining good from bad, the lemons drive quality used cars out of the market. Economists call this adverse selection. (<a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962fd217fa4ec389c00a39c2b4d7cb63ebe27ce0e9d2c03394b0d4ed2368fcdefc44b638f4eafa2070f4933073ea9d37a230">Listen to this Planet Money Summer School episode for more</a>. <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962f59e4d9ff7336094d538d78a27210bcdfe756045a1904f764681c702ca2e8934a284e873ba2fcd8526fb3c3d060ed0bd7"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>/</em><a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=0d8ebbdf533f962f4419c24c8224b1ad6729e20bc97d2bce163b074d5d62db65981ba641c5abde414e85818d0a52eecc8a7d124d6b806a67"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a>)</p>   <p>It's possible that dating apps face adverse selection. Basically, a new app starts up, and hopeless romantics looking for real love begin flocking to it. But so do sleazy types who lie on their dating profiles. Over time, the earnest daters go on a bunch of bad dates, encountering people who have no interest in real relationships or whose profiles are completely misleading. </p>   <p>Like lemons driving good cars out of the used-car market, maybe sleazeballs push great catches out of dating apps and ultimately ruin the quality of the whole app experience. So people go to a new app with the hopes of finding something better, and the cycle starts again. </p>   <p>Akerlof saw solutions to the lemon problem. Basically, people need warranties or ways to get better information about what they're buying. We've seen advances like this in the used-car market. For example, the company Carfax <a href="https://click.nl.npr.org/?qs=12dd3a66e2d70c08265ac2364869673409d650c56b685710e051772cb4fd4984e7a549d15f98106f824d326808edb8c0ac3236b729d0491f">offers</a> trusted information about the history of used cars. You can find out about a vehicle's history of accidents or its trips to the mechanic, for instance. This helps buyers overcome their suspicions and helps sellers of good used cars prove their cars are worth top dollar. </p>   
   <p>It's possible that dating apps could try to find similar solutions. Think like a Carfax for daters! Or a rating system, which is Airbnb's solution to this kind of information problem. Of course, daters will probably object to any system that gives your exes the power to rate you :). It's possible, however, that app designers could find more suitable solutions to the information problems of the online dating world.</p>   <p>All this said, maybe dating is just hard, especially now that you can potentially match with a much bigger number of people thanks to technology. Whatever the case, if you're in the market for love, good luck and, ummm, Happy Valentine's Day!</p>   <p><em>Extra listening: Check out our annual Valentine's Day episode in the </em><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money/">Planet Money<em> feed</em></a><em>, where we send love letters to our favorite stories and books and whatever else that other people have made that taught us things or just made us jealous.

There CERN PDF has a space under the heading and the LibreOffice version does not.</p><h2>Emulation</h2><p>To make sure that I knew what the actual original document looked like I decided to use <a href="https://infinitemac.org/1990/System%206.0.5">Infinite Mac</a> to boot a 1990-era Macintosh and run actual Word for Macintosh 4.0 on the original document.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijOiXeCEF_J1oTZBDun1YT3lye7507nTXRpEAUjYW6CQOVFhI6Qb1jGJhDgAJeOEA1BwmDFLqPYnq25JSXaK5zw2oZOFBTvZiVqmNfhf8Vfp4UYQ_HwJzIKuC_a3kAfvGNhR3U6rSlB77KUFilVUX2lVL7SKnnaQU4ZHkwilImtVFGqKak4kG1w/s1411/proposal-9.png"><img data-original-height="1081" data-original-width="1411" height="490" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijOiXeCEF_J1oTZBDun1YT3lye7507nTXRpEAUjYW6CQOVFhI6Qb1jGJhDgAJeOEA1BwmDFLqPYnq25JSXaK5zw2oZOFBTvZiVqmNfhf8Vfp4UYQ_HwJzIKuC_a3kAfvGNhR3U6rSlB77KUFilVUX2lVL7SKnnaQU4ZHkwilImtVFGqKak4kG1w/w640-h490/proposal-9.png" width="640"></a></p><p>That way I can see actual fonts, font sizes and layout to confirm how the document should have looked. And that's where it became obvious that the original document on the original Mac and the CERN PDF are quite different. The CERN PDF has 20 pages. On the Mac running Word for Macintosh 4.0 with A4 paper it has 22 pages. So I decided to aim to get us close to the original document on the Mac.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM3_thqxV_ZB-VqLJRytn7oA8LbAMlQ2a3kRZrubYhWt4M8ns2R-3nHFXFG-367BDUJQkHtLO6oqFNrZWGXhwlQfarVp_ih1SDBgBWsWGBKqKmZUYD51WLmLIGCQ1no0EcAPeTidkHBb52Y-EY7AXYnBX9nll33G7FuZofLN9XgpD0bWak-T1ONQ/s1389/proposal-10.png"><img data-original-height="1062" data-original-width="1389" height="490" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjM3_thqxV_ZB-VqLJRytn7oA8LbAMlQ2a3kRZrubYhWt4M8ns2R-3nHFXFG-367BDUJQkHtLO6oqFNrZWGXhwlQfarVp_ih1SDBgBWsWGBKqKmZUYD51WLmLIGCQ1no0EcAPeTidkHBb52Y-EY7AXYnBX9nll33G7FuZofLN9XgpD0bWak-T1ONQ/w640-h490/proposal-10.png" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>So... set to A4 paper and set right margin to same size as left margin.

            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 13:53:56 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/tesla_cybertruck_rust/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/tesla_cybertruck_rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39357595">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>It's only been a few months since Tesla's long-awaited Cybertruck made its way to those at the front of the queue, but the arrival has been tarnished for some.</p>
<p>CEO Elon Musk first unveiled the electric pickup model <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/22/smashing_tesla_cybertruck/">back in 2019</a>, claiming that its "ultra-hard stainless steel" body and "transparent metal" glass were "literally bulletproof."</p>
<p>Though beset with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/17/first_tesla_cybertrunk/">production issues</a> and missing its speculative 2021-22 release, its unique polygonal design – as with anything Tesla and Musk-related – attracted legions of devotees eager to get their hands on the steering wheel.</p>

    

<p>This unique design isn't without shortfalls, at least according to reports in the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> forum. A trending thread titled "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/rust-spots-corrosion-is-the-norm.11988/">Rust Spots/Corrosion is the Norm</a>" from a user going by "Raxar" states:</p>

<p>This, as you might expect, provoked a strong reaction from the faithful. "Liar. Is this fun for you?" one asked, while another incorrectly riposted: "If it 'rusts', it's not stainless steel." This is a common misconception. Stainless steel is resistant to rust, but not completely immune.</p>
<p>Members pondered whether orange stains could be caused by "rail dust" from certain vehicles being delivered via train, yet Raxar <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/rust-spots-corrosion-is-the-norm.11988/post-240328">posted some images</a> of his Cybertruck's body after driving it for "2 days in rain."</p>

        


        

<p>The tiny specks may not seem like a big deal, but given that the Cybertruck price went from $40,000 in 2019 to $60,000 in 2023, we understand why owners might want their cars to appear pristine at all times.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-spots-corrosion.12242/">separate thread</a>, another user, vertigo3pc, reported that "corrosion was forming on the metal" of his brand-new Cybertruck after 11 days in the "LA rain," leading some to worry that the steel body was becoming contaminated during production.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/24/tesla_cybertruck_offroading_video/">Tesla Cybertruck gets cyberstuck during off-roading expedition</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/19/musk_says_boat_mod_package/">Musk floats idea of boat mod for Cybertruck</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/15/tesla_reverses_course_on_cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck no-resale clause vanishes faster than a Model S in Ludicrous Mode</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/13/want_a_cybertruck_then_youre/">Want a Cybertruck? You're stuck with it for a year, says Tesla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, corrosion reports may stem from owners believing that "ultra-hard stainless steel" doesn't require much care. Tesla, it appears, would vehemently disagree.</p>
<p>Another thread from January <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/cybertruck-corrosion-per-owner-manual.11445/">included a screenshot of Cybertruck's maintenance documentation</a>, where it is said that the car does not have a clear coat. Clear coat is the outermost layer of transparent paint that serves as a protective barrier, preventing UV radiation and weather from damaging the colored paint layer. Clear coat also takes abrasions that might otherwise scratch the paint job.</p>

        

<p>The user warns: "The Cybertruck's exterior is susceptible to corrosion, as acknowledged in the manual. Once the oxide barrier is compromised, corrosion initiates. The manual advises prompt removal of corrosive substances, emphasizing not to wait until the Cybertruck is scheduled for a full wash."</p>
<p>The documentation says: "To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck is due for a complete wash. If necessary use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol."</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of work if even a five-minute dash for milk might result in a midge besmirching the body. Tesla explicitly states: "The stainless steel exterior of Cybertruck is more resistant to dents and dings than most other vehicles. However, Cybertruck does not have a clear coat on the surface of the exterior body panels, meaning any scratches that appear are in the stainless steel panels themselves."</p>

        

<p><em>The Register</em> asked Tesla whether it agreed with the description of Cybertruck corrosion as the "norm," and if not, what the company expected to cause the spots documented. We will update the article if a response is forthcoming. ®</p>

<p dir="auto">Sparkle 2 adds support for application sandboxing, custom user interfaces, updating external bundles, and a more modern architecture which includes faster and more reliable installs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Pre-releases when available can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases">Sparkle's Releases</a> or on your favorite package manager. More nightly builds can be downloaded by selecting a recent <a href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/actions?query=event%3Apush+is%3Asuccess+branch%3A2.x">workflow run</a> and downloading the corresponding Sparkle-distribution artifact.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current status for future versions of Sparkle is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/milestones">its roadmap</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please visit <a href="http://sparkle-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Sparkle's website</a> for up to date documentation on using and migrating over to Sparkle 2. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/CHANGELOG">Changelog</a> for a more detailed list of changes. More internal design documents to the project can be found in the repository under <a href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/Documentation">Documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Seamless. There's no mention of Sparkle; your icons and app name are used.</li>
<li>Secure. Updates are verified using EdDSA signatures and Apple Code Signing. Supports Sandboxed applications in Sparkle 2.</li>
<li>Fast. Supports delta updates which only patch files that have changed and atomic-safe installs.</li>
<li>Easy to install. Sparkle requires no code in your app, and only needs static files on a web server.</li>
<li>Customizable. Sparkle 2 supports plugging in a custom UI for updates.</li>
<li>Flexible. Supports applications, package installers, preference panes, and other plug-ins. Sparkle 2 supports updating external bundles.</li>
<li>Handles permissions, quarantine, and automatically asks for authentication if needed.</li>
<li>Uses RSS-based appcasts for release information. Appcasts are a de-facto standard supported by 3rd party update-tracking programs and websites.</li>
<li>Stays hidden until second launch for better first impressions.</li>
<li>Truly self-updating — the user can choose to automatically download and install all updates in the background.</li>
<li>Ability to use channels for beta updates (in Sparkle 2), add phased rollouts to users, and mark updates as critical or major.</li>
<li>Progress and status notifications for the host app.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Runtime: macOS 10.13 or later.</li>
<li>Build: Latest major Xcode (stable or beta, whichever is latest) and one major version less.</li>
<li>HTTPS server for serving updates (see <a href="http://sparkle-project.org/documentation/app-transport-security/" rel="nofollow">App Transport Security</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/" rel="nofollow">getting started guide</a>. No code is necessary, but a bit of configuration is required.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Troubleshooting</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Please check <strong>Console.app</strong> for logs under your application. Sparkle prints detailed information there about all problems it encounters. It often also suggests solutions to the problems, so please read Sparkle's log messages carefully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Use the <code>generate_appcast</code> tool which creates appcast files, correct signatures, and delta updates automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Make sure the URL specified in <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/customization/" rel="nofollow"><code>SUFeedURL</code></a> is valid (typos/404s are a common error!), and that it uses modern TLS (<a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" rel="nofollow">test it</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API symbols</h3>
<p dir="auto">Sparkle is built with <code>-fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden</code> which means no symbols are exported by default.
If you are adding a symbol to the public API you must decorate the declaration with the <code>SU_EXPORT</code> macro (grep the source code for examples).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the distribution package</h3>
<p dir="auto">You do not usually need to build a Sparkle distribution unless you're making changes to Sparkle itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build a Sparkle distribution, <code>cd</code> to the root of the Sparkle source tree and run <code>make release</code>. Sparkle-<em>VERSION</em>.tar.xz (or .bz2) will be created and revealed in Finder after the build has completed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, build the Distribution scheme in the Xcode UI.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Code of Conduct</h3>
<p dir="auto">We pledge to have an open and welcoming environment. See our <a href="https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

        </header>
        <p>It’s pretty weird for a startup to remain in stealth for over five years. People ask me why we did that, and my answer is always the same: “We wanted to build something awesome before releasing it out into the wild, and we were lucky enough to be able to do that under the radar while also attracting great hires, finding early customers, and working with investors.” All the same, it’s an unnatural thing for a startup to do. A lot of muscles end up atrophying, including those you use to talk to the world.   Fortunately, we’re going to get a lot of practice at it now, because in those five years we’ve built a lot of stuff – way more than I can tell you about right now. But I can tell you the first part of it.</p>
<h4>Why We Built This</h4>
<p>Some of you have heard of our last company, FoundationDB. At first glance, Antithesis couldn’t be more different from FoundationDB, but it’s also a continuation of that story in a funny sort of way. When we sat down in 2010 to build a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed database with ACID transactions, most people didn’t even think it was possible.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> We were agnostic as to whether it was possible or impossible, but we were certain that even under the best circumstances, it would be very hard. And the part that seemed hardest was how on earth you could test or validate such a thing, and how you could gain confidence in its correctness.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem of software testing—you might say the fundamental problem of software <em>development</em>—is that software has to handle many situations that the developer has never thought of or will never anticipate. This limits the value of testing, because if you had the foresight to write a test for a particular case, then you probably had the foresight to make the code handle that case too. This makes conventional testing great for catching regressions, but really terrible at catching all the “unknown unknowns” that life, the universe, and your endlessly creative users will throw at you.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="solving the wrong problem" src="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/images/wrong%20problem.jpeg">
</p>
<p>This isn’t unique to distributed databases: every kind of software has this problem, but a distributed storage system really turns it up to 11. Now you’ve got concurrency, both within each machine and between machines. You’ve got networks, which always seem to be delaying or reordering packets at the worst possible moments, and disks, which are just waiting for you to look away so they can start vomiting all over your data. And then you’ve got all the stuff that can <em>really</em> go wrong—machine failures and power outages and datacenters catching fire and, oh yeah, well-meaning human beings panicking and accidentally making things worse. What’s especially hard about these failure modes is that they’re <em>non-deterministic</em>—you can easily have a catastrophic bug that’s exquisitely dependent on the precise ordering of events across multiple machines in a cluster. Even if your tests find it once, they may never find it again (but don’t worry, your customers will find it for you). And here we were, trying to make a software system that would behave <em>perfectly</em> and maintain its ACID guarantees in the face of all of this. How were we going to do that?</p>
<p>So we did something crazy, which turned out to be the best decision we made in the whole history of the company. Before we even started writing the database, we first wrote a fully-deterministic event-based network simulation that our database could plug into. This system let us simulate an entire cluster of interacting database processes, all within a single-threaded, single-process application, and all driven by the same random number generator. We could run this virtual cluster, inject network faults, kill machines, simulate whatever crazy behavior we wanted, and see how it reacted. Best of all, if one particular simulation run found a bug in our application logic, we could run it over and over again with the same random seed, and the exact same series of events would happen in the exact same order. That meant that even for the weirdest and rarest bugs, we got infinity “tries” at figuring it out, and could add logging, or do whatever else we needed to do to track it down. I gave a talk about this at Strangeloop in 2014, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fFDFbi3toc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, we did this for a while and found all of the bugs in the database. I know, I know, that’s an insane thing to say. It’s kind of true though. In the entire history of the company, I think we only ever had one or two bugs reported by a customer. <em>Ever</em>. Kyle Kingsbury aka “aphyr” didn’t even bother testing it with Jepsen, because he didn’t think he’d find anything.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="aphyr-twitter-fdb" src="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/images/aphyr_twitter_fdb.png">
</p>
<p>It was a good database. But actually, this is not the cool part of the story.</p>
<p>Here is the cool part of the story. The cool part is what happened after we found all the bugs in the database. You see, once you’ve found all the bugs in something, and you have very powerful tests which can find any new ones, programming feels completely different. I’ve only gotten to do this a few times in my career, and it’s hard to convey the feeling in words, but I have to try. It’s like being half of a cyborg, or having a jetpack, or something. You write code, and then you ask the computer if the code is correct, and if not then you try again. Can you imagine having a genie, or an oracle, which just <em>tells you</em> whether you did something wrong? The closest comparison I have is the way some people talk about programming in Haskell or in Rust, where after half an hour of siege warfare against the compiler, it agrees to build something, and you can be confident that it won’t have certain kinds of bugs. But there’s a limit to what a compiler can tell you. I love me a powerful type system, but it’s not the same as actually running your software in thousands and thousands of crazy situations you’d never dreamed of.</p>
<p>At FoundationDB, once we hit the point of having ~zero bugs and confidence that any new ones would be found immediately, we entered into this blessed condition and we flew. Programming in this state is like living life surrounded by a force field that protects you from all harm. Suddenly, you feel like you can take risks. We did crazy stuff. We deleted all of our dependencies (including Zookeeper) because they had bugs, and wrote our own Paxos implementation in very little time and it <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf">had no bugs</a>. We rewrote the entire transaction processing subsystem of our database to make it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8729420">faster and more scalable</a> – a bonkers thing to do btw – and the project was shockingly not a debacle, and oh yeah it had no bugs. We had built this sophisticated testing system to make our database more solid, but to our shock that wasn’t the biggest effect it had. The biggest effect was that it gave our tiny engineering team the productivity of a team 50x its size.</p>
<p>In 2015, Apple acquired FoundationDB and began using it as the “underpinning of their cloud infrastructure” (that’s a <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/fdb-paper.pdf">direct quotation</a> from Apple, so they can’t sue me), and then <a href="https://github.com/apple/foundationdb">open sourced</a> it a few years later. As our team began to disperse throughout other big tech companies, we were shocked to find that even in these sophisticated organizations, nothing like FoundationDB's deterministic simulation testing existed. The near-impossibility of anticipating unintended system impacts meant that changes to their backend systems happened at a snail's pace, and diagnosing and fixing production bugs consumed months of extremely valuable time from some of their most senior engineers.</p>
<p>So I called up my friend and former boss Dave Scherer (FoundationDB’s chief architect), and told him: “There’s a $100 bill lying on the sidewalk here man.” Of course, economic theory will tell you that those don’t exist. There’s always a catch, always some horrible reason that the pot of gold is surrounded by corpses. But starting a company is about banishing that thought and telling yourself that when you reach the pit full of poisonous spikes, you’ll figure something out. So in 2018, we started Antithesis with the goal of bringing the superpower of FoundationDB-style deterministic autonomous testing to everybody else.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="poison-spikes" src="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/images/poison%20spikes.png">
</p>
<h4>What We've Built</h4>
<p>Sure enough, the $100 bill is surrounded by an entire <em>field</em> of poisonous spike-pits, nay, a <em>continent</em> of them. Here’s an obvious one: how do you take an arbitrary piece of software, which is probably doing stuff like spawning threads, checking the time, asking the kernel for random numbers, and talking to other software over a network, and make it deterministic? At FoundationDB we had the benefit of a green-field project that we knew we wanted to test this way, and we had no dependencies (or at least, we didn’t once we’d deleted them all). But any new software development methodology that requires everybody to rewrite everything from scratch isn’t going to get very far. We thought about this and decided to just go all out and write a hypervisor which emulates a deterministic <em>computer</em>. Consequently, we can force anything inside it to be deterministic. That meant learning lots of fun new things about how Intel CPUs handle extended page tables and other related horrors. It’s a story for another time, but it’s a good example of the kind of poisonous spike-pit we’ve gotten to explore (and it’s far from the worst one!).<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyway, we’ve built a platform that takes your software and hunts for bugs in it. When it finds one, that bug is always perfectly reproducible, no matter what crazy thing your software was doing–even if it involves multiple services communicating across a network. Also, once we’ve found a bug, we can bring some relatively space-age and insane debugging capabilities to bear on it. The platform is designed to be able to someday find many kinds of bugs in many kinds of software, but for now, we’re focused solely on distributed systems reliability / fault tolerance testing, because it’s an area where we already know what we’re doing.</p>
<p>Over the past several years we’ve partnered with engineering teams at a bunch of organizations with big and complicated systems whose reliability they consider critical. We’ve worked with <a href="https://antithesis.com/case_studies/mongodb_productivity">MongoDB for several years</a>, helping them test their core server software as well as their WiredTiger storage engine. We began working with the Ethereum Foundation about a year ahead of the Merge in order to <a href="https://antithesis.com/case_studies/ethereum_merge">help them test it</a>, and continue working with them today. And we’re working with Palantir—but when I told them I was writing this blog post they just glared at me and said “no comment”, so that’s all I can say about that.</p>
<p>Initially, these customers thought of Antithesis as a “special forces” tool that primarily helped them find and replicate their most elusive and dangerous bugs. But as our platform has become more mature and interactive, we’ve shifted to being an “always on” service that continuously tests the most recent builds of their software, thus shortening the time from bug introduction to bug discovery. When building FoundationDB, we found that this made diagnosing and fixing bugs dramatically easier, increasing our efficiency and improving our software quality. Our customers are seeing this effect now, and we’re excited to help many more of you reach the ~zero bugs promised land in the years to come.</p>

<p><span>FOSDEM 2024</span> The computer industry faces a number of serious problems, some imposed by physics, some by legacy technology, and some by inertia. There may be solutions to some of these, but they're going to hurt.</p>
<p>In a previous role, the <em>Reg</em> FOSS desk gave three talks at the FOSDEM open source conference in Brussels. In 2023, I proposed one under the banner of the <em>Reg</em>, so some of the points hearken back to earlier articles. Unfortunately, since submitting the proposal in October something sad happened, even if it was inevitable. A giant of twentieth century software design, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/04/niklaus_wirth_obituary/">Niklaus Wirth died</a>. As a small tribute, I decided to change the way I introduced this talk.</p>
<p>Wirth is famous for one thing, but arguably, it wasn't the biggest aspect of his career. To pick a superficially small but pervasive example: the computers Unix was written on used teletypes as their terminals. These were, very roughly, printers with a typewriter keyboard on them. Teletypes are why Linux console device files are called <code>tty</code>.</p>

    

<p>Typewriters have a shift key, and often not much else. But computer keyboards have lots of modifier keys: <em>Control</em> and <em>Alternate</em> (or "Option" or "Meta") and <em>Super</em> (or "Command" or "Windows"). The bits in memory which represent if one of these are pressed down are called <em>Bucky bits</em>… Because Niklaus Wirth studied in, and taught in, and loved, California, and his nickname there was "Bucky".</p>

        


        

<p>Bucky Wirth didn't just invent Pascal. Pascal grew out of a proposal to improve Algol. The Algol committee turned it down and picked someone else's, more complicated, idea instead. That became Algol 68 and killed the language forever. As a result, we got other languages that were the indirect offspring of Algol: which took Algol's ideas and changed them. Languages such as BCPL, which was turned into B, which became C – and C++ and everything built from them.</p>
<p>All because the Algol guys didn't like Bucky Wirth's simple, clean, proposal. Wirth went on to create Pascal. This was a big hit. A large part of the Apple Lisa operating system was implemented in Pascal, and that went on to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/29/mac_at_40_real_significance/">profoundly influence the Mac</a>. A Unix was implemented in a Pascal dialect, too. It was called <a href="https://archive.org/details/concurrenteuclid00holt" rel="nofollow">TUNIS: the Toronto University System</a>, and it was written in a Pascal derivative called Concurrent Euclid.</p>

        

<p>Pascal became Turbo Pascal which became <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/02/14/25_years_delphi_programming/">Borland Delphi</a> and drove the success of Microsoft Windows 3. Delphi was, for a while, huge. But Wirth ignored all that and went on to write a successor, called Modula. Then he threw that away and wrote a successor with built-in concurrency called Modula-2.</p>
<p>Late in Wirth's career, he became a passionate advocate of small software. He wrote a wonderful short article about this. It's called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Plea For Lean Software</a> [PDF], and it's only a few pages long. Read it. It's worth it. It won't take long. As a proof of concept of the validity of the concept, Wirth moved on from Modula-2 and wrote his masterpiece, <a href="http://www.projectoberon.net/" rel="nofollow">Project Oberon</a>. Oberon is a tiny Pascal-like language, with concurrency primitives. But it's also a compiler for the language, and an IDE for it. That IDE is also a tiling-window based OS in its own right. For the obituary I wrote for Prof.&nbsp;Wirth, I downloaded the source code of the core of Project Oberon and ran a line count. It comes out a bit over 4000 lines. Specifically, some 4,623 lines of code, in 262kB of text.</p>
<p>That's a self-hosting bare-metal OS. It is <em>unbelievably</em> tiny.</p>

        

<p>Debian 12, for comparison, is 1,341,564,204 lines of code. That's the <a href="https://micronews.debian.org/2023/1686455026.html" rel="nofollow">project's own estimate</a>. One and a third <em>billion</em>, that is, one and a third <em>thousand million</em> lines of code. For comparison, Google Chrome is about 40 million lines, which is in the same ballpark as the Linux kernel these days.</p>
<p><em>Nobody</em> can read the source code of Chrome. Not alone, not as a team. Humans don't live long enough. Any group that claims to have gone through the code and de-Googlized it is lying: all that's possible to do is some searches, and try to measure what traffic it emits. A thousand people working for a decade couldn't read the entire thing.</p>
<p>This is the sort of size of codebase that we are building the internet from these days.</p>
<p>These projects are so incomprehensibly vast that no human mind can comprehend even one small isolated subset of the entire thing.</p>
<p>We consider this normal. Everything is like that. It's just how it is. Computers are big, storage is cheap, interconnects are fast, and it works and it scales and it is all pretty amazing compared to the systems I started working with.</p>
<p>A hobby of mine is trying to clearly define some of what I call the Big Lies in computing. In 2022 I wrote that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/04/you_cannot_buy_software/">you can't buy software</a>. That means <em>you</em>, the reader, can't. Cash-rich multinational corporations absolutely can buy software, and they often do. But mere users can't. All <em>we</em> get are licenses that say we own the right to use one copy, or if you own a business, so many copies… and anyway, you don't get the source code, or any kind of guarantee.</p>
<p>That, of course, is why Free Software has done so well. If only big companies really own software then the only remaining choice is software that nobody owns and nobody controls and that's built and maintained by its community of users. That's why FOSDEM exists.</p>
<p>So, let's move on to another big lie:</p>
<p>Computers aren't much faster now than they were a decade ago, and they will probably never again return to the rate of performance improvement they had for 60 years up to the mid-noughties.</p>
<p>Moore's Law is over, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/11/software_versus_hardware/">replaced by Koomey's law</a>. Now, computers use less electricity, emit less heat, and they continue to get smaller and cheaper… but they're not getting massively faster the way that they did in the 20th century. Many <em>Reg</em> readers will remember the Pentium 4, Intel's space-heater chip launched in 2000, and which the company planned to ramp up to 10 gigaHertz by 2005.</p>
<p>It didn't happen. We got the smaller, cooler-running Pentium M instead, which evolved into the Core, Core 2 and then Core i-thingy ranges today. And thanks to AMD, they are 64-bit now. What we got instead of much faster processor cores are <em>more</em> processor cores.</p>
<p>The thing is, that doesn't scale very well. On the desktop we have four-core machines and now we're moving to eight-plus cores, but a single person can't use that very helpfully, so instead, we're getting computers with a mixture of high-performance but hot, power-hungry cores, and lower-performance, cooler, but more electrically-efficient cores.</p>
<p>As Sophie Wilson, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/05/02/unsung_heroes_of_tech_arm_creators_sophie_wilson_and_steve_furber/">co-creator of the Arm chip</a>, observed, the silicon chip industry is very good at finding ways of selling more and more products to us that we can't use because they <em>must</em> spend ever-increasing amounts of time turned off and not doing anything – or the device will incinerate itself.</p>
<p>Server chips have lots more cores, of course, because servers can use that better, but that has a ceiling too. Look it up: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" rel="nofollow">it's called Amdahl's law</a>, after the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/11/13/gene_amdahl_obit/">late great Gene Amdahl</a>, and it's quite scary. Even if a program can be made 95 per cent parallel, the maximum speedup you can get is about 20 times, <strong>no matter how many processor cores you throw at it.</strong></p>
<p>Once we started to get multi-core processors, Moore's Law meant that the transistor budget was spent on getting wider, not faster. Now we are getting built-in dedicated silicon for rendering 3D graphics, often disabled in favour of more powerful off-chip rendering silicon. Silicon for matrix arithmetic. Hardware dedicated to accelerating certain cryptography algorithms. Silicon for modelling neural networks for so-called "AI" features. ("AI" is another big lie, but one I won't go into here.)</p>
<p>These CPU components aren't the only bits that are getting faster: computers' other subsystems are improving, too. Memory is getting faster. Solid state storage is getting faster, although <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/01/optane_intel_cancellation/">as I wrote last year</a>, the most exciting kind of non-volatile memory – a bold attempt to bypass a whole pile of legacy bottlenecks and move non-volatile storage right onto the CPU memory bus – flopped. It was killed by legacy software designs.</p>
<p>All this stuff helps certain specific functions, but it doesn't make your general programs go faster.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, for one of the UK's leading computer magazines, I ported their in-house benchmark suite from 16-bit Windows to 32-bit Windows. I do know a <em>little</em> about benchmarking. Benchmark vendors now include tasks like video compression in their tests, even though most computer users never do that, just because the benchmark-sellers need some way to test the performance of multi-core chips. Multicore processors <em>do</em> manage to execute some stuff faster, and benchmarks need to show that.</p>
<p>These performance numbers aren't lies, exactly… but they are no longer relevant to ordinary desktop or laptop computing. Nor, mostly, are they relevant to server computing either.</p>
<p>So, yes, computers are still getting a little bit quicker every year and a half… but the thing is that up until about twenty years ago, they doubled in speed that often. Now it's a mere ten or 15 per cent. Unfortunately, our worldwide computing industry evolved to fit a market where microprocessors just kept getting faster, which they did, consistently, for about thirty years.</p>
<p>This industry is, by nature, unable to adapt to a world where that no longer happens – and never will again. The result is spiralling software bloat. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/lean-software-development" rel="nofollow">Even the IEEE says so</a>. The industry is profitable because most of this software is in unsafe programming languages, or marginally safer ones that are <em>implemented</em> in unsafe languages… resulting in a teetering stack of dozens of layers of flakey unreliable code, which in turn needs thousands and millions of people constantly patching the holes in it, and needs customers to pay to get those fixes fast, and keep paying for them for years to come.</p>
<p>The world runs on software, produced and consumed on an industrial scale, always getting bigger and more complicated.</p>
<p>Nobody understands it any more. Nobody can. It's too big. But it's the only model of making and selling software we have, so we are trapped in it.</p>
<p>And, because computers aren't getting much quicker, as it gets bigger, software is getting slower. That's why we're not seeing big exciting new features, new capabilities and tools.</p>
<p>Thanks to Koomey's Law, as we reach a quarter of the way through the 21st century, even pocket devices can throw around high-definition video streams. Thanks to vast server farms, they can understand speech and natural language… kinda sorta. But they can struggle to recognize our faces, and cannot read expressions or tone of voice. We can't mix speech with other UIs, and it's been so long since we standardized UI design that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/24/rise_and_fall_of_cua/">we've forgotten how to do it</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, we have some big problems in this industry, and we are not confronting them. Software is vast, and vastly complicated, and nobody can adequately understand it all.</p>
<p>It is too big to usefully change, or optimise. All we can do is nibble around the edges, removing bits here, making other bits a bit faster. It's almost fractal, so there are a near infinite number of edges to nibble at… but it's still getting bigger, so the problems are getting harder all the time.</p>
<p>This also means we can't <em>check</em> the whole thing. It's too big. All we can do is have a lot of people watching it for when it goes wrong, try to trace what happened, and fix that symptom.</p>
<p>Computers are getting more parallel. But, as far as anyone knows, it is simply impossible to automatically take algorithms and parallelise them. Only a human mind can do that, and yes, usually, it is <em>a</em> mind, in the singular.</p>
<p>That means that only chunks that can fit into one mind can be refactored like this.</p>
<p>This level of bloat is a crisis that Wirth foresaw when it was one per cent of today, when Windows 95 <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050819-10/?p=34513" rel="nofollow">fit onto 13 floppies</a>, and what he pleaded with the industry to consider and address.</p>

</ul>
<p>There is an urgent need for smaller, simpler software. When something is too big to understand, then you can't take it apart and make something smaller out of it.</p>
<p>You can trim it a bit, but to make profound changes, you have to go back to the planning stage, reconsider what you need, throw away what you don't, and try to make some minimum viable product that does the essentials and nothing else.</p>
<p>This is the existential crisis facing the software industry today, and it has no good answers. But there may be some out there, which is what we will look at next.</p>

        <p>Mathematics teacher <a href="https://github.com/sarah11918"><u>Sarah Rainsberger</u></a> wasn’t planning to become an open source contributor when she started rebuilding her choir’s website. She just wanted to learn JavaScript and web development for fun. “I wasn't a programmer, but I often found I was the only remotely technical person in a group,” she explained. “That’s how I ended up building the choir website in the first place.”</p>
<p>
She settled on using the front-end framework <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro"><u>Astro</u></a>, which was brand new at the time. It had fewer resources for learners than more established frameworks, but she thought following along as the project grew would be a good way to learn. She soon found herself contributing a small piece of code—a configuration file—to the project. Then, as the project grew, Rainsberger became increasingly involved with the community, fielding questions and supporting new Astro users. “I wasn’t the person who knew the most about the inner workings of the project, but I knew how to explain stuff and guide people through the learning process,” she says. “And I knew who to ask when there was something I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>Today, Rainsberger is part of Astro’s core maintainer group. But she still isn’t particularly involved in the codebase, even as she’s deepened her web development skills. As the documentation lead, she spends her time helping others learn the ins and outs of Astro.</p>

<p>When we think about “contributors” in open source, all too often we think of those who write code, whether that's adding features or fixing bugs. But open source projects are more than just code. Much of the work that goes into open source is the type of work Rainsberger does.</p>

<p>“The things you need for a successful open source project overlap with what you need for a successful commercial product,” says <a href="https://github.com/geekygirldawn"><u>Dawn Foster</u></a>, an open source community manager currently working as director of open source community strategy at VMware. “That includes documentation, localization, marketing, graphic design, testing, community management, and release management.”</p>

<p>It’s difficult to overstate how important non-code contributions are to open source. “Even if you write an amazing program, no one will use it if you don’t explain what it does and how to use it,” says <a href="https://github.com/nate-double-u"><u>Nate Waddington</u></a>, a developer advocate at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation with a background in design. A very simple project might just need a README, but the more complex the project, the more documentation, tutorials, and support are needed to make the code useful. Easy-to-source documentation boosts productivity by about 50% in both open source and enterprise software projects, according to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/2021/"><u>2021 State of the Octoverse</u></a> report. Graphic design, branding, and outreach, meanwhile, help signal the health and seriousness of a project that other projects or companies might leverage as dependencies.</p>

<p>While there are plenty of opportunities for non-technical folks to contribute to open source, non-code contributions aren’t necessarily non-technical. Certain testing, documentation, and support tasks might require deep knowledge of a codebase. As more and more people seek to contribute to open source to advance their careers, give back to the community, or both, it’s important to remember that these non-code contributions are crucial to open source and provide plenty of opportunities to develop technical and non-technical skills alike.</p>



<h3><b>Why YOU should make non-code contributions</b></h3>

<p>Adding features or fixing bugs might sound more glamorous than localizing documentation, providing support, or filing reproducible bug reports—especially if your goal is to use open source contributions as a path toward employment. But making non-code contributions can be just as rewarding, as Rainsberger’s experience demonstrates.</p>
<p>
If you’re interested in technical communications, graphic design, user experience design, or other roles that don’t involve programming, open source provides an opportunity to build a portfolio. However, programmers also benefit from sharpening their non-code skills, particularly in writing and communication. Plus, experience in writing, support, or community organizing can help you pivot into roles like developer relations or product management.</p>

<p>There are opportunities for people of any skill level to get involved. “You don’t need a computer science degree, or an English degree for that matter, to write documentation,” Waddington says. “Even if you’re not a strong writer, you have to start somewhere.”</p>
<p>Besides, it’s hard to make meaningful code contributions until you have a thorough understanding of a project. “Feature requests are fundamentally a different mindset for contributions,” <a href="https://github.com/wntrblm"><u>Winterbloom</u></a> founder Thea Flowers said in <a href="https://github.blog/2023-05-03-more-than-meets-the-pull-request-maintainers-talk-contributions/"><u>a recent contributor relations Q&amp;A with The ReadME Project</u></a>. “The other contributions are really like patching up a wall or repainting a fence, but a feature request is like building a new shed in your backyard. You’ve got to really think about it a bit.” Even what appears to be a small bug fix can have big ramifications.</p>

<p>“Only five percent of the effort to actually get something shipped is writing the code for it,” <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream"><u>Litestream</u></a> maintainer <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson"><u>Ben Johnson</u></a> said in our <a href="https://github.com/readme/featured/how-open-is-open-source"><u>article on different levels of openness for contributions</u></a>. “It’s the years of maintenance afterwards, fixing bugs, writing documentation, making tutorials, and all this other stuff. That’s the hard part.” In an informal social media poll in April, The ReadME Project asked maintainers what type of open source contribution they would want if they had to choose only one type from now on. Although code was the most popular answer, with 62.2% of the vote, more than one-third of respondents would prefer documentation, design, or testing.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/msaroufim"><u>Mark Saroufim</u></a>, an AI engineer at Meta who helps maintain <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch"><u>PyTorch</u></a>, recommends reading the documentation for a project you might want to get involved in and fixing any parts that are outdated or broken as a good starting point. Prolific open source maintainer <a href="https://github.com/readme/stories/jordan-harband"><u>Jordan Harband</u></a> explained in the Q&amp;A that newcomers are often better at recognizing issues with existing documentation or spotting areas that lack documentation, specifically because they’re not already experts with a particular project. “Any documentation I write will inevitably be tainted by my already knowing how it works,” he said.
Likewise, reading and responding to other people’s questions will help you deepen your knowledge, get to know the maintainers, and learn a project’s build process. “It gives you x-ray vision into a project,” Saroufim says.</p>
<p>
Even after you’ve transitioned to making code contributions, there are plenty of reasons to keep working on the non-code side. “If you don’t want to work on non-code tasks forever, by all means, don’t,” Saroufim says. “But many of the best, most productive engineers at PyTorch are also active in support.” Providing support helps maintainers learn where users struggle and what features users really want and need, and, in turn, develop better software.
</p>
<p>Sustained community involvement is also a better way to make a name for yourself in open source than one-off code contributions, and there are often more long-term opportunities to help out with a project in non-coding tasks. Rainsberger’s experience is proof of that. Her Chromebook contributions were valuable, but what made her a core contributor was her active involvement in the community.</p>

<p>“The relationships and trust you build are important from a career standpoint,” says Foster. “You will stand out more by consistently being helpful in a community’s Slack or Discord or by helping organize events like community meetups.”</p>

<h3><b>Finding and appreciating non-code contributors</b></h3>

<p>The importance of non-code contributions is clear, but how can maintainers find people to pitch in? Ideally, contributors will follow Waddington’s advice and jump in without waiting for someone to tell them what to do. However, the opposite advice applies to maintainers: If they want contributions, the best thing to do is to ask people to do specific things. “I search Twitter and if I see someone tweeting about something missing or incorrect in the docs I ask them if they’re interested in fixing it,” said Rainsberger. “It’s a simple way to get the docs fixed and to give people an opportunity to get involved.”
</p>
<p>Flowers recommends building a community on a chat platform like Discord, Gitter, or Slack to make it easier for people to get involved informally with a project. “It makes people feel less hesitant to ask quick questions,” she said. “A lot of people are intimidated to ask questions on repositories.” Also, people outside a project’s core team might be more willing to pipe up with an answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maintainers should also file issues and tag them with “Help Wanted” and, when appropriate, “Good First Issue.” The State of the Octoverse report found that projects with about 25% of their issues marked with the “Help Wanted” tag saw 13% more contributors than those without, and those with 40% of issues tagged as “Good First Issues” saw 21% more new contributors than those without.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Projects can also participate in programs like <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"><u>Summer of Code</u></a>, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/"><u>Hacktoberfest</u></a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs"><u>Season of Docs</u></a>. Astro focused specifically on non-code contributions at Hacktoberfest 2022. “It was phenomenal. We had so much activity; it was really nice to help so many people make their first PR to open source,” Rainsberger says.</p>

<p>But just asking for help isn’t always enough. Depending on the size and complexity of your project, contributors may need additional onboarding and orientation. Mentorship is perhaps the best way to set contributors up for success. The 2021 State of the Octoverse report found that mentorship increased productivity in open source projects by 46% and tripled the chances of having a healthy culture. “Having a dedicated person who engages with new community members helps them overcome hurdles and stay involved with the project,” <a href="https://github.com/GeorgLink"><u>Georg Link</u></a>, co-founder of open source health metrics organization <a href="https://github.com/chaoss"><u>CHAOSS</u></a>, told The ReadME Project for our <a href="https://github.com/readme/featured/contributor-onboarding"><u>article on onboarding contributors</u></a>. Mentorship is time-consuming and can take maintainers away from other tasks, but the time investment usually pays off in the long run. New contributors can take on increasingly important tasks and even become mentors themselves.
</p>
<p>It’s also crucial to elevate and appreciate non-code contributors. This not only helps keep current contributors motivated but also helps attract new contributors. “We try to give lots of opportunities for people to feel valued and publicly recognized,” Rainsberger says. Early on, the Astro project required someone to make “significant code contributions” to become a “core contributor.” That language has since changed to include non-code contributions when considering promoting people to core contributor status.</p>

<p>Non-code contributors are also included in the project’s other forms of recognition, such as badges that contributors can display on their GitHub profiles to highlight accomplishments within the project. To help ensure everyone gets their fair share of credit, Astro includes detailed instructions on specifying co-authorship on pull requests. Additionally, the GitHub avatar of every contributor is on the first page of the project’s documentation. For a more tangible reward, the project distributes funds raised on Open Collective to contributors once per quarter.
</p>
<p>It’s time for everyone to recognize the role that documentation, support, and other non-code contributions play in making open source viable. It’s never too late or too early to make your own contributions to your favorite projects.</p>

<p>The phone market in 2000-10 was crazy, but Nokia’s strategy was even crazier. Just in the year ‘05 alone, it launched more than fifty models, more than the number of iPhone models Apple has shipped in sixteen years since the first. Granted, many of the Nokia models were barely different from each other, but nonetheless, Nokia was creating an absurd number of categories.</p>
<p>Nokia phones were business-centric, music-centric, camera-centric. They had everything from 1-bit monochromatic displays to 24-bit AMOLED displays. The body-design itself had multiple type: Bar, Flip, Slide, Qwerty, and … <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_7280">Lipstick</a>?</p>
<p>For some models, the company decided to drop all forms of conventionality.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.textquery.app/nokia-3650.png"><img src="https://images.textquery.app/nokia-6800.jpeg"><img src="https://images.textquery.app/nokia-7600.png"> </p> 
<p>To clarify, making different models isn’t the core issue here. Laptops, monitors, and appliances all come in various specs and sizes to serve different needs. However, they don’t deviate too much from the core design. Nokia, on the other hand, was experimenting too much. Not only the variety of devices was creating an incoherent user experience, but it also made it almost impossible to create an app market.</p>
<h2 id="why">…why?</h2>
<p>In the 1960s, Nokia was a conglomerate selling everything from toilet paper to tires. It did a commendable job transforming itself into a telecom-based company in the 90s. However, market segmentation was baked into Nokia’s strategy. In their ‘05 <a href="https://www.nokia.com/system/files/files/form20-f-05-pdf.pdf">annual report</a>, they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Nokia, a competitive mobile device product portfolio means a broad and balanced offering of commercially appealing mobile devices with attractive features, functionality and design for all major consumer segments and price points supported by the Nokia brand, quality and competitive cost structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interesting part is how the idea manifested itself in how the organization worked.</p>
<p>Nokia’s Mobile device division had three sub-divisions: mobile phones, multimedia, and enterprise solutions business groups. And each of those divisions had further sub-divisions. Each sub-division was independently creating phone models, trying to capture the market they were assigned.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Mobile phone division. It had five separate units (<a href="https://www.nokia.com/system/files/files/form20-f-05-pdf.pdf">Nokia Annual report ‘05</a>, p28):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Broad Appeal unit focused “on mid-range products where the balance between price, functionality and style is key” (eg, Nokia 3250).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Entry unit addressed markets where they believed “there is potential for growth and where mobile penetration levels are relatively low.” (eg, Nokia 1100).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifestyle unit concentrated on “top-end products for consumers who will pay a premium for higher-quality materials, design, and features.” (eg. Nokia 8800).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A CDMA unit to collaborate with operators and create models using CDMA technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertu, a unit for luxury communications products, focused “towards establishing a luxury mobile phone category.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The multimedia division focused on phones with “the ability to create, access and consume multimedia”. This included the N-Series phones, and XPressMusic phones.</p>
<p>The enterprise division focused on business users. This included the E-Series phones, 9300 phones.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can already see where the trouble started brewing. Tens of sub-divisions, each launching multiple models to capture specific segments of the market. While Nokia did invest heavily in R&amp;D, it was impossible to produce cohesive research that could improve their phones in general; the crucial research that would pave the way for the iPhone in a few years. And the rest is history.</p>
<p>One of the first things that Jobs did after returning to Apple was to kill individual “business units” and reorganize the company based on functions. It’s interesting to see how Nokia succumbed to the bad strategy that had almost killed Apple in ‘97. Nokia perceived the smartphone market as composed of multiple categories, not as a whole. And that’s where it lost the battle.</p> <hr> </article></div>]]></description>

<p>A collection of philosopher <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/">John Locke</a>‘s<a href="https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/repositories/2/resources/9195"> papers at the Bodleian Library</a> includes letters, accounts, poetry, notes on medicine and books, and recipes. When David Armitage posted this recipe for pancakes in the Bodleian collection on <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRArmitage/status/1420686951829618688?s=20">Twitter</a>, I knew that I wanted to try it. These rich, nutmeg-scented pancakes are absolutely delicious.&nbsp;(Many thanks to Rhae Lynn Barnes and the other readers who immediately sent this recipe my way.)</p>


<p>In <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015005394641&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=22">Philip Long’s catalog</a> of the collection at the Bodleian, he notes that this recipe, and a few others, were written by Locke: “A collection of twelve recipes dated 1675-94, of which three (fols. 85, 89, 91) are in Locke’s hand” (2). The next time I visit Oxford for research, I will be excited to see this recipe as well as the eleven others in this set of miscellaneous papers.</p>

<p>pancakes<br>
Take sweet cream 3/4 + pint. Flower a<br>
quarter of a pound. Eggs <del>four</del> 7 leave out <del>two</del> 4 of<br>
the whites. Beat the Eggs very well. Then put in<br>
the flower, beat it a quarter of an hower. Then<br>
put in six spoonfulls of the Cream, beat it a litle<br>
Take new sweet butter half a pound. Melt it to oyle, &amp;<br>
take off the skum, power in all the clear by degrees<br>
beating it all the time. Then put in the rest of<br>
y<em>ou</em>r cream. beat it well. Half a grated nutmeg<br>
&amp; litle orangeflower water. Frie it without butter.<br>
This is the right way</p>
<p>From the start, I was intrigued by the cross-outs and other notes in the recipe. It appears that it was first drafted (or prepared) using significantly fewer eggs. The modifier “new” was added before “sweet butter” at some point. Locke may have written the final note “This is the right way” as part of the initial draft or after the recipe was prepared. Locke was attentive to the details of separating and whisking eggs as well as adding just the right amount of orange blossom water (“litle”) and nutmeg (“Half a grated nutmeg”) – an exceptional, expensive amount.</p>

<p>Like the other seventeenth- and eighteenth-century <a href="https://rarecooking.com/2016/02/09/pancakes-two-ways/">pancakes</a> that I’ve tried, these fall somewhere between crêpes and American pancakes: They’re a bit fluffier and fattier than a classic French crêpe and have far less rise than my favorite American breakfast version. My spouse, Joseph, described Locke’s pancakes as somewhere between a classic English pancake and a Scotch pancake (or Scottish pancake).</p>
<p>Many of the commenters on Twitter balked at the instruction to beat the eggs and flour for a “quarter of an hower.” These extended mixing times, however, are common in early modern recipes. While I did prepare my version using a hand-held mixer to ensure thorough beating, I did reduce the mixing time to avoid <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/common-mistakes/article/10-pancake-common-mistakes-avoid">over-mixing</a> which can lead to&nbsp;a chewy pancake. From what I know about historical and contemporary flour milling, this would not have been a concern for Locke or his cook.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Recipe</strong></p>
<p><em>Makes approximately 10 8-inch pancakes</em></p>
<p>1 cup butter (2 sticks, 1/2 lb, 226g)<br>
3 whole eggs plus 4 additional egg yolks<br>
1 cup flour (1/4 lb, 113g)<br>
1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br>
1 Tablespoon orange blossom water<br>
half a nutmeg, grated</p>
<p>First, melt the butter. Set it aside.</p>
<p>Put the whole eggs and egg yolks in a large bowl. Beat with a whisk or hand-held mixer until well combined.</p>
<p>Add the flour and beat until smooth and completely combined. Add 6 Tablespoons of the cream to the egg flour mixture and mix until combined. While stirring or beating, pour in the melted butter.&nbsp;Add the remaining cream and orange blossom water and stir to combine. Grate 1/2 a nutmeg and stir into batter.</p>
<p>Heat a frying pan or skillet on a high heat until a drop of water skitters across the surface. Lower the heat to medium.</p>
<p>Pour approximately half a cup of batter into the center of the pan and spread by swirling the pan to create an 8-inch pancake. Cook for 1 minute or until the edges of the pancake lift and appear lacy and the middle looks mostly set. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Repeat until your batter is gone. Serve the pancakes immediately.</p>

<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>
<p>Between the rich dairy and the fragrant nutmeg, these pancakes made for a decadent breakfast. When Locke wrote down, and perhaps prepared this recipe, the eggs, cream, butter, and flour would all have been ingredients ready to hand in many households. The addition of so much nutmeg and a dash of orange blossom water elevates this specific pancake recipe to a special treat.</p>
<p>I certainly enjoyed sitting down with a plate of pancakes drizzled with a little bit of honey, a cup of coffee, and an old, heavily annotated copy of Locke that I read for a class that I took more than a decade ago. If you make these pancakes on a future winter morning or as part of your holiday vacation, be sure to let me know.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: This song contains someone strumming a melody on a mandolin while more people are whistling along. Then a mandolin, an e-bass and an acoustic guitar are playing a short melody in a lower key before breaking into the next part along with flutes and percussions. This song may be played outside by musicians performing.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: The commercial music features a groovy piano melody played over snare rolls in the first half of the loop. Right after, there is a drop that consists of a punchy “4 on the floor” kick pattern, shimmering hi hats, claps, groovy piano and wide synth lead melody. It sounds happy, fun, euphoric and exciting.</p>

Not because it sucks, but to save some money on taxes.</p><p>It's not the first time this has happened recently--"content" ranging<a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-streaming-cuts-tax-writeoffs-1850502594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Disney TV shows</a> to a <em>Batgirl </em>movie has met with the same fate--but this one stung a little more. Disney and HBO removing TV shows that people had already had a chance to see was one thing, and <em>Batgirl</em><a href="https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/batgirl-movie-so-bad-not-releasable-says-dc-studios-3390857#:~:text='Batgirl'%20movie%20was%20so%20bad%20it%20was%20%E2%80%9Cnot,releasable%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20DC%20Studios%20boss&amp;text=Leslie%20Grace%20as%20'Batgirl'%20CREDIT,Grace%2C%20Brandon%20Fraser%20and%20J.K." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>was reportedly also very bad</a>, which was another.</p><p>But <em>Coyote vs Acme</em> has been seen by <em>nobody</em>. The movie--directed by Dave Green, written by <em>May December's</em> Samy Burch, produced by (among others) James Gunn and starring characters that define Warner Bros.' entire existence--was paid for, is finished, is ready to be seen, and now it stands a very real chance of being deleted forever, just to save a company some money.</p><p>It's an incredibly dystopian situation we all find ourselves in, where art is only made to be fed into a woodchipper to serve shareholders, and it's one<a href="https://www.looper.com/1161829/hollywood-creatives-are-breathing-fire-over-the-current-trend-of-tv-tax-write-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that's been covered extensively elsewhere</a>, so I'm not going to get into the reeds over the politics and economics of the decision here.</p><p>What I am going to say, though, is that if you work at Warner Bros., or anywhere related to Warner Bros., and you have any access to this movie whatsoever, it's your moral imperative to leak it to the world before it's too late. If Warner Bros. don't want to release it, and have reportedly blocked attempts for other companies to release it, then what does it matter?</p><p>(<strong>Please note</strong>: I am not a lawyer or law enforcement officer and this does not constitute actual advice).</p><p>As we <em>have </em>covered previously,<a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there is no piracy without ownership</a>. If we can't buy or rent the thing, and likely never will be able to do so via legal means, then leaking this movie and putting it on torrent sites shouldn't be seen as stealing, either. By all accounts Warner CEO David Zaslav is happy throwing this movie in the bin, without selling a single theatre ticket or digital rental, so whether we get to see it for free or not doesn't move that financial needle one bit.</p><p>What leaking the movie <em>would </em>do is save a piece of art that hundreds of people poured their hearts and souls into for months or even <em>years</em>. That shouldn't be a crime. That's public service.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Topline</h2>
<p>Nvidia’s market value surpassed those of fellow technology titans Amazon and Alphabet on Monday, an almost unbelievable feat accomplished as Nvidia’s stock more than quadrupled over the last 15 months as investors bought into Nvidia’s market-leading<strong> </strong>position in artificial intelligence.</p>
<figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion current="-1"><p>Nvidia stock's 17,000% runup over the last 10 years is far and away the best of any S&amp;P 500 <span data-ga-track="caption expand">... [+]</span><span> constituent.</span></p></fbs-accordion><small>Getty Images</small></figcaption></figure> 

<h2>Key Facts</h2>
<div>
 <div>
  <p>Shares of Nvidia rose nearly 3% to an record high of over $740, bringing its market capitalization to $1.83 trillion, narrowly surpassing Alphabet’s $1.82 trillion and Amazon’s $1.8 trillion.</p>
  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p>The symbolic passing of the torch caps Nvidia’s remarkable journey as Wall Street flooded into the stock amid the AI boom.</p>
  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p>Nvidia’s market cap sat below $300 billion as recently as October 2022, just before the AI wave began to crest, lagging far behind Amazon and Alphabet’s above $1 trillion valuations at the time.</p>
  
  
 </div>
 <p>Nvidia is now the fourth most-valuable public company in the world, trailing only Microsoft ($3.1 trillion), Apple ($2.9 trillion) and Saudi Aramco ($2 trillion).</p>
</div>


<h2>Key Background</h2>
<p>Nvidia is by far the most prominent producer of the semiconductor chip technology powering generative AI. Investors have been impressed not just by the potential for Nvidia to capitalize on the growing interest and corporate spending in AI, but also by its already exploding results. Nvidia’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) expanded by more than 500% last quarter on a year-over-year basis thanks to runaway growth in its AI unit, far stronger than Amazon and Alphabet’s robust 20% or more earnings growth during the comparable period. Nvidia’s gross revenue and profits are less eye-popping than its trillion-dollar company peers – its $9.2 billion profit last quarter was far smaller than Apple’s and Microsoft’s over $22 billion profits during the comparable stretch – but analysts expect Nvidia’s financials to soon close the gap. Nvidia remains among the most popular stocks on Wall Street even after its more than 50% run-up this year, and is a top pick for analysts at both Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, each of which has an $800 price target for Nvidia, implying 8% further upside for the stock.</p>
<h2>Surprising Fact</h2>
<p>Nvidia stock’s 17,000% gain over the last decade is by far the best return of any stock on the S&amp;P 500, nearly tripling the return of silver medalist and fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia a decade ago would now be worth about $175,000.</p>
<h2>What To Watch For</h2>
<p>Nvidia will report earnings next Wednesday for its fiscal quarter ending last month. Analysts project the company to report its third consecutive quarter of record sales and profits.</p>

            Thick roots tumble across a dilapidated house, the snake-like trunks of a banyan tree framing where the front door once stood. Its walls have been hollowed by decades of typhoons, monsoons and summer humidity, now little more than loose, moss-covered stones and mortar dust. Vines tease through cracks in the foundations and fallen leaves litter the rotten floorboards.

            This scene wouldn’t look out of place deep in the Malaysian rainforest or the verdant foothills of India. But photographer Stefan Irvine snapped these pictures just a stone’s throw from one of the most densely populated cities in the world, a global metropolis of steely skyscrapers and gridlocked traffic.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjne83700083b6hjnef25q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Irvine, who has lived in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/asia/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> since 2002, first stumbled across the city’s abandoned villages in 2012 while visiting a friend in the New Territories, a vast area to the city’s north. Accounting for over 85% of Hong Kong’s territory, the district is characterized by steep mountains, long stretches of rugged coastline and tree-covered country parks.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjne9e7000a3b6hgs4ltkyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “It made me question, ‘Why (were) so many of these places vacant in a place like Hong Kong, where the property prices are the highest in the world?’” Irvine recalled. Over the next 12 years, the London-born photographer explored more of these abandoned villages, documenting what would become the subject of his new book, “<a href="https://www.stefanirvine.photo/book/abandoned-villages-of-hong-kong-stefan-irvine" target="_blank">Abandoned Villages of Hong Kong</a>.”

            “It’s opened my eyes to a different aspect of Hong Kong,” said Irvine. “That’s what I’m hoping the project will do for other people as well.”

            Although Irvine took the first image for the project — an abandoned home with plants spilling out onto the road through a yellow door frame — in 2012, it wasn’t until 2019 that he began actively hunting down locations to photograph.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000j3b6h8v67ixly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “These villages have existed in Hong Kong for hundreds of years, way before the colonial period,” explained Irvine. In the 1950s and ‘60s, as Hong Kong grew as an industrial hub, many people migrated to the rapidly expanding urban centers for better working opportunities. “It’s hard farming and fishing out there in these remote areas, so a lot of people moved to the city to work in the factories,” he added.
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000k3b6hmc50phpk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Through library research, the 48-year-old photographer found people who grew up in the villages or had relatives who lived there. In the book, he included essays from two women connected to the village: one whose father grew up in Wong Chuk Shan village, now completely overgrown, and another who spent several years of her childhood in Lai Chi Wo village, on the northeast coast of Hong Kong in the 1970s.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000l3b6hbh7vyacj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “Now she lives in the UK with her own family, but she comes back to visit HK every few years, and still feels a deep sense of connection with Lai Chi Wo,” Irvine said of the latter woman, adding: “You can tell they feel an intense bond with their ancestors and with the village itself.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjngadu000m3b6h5zvravrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            While many of the villages emptied out slowly over decades, Irvine found some homes that appeared to have been “abandoned pretty rapidly,” with personal items and furniture left behind.
    </p>

            “There were calendars on the wall, school certificates in drawers — it’s quite poignant,” said Irvine.
    </p>

            “I think a lot of people left with the intention of coming back one day, or maybe retiring back in the village. But if you don’t maintain these properties, eventually they’ll succumb to nature. Termites will start to burrow their way into the wooden beams. If one of those collapses, then the seeds can fall in from trees and plants, and then they really take over.”
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjnl5k4000t3b6hqc4bwpvx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Rotting floorboards and unstable masonry made some of the building dangerous to explore. For Irvine, the biggest risk was posed by territorial village dogs that often became aggressive as he walked through remote areas. “I started the habit of carrying dog biscuits in my camera bag when I went out to these places,” he said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clsjnl5k4000u3b6h6swjleh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The project took Irvine to the furthest reaches of the city, using minibuses and ferries to access isolated towns and islands. One adventure saw him embark on a six-hour round trip to Tung Ping Chau, a far-flung island closer to the Chinese mainland than to Hong Kong. Once a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geopark.gov.hk/en/discover/attractions/tung-ping-chau" target="_blank">thriving fishing and farming community</a>, most residents left the island in the 1960s to make a living in the city. Irvine ended up using just one image from the trip in his book — but the trip was “totally worth it,” he said.

            “I would hike for about an hour into the wilderness to find a beautiful old village and I assumed there would be nobody there — and then around the corner would be someone with a wheelbarrow on their way to plant vegetables or something. So that was a bit of a shock,” he said.

            “Lai Chi Wo is quite interesting because (Hong Kong’s) government has realized the heritage value in this village and they’ve invested a substantial amount of money to revitalize some of the old buildings,” said Irvine. “They want to encourage young people to go out there and stay overnight and to experience a different side of Hong Kong.”

            Irvine found other deserted villages that were also being revitalized for tourism. Yim Tin Tsai, a former catholic missionary outpost and salt farming community, is completely abandoned — but every summer, it hosts an art installation and festival.

            “People take a little sampan (a flat-bottomed boat) across the water, it’s 15 minutes away from (the coast), and they can interact with these art installations that use some of the abandoned sites to great effect,” Irvine said.

            Irvine believes there is a growing sentimentality and nostalgia among Hong Kong’s people “to save and relish their built heritage.” These rural sites are a key part of that, he said, adding: “I think it’s of great value to people and their sense of identity.”

<p><b>Visual calculus</b>, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamikon_Mnatsakanian" title="Mamikon Mnatsakanian">Mamikon Mnatsakanian</a> (known as Mamikon), is an approach to solving a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral" title="Integral">integral calculus</a> problems.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Many problems that would otherwise seem quite difficult yield to the method with hardly a line of calculation. Mamikon collaborated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Apostol" title="Tom Apostol">Tom Apostol</a> on the 2013 book <i>New Horizons in Geometry</i> describing the subject.

<p>Mamikon devised his method in 1959 while an undergraduate, first applying it to a well-known geometry problem: find the area of a ring (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_(mathematics)" title="Annulus (mathematics)">annulus</a>), given the length of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry)" title="Chord (geometry)">chord</a> tangent to the inner circumference. Perhaps surprisingly, no additional information is needed; the solution does not depend on the ring's inner and outer dimensions.
</p><p>The traditional approach involves algebra and application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem" title="Pythagorean theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>. Mamikon's method, however, envisions an alternate construction of the ring: first the inner circle alone is drawn, then a constant-length tangent is made to travel along its circumference, "sweeping out" the ring as it goes.
</p><p>Now if all the (constant-length) tangents used in constructing the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, the result is a circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point)—and sweeping out a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and sweeping out a disk.
</p><p>Mamikon's insight was to recognize the equivalence of the two constructions; and because they are equivalent, they yield equal areas. Moreover, the two starting curves need not be circular—a finding not easily proven by more traditional geometric methods. This yields <b>Mamikon's theorem</b>:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>The area of a tangent sweep is equal to the area of its tangent cluster, regardless of the shape of the original curve.</i></dd></dl>

<p>The area of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid" title="Cycloid">cycloid</a> can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. These tangents can all be clustered to form a circle. If the circle generating the cycloid has radius <span><i>r</i></span> then this circle also has radius <span><i>r</i></span> and area <span>π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup></span>. The area of the rectangle is <span>2<i>r</i> × 2π<i>r</i> = 4π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup></span>. Therefore the area of the cycloid is <span>3π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup></span>: it is 3 times the area of the generating circle.
</p><p>The tangent cluster can be seen to be a circle because the cycloid is generated by a circle and the tangent to the cycloid will be at right angle to the line from the generating point to the rolling point. Thus the tangent and the line to the contact point form a right-angled triangle in the generating circle. This means that clustered together the tangents will describe the shape of the generating circle.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
