            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://unoriginal.blog/introducing-dwlaas/">https://unoriginal.blog/introducing-dwlaas/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38581373">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m excited to announce our fintech startup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Deadweight Loss as a Service</a> is coming out of stealth after receiving $8M in seed funding from Emergent Ventures and Thiel Capital. Our platform makes charitable giving more efficient using the latest AI and blockchain technology. Our platform has two major innovations:</p><ul><li><strong>OmniMatch™️</strong> will match any funding through our platform up to fifty cents on the dollar.</li><li><strong>Antidollars™️</strong> remove $1 of funding from an organization of your choosing.</li></ul><h2 id="antidollarstm">Antidollars™️</h2><p>Frustrated that the only avenues for disagreement with an organization’s decisions or worldview are ineffective and inefficient protests, petitions, boycotts, and social media campaigns? Tired of cardboard protest signs wasting valuable economic resources, then being reduced to litter in the street? The Antidollar™️ is for you. Patent-pending and only available through Deadweight Loss as a Service, each Antidollar™️ donation either annihilates a dollar donated to your target or donates a dollar to its antithesis.</p><p>Here’s how it works: We’ve identified hundreds of pairs of organizations which directly oppose each other (e.g. Clean Air Task Force / American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, Electronic Frontier Foundation / <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/01/apple-encryption-iphone-heat-initiative/">Heat Initiative</a>). For each pair, we’ve created a smart contract providing a “market” for this pair. Each market has a <em>balance</em> which starts at $0 and can become either negative or positive. Each January 1st at 00:00, the absolute value of the balance is donated to one of the organizations. If the balance is negative, it is donated to the first in the pair; if positive, it is donated to the second.</p><p>On our platform, you can send money (plus an <a href="https://unoriginal.blog/introducing-dwlaas/#omnimatchtm">OmniMatch™️ subsidy</a>) to a supported organization of your choosing. Behind the scenes, this works by increasing or decreasing the relevant market’s balance. If $1 is sent to the first organization, the balance decreases by a dollar; if the second, the balance increases by a dollar. The Antidollar™️ does the exact opposite: sending an Antidollar™️ to the first organization <em>increases</em> the balance by a dollar, and sending an Antidollar™️ to the second <em>decreases</em> the balance by a dollar. If the balance currently favors the organization sent an Antidollar™️, the Antidollar™️ will simply subtract $1 from the amount donated; if not, the Antidollar™️ is sent to the opposing organization, which, for well-chosen markets, should have a similar effect. Sending dollars or Antidollars™️ on our platform is completely free.</p><h2 id="omnimatchtm">OmniMatch™️</h2><p>If Antidollars™️ aren’t motivation enough to use our platform, OmniMatch™️ will be. $0.20 per Antidollar™️ sold is directed towards an OmniMatch™️ pool. This pool is used to match a fraction of each dollar or Antidollar™️ directed towards an organization on our platform. Our proprietary OmniMatch™️ algorithm determines this fraction using factors such as market activity. We guarantee these OmniMatch™️ subsidies will never go below 10 cents per dollar. Funding organizations through our platform is a no-brainer: your donation will be worth 10%-50% more at no cost.</p><p><img alt="A simple infographic-style bar chart with two bars, the left labeled “Without DWLaaS” and the right labeled “With DWLaaS”. The right bar is actually two bars, one behind the other. One is 10% larger than the left bar; the other is 50% larger. Above the left bar is text reading “10-50¢ matched per dollar”." src="https://unoriginal.blog/dwlaas-subsidy.png"></p><p>Thanks to OmniMatch™️, in our closed beta lasting only a few months, several of our markets have already seen more than $10,000 in volume:</p><ul><li>Cato Institute / Democratic Socialists of America (current balance -$12)</li><li>Brady Campaign / National Rifle Association (current balance +$536)</li><li>Planned Parenthood Federation of America / National Right to Life Committee (current balance -$4165)</li><li>United States Treasury / Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Central Planning Committee (current balance -$3484)</li><li>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals / National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (current balance $6645)</li><li>Biden for President / Donald J Trump for President (current balance -$8392)</li></ul><h2 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h2><blockquote><p>Tired of political quarrels at the Thanksgiving table? Buy anti-gift cards for the whole family! Can’t make it to a (counter-)protest? Whether you’d have been at Planned Parenthood or on Wall Street, Deadweight Loss as a Service has got you covered. …. This startup … is … good.</p><p>— <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716nAssnUVL._AC_SL1500_.jpg">WIRED Magazine</a>, “Forget Political Activism. ‘Deactivism’ Is Sweeping Silicon Valley”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[The] Hatch-Waxman [Act] was our wakeup call at Eli Lilly to start making connections inside the Beltway. They’ve been worth every penny, but were starting to impact our image. We partnered with Deadweight Loss as a Service to redirect our lobbying spend towards [Patients For Affordable Drugs Now] Antidollars™. It’s much more efficient, and our ESG scores have never been better.</p><p>— David A. Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly and Company</p></blockquote><h2 id="pro-modetm">Pro Mode™</h2><p>Stay tuned for a future update to the platform, Pro Mode™. For power users, Pro Mode™ further increases liquidity on our markets using advanced AI technology. We embed the mission statements of thousands of humanitarian aid groups, religious organizations, PACs, and more into a high-dimensional “cause-space” which accurately represents divergence in goals between any two supported organizations. The Pro Mode™ smart contract unifies Antidollar™ markets, replacing many distinct prices with a single Praxis Vector™ within cause-space. At the end of the year, the Pro Mode™ contract allocates its funds proportionally to each charity’s cause-space distance from the final Praxis Vector™.</p><p>In Pro Mode™ with patent-pending Praxis Vector™ technology, every dollar pushes the market’s Praxis Vector™ towards your own PPV (Personal Praxis Vector™), set manually or inferred with state-of-the-art LLMs. With Pro Mode™, you can be confident your funds increase the cosine similarity of your and the market’s Praxis Vectors™ as efficiently as possible, without wasting an Anticent™️ on causes literally and figuratively orthogonal to your beliefs. And best of all, Pro Mode™ comes at no additional cost.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p><h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next</h2><p>Our “PvP mode” experiment was extremely successful in closed alpha. We’ll go GA as soon as a lawyer stays long enough to sign off on it.</p><p>In the long term, you can expect even more from us. A certain seed investor has encouraged us to expand into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_pairing_in_the_2016_United_States_presidential_election">vote swapping</a> market with the help of Dr. Bryan Caplan. Meanwhile, Dr. Robin Hanson has been instrumental in the design of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Jury Nullification Market Beta</a>—early adopters can join the waitlist starting today!</p><p>We don’t expect to go public any time soon, but what’s a few unregistered securities between friends: invest in Deadweight Loss as a Service by sending Antidollars™ to our enemies.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong><mark>OSS Capital leads the Series A funding alongside Naval Ravikant (Founder of AngelList) and a group of angels including Justin Hoffman, Larry Augustin, Alex Atallah, Thomas Dohmke, Diogo Mónica, Scott Williamson.</mark></strong></p>



<p>3 billion people play video games – that’s nearly half the planet! Despite this already massive market size, <strong>the video game industry is at an inflection point where its already strong growth rate will increase even further, and exponentially so. </strong>Shifting demographics, widening Internet access, emerging technologies, and ever-growing adoption by non-gaming industries will completely transform demand for video game developers, platforms, and games themselves. 25,000+ studios. 22 million+ gaming jobs. These illustrate just the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>We at W4 Games are going all-in on the creation of an ecosystem with the Godot Engine at its center. The free, open-source technology of the Godot Engine empowers developers to create stunning 2D and 3D games, and we believe it will become the most used game engine in the world within the decade, driving video game development to new heights. It is already the preferred game engine for new generations of game developers and will scale exponentially further thanks to its fast learning curve, intuitive design, and a fast-growing and welcoming community.</p>



<p>To help drive our continuing growth, we are thrilled to announce a new $15M Series A funding round led by OSS Capital and Naval Ravikant (AngelList and AirChat co-founder). Other investors include Justin Hoffman (Ex&nbsp;Elastic), Larry Augustin (Ex SugarCRM),&nbsp;Alex Atallah (Co-founder of OpenSea), Thomas Dohmke (CEO of GitHub), Diogo Mónica (Founder of Anchorage Digital), Scott Williamson (Ex GitLab) and more notable founders and executives in the commercial open-source ecosystem.</p>



<p>W4 Games will strengthen our role within the Godot ecosystem by supporting its open-source development and continuing to build products and services to facilitate Godot’s expansion, such as W4 Consoles (an approved middleware console porting solution for Godot games) and W4 Cloud (multi-tenant service to support millions of users). Moreover, we will target international expansion across North America, Europe, and Asia, and the development of a new Godot education program.</p>



<p>With this new funding, W4 Games aims to more than double its headcount in the coming 18 months to capture the fast-growing demand for its products and services.</p>



<p>“W4 and the Godot community mark the first time in history that the now $300B+ gaming industry is seeing fundamental disruption and acceleration of innovation thanks to open source. OSS Capital is proud to deepen our partnership with W4 towards an open future in gaming.”</p>



<p><em>Joseph Jacks (Founder and General Partner at OSS Capital)</em></p>



<p><strong>About W4 Games (w4games.com)&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Founded in 2021, W4 Games is an Irish startup formed by Godot veterans Juan Linietsky, Rémi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, and veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato. The company plans to revolutionize the game industry by bringing the Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) business model to an ecosystem that has traditionally relied on proprietary solutions from an ever-shrinking number of independent vendors. By providing a commercial services offering anchored in the entirely open and community-developed Godot platform, W4 Games believes that companies will be able to reclaim control of the technology powering their games, with a level of freedom and flexibility they never had before. In 2021 W4 Games raised its seed investment round led by OSS and Lux Capital, with the participation of SISU Ventures and Bob Young, the co-founder of Red Hat.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>The discovery that two agents from Spain’s <a href="https://english.elpais.com/politics/catalonia_independence/2020-07-16/spains-intelligence-service-has-spyware-program-that-targeted-catalan-politicians.html">CNI intelligence service</a> were bribed to provide classified information to the United States has led to an unprecedented situation between Madrid and Washington. Spanish Minister of Defense Margarita Robles, who oversees the CNI, summoned the U.S. ambassador to Spain, Julissa Reynoso, to her office to explain what happened. Such actions are considered hostile and are not expected between two allies. The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel Albares, also spoke with Reynoso and expressed the Spanish government’s unease over the revelations, according to government sources. At least two U.S. agents stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, who were directly involved in recruiting the CNI spies, have been discreetly expelled from Spain.</p><p>The investigation into the spying operation began before the summer, when during a CNI security check, it was discovered that the two Spanish agents had accessed classified information that they did not need for their work, nor were authorized to know. The internal investigation confirmed that at least one of the agents, a middle-ranking official at the secret service, had been recruited by U.S. spies to obtain secret information in exchange for a large sum of money. According to sources close to the CNI, the agent was an area chief, one of the sections that are part of the intelligence division, while the other was his assistant.</p><p>When the CNI concluded its investigation, the director of the secret service, Esperanza Casteleiro, reported the case to the Prosecutor’s Office of Spain’s highest court, the National Assembly, which transferred the case to the Prosecutor’s Office of the High Court of Madrid, on the grounds that it was the competent authority. The Madrid tribunal then presented the complaint to the investigative courts of Plaza de Castilla.</p><figure><span><img alt="Margarita Robles" decoding="auto" height="275" srcset="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/_PyZjH5NdM4k53dWZsOq0v16wgc=/414x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 414w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/65ucy8UnINhGGz9RdPt77kqGoEM=/828x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 640w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/G5YVvdz_8MCDVVDp7iV_pnh6EO4=/980x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 1000w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/tZlYyRwpLKvqDrLZSJClrd2hHEg=/1960x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG 1960w" width="414" loading="lazy" src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/_PyZjH5NdM4k53dWZsOq0v16wgc=/414x0/filters:focal(352x123:362x133)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/GAH4LNRE6VFUFNYO2GGXBSPN3A.JPG" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw"></span><figcaption><span>Spain's Minister of Defense, Margarita Robles (l) and the U.S. ambassador to Spain, Julissa Reynoso, last May.</span><span>MINISTERIO DE DEFENSA</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was at that moment, according to the sources consulted, that the Spanish government decided to share the findings of the investigation with the United States and condemn what happened. The case is a very serious matter, since recruiting secret agents of a host state to betray their own country is considered an <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-05/ex-us-ambassador-who-put-evo-morales-on-the-map-arrested-for-spying-for-cuba.html">openly hostile act</a>. Such actions may be taken with enemy or adversary governments, but never with friends and allies. Sources from the Spanish intelligence service do not fully understand what happened. “What do Americans have to pay for if we give them everything they ask for?” they noted. These sources insist that Spain openly collaborates with the United States, and always exchanges information. According to these sources, the number of times in which Spain has refused to share information of interest to Washington is “between one and zero.”</p><p>These sources explain that, when the U.S. Ambassador Reynoso was summoned by Minister Robles, she said that she was not aware of the case. The U.S. ambassador allegedly claimed that the U.S. agents who had bribed the Spanish spies were working independently of her, in a program that was launched before current <a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2023-12-06/biden-says-he-might-not-have-run-for-reelection-if-not-for-threat-of-trump.html">President Joe Biden</a> arrived at the White House and that, for reasons unknown, had been maintained until now. Reynoso, the same sources add, apologized for what happened and promised utmost collaboration with the ongoing investigation. The case has left the U.S. in an embarrassing situation.</p><p>The Spanish Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs agreed to expel at least two American spies — some sources claim that there were more — who were involved in recruiting and bribing the CNI agents. The spies were expelled discreetly, as Washington rushed to remove them. For its part, the Madrid court sealed the investigation, and ordered the arrest of the two alleged CNI spies and for their homes to be searched. Both were taken to the Estremera prison module in Madrid, which is reserved for security forces personnel and prison officials who are serving a sentence or are in pre-trial, and is separated from the rest of the inmates. The CNI assistant was released last month, while his superior remains behind bars.</p><p>According to CNI sources, the arrest of the CNI area chief has shocked his colleagues, since he is a veteran agent and widely known in the center. Both he and his subordinate are accused of the crime of revealing secrets and could be sentenced to between six and 12 years in prison under Article 584 of the Penal Code, which punishes “a Spaniard who, with the purpose of helping a foreign power, association or international organization, procures, falsifies, disables or discloses information classified as reserved or secret, that is likely to harm national security or national defense.”</p><p>This is not the first time that the Spanish secret service has denounced one of its own agents for spying. In 2007, the CNI opened a case against former spy Roberto Flórez — who had worked for the center between 1992 and 2004 —, after classified documentation was found in his premises and two apartments he owned in Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife. The CNI also seized a letter addressed to the Russian secret services in which Flórez offered to work for them in exchange for a first payment of $200,000. Although it could not be proven that Flórez had delivered the secret documents, the Provincial Court of Madrid sentenced him to 12 years in prison in 2010, which the Supreme Court later reduced to nine.</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank"><i>our weekly newsletter </i></a><i>to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>"If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing" (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>20 years ago, I got in a (friendly) public spat with Chris Anderson, who was then the editor in chief of <em>Wired</em>. I'd publicly noted my disappointment with glowing <em>Wired</em> reviews of DRM-encumbered digital devices, prompting Anderson to call me unrealistic for expecting the magazine to condemn gadgets for their DRM:</p>
<p><a href="https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html">https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html</a></p>
<p>I replied in public, telling him that he'd misunderstood. This wasn't an issue of ideological purity – it was about good reviewing practice. <em>Wired</em> was telling readers to buy a product because it had features x, y and z, but at any time in the future, without warning, without recourse, the vendor could switch off any of those features:</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/">https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/</a></p>
<p>I proposed that all <em>Wired</em> endorsements for DRM-encumbered products should come with this disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  WARNING: THIS DEVICE’S FEATURES ARE SUBJECT TO REVOCATION WITHOUT NOTICE, ACCORDING TO TERMS SET OUT IN SECRET NEGOTIATIONS. YOUR INVESTMENT IS CONTINGENT ON THE GOODWILL OF THE WORLD’S MOST PARANOID, TECHNOPHOBIC ENTERTAINMENT EXECS. THIS DEVICE AND DEVICES LIKE IT ARE TYPICALLY USED TO CHARGE YOU FOR THINGS YOU USED TO GET FOR FREE — BE SURE TO FACTOR IN THE PRICE OF BUYING ALL YOUR MEDIA OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT NO TIME IN HISTORY HAS ANY ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY GOTTEN A SWEET DEAL LIKE THIS FROM THE ELECTRONICS PEOPLE, BUT THIS TIME THEY’RE GETTING A TOTAL WALK. HERE, PUT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH, IT’LL MUFFLE YOUR WHIMPERS.
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Wired</em> didn't take me up on this suggestion.</p>
<p>But I was right. The ability to change features, prices, and availability of things you've <em>already paid for</em> is a powerful temptation to corporations. Inkjet printers were always a sleazy business, but once these printers got directly connected to the internet, companies like HP started pushing out "security updates" that modified your printer to make it reject the third-party ink you'd paid for:</p>

<p>Now, this scam wouldn't work if you could just put things back the way they were before the "update," which is where the DRM comes in. A thicket of IP laws make reverse-engineering DRM-encumbered products into a <em>felony</em>. Combine always-on network access with indiscriminate criminalization of user modification, and the enshittification will follow, as surely as night follows day.</p>
<p>This is the root of all the right to repair shenanigans. Sure, companies withhold access to diagnostic codes and parts, but codes can be extracted and parts can be cloned. The real teeth in blocking repair comes from the law, not the tech. The company that makes McDonald's wildly unreliable McFlurry machines makes a fortune charging franchisees to fix these eternally broken appliances. When a third party threatened this racket by reverse-engineering the DRM that blocked independent repair, they got buried in legal threats:</p>

<p>Everybody loves this racket. In Poland, a team of security researchers at the OhMyHack conference just presented their teardown of the anti-repair features in NEWAG Impuls <em>locomotives</em>. NEWAG boobytrapped their trains to try and detect if they've been independently serviced, and to respond to any unauthorized repairs by bricking themselves:</p>
<p><a href="https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453">https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453</a></p>
<p>Poland is part of the EU, meaning that they are required to uphold the provisions of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive, including Article 6, which bans this kind of reverse-engineering. The researchers are planning to present their work again at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg this month – Germany is also a party to the EUCD. The threat to researchers from presenting this work is real – but so is the threat to conferences that host them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/">https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/</a></p>
<p>20 years ago, Chris Anderson told me that it was unrealistic to expect tech companies to refuse demands for DRM from the entertainment companies whose media they hoped to play. My argument – then and now – was that any tech company that sells you a gadget that can have its features revoked is defrauding you. You're paying for x, y and z – and if they are contractually required to remove x and y on demand, they are selling you something that you can't rely on, without making that clear to you.</p>
<p>But it's worse than that. When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they <em>invite</em> both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded <em>inevitably</em> results in  the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification</a></p>
<p>But even if everyone at that table is a swell egg who wouldn't dream of enshittifying the product, the existence of a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature makes the product vulnerable to <em>external</em> actors who will demand that it be used. Back in 2022, Adobe informed its customers that it had lost its deal to include Pantone colors in Photoshop, Illustrator and other "software as a service" packages. As a result, users would now have to start paying a monthly fee to see their own, completed images. Fail to pay the fee and all the Pantone-coded pixels in your artwork would just show up as black:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process</a></p>
<p>Adobe blamed this on Pantone, and there was lots of speculation about what had happened. Had Pantone jacked up its price to Adobe, so Adobe passed the price on to its users in the hopes of embarrassing Pantone? Who knows? Who <em>can</em> know? That's the point: you invested in Photoshop, you spent money and time creating images with it, but you have no way to know whether or how you'll be able to access those images in the future. Those terms can change at any time, and if you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>These companies are all run by CEOs who got their MBAs at Darth Vader University, where the first lesson is "I have altered the deal, pray I don't alter it further." Adobe <em>chose</em> to design its software so it would be vulnerable to this kind of demand, and then its <em>customers</em> paid for that choice. Sure, Pantone are dicks, but this is <em>Adobe's</em> fault. They stuck a KICK ME sign to your back, and Pantone obliged.</p>
<p>This keeps happening and it's <em>gonna</em> keep happening. Last week, Playstation owners who'd bought (or "bought") Warner TV shows got messages telling them that Warner had walked away from its deal to sell videos through the Playstation store, and so all the videos they'd paid for were going to be deleted forever. They wouldn't even get refunds (to be clear, refunds would also be bullshit – when I was a bookseller, I didn't get to break into your house and steal the books I'd sold you, not even if I left some cash on your kitchen table).</p>
<p>Sure, Warner is an unbelievably shitty company run by the single most guillotineable executive in all of Southern California, the loathsome David Zaslav, who oversaw the merger of Warner with Discovery. Zaslav is the creep who figured out that he could make more money <em>cancelling completed movies and TV shows</em> and taking a tax writeoff than he stood to make by releasing them:</p>
<p><a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership">https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership</a></p>
<p>Imagine putting years of your life into making a program – showing up on set at 5AM and leaving your kids to get their own breakfast, performing stunts that could maim or kill you, working 16-hour days during the acute phase of the covid pandemic and driving home in the night, only to have this absolute <em>turd</em> of a man <em>delete</em> the program before anyone could see it, forever, to get a minor tax advantage. Talk about moral injury!</p>
<p>But without Sony's complicity in designing a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature into the Playstation, Zaslav's war on art and creative workers would be limited to material that hadn't been released yet. Thanks to Sony's awful choices, David Zaslav can break into your house, steal your movies – and he doesn't even have to leave a twenty on your kitchen table.</p>
<p>The point here – the point I made 20 years ago to Chris Anderson – is that <em>this is the foreseeable, inevitable result</em> of designing devices for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades. Anyone who was paying attention should have figured that out in the GW Bush administration. Anyone who does this <em>today</em>? Absolute flaming garbage.</p>
<p>Sure, Zaslav deserves to be staked out over and anthill and slathered in high-fructose corn syrup. But save the next anthill for the Sony exec who shipped a product that would let Zaslav come into your home and rob you. That piece of shit <em>knew what they were doing</em> and <em>they did it anyway</em>. <em>Fuck</em> them. Sideways. With a <em>brick</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studios keep making the case for stealing movies rather than paying for them. As Tyler James Hill wrote: "If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing":</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/the-surprising-connection-between-after-hours-work-and-decreased-productivity">https://slack.com/blog/news/the-surprising-connection-between-after-hours-work-and-decreased-productivity</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38579890">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-js-content="true" data-js-dom="toc"><p><em><strong>Quick take:</strong> How do you spend your time at work and what is it costing you? Slack’s Workforce Index, based on survey responses from more than 10,000 desk workers around the globe, uncovers new findings on how to structure the workday to maximize productivity and strengthen employee well-being and satisfaction. </em></p>
<p>Key learnings include:</p>
<ul><li>Employees who log off at the end of the workday register 20% higher productivity scores than those who feel obligated to work after hours.</li>
<li>Making time for breaks during the workday improves employee productivity and well-being, and yet half of all desk workers say they rarely or never take breaks.</li>
<li>On average, desk workers say that the ideal amount of focus time is around four hours a day, and more than two hours a day in meetings is the tipping point at which a majority of workers feel overburdened by meetings.</li>
<li>Three out of every four desk workers report working in the 3 to 6pm timeframe, but of those, only one in four consider these hours highly productive.</li>
</ul>

<p>For decades, putting in extra hours at the office was seen by many as a sign of hard work and productivity, even a badge of honor. But new research from Slack shows despite that longstanding perception, working after hours is more often associated with <em>lower</em> levels of productivity—and could be a red flag that an employee is juggling too many tasks and needs help prioritizing and balancing their time.</p>
<p>The latest results from the Workforce Index, Slack’s survey of more than 10,000 desk workers, show the productivity gap depends on what’s driving workers to burn the midnight (or early morning) oil. About two out of every five desk workers (37%) are logging on outside of their company’s standard hours at least weekly, and more than half (54%) of these workers say it’s because they feel pressured to, not because they choose to.</p>
<p>Employees who feel <em>obligated</em> to work after-hours register 20% lower productivity scores than those who log off at the end of the standard workday. They also report:</p>
<ul><li>2.1x worse work-related stress</li>
<li>1.7x times lower satisfaction with their overall working environment</li>
<li>2x greater burnout</li>
</ul>
<section><figure><img alt="Employees who feel pressured to work after hours report 20% lower productivity throughout the day" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_After-Hours-Horchata.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_After-Hours-Horchata.png"></figure></section>
<p>Both groups say around 70% of their time spent working is productive—a sign that those working extra hours are putting in as much effort as their colleagues—but those who work after hours are 50% more likely to say their productivity is blocked by competing priorities compared to those who log a standard workday.</p>
<p>On the flip side, employees who work outside of standard hours by choice, to better suit their schedule or to pursue personal ambitions, report no negative impacts and even a slight uptick in their wellness and productivity scores.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“We’ve long seen a focus on quantity over quality across many aspects of work, from how we spend our time to how we define productivity. Constantly feeling like you need to catch up is hurting employees and businesses. This underscores the importance of building a culture of trust where employees feel safe enough to speak up when they need help prioritizing and have the right balance of time in the work day to get work done.”</p></blockquote></div>
<h2>When it comes to productivity, it’s not quantity of time spent working, it’s quality</h2>
<p>Results from the Workforce Index show that a significant portion of desk workers across the globe are struggling to balance their time at work, with different job tiers experiencing this problem in different ways.</p>
<p>More than one in four desk workers (27%), including more than half (55%) of executives, say they spend too much time in meetings. A similar share (25%) of all desk workers, including 43% of executives, say they spend too much time in email.</p>
<p>One in five (20%) don’t have enough time to connect with coworkers, and this problem is most pronounced among more junior employees.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, the data shows that many workers across all levels are plowing through their daily tasks without any down time: Half of desk workers surveyed (50%) say they rarely or never take breaks during the workday. These workers are 1.7x more likely to experience burnout.</p>
<p>Their break-taking counterparts, on the other hand, show 62% higher scores for work-life balance, 43% greater ability to manage stress and anxiety, 43% greater overall satisfaction, and—perhaps surprisingly—13% higher scores for productivity.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“Why did we all come to believe that we are more productive if we are always on and that we need to burn out in order to succeed? It goes back to the first Industrial Revolution, when we started revering machines. The goal of machines is to minimize downtime. But for the human operating system, downtime is not a bug, it’s a feature. Elite athletes know that recovery is part of peak performance. Downtime is a productivity multiplier.”</p></blockquote></div><section><figure><img alt="Workers who regularly take breaks have 13% higher productivity" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Taking-Breaks-Horchata.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Taking-Breaks-Horchata.png"></figure></section>
<h2>Prime productivity hours: Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, the afternoon slump is real</h2>
<p>On average, desk workers say that 70% of their time at work is productive. When asked about prime hours for productivity, answers vary widely, with some desk workers preferring the morning and others preferring the evening. But no matter their preference, a majority (71%) of desk workers agree that the late afternoon is the worst time for work, with productivity plummeting between the hours of 3 and 6pm.</p>
<section><figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Afternoon-Slump-Purple.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Afternoon-Slump-Purple.png"></figure></section>
<p>While three out of every four desk workers report working in the 3-6pm timeframe, only one in four consider these hours highly productive.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“This goes to show that productivity isn’t linear. Productivity happens in bursts, on and off throughout a day, not necessarily in prescribed windows of time, and definitely not for eight consecutive hours. The ‘afternoon slump’ shouldn’t be seen as a bad thing; for many workers this could be an ideal time to take that break that will boost their overall productivity for the day.”</p></blockquote></div>
<p>The most productive people use time management strategies. They are 1.6x more likely to block time to complete specific tasks, 1.7x more likely to only check email at specific times, and 2.2x more likely to set focus timers.</p>
<h2>The “Goldilocks Zone” for work: How to balance your workday to optimize your productivity</h2>
<p>While there’s no one-size-fits-all schedule that applies across all industries, roles, and job levels, a close examination of the data reveals a formula emerging to set employees up for success.</p>
<p>Regardless of job tier, the research shows a “Goldilocks Zone” for the ideal balance of focus time, collaboration time, social connection, and downtime. On average, desk workers say the ideal amount of focus time is around four hours a day. More than two hours a day in meetings is the tipping point at which a majority of workers say they’re spending “too much time” in meetings, with a similar pattern emerging across all job levels. People who say they spend too much time in meetings are more than twice as likely to say they don’t have enough time to focus.</p>
<p>In contrast, about 10% of desk workers, most common among employees with less than one year at a company and those under 30, say they spend <em>too little</em> time in meetings, and this is also associated with decreased sense of belonging and productivity.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“Focus time, collaboration time, connection, and rest are like the macronutrients of a workday. The right balance gives you the energy you need to work your best. We cannot consider these critical components of our work in silos. To be our most effective, we must create the space for collaborative work and for focused work.”</p></blockquote></div>
<h2>What do desk workers most want from AI? Assistance and automation to rightsize the meeting load and free up time</h2>
<p>At the same time that desk workers are struggling with time management, many are also excited about the potential of AI tools to give them more command over balancing their time.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of executives—94%—feel some urgency to incorporate AI into their organizations, with half of executives saying they feel a strong sense of urgency. And yet, our survey shows that adoption of AI is still in its infancy, with only one in five desk workers reporting that they have used AI tools for work.</p>
<p>Given the low adoption, it’s not surprising that most desk workers (more than 80%) say that AI tools are not improving their productivity at work—yet. But they’re anticipating that AI will assist with one of the biggest struggles of the workday: meetings. The top three activities that employees expect AI will provide the most value in the future are 1) meeting notes and recaps 2) writing assistance and 3) automation of workflows.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“People at every job level may be shocked to see that more than two hours of meetings a day reduces productivity. It may feel unrealistic to many team leaders to try to hit that target today. But that’s where the newest generation of AI tools could be a lifesaver. An AI assistant that could accurately summarize meeting notes and automate common workflows could be the key that frees up our time and helps us to unlock the balance we need to set ourselves up for success.”</p></blockquote></div>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p><em>The Workforce Index surveyed 10,333 workers in the U.S., Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the U.K. between August 24 and September 15, 2023. The survey was administered by Qualtrics and did not target Slack or Salesforce employees or customers. Respondents were all desk workers, defined as employed full-time (30 or more hours per week) and either having one of the roles listed below or saying they “work with data, analyze information or think creatively”: executive management (e.g. president/partner, CEO, CFO, C-suite), senior management (e.g. executive VP, senior VP), middle management (e.g. department/group manager, VP), junior management (e.g. manager, team leader), senior staff (i.e. non-management), skilled office worker (e.g. analyst, graphic designer). For brevity, we refer to the survey population as “desk-based” or “desk workers.”</em></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What Is PySimpleGUI ❓</h2>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI is a Python package that enables Python programmers of all levels to create GUIs.  You specify your GUI window using a "layout" which contains widgets (they're called "Elements" in PySimpleGUI).  Your layout is used to create a window using one of the 4 supported frameworks to display and interact with your window.  Supported frameworks include tkinter, Qt, WxPython, or Remi. The term "wrapper" is sometimes used for these kinds of packages.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your PySimpleGUI code is simpler and shorter than writing directly using the underlying framework because PySimpleGUI implements much of the "boilerplate code" for you.  Additionally, interfaces are simplified to require as little code as possible to get the desired result.  Depending on the program and framework used, a PySimpleGUI program may require 1/2 to 1/10th amount of code to create an identical window using one of the frameworks directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">While the goal is to encapsulate/hide the specific objects and code used by the GUI framework you are running on top of, if needed you can access the frameworks' dependent widgets and windows directly. If a setting or feature is not yet exposed or accessible using the PySimpleGUI APIs, you are not walled off from the framework. You can expand capabilities without directly modifying the PySimpleGUI package itself.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bridging the "GUI Gap"</h2>
<p dir="auto">Python has brought a large number of people into the programming community. The number of programs and the range of areas it touches is mindboggling.  But more often than not, these technologies are out of reach of all but a handful of people.  The majority of Python programs are "command line" based. This isn't a problem for programmer-types as we're all used to interacting with computers through a text interface.  While programmers don't have a problem with command-line interfaces, most "normal people" do.  This creates a digital divide, a "GUI Gap".</p>
<p dir="auto">Adding a GUI to a program opens that program up to a wider audience. It becomes more approachable. GUIs can also make interacting with some programs easier, even for those that are comfortable with a command-line interface.  And finally, some problems require a GUI.</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">The results have been fascinating to witness and it's been touching to read the accounts of the journeys of users.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nothing prepared me for the emails that started to arrive soon after the first release of PySimpleGUI. They are heartwarming and heartbreaking tales of life-long dreams of creating a program that required a GUI. Some made a few attempts, giving up each time. Others never started once they started to research what was required.</p>
<p dir="auto">After recounting the varied and long road to finding PySimpleGUI, the stories became similar. They each found success and expressed joy and gratitude. The joy expressed in these messages was unlike anything I had encountered in the entirety of career in the computing field.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's been these emails and the messages of gratitude seen here in the GitHub Issues that made dedicating my life to his project a non-decision.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About Me 👋</h2>
<p dir="auto">Hi there!  I'm Mike.  You'll find me right here, on the PySimpleGUI GitHub, solving problems and continuously pushing PySimpleGUI forward.  I've dedicated my days, nights, and weekends to the project and PySimpleGUI users.  Our successes are ultimately shared.  I'm successful when you're successful.</p>
<p dir="auto">While I'm a relative newcomer to Python, I've been writing software since the 70s.  The majority of my career was spent creating products in Silicon Valley. I bring to PySimpleGUI the same professionalism and dedication as I did to the corporate products I developed. You are my customers now.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project Goals 🥅</h2>
<p dir="auto">Two of the most important goals of the PySimpleGUI project:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Having fun</li>
<li>Your success</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Fun</strong> as a goal on a serious project sounds odd, but it's a serious goal. I find writing these GUI programs to be a lot of fun. One reason is how little time it takes to write a complete solution. If we're not enjoying the process then someone's going to give up.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is a significant amount of documentation, a cookbook, 100's of demo programs to get you immediately running, a detailed call reference, YouTube videos, online Trinket demos, and more... all working to create... a fun experience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Your Success</strong> is a shared goal.  PySimpleGUI was built for developers. You're my peeps. It's been an unexpected reward to see the results of the combined effort of users and PySimpleGUI. Use the documentation &amp; other materials to help build your application.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example 2 - Interactive Window</h2>
<p dir="auto">In this example, our window will remain on the screen until the user closes the window or clicks the Quit button.  The main difference between the one-shot window you saw earlier and an interactive window is the addition of an "Event Loop". The Event Loop reads events and inputs from your window.  The heart of your application lives in the event loop.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Define the window's contents
layout = [[sg.Text(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],
          [sg.Input(key='-INPUT-')],
          [sg.Text(size=(40,1), key='-OUTPUT-')],
          [sg.Button('Ok'), sg.Button('Quit')]]

# Create the window
window = sg.Window('Window Title', layout)

# Display and interact with the Window using an Event Loop
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    # See if user wants to quit or window was closed
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED or event == 'Quit':
        break
    # Output a message to the window
    window['-OUTPUT-'].update('Hello ' + values['-INPUT-'] + &quot;! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI&quot;)

</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's take a quick look at some of the differences between this example and the one-shot window.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, you'll notice differences in the layout.  Two changes in particular are important.  One is the addition of the <code>key</code> parameter to the <code>Input</code> element and one of the <code>Text</code> elements.  A <code>key</code> is like a name for an element.  Or, in Python terms, it's like a dictionary key.  The <code>Input</code> element's key will be used as a dictionary key later in the code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another difference is the addition of this <code>Text</code> element:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="          [sg.Text(size=(40,1), key='-OUTPUT-')],"><pre>          [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>size</span><span>=</span>(<span>40</span>,<span>1</span>), <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>'-OUTPUT-'</span>)],</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">There are 2 parameters, the <code>key</code> we already covered.  The <code>size</code> parameter defines the size of the element in characters.  In this case, we're indicating that this <code>Text</code> element is 40 characters wide, by 1 character high.  Notice that there is no text string specified which means it'll be blank.  You can easily see this blank row in the window that's created.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also added a button,  "Quit".</p>
<p dir="auto">The Event Loop has our familiar <code>window.read()</code> call.</p>
<p dir="auto">Following the read is this if statement:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED or event == 'Quit':
        break"><pre>    <span>if</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>WINDOW_CLOSED</span> <span>or</span> <span>event</span> <span>==</span> <span>'Quit'</span>:
        <span>break</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This code is checking to see if the user closed the window by clicking the "X" or if they clicked the "Quit" button.  If either of these happens, then the code will break out of the event loop.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the window wasn't closed nor the Quit button clicked, then execution continues.  The only thing that could have happened is the user clicked the "Ok" button.  The last statement in the Event Loop is this one:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    window['-OUTPUT-'].update('Hello ' + values['-INPUT-'] + &quot;! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI&quot;)"><pre>    <span>window</span>[<span>'-OUTPUT-'</span>].<span>update</span>(<span>'Hello '</span> <span>+</span> <span>values</span>[<span>'-INPUT-'</span>] <span>+</span> <span>"! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This statement updates the <code>Text</code> element that has the key <code>-OUTPUT-</code> with a string.  <code>window['-OUTPUT-']</code> finds the element with the key <code>-OUTPUT-</code>.  That key belongs to our blank <code>Text</code> element.  Once that element is returned from the lookup, then its <code>update</code> method is called.  Nearly all elements have an <code>update</code> method.  This method is used to change the value of the element or to change some configuration of the element.</p>
<p dir="auto">If we wanted the text to be yellow, then that can be accomplished by adding a <code>text_color</code> parameter to the <code>update</code> method so that it reads:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    window['-OUTPUT-'].update('Hello ' + values['-INPUT-'] + &quot;! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI&quot;,
                              text_color='yellow')"><pre>    <span>window</span>[<span>'-OUTPUT-'</span>].<span>update</span>(<span>'Hello '</span> <span>+</span> <span>values</span>[<span>'-INPUT-'</span>] <span>+</span> <span>"! Thanks for trying PySimpleGUI"</span>,
                              <span>text_color</span><span>=</span><span>'yellow'</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">After adding the <code>text_color</code> parameter, this is our new resulting window:</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">The parameters available for each element are documented in both the <a href="http://calls.pysimplegui.org/" rel="nofollow">call reference documentation</a> as well as the docstrings.  PySimpleGUI has extensive documentation to help you understand all of the options available to you. If you lookup the <code>update</code> method for the <code>Text</code> element, you'll find this definition for the call:</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">As you can see several things can be changed for a <code>Text</code> element.  The call reference documentation is a valuable resource that will make programming in PySimpleGUI, uhm, simple.</p>

<hr>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Layouts Are Funny LOL! 😆</h2>
<p dir="auto">Your window's layout is a "list of lists" (LOL).  Windows are broken down into "rows".  Each row in your window becomes a list in your layout.  Concatenate together all of the lists and you've got a layout...a list of lists.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is the same layout as before with an extra <code>Text</code> element added to each row so that you can more easily see how rows are defined:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="layout = [  [sg.Text('Row 1'), sg.Text(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],
            [sg.Text('Row 2'), sg.Input()],
            [sg.Text('Row 3'), sg.Button('Ok')] ]"><pre><span>layout</span> <span>=</span> [  [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>'Row 1'</span>), <span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>"What's your name?"</span>)],
            [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>'Row 2'</span>), <span>sg</span>.<span>Input</span>()],
            [<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>'Row 3'</span>), <span>sg</span>.<span>Button</span>(<span>'Ok'</span>)] ]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Each row of this layout is a list of elements that will be displayed on that row in your window.</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/layout-with-rows.jpg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/layout-with-rows.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Using lists to define your GUI has some huge advantages over how GUI programming is done using other frameworks.  For example, you can use Python's list comprehension to create a grid of buttons in a single line of code.</p>
<p dir="auto">These 3 lines of code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

</p>
<p dir="auto">Recall how "fun" is one of the goals of the project.  It's fun to directly apply Python's powerful basic capabilities to GUI problems. Instead of pages of code to create a GUI, it's a few (or often 1) lines of code.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Collapsing Code</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's possible to condense a window's code down to a single line of code.  The layout definition, window creation, display, and data collection can all be written in this line of code:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="event, values = sg.Window('Window Title', [[sg.Text(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],[sg.Input()],[sg.Button('Ok')]]).read(close=True)"><pre><span>event</span>, <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>Window</span>(<span>'Window Title'</span>, [[<span>sg</span>.<span>Text</span>(<span>"What's your name?"</span>)],[<span>sg</span>.<span>Input</span>()],[<span>sg</span>.<span>Button</span>(<span>'Ok'</span>)]]).<span>read</span>(<span>close</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/ex1-tkinter.jpg"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/ex1-tkinter.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The same window is shown and returns the same values as the example showing the sections of a PySimpleGUI program.  Being able to do so much with so little enables you to quickly and easily add GUIs to your Python code.  If you want to display some data and get a choice from your user, it can be done in a line of code instead of a page of code.</p>
<p dir="auto">By using short-hand aliases, you can save even more space in your code by using fewer characters.  All of the Elements have one or more shorter names that can be used.  For example, the <code>Text</code> element can be written simply as <code>T</code>. The <code>Input</code> element can be written as <code>I</code> and the <code>Button</code> as <code>B</code>.  Your single-line window code thus becomes:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="event, values = sg.Window('Window Title', [[sg.T(&quot;What's your name?&quot;)],[sg.I()],[sg.B('Ok')]]).read(close=True)"><pre><span>event</span>, <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>Window</span>(<span>'Window Title'</span>, [[<span>sg</span>.<span>T</span>(<span>"What's your name?"</span>)],[<span>sg</span>.<span>I</span>()],[<span>sg</span>.<span>B</span>(<span>'Ok'</span>)]]).<span>read</span>(<span>close</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>)</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Code Portability</h3>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI is currently capable of running on 4 Python GUI Frameworks.  The framework to use is specified using the import statement.  Change the import and you'll change the underlying GUI framework.  For some programs, no other changes are needed than the import statement to run on a different GUI framework.  In the example above, changing the import from <code>PySimpleGUI</code> to <code>PySimpleGUIQt</code>, <code>PySimpleGUIWx</code>, <code>PySimpleGUIWeb</code> will change the framework.</p>

<p dir="auto">Porting GUI code from one framework to another (e.g. moving your code from tkinter to Qt) usually requires a rewrite of your code.  PySimpleGUI is designed to enable you to have easy movement between the frameworks.  Sometimes some changes are required of you, but the goal is to have highly portable code with minimal changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some features, like a System Tray Icon, are not available on all of the ports.  The System Tray Icon feature is available on the Qt and WxPython ports.  A simulated version is available on tkinter.  There is no support for a System Tray icon in the PySimpleGUIWeb port.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing  💾</h2>
<p dir="auto">Two common ways of installing PySimpleGUI:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>pip to install from PyPI</li>
<li>Download the file PySimpleGUI.py and place in your application's folder</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pip Installing &amp; Upgrading</h3>
<p dir="auto">The current suggested way of invoking the <code>pip</code> command is by running it as a module using Python.  Previously the command <code>pip</code> or <code>pip3</code> was directly onto a command-line / shell.  The suggested way</p>
<p dir="auto">Initial install for Windows:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python -m pip install PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Initial install for Linux and MacOS:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python3 -m pip install PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<p dir="auto">To upgrade using <code>pip</code>, you simply add 2 parameters to the line <code>--upgrade --no-cache-dir</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Upgrade installation on Windows:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Upgrade for Linux and MacOS:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python3 -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir PySimpleGUI</code></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Single File Installing</h3>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI was created as a single .py file so that it would be very easy for you to install it, even on systems that are not connected to the internet like a Raspberry Pi.  It's as simple as placing the PySimpleGUI.py file into the same folder as your application that imports it. Python will use your local copy when performing the import.</p>
<p dir="auto">When installing using just the .py file, you can get it from either PyPI or if you want to run the most recent unreleased version then you'll download it from GitHub.</p>
<p dir="auto">To install from PyPI, download either the wheel or the .gz file and unzip the file.  If you rename the .whl file to .zip you can open it just like any normal zip file.  You will find the PySimpleGUI.py file in one of the folders.  Copy this file to your application's folder and you're done.</p>
<p dir="auto">The PyPI link for the tkinter version of PySimpleGUI is:
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/#files" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/#files</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The GitHub repo's latest version can be found here:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/PySimpleGUI.py" rel="nofollow">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/PySimpleGUI.py</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Now some of you are thinking, "yea, but, wait, having a single huge source file is a terrible idea".  And, yea, <em>sometimes</em> it can be a terrible idea.  In this case, the benefits greatly outweighed the downside.  Lots of concepts in computer science are tradeoffs or subjective.  As much as some would like it to be, not everything is black and white.  Many times the answer to a question is "it depends".</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Galleries 🎨</h2>
<p dir="auto">Work on a more formal gallery of user-submitted GUIs as well as those found on GitHub is underway but as of this writing it's not complete.  There are currently 2 places you can go to see some screenshots in a centralized way.  Hopefully, a Wiki or other mechanism can be released soon to do justice to the awesome creations people are making.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">User Submitted Gallery</h3>
<p dir="auto">The first is a <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/10" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/10/hovercard">user submitted screenshots issue</a> located on the GitHub.  It's an informal way for people to show off what they've made.  It's not ideal, but it was a start.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Massive Scraped GitHub Images</h3>
<p dir="auto">The second is a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g67ms0darox0i2p/AAAMrkIM6C64nwHLDkboCWnaa?dl=0" rel="nofollow">massive gallery of over 3,000 images</a> scraped from 1,000 projects on GitHub that are reportedly using PySimpleGUI.  It's not been hand-filtered and there are plenty of old screenshots that were used in the early documentation.  But, you may find something in there that sparks your imagination.</p>
<hr>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Uses for PySimpleGUI 🔨</h2>
<p dir="auto">The following sections showcase a fraction of the uses for PySimpleGUI.  There are over 1,000 projects on GitHub alone that use PySimpleGUI.  It's truly amazing how possibilities have opened up for so many people.  Many users have spoken about previously attempting to create a GUI in Python and failing, but finally achieving their dreams when they tried PySimpleGUI.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Your First GUI</h2>
<p dir="auto">Of course one of the best uses of PySimpleGUI is getting you into making GUIs for your Python projects.  You can start as small as requesting a filename.  For this, you only need to make a single call to one of the "high-level functions" called <code>popup</code>.  There are all kinds of popups, some collect information.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>popup</code> on itself makes a window to display information.  You can pass multiple parameters just like a print.  If you want to get information, then you will call functions that start with <code>popup_get_</code> such as <code>popup_get_filename</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Adding a single line to get a filename instead of specifying a filename on the command line can transform your program into one that "normal people" will feel comfortable using.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

filename = sg.popup_get_file('Enter the file you wish to process')
sg.popup('You entered', filename)"><pre><span>import</span> <span>PySimpleGUI</span> <span>as</span> <span>sg</span>

<span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>popup_get_file</span>(<span>'Enter the file you wish to process'</span>)
<span>sg</span>.<span>popup</span>(<span>'You entered'</span>, <span>filename</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This code will display 2 popup windows.  One to get the filename, which can be browsed to or pasted into the input box.</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">The other window will output what is collected.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rainmeter-Style Windows</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/RainmeterStyleWidgets.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/RainmeterStyleWidgets.jpg" alt="img" width="500px"></a>
The default settings for GUI frameworks don't tend to produce the nicest looking windows.  However, with some attention to detail, you can do several things to make windows look attractive.  PySimpleGUI makes it easier to manipulate colors and features like removing the title bar.  The result is windows that don't look like your typical tkinter windows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example of how you can create windows that don't look like your typical tkinter in windows.  In this example, the windows have their titlebars removed.  The result is windows that look much like those found when using Rainmeter, a desktop widget program.</p>
<p>
You can easily set the transparency of a window as well.  Here are more examples of desktop widgets in the same Rainmeter style.  Some are dim appearing because they are semi-transparent.
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/semi-transparent.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/semi-transparent.jpg" alt="img" width="500px"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Both of these effects; removing the titlebar and making a window semi-transparent, are achieved by setting 2 parameters when creating the window.  This is an example of how PySimpleGUI enables easy access to features.  And because PySimpleGUI code is portable across the GUI frameworks, these same parameters work for the other ports such as Qt.</p>
<p dir="auto">Changing the Window creation call in Example 1 to this line of code produces a similar semi-transparent window:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="window = sg.Window('My window', layout, no_titlebar=True, alpha_channel=0.5)"><pre><span>window</span> <span>=</span> <span>sg</span>.<span>Window</span>(<span>'My window'</span>, <span>layout</span>, <span>no_titlebar</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>, <span>alpha_channel</span><span>=</span><span>0.5</span>)</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Games</h2>
<p dir="auto">While not specifically written as a game development SDK, PySimpleGUI makes the development of some games quite easy.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Chess.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Chess.png" alt="img" width="500px"></a>

<p dir="auto">Capturing and displaying video from your webcam in a GUI is 4 lines of PySimpleGUI code.  Even more impressive is that these 4 lines of code work with the tkinter, Qt, and Web ports.  You can display your webcam, in realtime, in a browser using the same code that displays the image using tkinter.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>Media playback, audio and video, can also be achieved using the VLC player.  A demo application is provided to you so that you have a working example to start from. Everything you see in this readme is available to you as a starting point for your own creations.

<p dir="auto">AI and Python have long been a recognized superpower when the two are paired together. What's often missing however is a way for users to interact with these AI algorithms familiarly, using a GUI.</p>
<p dir="auto">These YOLO demos are a great example of how a GUI can make a tremendous difference in interacting with AI algorithms.  Notice two sliders at the bottom of these windows.  These 2 sliders change a couple of the parameters used by the YOLO algorithm.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>If you were tuning your YOLO demo using only the command line, you would need to set the parameters, once, when you launch the application, see how they perform, stop the application, change the parameters, and finally restart the application with the new parameters.
</p></div>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/YOLO%20Object%20Detection.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/YOLO%20Object%20Detection.jpg" alt="img" width="500px"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Contrast those steps against what can be done using a GUI.  A GUI enables you to modify these parameters in real-time.  You can immediately get feedback on how they are affecting the algorithm.</p>
<p>

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Colorizer.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Colorizer.jpg" alt="img" width="500px"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are SO many AI programs that have been published that are command-line driven.  This in itself isn't a huge hurdle, but it's enough of a "pain in the ass" to type/paste the filename you want to colorize on the command line, run the program, then open the resulting output file in a file viewer.</p>
<p dir="auto">GUIs have the power to <strong>change the user experience</strong>, to fill the "GUI Gap".  With this colorizer example, the user only needs to supply a folder full of images, and then click on an image to both colorize and display the result.</p>
<p dir="auto">The program/algorithm to do the colorization was freely available, ready to use.  What was missing is the ease of use that a GUI could bring.</p>

<p dir="auto">Displaying and interacting with data in a GUI is simple with PySimpleGUI.  You have several options.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>You can use the built-in drawing/graphing capabilities to produce custom graphs.  This CPU usage monitor uses the <code>Graph</code> element

<p dir="auto">Matplotlib is a popular choice with Python users.  PySimpleGUI can enable you to embed Matplotlib graphs directly into your GUI window.  You can even embed the interactive controls into your window if you want to retain the Matplotlib interactive features.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Matplotlib2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/Matplotlib2.jpg" alt="img" width="500px"></a>
Using PySimpleGUI's color themes, you can produce graphs that are a notch above default graphs that most people create in Matplotlib.</p>

<p dir="auto">The "GUI Gap" mentioned earlier can be easily solved using PySimpleGUI.  You don't even need to have the source code to the program you wish to add a GUI onto.  A "front-end" GUI is one that collects information that is then passed to a command-line application.</p>
<p dir="auto">Front-end GUIs are a fantastic way for a programmer to distribute an application that users were reluctant to use previously because they didn't feel comfortable using a command-line interface.  These GUIs are your only choice for command-line programs that you don't have access to the source code for.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>This example is a front-end for a program called "Jump Cutter".  The parameters are collected via the GUI, a command-line is constructed using those parameters, and then the command is executed with the output from the command-line program being routed to the GUI interface.  In this example, you can see in yellow the command that was executed.

<p dir="auto">Because PySimpleGUI is compatible back to Python 3.4, it is capable of creating a GUI for your Raspberry Pi projects.  It works particularly well when paired with a touchscreen.  You can also use PySimpleGUIWeb to control your Pi if it doesn't have a monitor attached.</p>

<p dir="auto">Because it's very easy to access many of the underlying GUI frameworks' features, it's possible to piece together capabilities to create applications that look nothing like those produced using the GUI framework directly.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p>For example, it's not possible to change the color/look-and-feel of a titlebar using tkinter or the other GUI packages, but with PySimpleGUI it's easy to create windows that appear as if they have a custom titlebar.

<p dir="auto">Unbelievably, this window is using tkinter to achieve what appears to be something like a screensaver.</p>
<p dir="auto">On windows, tkinter can completely remove the background from your application.  Once again, PySimpleGUI makes accessing these capabilities trivial.  Creating a transparent window requires adding a single parameter to the call that creates your <code>Window</code>.  One parameter change can result in a simple application with this effect:</p>
<p dir="auto">You can interact with everything on your desktop, clicking through a full-screen window.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Themes</h2>
<p dir="auto">Tired of the default grey GUIs?  PySimpleGUI makes it trivial for your window to look nice by making a single call to the <code>theme</code> function.  There are over 150 different color themes available for you to choose:</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/ThemePreview.jpg" alt="img" width="900px"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">With most GUI frameworks, you must specify the color for every widget you create.  PySimpleGUI takes this chore from you and will automatically color the Elements to match your chosen theme.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use a theme, call the <code>theme</code> function with the name of the theme before creating your window. You can add spaces for readability.  To set the theme to "Dark Grey 9":</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import PySimpleGUI as sg

sg.theme('dark grey 9')"><pre><span>import</span> <span>PySimpleGUI</span> <span>as</span> <span>sg</span>

<span>sg</span>.<span>theme</span>(<span>'dark grey 9'</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This single line of code changes the window's appearance entirely:</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/master/images/for_readme/DarkGrey.jpg" alt="img" width="400px"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">The theme changed colors of the background, text, input background, input text, and button colors.  In other GUI packages, to change color schemes like this, you would need to specify the colors of each widget individually, requiring numerous changes to your code.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you still have a question or need help...  no problem... help is available to you, at no cost. Simply <a href="http://issues.pysimplegui.org/" rel="nofollow">file an Issue</a> on the PySimpleGUI GitHub repo and you'll get help.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nearly all software companies have a form that accompanies bug reports.  It's not a bad trade... fill in the form, get free software support.  This information helps get you an answer efficiently.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to requesting information such as the version numbers of PySimpleGUI and underlying GUI frameworks, you're also given a checklist of items that may help you solve your problem.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Please fill in the form.</strong></em>  It may feel pointless to you.  It may feel painful, despite it taking just a moment.  It helps get you a solution faster.  If it wasn't useful and necessary information to help you get a speedy reply and fix, you wouldn't be asked to fill it out.  "Help me help you".</p>

<p dir="auto">Financial support for the project is greatly appreciated.  To be honest, financial help is needed.  It's expensive just keeping the lights on.  The domain name registrations, a long list of subscriptions for things like Trinket, consulting help, etc., quickly add up to a sizable recurring cost.</p>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI wasn't inexpensive to create. While a labor of love, it was very laborious over several years, and quite a bit was invested, and continues to be invested, in creating what you see today.</p>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI has an open-source license and it would be great if it could remain that way.  If you or your company (especially if you're using PySimpleGUI in a company) are benefiting financially by using PySimpleGUI, you have the capability of extending the life of the project for you and other users.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Buy Me A Coffee</h3>
<p dir="auto">Buy Me a Coffee is a great way to publicly support developers.  It's quick, easy, and your contribution is recorded so that others can see that you're a supporter of PySimpleGUI.  You can also choose to make your donation private.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/PySimpleGUI">GitHub recurring sponsorship</a> is how you can sponsor the project at varying levels of support on an ongoing basis.  It's how many Open Source developers are able to receive corporate level sponsorship.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your help in financially contributing to the project would be greatly appreciated. Being an Open Source developer is financially challenging.  YouTube video creators are able to make a living creating videos.  It's not so easy yet for Open Source developers.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thank you for the Thank You's</h2>
<p dir="auto">To everyone that's helped, in whatever fashion, I'm very very grateful.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even taking a moment to say "thank you" helps, and a HUGE number of you have done that.  It's been an amazing number actually.  I value these thanks and find inspiration in the words alone.  Every message is a little push forward.  It adds a little bit of energy and keeps the whole project's momentum.  I'm so very grateful to everyone that's helped in whatever form it's been.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing  👷</h2>
<p dir="auto">While PySimpleGUI is currently licensed under an open-source license, the project itself is structured like a proprietary product.  Pull Requests are not accepted.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the best ways for you to contribute code is to write and publish applications.  Users are inspired by seeing what other users build.  Here's a simple set of steps you can take - Create a GitHub repo, post the code, and include a screenshot in your repo's readme file.  Then come back to the PySimpleGUI repo and post a screenshot in Issue #10 or in the project's WIKI.</p>
<p dir="auto">If there is a feature missing that you need or you have an enhancement to suggest, then <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=issue-form---must-fill-in-this-form-with-every-new-issue-submitted.md&amp;title=%5B+Enhancement%2FBug%2FQuestion%5D+My+problem+is...">open an Issue</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Special Thanks 🙏</h2>
<p dir="auto">The PySimpleGUI team is tiny and they're all superstars. Every week I've been stunned by what they do. Dream-team is an understatement.  Simply put <a href="https://github.com/Chr0nicT">@Chr0nicT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jason990420">@jason990420</a>, <a href="https://github.com/snaiel">@Snaiel</a> and Mike<a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI">@PySimpleGUI</a> <em><strong>are</strong></em> PySimpleGUI.</p>
<p dir="auto">This version of the PySimpleGUI readme wouldn't have come together without the help from <a href="https://github.com/M4cs">@M4cs</a>. He's a fantastic developer and has been a PySimpleGUI supporter since the project's launch.   <a href="https://github.com/israel-dryer">@israel-dryer</a> is another long-term supporter and has written several PySimpleGUI programs that pushed the envelope of the package's capabilities.  The unique minesweeper that uses an image for the board was created by Israel.  <a href="https://github.com/jason990420">@jason990420</a> surprised many when he published the first card game using PySimpleGUI that you see pictured above as well as the first minesweeper game made with PySimpleGUI.  <a href="https://github.com/Chr0nicT">@Chr0nicT</a> is the youngest developer I've worked with, ever, on projects. This kid shocks me on a regular basis.  Ask for a capability, such as the PySimpleGUI GitHub Issues form error checking bot, and it simply happens regardless of the technologies involved. I'm fortunate that we were introduced. Someday he's going to be whisked away, but until then we're all benefiting from his talent. <a href="https://github.com/snaiel">@Snaiel</a> made the Udemy course happen. It wouldn't have been 1/4th of what it is without his amazing skills in video production, course design, marketing brilliance, and web programming. The Japanese version of the readme was greatly improved with help from  <a href="https://github.com/okajun35">@okajun35</a>. <a href="https://github.com/nngogol">@nngogol</a> has had a very large impact on the project, also getting involved with PySimpleGUI in the first year of initial release.  He wrote a designer, came up with the familiar window[key] lookup syntax, wrote the tools that create the documentation, designed the first set of doc strings as well as tools that generate the online documenation using the PySimpleGUI code itself.  PySimpleGUI would not be where it is today were it not for the help of these individuals.</p>
<p dir="auto">The more than 4,000 GitHub repos that use PySimpleGUI are owed a "Thank You" as well, for it is <em>you</em> that has been the inspiration that fuels this project's engine.</p>
<p dir="auto">The overseas users that post on Twitter overnight are the spark that starts the day's work on PySimpleGUI. They've been a source of positive energy that gets the development engine started and ready to run every day. As a token of appreciation, this readme file has been translated into <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/readme.ja.md">Japanese</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">PySimpleGUI users have been the best user community an Open Source developer could hope for. I've never seen expressions of gratitude and joy like PySimpleGUI users show on a daily basis.</p>

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OpenBao</h2>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note</strong>: We take OpenBao's security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Vault, <em>please responsibly disclose</em> by contacting us at <a href="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/development/openbao-security@lists.lfedge.org">openbao-security@lists.lfedge.org</a>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Announcement list: <a href="https://lists.lfedge.org/g/openbao" rel="nofollow">Mailing List</a></li>
<li>Discussion forum: <a href="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a></li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/development/bao.svg"><img width="300" alt="OpenBao Mascot" src="https://github.com/openbao/openbao/raw/development/bao.svg"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. The OpenBao community intends to provide this software under an OSI-approved open-source license, led by a community run under open governance principles.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where OpenBao steps in.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key features of OpenBao are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Secure Secret Storage</strong>: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored
in OpenBao. OpenBao encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent
storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access
your secrets. OpenBao can write to disk, <a href="https://www.consul.io/" rel="nofollow">Consul</a>,
and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Dynamic Secrets</strong>: OpenBao can generate secrets on-demand for some
systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application
needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks OpenBao for credentials, and OpenBao
will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After
creating these dynamic secrets, OpenBao will also automatically revoke them
after the lease is up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: OpenBao can encrypt and decrypt data without storing
it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and
developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without
having to design their own encryption methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Leasing and Renewal</strong>: All secrets in OpenBao have a <em>lease</em> associated
with them. At the end of the lease, OpenBao will automatically revoke that
secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Revocation</strong>: OpenBao has built-in support for secret revocation. OpenBao
can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,
all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.
Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the
case of an intrusion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams</h2>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Developing Vault</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to work on OpenBao itself or any of its built-in systems, you'll
first need <a href="https://www.golang.org/" rel="nofollow">Go</a> installed on your machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">For local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH" rel="nofollow">GOPATH</a>. Ensure that <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> is in
your path as some distributions bundle the old version of build tools. Next, clone this
repository. OpenBao uses <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules">Go Modules</a>,
so it is recommended that you clone the repository <em><strong>outside</strong></em> of the GOPATH.
You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:</p>

<p dir="auto">To compile a development version of OpenBao, run <code>make</code> or <code>make dev</code>. This will
put the OpenBao binary in the <code>bin</code> and <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> folders:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make dev
...
$ bin/bao
..."><pre>$ make dev
...
$ bin/bao
...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run <code>make static-dist dev-ui</code>. This will
put the OpenBao binary in the <code>bin</code> and <code>$GOPATH/bin</code> folders:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/bao
..."><pre>$ make static-dist dev-ui
...
$ bin/bao
...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To run tests, type <code>make test</code>. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If
this exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that
package by specifying the <code>TEST</code> variable. For example below, only
<code>vault</code> package tests will be run.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make test TEST=./vault
..."><pre>$ make <span>test</span> TEST=./vault
...</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Acceptance Tests</h3>
<p dir="auto">OpenBao has comprehensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing" rel="nofollow">acceptance tests</a>
covering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to
verify it is functioning (and also hasn't broken anything else), we recommend
running the acceptance tests.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Warning:</strong> The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify <em>real resources</em>, which
may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically
possible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,
please run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,
we recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend
you're testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run the acceptance tests, invoke <code>make testacc</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
..."><pre>$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul
...</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>TEST</code> variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the
backend is. The <code>TESTARGS</code> variable is recommended to filter down to a specific
resource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very
long time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Acceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for
things such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell
you what to set, so it is not documented here.</p>

      PRIVACY FIRST
    </p> <p>
      Why does this matter?
    </p> <p>
      Anonymous genetic testing can eliminate several potential vulnerabilities individuals
      are exposed to when purchasing genetic testing services. Most importantly, enabling
      individuals to remain anonymous would eliminate the dependence on data de-identification
      by personal genomics companies prior to data sharing.
    </p></div> <div data-v-d23d7b80=""><div data-v-d23d7b80=""> <p>
        Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, can enable (pseudo)anonymous payments because they rely on blockchain addresses that can have no connection to real-life identities such as name, address or bank accounts. Alternatively, a prepaid debit card purchased with cash can be used to make anonymous payments.
      </p></div> <div data-v-d23d7b80=""> <p>
        Consider using an email address that is not tied to any personal information. Creating a new email address that you are using for nebula purposes only through a service such as <a target="_blank" href="https://protonmail.com/" data-v-d23d7b80="">Protonmail</a> is a great first step.
      </p></div> <div data-v-d23d7b80=""> <p>
        A virtual private network (VPN) is a tool that allows you to browse the internet while maintaining your privacy. It is good practice to always use a VPN, especially when you are purchasing anything or sharing any personal information online.

<h2>"If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing" (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>20 years ago, I got in a (friendly) public spat with Chris Anderson, who was then the editor in chief of <em>Wired</em>. I'd publicly noted my disappointment with glowing <em>Wired</em> reviews of DRM-encumbered digital devices, prompting Anderson to call me unrealistic for expecting the magazine to condemn gadgets for their DRM:</p>
<p><a href="https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html">https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html</a></p>
<p>I replied in public, telling him that he'd misunderstood. This wasn't an issue of ideological purity – it was about good reviewing practice. <em>Wired</em> was telling readers to buy a product because it had features x, y and z, but at any time in the future, without warning, without recourse, the vendor could switch off any of those features:</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/">https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/</a></p>
<p>I proposed that all <em>Wired</em> endorsements for DRM-encumbered products should come with this disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  WARNING: THIS DEVICE’S FEATURES ARE SUBJECT TO REVOCATION WITHOUT NOTICE, ACCORDING TO TERMS SET OUT IN SECRET NEGOTIATIONS. YOUR INVESTMENT IS CONTINGENT ON THE GOODWILL OF THE WORLD’S MOST PARANOID, TECHNOPHOBIC ENTERTAINMENT EXECS. THIS DEVICE AND DEVICES LIKE IT ARE TYPICALLY USED TO CHARGE YOU FOR THINGS YOU USED TO GET FOR FREE — BE SURE TO FACTOR IN THE PRICE OF BUYING ALL YOUR MEDIA OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT NO TIME IN HISTORY HAS ANY ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY GOTTEN A SWEET DEAL LIKE THIS FROM THE ELECTRONICS PEOPLE, BUT THIS TIME THEY’RE GETTING A TOTAL WALK. HERE, PUT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH, IT’LL MUFFLE YOUR WHIMPERS.
</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Wired</em> didn't take me up on this suggestion.</p>
<p>But I was right. The ability to change features, prices, and availability of things you've <em>already paid for</em> is a powerful temptation to corporations. Inkjet printers were always a sleazy business, but once these printers got directly connected to the internet, companies like HP started pushing out "security updates" that modified your printer to make it reject the third-party ink you'd paid for:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>Now, this scam wouldn't work if you could just put things back the way they were before the "update," which is where the DRM comes in. A thicket of IP laws make reverse-engineering DRM-encumbered products into a <em>felony</em>. Combine always-on network access with indiscriminate criminalization of user modification, and the enshittification will follow, as surely as night follows day.</p>
<p>This is the root of all the right to repair shenanigans. Sure, companies withhold access to diagnostic codes and parts, but codes can be extracted and parts can be cloned. The real teeth in blocking repair comes from the law, not the tech. The company that makes McDonald's wildly unreliable McFlurry machines makes a fortune charging franchisees to fix these eternally broken appliances. When a third party threatened this racket by reverse-engineering the DRM that blocked independent repair, they got buried in legal threats:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/20/euthanize-rentier-enablers/#cold-war">https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/20/euthanize-rentier-enablers/#cold-war</a></p>
<p>Everybody loves this racket. In Poland, a team of security researchers at the OhMyHack conference just presented their teardown of the anti-repair features in NEWAG Impuls <em>locomotives</em>. NEWAG boobytrapped their trains to try and detect if they've been independently serviced, and to respond to any unauthorized repairs by bricking themselves:</p>
<p><a href="https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453">https://mamot.fr/@q3k@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453</a></p>
<p>Poland is part of the EU, meaning that they are required to uphold the provisions of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive, including Article 6, which bans this kind of reverse-engineering. The researchers are planning to present their work again at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg this month – Germany is also a party to the EUCD. The threat to researchers from presenting this work is real – but so is the threat to conferences that host them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/">https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/</a></p>
<p>20 years ago, Chris Anderson told me that it was unrealistic to expect tech companies to refuse demands for DRM from the entertainment companies whose media they hoped to play. My argument – then and now – was that any tech company that sells you a gadget that can have its features revoked is defrauding you. You're paying for x, y and z – and if they are contractually required to remove x and y on demand, they are selling you something that you can't rely on, without making that clear to you.</p>
<p>But it's worse than that. When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they <em>invite</em> both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded <em>inevitably</em> results in  the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification</a></p>
<p>But even if everyone at that table is a swell egg who wouldn't dream of enshittifying the product, the existence of a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature makes the product vulnerable to <em>external</em> actors who will demand that it be used. Back in 2022, Adobe informed its customers that it had lost its deal to include Pantone colors in Photoshop, Illustrator and other "software as a service" packages. As a result, users would now have to start paying a monthly fee to see their own, completed images. Fail to pay the fee and all the Pantone-coded pixels in your artwork would just show up as black:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process</a></p>
<p>Adobe blamed this on Pantone, and there was lots of speculation about what had happened. Had Pantone jacked up its price to Adobe, so Adobe passed the price on to its users in the hopes of embarrassing Pantone? Who knows? Who <em>can</em> know? That's the point: you invested in Photoshop, you spent money and time creating images with it, but you have no way to know whether or how you'll be able to access those images in the future. Those terms can change at any time, and if you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>These companies are all run by CEOs who got their MBAs at Darth Vader University, where the first lesson is "I have altered the deal, pray I don't alter it further." Adobe <em>chose</em> to design its software so it would be vulnerable to this kind of demand, and then its <em>customers</em> paid for that choice. Sure, Pantone are dicks, but this is <em>Adobe's</em> fault. They stuck a KICK ME sign to your back, and Pantone obliged.</p>
<p>This keeps happening and it's <em>gonna</em> keep happening. Last week, Playstation owners who'd bought (or "bought") Warner TV shows got messages telling them that Warner had walked away from its deal to sell videos through the Playstation store, and so all the videos they'd paid for were going to be deleted forever. They wouldn't even get refunds (to be clear, refunds would also be bullshit – when I was a bookseller, I didn't get to break into your house and steal the books I'd sold you, not even if I left some cash on your kitchen table).</p>
<p>Sure, Warner is an unbelievably shitty company run by the single most guillotineable executive in all of Southern California, the loathsome David Zaslav, who oversaw the merger of Warner with Discovery. Zaslav is the creep who figured out that he could make more money <em>cancelling completed movies and TV shows</em> and taking a tax writeoff than he stood to make by releasing them:</p>
<p><a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership">https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership</a></p>
<p>Imagine putting years of your life into making a program – showing up on set at 5AM and leaving your kids to get their own breakfast, performing stunts that could maim or kill you, working 16-hour days during the acute phase of the covid pandemic and driving home in the night, only to have this absolute <em>turd</em> of a man <em>delete</em> the program before anyone could see it, forever, to get a minor tax advantage. Talk about moral injury!</p>
<p>But without Sony's complicity in designing a remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrade feature into the Playstation, Zaslav's war on art and creative workers would be limited to material that hadn't been released yet. Thanks to Sony's awful choices, David Zaslav can break into your house, steal your movies – and he doesn't even have to leave a twenty on your kitchen table.</p>
<p>The point here – the point I made 20 years ago to Chris Anderson – is that <em>this is the foreseeable, inevitable result</em> of designing devices for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades. Anyone who was paying attention should have figured that out in the GW Bush administration. Anyone who does this <em>today</em>? Absolute flaming garbage.</p>
<p>Sure, Zaslav deserves to be staked out over and anthill and slathered in high-fructose corn syrup. But save the next anthill for the Sony exec who shipped a product that would let Zaslav come into your home and rob you. That piece of shit <em>knew what they were doing</em> and <em>they did it anyway</em>. <em>Fuck</em> them. Sideways. With a <em>brick</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studios keep making the case for stealing movies rather than paying for them. As Tyler James Hill wrote: "If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing":</p>

                     <p><span>The US Environmental Protection Agency is cracking down on a fluorination process that enhances the barrier properties of certain plastic containers. The agency says the process, used by Inhance Technologies to treat millions of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic containers each year, <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/persistent-pollutants/fluorinating-polyethylene-health-threat/101/i5" shape="rect" title="Is fluorinating polyethylene a health threat?">creates dangerous per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) impurities</a> that can leach into products stored in the treated containers.</span></p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>In a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-protect-people-pfas-leach-plastic-containers-pesticides-and-other" shape="rect" title="EPA Takes Action to Protect People from PFAS that Leach from Plastic Containers into Pesticides and Other Products I US EPA">Dec. 1 notice</a>, the EPA ordered Inhance to stop producing the PFAS by Feb. 28, 2024. The agency says that nine PFAS are created by the company’s fluorination process. Three of them—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid—are highly toxic. Additional testing is needed to determine whether the other six pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment, the EPA says.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Inhance claims in a <a href="https://www.inhancetechnologies.com/news/inhance-technologies-response-to-u.s.-epa-call-to-ban-fluorination" shape="rect" title="Inhance Technologies Response to U.S. EPA Call to Ban Fluorination">news release</a> responding to the EPA’s order that it has modified its fluorination process over the past 2 years, resulting in a more-than-90% decrease in PFAS impurities. PFAS are undetectable in nearly all of its fluorinated plastic packaging, the company says.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>The EPA warned Inhance in 2022 that it was not in compliance with a rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requiring companies to notify the agency before they produce certain PFAS.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Inhance says the EPA’s rule does not apply to its operations because its fluorination process has been in continuous use since 1983. Uses that have been ongoing since before the EPA proposed the rule in 2015 are exempt. The firm says it “will pursue all legal options to protect its customers, suppliers, and employees and to ensure the continued operations of this environmentally critical technology.”</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Fluorinated HDPE containers are used for storing personal care products, detergents, pesticides, and other household and industrial goods. Inhance markets its fluorination process as a way to extend the shelf life of products and prevent permeation through the packaging. The company claims the resulting containers are fully recyclable.</p>
                
            

            
                

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>The EPA first became aware of PFAS impurities created by Inhance’s fluorination process in 2020 after <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/persistent-pollutants/Mosquito-spray-tainted-PFAS-shipping/99/web/2021/01" shape="rect" title="Mosquito spray tainted with PFAS from shipping containers">PFAS-tainted mosquitocide</a> contaminated a Massachusetts drinking water supply. The agency determined that PFOA had leached into the mosquitocide from fluorinated HDPE containers treated by Inhance.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>The EPA and environmental groups filed lawsuits against Inhance in December 2022 for its failure to notify the agency that it produces certain long-chain PFAS. The EPA considers making such PFAS, even as impurities, a significant new use under TSCA.</p>
                
            

            
        
            
            

            
                
                
                
                     <p>Environmental groups involved in the case welcome the EPA’s decision to essentially ban Inhance’s fluorination process. “This is a huge step forward in eliminating PFAS from consumer products and a win for human health and the environment,” Kyla Bennett science policy director at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, says in a <a href="https://peer.org/peer-ceh-applaud-epas-decision-to-protect-people-from-pfas-that-leach-from-plastic-containers/" shape="rect" title="PEER and CEH Applaud EPA’s Decision to Protect People from PFAS that Leach from Plastic Containers">statement</a>. “EPA has known about PFAS leaching from these containers for three years, and it’s a relief that EPA is finally taking action to halt this dangerous practice.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The rebellion against HashiCorp for adopting a competition-limiting license for its Terraform software expanded this week, with word that The Linux Foundation aims to help hatch an open source alternative to Vault, the company's secrets management project.</p>
<p>At the Open Source Summit in Tokyo, Japan, this week, Sebastian Stadil, co-founder and CEO of DevOps automation biz Scalr and one of the organizers of OpenTofu, a fork of Terraform, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/N_0QDOZ-_GE?feature=shared&amp;t=11435">revealed details</a> about the project, dubbed <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ibm.biz/openbao">OpenBao</a>.</p>
<p>OpenBao is a fork of Vault, which helps developers manage secrets like passwords, tokens, certificates, API keys, and the like.</p>

    

<p>Vault, like HashiCorp's Boundary, Consul, Nomad, Packer, Terraform, Vagrant, and Waypoint, has been put under the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq">Business Source License</a>, which disallows other cloud companies from offering the software as a competitive product. And so rivals have forked the Vault code under an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">OSI-compliant license</a> – Mozilla PLv2 – to ensure continued access to the technology.</p>

        


        

<p>"If there are two projects that are identical and one's open source and one's not, I personally believe that the moral choice is to use the open source project and help in some manner," Stadil told the conference.</p>
<p>Stadil explained to <em>The Register</em> that later this month an OpenTofu release candidate is planned and that OpenBao will start accepting new contributions.</p>

        

<p>OpenBao is being incubated by the Linux Foundation, led by IBM developers through LF Edge, an edge computing initiative. The project is not (yet) officially endorsed by IBM. Before it graduates in the eyes of the Linux Foundation, it needs to meet <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md">certain criteria</a> to demonstrate that it's likely to last.</p>
<p>Project viability and longevity were among the concerns voiced by those attending Stadil's presentation, given that OpenTofu and OpenBao are recent projects.</p>
<p>Stadil declined to speak for other companies, and in fact had been told not to make any announcements about other organizations endorsing the projects. But he recommended visiting the project repos and making note of where those <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/graphs/contributors">contributing</a> to the two projects work as a proxy for corporate support.</p>

        

<p>Asked by a conference attendee about HashiCorp's rationale for relicensing its software, Stadil said the official party line is that Terraform is vital to the internet and there's long been a desire to have it under the oversight of The Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>"If HashiCorp in the future wants to join us at OpenTofu we'd be thrilled to see that happen," he said.</p>
<p>Stadil <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/N_0QDOZ-_GE?feature=shared&amp;t=12122">said</a> he can't speculate on HashiCorp's internal decision making process.</p>
<p>Hashicorp, he said, had been burning cash and with interest rates rising it would not be surprising to see the software firm taking steps to generate greater revenue. HashiCorp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the software biz <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ir.hashicorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hashicorp-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial">reported</a> revenue of $146.1 million for its third fiscal quarter of 2024, representing a 17 percent increase year-on-year. That amounted to a GAAP net loss of $39.5 million, which is down from $72 million in the same period last year. ®</p>

<p>Verizon Wireless gave a female victim's address and phone logs to an alleged stalker who pretended to be a police officer, according to an affidavit filed by an FBI special agent. The man, Robert Michael Glauner, was later arrested near the victim's home and found to be carrying a knife at the time, according to the affidavit submitted in court yesterday.</p>
<p>Glauner allegedly traveled from New Mexico to Raleigh, North Carolina, after finding out where she lived and, before arriving, sent a threatening message that said, "if I can't have you no one can." He also allegedly threatened to send nude photos of the victim to her family members.</p>
<p>Glauner was charged yesterday with stalking and fraud "in connection with obtaining confidential phone records" in US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. We aren't posting or linking directly to the court record because it seems to contain the victim's home address. The incident was previously <a href="https://www.404media.co/verizon-gave-phone-data-to-stalker-edrs-search-warrant-pose-as-cop/">reported by 404 Media</a>.</p>
<p>Glauner and the victim met in August or September 2023 on xhamster.com, a porn website with dating features, and "had an online romantic relationship," the affidavit said. The victim ended the relationship, but Glauner "continued to contact or try to contact" her, the document said.</p>
<p>Glauner tricked Verizon into providing sensitive information by sending an email and fake search warrant to vsat.cct@one.verizon.com, the email address for the Verizon Security Assistance Team (VSAT), which handles legal requests. Verizon didn't realize the request was fraudulent even though it came from a Proton Mail address rather than from a police department or other governmental agency, according to the affidavit filed yesterday by FBI Special Agent Michael Neylon.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Fake cop, forged judge’s signature</h2>
<p>An email to Verizon from "steven1966c@proton.me" on September 26, 2023, said, "Here is the pdf file for search warrant. We are in need if the [<em>sic</em>] this cell phone data as soon as possible to locate and apprehend this suspect. We also need the full name of this Verizon subscriber and the new phone number that has been assigned to her. Thank you."</p>
<p>The email's attached document contained a fake affidavit written by "Detective Steven Cooper" of the Cary, North Carolina Police Department. The Cary Police Department confirmed that no officer named Steven Cooper is employed by their agency, Neylon wrote.</p>
<p>VSAT received a phone call the same day from a man identifying himself as Cooper, who stated that he needed information on a suspect in a homicide case. "The caller stated that the person involved changed her phone number," Neylon wrote.</p>
<p>The fake affidavit asked for the new phone number as well as "call records both outgoing and incoming" and "locations and text messages incoming and outgoing." The affidavit for a search warrant was supposedly approved by Superior Court Judge Gale Adams.</p>
<p>Adams is a real judge and she later confirmed to authorities "that the signature displayed on the document was not hers," Neylon wrote. Neylon's affidavit also said the "search warrant" was "not in the proper format and does not have form AOC-CR-119, as required for State of North Carolina search warrants."</p>
<h2>Verizon provides address and phone logs</h2>
<p>But after reviewing the email and document sent by "Cooper," Verizon provided an address and phone logs. "On October 5, 2023, Verizon Wireless provided Victim 1's phone records, including address and phone logs, to Glauner," according to Neylon's affidavit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/account/manage-account/security/security-assist-team">Verizon's website</a> says that the Verizon Security Assistance Team ensures that "court orders, search warrants, subpoenas and other legal demands served upon Verizon are processed confidentially and in compliance with all applicable law."</p>
<p>"Verizon Security Assistance Team will only accept valid legal demands (subpoena, court order or search warrant) for records," the VSAT webpage says.</p>
<p>We contacted Verizon about the incident today and will update this article if we get a response. A Verizon spokesperson told 404 Media that the company is cooperating with law enforcement on this matter.</p>

<p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit amazing performance on a wide
variety of tasks such as text modeling and code generation. However,
they are also very large. For example Llama 2 70B has 70 billion
parameters that require 140GB of memory to store in half precision. This
presents many challenges, such as needing multiple GPUs just to serve a
single LLM. To address these issues, researchers have developed
compression methods that reduce the size of models without destroying
performance.</p>
<p>One class of methods, post-training quantization, compresses trained
model weights into lower precision formats to reduce memory
requirements. For example, quantizing a model from 16 bit to 2 bit
precision would reduce the size of the model by 8x, meaning that even
Llama 2 70B would fit on a single 24GB GPU. In this work, we introduce
<strong>QuIP#</strong>, which combines lattice codebooks with
incoherence processing to create state-of-the-art 2 bit quantized
models. These two methods allow QuIP# to significantly close the gap
between 2 bit quantized LLMs and unquantized 16 bit models.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="method-overview">Method Overview</h3>
<p>QuIP# relies on two main components: <em>incoherence processing</em>
and <em>lattice codebooks</em>. Incoherence processing in the context of
model quantization was introduced in QuIP. While QuIP used a Kronecker
product to perform incoherence processing, we introduce a Hadamard
transform-based incoherence approach that is more amenable to fast GPU
acceleration.</p>
<p>Incoherence-processed weights are approximately Gaussian-distributed,
which means that they are suitable for quantizing with symmetric and
“round” codebooks. We introduce a new lattice codebook based on the
<span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice, which achieves the
optimal 8 dimension unit ball packing density. Our codebooks are
specifically designed to be hardware-friendly by exploiting symmetries
in these lattices.</p>
<h3 id="quantization-background">Quantization Background</h3>
<p>In QuIP#, we follow existing state-of-the-art post training
quantization methods and round weights to minimize the per-layer
“adaptive rounding” proxy objective</p>
<p><span>\[
\ell(\hat W)
  = E_x \left[ \| (\hat W - W)x \|^2 \right]
  = \operatorname{tr}\left(
    (\hat W - W) H (\hat W - W)^T
   \right).
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span>\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times
n}\)</span> is the original weight matrix in a given layer, <span>\(\hat W = \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> are the
quantized weights, <span>\(x \in
\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is an input vector drawn uniformly at random from
a calibration set, and <span>\(H\)</span> is the
second moment matrix of these vectors, interpreted as a proxy Hessian.
This intra-layer formulation makes quantization tracatable for large
language models. The original QuIP paper forumlated a class of adaptive
rounding methods that used linear feedback to minimize <span>\(\ell\)</span>. Within this class, the LDLQ
rounding algorithm was shown to be optimal; we use LDLQ in QuIP# as
well.</p>
<h3 id="incoherence-processing">Incoherence Processing</h3>
<p>The main insight of QuIP is that incoherent weight and hessian
matrices result in improved quantization performance. Informally, this
means that weights that are even in magnitude with important rounding
directions (the Hessians) that are not too large in any one coordinate
are significantly easier to quantize without catastrophic error. In some
sense, incoherence processing can be viewed as a form of outlier
suppression across weight and activation spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> <em>We say a symmetric Hessian matrix
<span>\(H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)</span> is
<span>\(\mu\)</span>-incoherent if it has an
eigendecomposition <span>\(H = Q \Lambda
Q^T\)</span> such that for all <span>\(i\)</span>
and <span>\(j\)</span>, <span>\(|Q_{ij}| = |e_i^T Q e_j| \leq \mu /
\sqrt{n}\)</span>. By extension, we say a weight matrix <span>\(W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span> is <span>\(\mu\)</span>-incoherent if for all <span>\(i\)</span> and <span>\(j\)</span>, <span>\(|W_{ij}| =
|e_i^T W e_j| \leq \mu \|W\|_F / \sqrt{mn}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Incoherence is an important property for quantizing models. In QuIP,
the incoherence condition on <span>\(H\)</span> is
required to show that LDLQ achieves a superior proxy loss to nearest and
stochastic rounding through a spectral bound on <span>\(H\)</span>. Therefore, it is important to be able
to incoherence-process weight and hessian matrices efficiently so that
incoherence-processed models can be tractably deployed.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by conjugating <span>\(W\)</span> and <span>\(H\)</span> by random orthogonal matrices. Let
<span>\(U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}\)</span>, and
<span>\(V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)</span> be
two random orthogonal matrices. If we assign <span>\(\tilde H \gets V H V^T\)</span> and <span>\(\tilde W \gets U W V^T\)</span>, <span>\(\tilde H\)</span> and <span>\(\tilde W\)</span> become incoherence processed
with high probability (see QuIP for proof). One can verify that this
transformation preserves the proxy objective as <span>\[\operatorname{tr}(\tilde W \tilde H \tilde W^T) =
\operatorname{tr}((U W V^T) (V H V^T) (V W^T U^T)) =
\operatorname{tr}(WHW^T).\]</span></p>
<h4 id="randomized-hadamard-transformation-rht">Randomized Hadamard
Transformation (RHT)</h4>
<p>To construct <span>\(U\)</span> and <span>\(V\)</span> from above, we use the RHT, which is
amenable to fast GPU implementation. In fact, one of the CUDA sample
kernels is the RHT. The RHT performs the multiplication <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{H}Sx\)</span>,
where <span>\(\mathbb{H}\)</span> is a <span>\(n \times n\)</span> Hadamard matrix (scaled by a
normalization factor) and <span>\(S\)</span> is a
<span>\(n\)</span> dimensional random sign vector.
The RHT concentrates the entries of <span>\(x\)</span> and thus results in incoherent matrices
through an <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/teaching/15859-fall20/lecture_2.1.pdf">application
of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality</a>. Note that the Hadamard transform
can be computed more efficiently than a matrix multiplication via the
fast Walsh-Hadamard transform, which we employ directly for powers of 2.
To handle non power-of-two values of <span>\(n\)</span>, we perform the following
algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let <span>\(p\)</span> be the remaining
dimension and reshape <span>\(Sx\)</span> into a
<span>\(n/p \times p\)</span> matrix.</li>
<li>Perform the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform on <span>\(Sx\)</span> associated with dimension <span>\(n/p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Let <span>\(\mathbb{H}'\)</span> be a <span>\(p \times p\)</span> scaled Hadamard matrix. Apply
this Hadamard transform to <span>\(Sx\)</span> on
the right, and reshape back.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only consequence of performing RHT is needing to store two sign
vectors per layer: <span>\(S_U\)</span> and <span>\(S_V\)</span>. Since large language models have
large weight and Hessian matrices, this only increases the number of
bits per weight in practice by less than 0.01, or a negligible
amount.</p>
<h3 id="lattice-codebooks">Lattice Codebooks</h3>
<p>Incoherence processed weights are approximately Gaussian-distributed,
meaning that they are symmetric and “round.” To take advantage of this
“roundness,” we can use <span>\(n\)</span>
dimensional codebooks that quantize <span>\(n\)</span> weights at once. Specifically, to
quantize <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> to a
<span>\(n\)</span> dimensional codebook <span>\(C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\)</span>, we round
<span>\(x\)</span> to its nearest distance-wise
entry in <span>\(C\)</span>. This requires <span>\(\log_2m\)</span> bits to represent which index in
<span>\(C\)</span> to store, and results in <span>\(k = \frac{\log_2m}{n}\)</span> bits per
weight.</p>
<p>Increasing <span>\(n\)</span> results in a
“rounder” codebook that reduces quantization error. However, note that
the number of bits per weight is determined by <em>both</em> the number
of entries in <span>\(C\)</span> (m) as well as the
dimension of <span>\(C\)</span> (n). To maintain a
set number of bits per weight, a linear increase in <span>\(n\)</span> requires an exponential increase in
<span>\(m\)</span>. For example, a naively designed
16-dimensional codebook requires <span>\(2^{32}\)</span> entries to achieve 2 bits per
weight, but performing lookups into a size <span>\(2^{32}\)</span> codebook is intractable. Thus, it
is important to design codebooks that both have relatively large <span>\(n\)</span> while being compressible so the actual
lookup happens with less than <span>\(2^{nk}\)</span> entries.</p>
<p>Geometric lattices are suitable bases for such codebooks as most
lattices have inherent symmetries and certain lattices achieve optimal
bin packing densities. For example, our E8P codebook based on the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice has <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> entries but only requires looking
up into a size <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook due to
symmetries inherent to the <span>\(E_8\)</span>
lattice itself – more on this later. In QuIP#, we present the E8P
codebook based on the 8-dimensional <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice. This lattice achieves the 8
dimensional kissing number, or the maximum number of unit balls touching
a central unit ball in 8 dimensions. Interestingly, Maryna Viazovska
recently won the Fields Medal in 2022 “for the proof that the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice provides the densest packing
of identical spheres in 8 dimensions.”</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://cornell-relaxml.github.io/quip-sharp/img/kissing2d.png" alt="The 2D kissing number is 6, which is achieved by this packing configuration. Image from Wikipedia.">

</figure>
<h4 id="e8p-codebook">E8P Codebook</h4>
<p>Our E8P codebook is a version of the <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice intersected with a ball,
padded (hence the P in E8P) to reach <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> entries. This results in <span>\(k = 16/8 = 2\)</span> bits per weight. The <span>\(E_8\)</span> lattice is composed of 8 dimensional
all-integer or all-half integer vectors whose sum is an even number. In
set-builder notation, <span>\[E_8 = \left\{x \mid x
\in \left(\mathbb{Z}^8 \cup \left(\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}\right)^8\right)
\land \sum_i x_i \equiv 0 \pmod 2\right\}.\]</span> Note that <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span> has the same packing
density of <span>\(E_8\)</span> and is equivalent to
<span>\(D_8 + \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{1}{4}\)</span>,
where <span>\(D_8\)</span> is the set of 8
dimensional all-integer vectors with even sum. Denote <span>\(D_8 + \frac{1}{2}\)</span> as <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>; all elements in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> also have even sum parity.</p>
<p>Now, note that if we flip an even number of signs of an element in
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, we get another element
in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, whereas flipping an
odd number of signs results in something not in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. This is due to <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> being a half integer grid;
flipping a single half integer results in changing the sum parity. Since
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span> has 8 dimensions, there
are <span>\(2^8/2 = 128\)</span> possible “even sign
flip” patterns to stay within <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Conversely, there are also 128
“odd sign flip” patterns.</p>
<p>If we start from some “source codebook” <span>\(S\)</span> that is a subset of <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span>, where <span>\(|\cdot|\)</span> denotes the elementwise absolute
value, we can use 128 odd or even sign flips to generate a subset of
<span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Each entry in <span>\(S\)</span> is either an odd or even number of
flips away from an entry in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, but not both. Thus, given an
entry <span>\(s \in S\)</span> and 7 out of the 8
sign flips, we can infer the last one from the parity of the 7 sign
flips and <span>\(s\)</span>. This lets us use the
following bit pattern to store a 16-bit codeword in <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span>: 8 bits for the entry
index in <span>\(S\)</span>, 7 bits for the sign
flips of the right 7 dimensions of the entry in <span>\(S\)</span>, and 1 bit to add or subtract <span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if we had the codeword <code>0001010110010111</code>,
the first 8 bits <code>00010101</code> = 21 would indicate that we start
with the 21st entry in <span>\(S\)</span>. In this
example, let this be the vector</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which is not in <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Thus,
<span>\(s\)</span> requires an odd number of sign
flips to get into <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>. Then,
the next 7 bits <code>1001011</code> would indicate that we need to
negate the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 7th from right bits. Since we need an odd
number of sign flips, the 8th from right bit is also a sign flip. The
sign-decoded vector is then</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2},
\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2},
-\frac{1}{2}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which we can verify is in <span>\(E_8\)</span>.
Finally, the last bit <code>1</code> indicates that we need to add <span>\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, so the final decoded vector
is</p>
<p><span>\[\left\{-\frac{1}{4}, -\frac{3}{4},
\frac{3}{4}, \frac{7}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4},
-\frac{1}{4}\right\},\]</span></p>
<p>which is in <span>\(E_8 + \frac{1}{4}\)</span> as
desired.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, this lets us decode a size <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> codebook by looking up into only a
size <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook (namely <span>\(S\)</span>) and performing some operations. On
hardware, this means that we can store the smaller <span>\(2^8\)</span> codebook in local caches, avoiding
performance killing memory accesses that the larger <span>\(2^{16}\)</span> codebook would require. The
question remains then of how to choose <span>\(S\)</span>. In our implementation, we set <span>\(S\)</span> to be the 227 elements of <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span> with norm <span>\(\le \sqrt{10}\)</span> plus 29 elements from <span>\(|\hat{D_8}|\)</span> that have norm <span>\(\sqrt{12}\)</span>. The exact elements chosen can
be found in our code.</p>
<h4 id="codebook-errors">Codebook Errors</h4>
<p>To show the optimality of our lattice codebooks, we plotted the
minimum achievable elementwise MSE of quantizing a <span>\(n\)</span>-dimensional multivariate Gaussian to
various <span>\(k\)</span> bit codebooks. To create
each codebook, we intersected a ball with the base lattice and increased
the radius of the ball to get more bits. The half integer codebooks are
formed from the <span>\(n\)</span>-dimensional half
integer grids.</p>
<p>Specifically, each point in the graph below plots <span>\((k, y)\)</span> where</p>
<p><span>\[y = \min_{s \in \mathbb{R}^+}
\frac{1}{n}\left\|\mbox{quantize}\left(\frac{\mathcal{N}(0_n, I_n)}{s},
\mbox{codebook}\right)*s - \mathcal{N}(0_n, I_n)\right\|^2\]</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://cornell-relaxml.github.io/quip-sharp/img/lattice_err.png" title="Lattice Errors" alt="Lowest element-wise mean squared error (MSE) achievable for quantizing a multivariate Gaussian to various codebooks. The E_8 lattice achieves the densest unit-sphere packing in 8 dimensions and our derivative codebooks have the lowest MSE.">

</figure>
<p>The <span>\(E_8\)</span>-based codebooks achieves
lower MSEs than all other codebooks, including those based on the <span>\(D_4\)</span> lattice that achieves the 4
dimensional kissing number. This figure also shows the importance of
having a large number of columns <span>\(n\)</span>.
Increasing the number of columns decreases the error for the half
integer grid, as the resulting codebook is more “round.” Since the E8P
codebook is actually the union of two shifted codebooks, each of which
is a ball intersected with <span>\(\hat{D_8}\)</span>, it is not perfectly round.
This is reflected in the MSE plot, where it sits slightly above the
<span>\(E_8\)</span> line. However, there does not
exist a <span>\(E_8\)</span> codebook with exactly 2
bits, so E8P is still practically superior.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Here, we present quantization results using QuIP# on Llama 1 and 2
models. All models were quantized using the Hadamard transform for
incoherence processing and a weight scale factor of roughly 0.9 times
the optimal scale for a multivariate Gaussian to compensate for
inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, all Llama 2 models were evaluated
using a context lenth of 4096 and all Llama 1 models were evaluated with
context length 2048; these numbers match the context length the models
were trained with. These and other models can be found in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/relaxml">Hugging Face repository</a>.</p>
<p>The table below contains results for all Llama 1 and 2 models when
quantized to 2 bits using the E8P codebook. QuIP# achieves excellent
performance across all model sizes on both language modeling and zero
shot tasks. Furthermore, on the zero-shot tasks (ArcC, ArcE, BoolQ,
PiQA, WinoGrande), QuIP# models achieve near-native performance with
minimal degradation. Additional results are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18woLrIBdVGUr9CuFDbK9pl_6QzEBl09hfnoe4Qkg7Hg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary">Was it too good to be true? <a href="https://beeper.com/">Beeper</a>, the startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/beeper-reversed-engineered-imessage-to-bring-blue-bubble-texts-to-android-users/">reverse-engineered iMessage</a> to bring blue bubble texts to Android users, is experiencing an outage, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501">reported via a post on X on Friday</a>. And Apple is to blame, it seems. Users, including those of us at TechCrunch with access to the app, began seeing error messages when trying to send texts via the newly released Beeper Mini and messages are not going through.</p>
<p>The error message reads: “failed to lookup on server: lookup request timed out” spelled out in red letters.</p>

<p>In a response to a question on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beeper/comments/18duom1/comment/kcjk6df/">Reddit</a> as to whether or not the app was broken, a Beeper team member had earlier replied, “Report a problem from the app, give us a chance to look into it.”</p>
<p>However, Beeper CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmigi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmigi/">Eric Migicovsky</a> responded to TechCrunch’s inquiry about Beeper Mini’s status by pointing us to <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501">the X post acknowledging the outage</a>, and providing more detail. Asked if possibly Apple found a way to cut off Beeper Mini’s ability to function, he replied, “Yes, all data indicates that.”</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investigating reports that sending/receiving is not working in Beeper Mini 🔎</p>
<p>— Beeper (@onbeeper) <a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733223640270082501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>We don’t know what this means for the future of Beeper Mini’s efforts, unless Beeper’s engineers are able to work around the problem somehow.</p>
<p>Migicovsky, who previously founded the smartwatch Pebble, has argued that Beeper Mini wasn’t just beneficial for Android users who wanted to finally join their iMessage friends’ group chats, but that it increased security for iPhone users, too.</p>
<p>In an interview ahead of Beeper Mini’s launch, the founder explained that green bubble texts were unencrypted.</p>
<p>“That means that anytime you text your Android friends, anyone can read the message. Apple can read the message. Your phone carrier can read the message. Google… literally, it’s just like a postcard. Anyone can read it. So Beeper Mini actually increases the security of iPhones,” he had told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, sees iMessage as one of the key tools for locking in users to its ecosystem, which is why it won’t launch an iMessage app for Android. While there was some hope that EU regulations would force it to make iMessage more interoperable, news this week indicates that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/imessage-will-reportedly-get-a-reprieve-from-eus-interoperability-regulation/">iMessage will get a reprieve from those rules</a> because the service is not popular enough with business users. That means Apple has no reason not to try to shut down Beeper Mini, if it could.</p>
<p>Migicovsky is none too pleased with that turn of events.</p>
<p>“I would be very interested to hear why they think that making security worse for iPhone users makes sense,” he said.</p>
<p>“If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is — if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they try to kill a service that enables iPhones to send encrypted chats to Android users? With their announcement of RCS support, it’s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?,” he asked.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Beeper’s team had originally been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/pebble-founder-launches-beeper-a-universal-chat-app-that-works-with-imessage-and-others/">working on a multi-platform messaging aggregator</a>, which was renamed Beeper Cloud this week as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/beeper-reversed-engineered-imessage-to-bring-blue-bubble-texts-to-android-users/"> Beeper Mini went to launch</a>. The latter uses new <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works">technology</a> that allows Android users to text iMessage users as if they were also texting from an iPhone for just $1.99 per month. That means blue bubbles in the group chat, not green ones. Because the startup was no longer using a middleman — like a Mac server relaying messages, as other iMessage-to-Android apps employ — it would essentially appear to Apple’s servers that Beeper Mini’s messages were coming from a device that runs iMessage natively. It’s unclear, then, how Apple was able to cut off Beeper Mini’s access.</p>
<p>What this means for Beeper Mini’s future is uncertain.</p>
<p>“We’ll evaluate options,” Migicovsky said.</p>

Spinning out of a research program from our team and academic collaborators, with roots in <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-08-hyena-safari">signal processing-inspired sequence models</a>, we are excited to introduce the <strong>StripedHyena </strong>models. This release includes <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/StripedHyena-Hessian-7B"><strong>StripedHyena-Hessian-7B</strong> <strong>(SH 7B)</strong></a>, a base model, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/StripedHyena-Nous-7B"><strong>StripedHyena-Nous-7B (SH-N 7B)</strong></a>, a chat model. StripedHyena builds on the many lessons learned in the past year on designing efficient sequence modeling architectures: <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/hungry-hungry-hippos-towards-language-modeling-with-state-space-models">H3</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-07-hyena">Hyena</a>, <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna">HyenaDNA</a>, and <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/monarch-mixer">Monarch Mixer</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/657376483aa570d149ef2a34_ezgif-1-cf1baf1671.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>StripedHyena is the first alternative model competitive with the best open-source Transformers in short and long-context evaluations. The same base model achieves comparable performance with<strong> </strong>Llama-2, Yi and Mistral 7B on OpenLLM leaderboard tasks, outperforming on long-context summarization.</li><li>StripedHyena is faster and more memory efficient for long sequence training, fine-tuning, and generation. Beside attention, one core computational primitive for efficient inference is a state-space model (SSM) layer, building on pioneering work such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">S4</a> (Gu el al.), enabling conversion of convolutional layers into recurrences. Using our latest research on fast kernels for gated convolutions (<a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/flashfftconv">FlashFFTConv</a>) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">on efficient Hyena inference</a>, StripedHyena is &gt;30%, &gt;50%, and &gt;100% faster in end-to-end training on sequences of length 32k, 64k and 128k respectively, compared to an optimized Transformer baseline using FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels. StripedHyena caches for autoregressive generation are &gt;50% smaller than an equivalently-sized Transformer using grouped-query attention.&nbsp;</li><li>StripedHyena is designed using our latest research on <strong>scaling laws of efficient architectures.</strong> In particular, StripedHyena is a hybrid of attention and gated convolutions arranged in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena operators</a>. Via a compute-optimal scaling protocol, we identify several ways to improve on baseline scaling laws for Transformers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Chinchilla</a>) at the architecture level, such as hybridization. With these techniques, we are able to obtain higher quality models than Transformers at each training compute budget, with additional benefits at inference time.</li><li>StripedHyena is optimized using a set of new <strong>model grafting</strong> techniques, enabling us to change the model architecture during training. StripedHyena was obtained by grafting architectural components of Transformers and Hyena, and trained on a mix of the RedPajama dataset, augmented with longer-context data.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>We look forward to further pushing the boundaries of model architectures for fast training and inference, allowing us to improve on existing scaling laws and to obtain higher quality base models at each compute budget. </p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>A single architecture for short and longer context tasks</strong>‍</h2><p>For the past year, the Together AI team and our collaborators at Hazy Research have been working on the design of new sequence models for language and other domains. We’ve been especially excited by architectures that replace attention as the primary operator responsible for mixing sequences of embeddings, and replacing them with alternatives that are computationally cheaper. We’ve developed several models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10866">Hyena</a>) that replace attention with implicit gated convolutions and gated SSMs, and trained some of the first alternative architectures rivaling Transformers on language.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Evaluation</strong></h3><p>We evaluate StripedHyena on a suite of benchmarks to establish performance on short-context tasks, as well as to probe its ability to process long prompts.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we test perplexity scaling on a subset of books from Project Gutenberg. We compute the perplexity on the last 2048 tokens of each sample, and repeat the experiment by including increasingly longer prefixes in the prompt of StripedHyena. We observe different behaviors depending on the structure of the sample; perplexity either saturates at 32k (the input length seen during the last stages of training), or keeps decreasing past 32k, suggesting that the model is able to incorporate some information from the longer prompt.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f121802735f813cafb9_PastedGraphic-5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Context length scaling on books sampled from the Gutenberg collection.

On short-context tasks, including <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard">OpenLLM</a> leaderboard tasks, StripedHyena outperforms Llama-2 7B, Yi 7B and the strongest Transformer alternatives such as RWKV 14B:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/6573705b70c9c003c9a61e1e_average.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Average of standard short-context, benchmarks: `arc-challenge`, `mmlu`, `boolq`, `winogrande`, `hellaswag`, `truthfulqa`. We use the few shot configuration from the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard">OpenLLM</a> leaderboard. <strong>SH 7B is the first alternative model with performance comparable to the best Transformer</strong> baselines of the same size or larger.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>With our collaborators at <a href="https://nousresearch.com/">Nous Research</a>, we are excited to also release <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/StripedHyena-Nous-7B">StripedHyena-Nous- 7B</a> (SH-N 7B), a chat model, built with new fine-tuning recipes tailored to the StripedHyena architecture.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Understanding the architecture design space:&nbsp;Many ways to improve scaling</strong></h2><h3><strong>Hybridization&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>Early in our scaling experiments, we noticed a consistent trend: given a compute budget, architectures built out of mixtures of different key layers always outperform homogenous architectures. These observations echo findings described in various papers: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mega+arxiv+model&amp;oq=mega+arxiv+model&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l4j33i299.3100j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">MEGA</a> (among others) and find even earlier connections to the hybrid global-local attention design of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">GPT-3</a> (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10509.pdf">Sparse Transformers</a>) and <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt_neo">GPTNeo</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>To understand this phenomenon, as well as the improvement on scaling coefficients – for example, the expected loss reduction per floating point operation (FLOP) in the budget – for a class of architectures, we carried out an extensive compute-optimal scaling analysis. We found hybrids composed of multi-head attention, gated MLPs and gated convolutions to outperform strong Transformer architectures such as Llama across compute budget, and identified optimal ways to mix these components, in both ordering and quantity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65734be22ed8d1eca69a9876_graph23.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>[Left] Perplexity scaling of different architectures, as a function of compute budget. [Right] Optimal hybridization ratio for the compute-optimal model at each compute budget. All points in the figures above, each representing a training setting (model size, architecture, and total number of tokens) are compute-optimal.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65734b5af10b77767f02d895_graph22.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Perplexity scaling analysis. We follow a compute-optimal protocol and identify the optimal model sizes for each FLOP group (each indicated via a different color) for base and hybrid architectures. To minimize the impact of hyperparameters on different architectures, we derive hyperparameter scaling laws from a subset of optimized experiments. <strong>Hybridizing improves on both scaling and robustness to training performed outside the compute-optimal frontier.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>With our academic partners, we have been developing theory and synthetic tasks to understand how and why this occurs. We have identified a variety of regimes where layers specialize to particular sub-tasks of sequence modeling, providing valuable signals for further architecture optimization. This continues our general line of work on <strong>mechanistic design</strong>, which involves small-scale, synthetic tasks carefully constructed to stress-test architecture capabilities.</p><h3><strong>Multi-head gated convolutions</strong></h3><p>‍</p><p>Another way to improve over Transformer rates is to introduce additional computation in the form of multiple heads in gated convolutions. This design, inspired by linear attention, has been validated in architectures such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14052">H3</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">MultiHyena</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">is provably more efficient at encoding associative recall circuits.</a>&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/6573717223a903c3f413a3bd_white%20lines.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>We validate a variety of architectural improvements via compute-optimal scaling.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>These are two of many architectural design techniques that can result in improved scaling over Transformers. With StripedHyena, we focus in particular on the synergy between attention and gated convolutions.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>A shift in the computational footprint of language models: Cheaper fine-tuning, faster inference</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>Optimizing models built on a different architecture requires rethinking computational trade-offs of training, fine-tuning, and inference. For these new architectures, a different set of computational bottlenecks emerges, and we’re proud to have developed the key technologies enabling these models as well, such as <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/flashfftconv">FlashFFTConv</a> and its <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/h3">predecessors</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>For training and fine-tuning workloads on long sequences, SH 7B is always faster than optimized Transformers (&gt;10%, &gt;20% and &gt;50% end-to-end faster than FlashAttention v2 processing sequences of lengths 32k, 64k and 128k, at batch size 1), with the speedup growing larger on longer sequences and with larger batches. StripedHyena models are optimal candidates for fine-tuning on long-context tasks – for tasks at length 128k, SH 7B can finetune on more than twice as many tokens as a Transformer given the same budget.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f3e6bb6da558f966bb8_PastedGraphic-4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><strong> </strong>End-to-end batch size 1 latency of an optimized Transformer 7B (FlashAttention v2 and custom kernels) compared to SH 7B.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>These improvements are driven by the different asymptotic scaling and computational profile of layers in the hybrid architecture. We look forward to even faster models with refined mixing ratios and layers.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Reducing memory for inference</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>One additional advantage of SH 7B is a &gt;50% reduced memory footprint during autoregressive generation, compared to a Transformer (both with grouped-query attention). In Transformers, the key and value entries of each layer are cached during the <em>prefilling</em> phase to avoid recomputation and speed up incremental decoding. Gated-convolution layers introduce significantly more degrees of freedom during inference, as there are several ways to represent and optimize computation. We explore these trade-offs in our recent research on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18780">distillation and representation of convolutions in Hyena</a>. These new techniques have been used in SH 7B to further reduce the memory footprint by identifying and pruning redundant states.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/65732f59425c945fc9fbfe71_PastedGraphic-6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Memory footprint of inference cache for GQA Transformer and StripedHyena, including key-value cache and convolution states (FIR and IIR).&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From signal processing to language models</strong></h2><p>‍</p><p>The flexibility of StripedHyena is a direct consequence of the existence of multiple equivalent representations and parametrization of linear systems: convolutional, modal, canonical. Each form is better suited to a specific training and inference workload.</p><p>‍</p><p>Borrowing terminology from classical signal processing, SH convolutional filters can be broadly treated as&nbsp; either finite (FIR) or infinite (IIR). FIR caching for a convolution is analogous to standard key-value caching (kv caching) in attention – particularly the sliding window kind – and grows in memory footprint (until a maximum value).</p><p>‍</p><p>IIR filters on the other hand can be applied by caching a constant-size state, then updated during decoding via a recurrent step. The IIR representation can itself be customized. Fixed-size states, in contrast to kv caches, open up several key optimizations at the inference stack level, streamlining techniques such as continuous batching and speculative decoding.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>What’s ahead&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Our primary objective with the StripedHyena models is to push the frontier of architecture design beyond Transformers. StripedHyena only scratches the surface of what is possible with careful architecture design via mechanistic design and scaling laws, and with ideas such hybridization, implicit convolutions and state caching. We hope these models can inspire the open source community to explore new exciting builds with diverse architectures.</p><p>‍</p><p>In future versions we will explore:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Larger models with longer context.&nbsp;</li><li>Multi-modal support.&nbsp;</li><li>Further performance optimizations.&nbsp;</li><li>Integration of StripedHyena into retrieval pipelines for full utilization of longer context.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h2><p>This work would not have been possible without our collaborators at <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/">HazyResearch</a>, <a href="https://hessian.ai/">Hessian.AI</a>, <a href="https://nousresearch.com/">Nous Research</a>, <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a>, <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web">DFKI</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We are grateful to Hessian.AI Innovation Lab (funded by the Hessian Ministry for Digital Strategy and Innovation) and the hessian.AISC Service Center (funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)) for the collaboration and joint use of their AI supercomputer forty-two.

Ozer took care to note that Carey worked for Wix.</p><p><a href="https://www.j-ventures.com/investor/oded-hermoni" rel="">Oded Hermoni</a><span>, a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/odedhermoni/details/experience/" rel="">tech journalist</a><span>-turned-venture capitalist, piped up to assure everyone that </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/batsheva-moshe/" rel="">Batsheva Moshe</a><span>, Wix’s general manager for Israel and a member of the group chat, had been “on it since Sat[urday] night.”</span></p><p>Moshe then chimed in to assure her peers that the issue with Carey had been “taken care of since it was published.”</p><p>“I believe there will be an announcement soon re our reaction,” she added.</p><p><span>Wix </span><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2023/10/23/dublin-woman-fired-by-israeli-company-over-anti-israel-social-media-posts/" rel="">terminated Carey</a><span> the following day.</span></p><p><span>Moshe was apparently aware of Carey’s LinkedIn comments, which </span><a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/fundraiser-launched-dublin-woman-fired-27987731" rel="">also included</a><span> a denunciation of the “Zionist ideology which promotes an exclusivist state,” before Ozer flagged them in the WhatsApp group.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The interaction nonetheless reflects the heightened coordination among pro-Israel forces in Silicon Valley and the global tech sector.</p><p>Following Hamas’ terror attack on Oct. 7, a loose network of pro-Israel investors, tech executives, activists, and Israeli government officials have stepped up their efforts to combat the slightest deviations from the pro-Israel script.</p><p>The WhatsApp group where Carey’s case came up serves as a kind of switchboard where the various independent players in Silicon Valley’s pro-Israel community swap ideas, identify enemies, and collaborate on ways to defend Israel in the media, academia, and the business world.&nbsp;</p><p>We have obtained access to thousands of the group’s WhatsApp messages dating back to mid-October, and an intricate spreadsheet where group participants request and claim tasks ranging from social media responses to IDF support shipments. Separately, we have viewed a number of video meetings charting best practices for “hasbara” –-- an Israeli term of art for “public diplomacy” whose detractors see it as a euphemism for propaganda -- that offer a window into Israel’s public-relations war that is not limited to the tech sector.</p><div data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div><p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fattachment_icon.svg"></p><div><p>J-Ventures Israel Emergency Fund spending [redacted]</p><p>309KB ∙ XLSX file</p></div><p><a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/api/v1/file/0a476a9e-9267-49d6-8fc0-37672dfbe5f7.xlsx" rel=""><span>Download</span></a></p></div><p>A redaction of the J-Ventures Israel Emergency Fund activities spreadsheet which removes personally-identifiable information of non-government officials.

And the tactics that these wealthy individuals, advocates, and groups use -- hounding Israel critics on social media; firing pro-Palestine employees and canceling speaking engagements; smearing Palestinian journalists; and attempting to ship military-grade equipment to the IDF -- are often heavy-handed and controversial.</p><div><p><span>“This is a peek under the hood of how U.S. foreign policy is steered in order to produce policy outcomes,” said Eli Clifton, a senior advisor to the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. </span></p><p><span>Clifton noted that the White House has strongly communicated an interest in limiting civilian casualties during the war, but appears unable to muster the political resources to change the IDF’s current direction.</span></p></div><p>"President Biden seems incapable of using the one policy tool that may actually produce a change in Israel's actions that might limit civilian deaths, which would be to condition military aid that the United States provides to Israel,” Clifton added. He partially attributed the inability of the U.S. government to rein in Israel’s war actions to the “lobbying and advocacy efforts underway.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png" width="1456" height="990" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:990,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1590610,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bae5b38-375f-49b6-a8c7-7aca00be6db4_1959x1332.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Two contiguous screenshots from a Sunday, Oct. 22 conversation in the J-Ventures WhatsApp group regarding the firing of Dublin-based Wix employee Courtney Carey for her pro-Palestinian LinkedIn statements. The last participant is Wix’s General Manager for Israel, Batsheve Moshe, using a kind of Hebrew rebus handle.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Just days after the Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel from Hamas, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesperson for Israel Defense Forces, beamed into a Zoom meeting to brief pro-Israel activists from Silicon Valley. The participants included major venture capitalists and technology executives, such as Jordan Blashek, the President of America’s Frontier Fund, a national security investment firm backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.&nbsp;</p><div><p><span>"There is still fighting ongoing in sporadic clashes and attacks by Hamas terrorists in southern Israel," Conricus said. Since he was speaking to the group on an unencrypted, open line, Conricus cautioned that he could not divulge too many secrets. But, he added, the war would soon escalate with an Israeli military response and the participants on the call could lend a hand.</span></p><p><span>The IDF spokesman encouraged those on the call to assist with “maintaining pressure on legislators” in Congress and to work to influence those “in universities or media, or think tanks, or in elite circles.”</span></p></div><p>Members of the hasbara-oriented tech world WhatsApp group have eagerly taken up the call to shape public opinion as part of a bid to win what’s been described as the “second battlefield” and “the information war.”</p><p><span>It’s not hard to see why. On Oct. 7, Hamas murdered an estimated 1,200 Israelis and foreign workers, and abducted </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/israel-hostages-hamas-explained.html" rel="">roughly</a><span> 240 people as hostages. The killing spree was the worst mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust and a tragedy that immediately upended Israeli society.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The massacre also prompted Israel to embark on an invasion of Gaza that has killed </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-have-died-gaza-war-how-will-counting-continue-2023-12-06/" rel="">more than 16,000 Palestinians</a><span>, most of whom are women and children and displaced more than 1 million Gaza residents from their homes. Critics of the invasion argue that Israel is both failing to minimize the invasion’s impact on Palestinian civilians and to recognize that it will only achieve security when Palestinians have hope for a state of their own. But Israel maintains that it must stop at nothing to eradicate Hamas, which embeds itself in civilian infrastructure.</span></p><div><p><span>That’s where the efforts of J-Ventures’ hasbara WhatsApp group come in.&nbsp;The group, which also includes attorneys and individuals affiliated with the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), has tirelessly worked to fire employees and punish activists for expressing pro-Palestinian views. It has also engaged in a </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4315364-arizona-state-cancels-pro-palestinian-event-featuring-tlaib/" rel="">successful</a><span> push to cancel events held by prominent Palestinian voices, including an Arizona State University talk featuring Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat who is the only Palestinian-American in Congress. The group has also circulated a </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231208003427/https://engage.gophousemajority.com/tell-tlaib-to-resign/" rel="">push-poll</a><span> suggesting Rep. Tlaib should resign from office and provided an automated means of thanking Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) for voting to censure her.</span></p><p><span>In some cases, officials from the IDF and other parts of the Israeli government have joined the effort. David, the Israeli foreign ministry official and an investor in J-Ventures, has shared official talking points in the WhatsApp group.</span></p><p><span>One presentation that David shared made the case that Hamas intentionally stations its military operations near civilian sites as part of its strategy of deploying “human shields.” United Nations officials have </span><a href="https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-condemns-placement-rockets-second-time-one-its-schools" rel="">discovered</a><span> Hamas rockets hidden in a vacant school in the past, and indeed, the militant group's vast, underground tunnel network endangers civilians throughout the Gaza Strip. Yet the recent IDF document uses broad categories to identify Hamas military sites and Israeli targets, including a “Hamas bank” located next to a Palestinian kindergarten.</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png" width="1200" height="670.8791208791209" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ecff7e5-40c5-4bed-ae1c-92d6d2bfe38a_1600x894.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>An IDF presentation shared by Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs official and J-Ventures investor Andy David and dated Oct. 11.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Israeli officials have invested heavily in shaping the narrative about its war on social media, viewing online discourse as a vital area for maintaining public support. Last month, a spokeswoman for the IDF and the Israel office director of Bessemer Venture Partners, the venture capital firm where Jeff Epstein is an operating partner, jointly led a Zoom workshop for “high-tech leaders” on tactics for scoring “victories” in the public discourse on Twitter/X. J-Ventures has also raised funds for automated technology to mass report tweets and for facial recognition technology for the IDF to identify hostages. Meanwhile, other Israeli officials have led similar webinar sessions on strategy to shape coverage in campus newspapers and major media outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>J-Ventures has joined the broader U.S. Jewish community in supporting more conventional charity efforts in Israel. One J-Ventures impact report notes that the group raised money for laptops for Israeli children evacuated because of the conflict and supplied mental health services for those traumatized by the Oct. 7 attack. The chats discuss the urgent need to send medical supplies and funds to Israeli hospitals.</p><p>Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old Israeli-American IDF soldier who went missing on Oct. 7 and is believed to be a hostage of Hamas, is also a member of WhatsApp chat. The group has coordinated closely with Chen to promote his television appearances.</p><p>But J-Ventures has also veered into an unusual kind of philanthropy: shipments of military supplies. The group has attempted to provide tactical gear to Israel’s equivalent of the U.S. Navy SEALs, known as Shayetet-13, and donated to a foundation dedicated to supporting the IDF’s undercover “Duvdevan” unit, which is known for infiltrating Palestinian populations. Many of the shipments intended for the IDF were held up at U.S. airports over customs issues.&nbsp;</p><div><p><span>The online space has been a focal point of pro-Israel activism, far beyond J-Ventures. Less than two weeks into the conflict, the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry </span><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-social-media-opinion-hamas-war/" rel="">released</a><span> 75 different online ads and spent millions of dollars purchasing space on platforms such as YouTube and Twitter/X. The ministry, which operates several highly active social media accounts, has also reached out directly to American allies, helping guide pro-Israel activism on social platforms. </span></p><p><span>"You guys are our frontline soldiers,” said Tamar Schwarzbard, head of Digital Diplomacy at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, on an October Zoom call posted online by Hasbara Fellowships, a nonprofit group that works closely with the Israeli government to train pro-Israel activists in the U.S. and Canada. She noted that the government needed help reframing the Gaza war and the public messaging over the conflict with Hamas.</span></p></div><p>“Let’s say you see some kind of newspaper article on your campus news site showing support or solidarity with the Palestinians and not speaking out against what's going on in the Gaza envelope and in Israel,” she said. “So you want to make sure, try to tag, let's say, the president of the university on the post you're putting out condemning that article.”</p><div><p><span>“Hamas does really good PR,” continued Schwarzbard. “We need to change the narrative.” She implored the group to use focused language. “We need people to see this isn't just a run-of-the-mill resistance, freedom fighter group. This is something equivalent of ISIS.”</span></p><p><span>Schwarzbard instructed participants on the call to use certain hashtags when discussing the conflict, such as #HamasIsISIS, #IStandwithIsrael, and #IsraelUnderAttack. The strategy would boost engagement and bring a large audience to the pro-Israel cause, she explained.</span></p><p><span>She also focused on the expected public relations challenges posed by the war. Israel would soon lose international support as its military response in Gaza kills more Palestinian civilians, noted Schwarzbad, who stressed the need to refocus attention on Israeli civilian deaths. “Try to use names and ages whenever you can,” she said. Don’t refer to statistics of the dead, use stories. “Say something like, 'Noah, age 26, was celebrating with her friends at a music festival on the holiest day of the week, Shabbat. Imagine if your daughter was at Coachella.’” </span></p><p><span>As with the efforts to punish employees and activists, senior figures in both Silicon Valley and the Israeli tech corridor work closely with the Israeli government to disseminate pro-Israel narratives on social media. On Nov. 22, </span><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/adam-fisher" rel="">Adam Fisher</a><span>, the head of the Israel office of Bessemer Venture Partners, gave a presentation on how U.S. “high-tech leaders, investors, and entrepreneurs,” such as himself, could help the Israel Defense Forces win the “information war” on social media.

For this category of people, the goal is not to "convince them of anything," but to "show them that it's much more complicated than it seems." Seeding doubt, he said, would make certain audiences think twice before attending a protest. "So it's really about creating some kind of confusion,” Fisher continued, “but really, just to make it clear to them that it's really a lot more complicated."</p><div><p><span>A second category, Fisher explained, is the "uncomfortable sympathizer," a group that "wants to support Israel -- they're typically more liberal," but opposes the current government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. These types can be won over, Fisher said, by pointing out "that we are a multi-ethnic, diverse, democratic liberal society with rotten apples." </span></p><p><span>The final group consists of those who are "reflexively pro-Israel, kind of ‘Israel, right or wrong.’" Members of this group "are not actually very knowledgeable," so they needed to be equipped with the right facts to make them "more effective in advocating for Israel,” Fisher said.</span></p><p><span>Fisher repeatedly noted the need to offer accurate and nuanced information to rebut critics of Israel's actions. Yet at times, he offered his own misinformation, such as his claim that "anti-Israel" human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch "didn't condemn the October 7th massacre." </span></p><p><span>In fact, Amnesty had condemned Hamas’ attack a few days after it occurred, detailing a </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/israel-palestinian-armed-groups-must-be-held-accountable-for-deliberate-civilian-killings-abductions-and-indiscriminate-attacks/" rel="">long list of atrocities</a><span> committed by the Palestinian militia and allied groups. “Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups flagrantly violated international law and displayed a chilling disregard for human life,” </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/israel-palestinian-armed-groups-must-be-held-accountable-for-deliberate-civilian-killings-abductions-and-indiscriminate-attacks/" rel="">Amnesty stated</a><span> in its Oct. 12 report. Similarly, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/10/hamas-led-attack-southern-israel-kills-hundreds" rel="">dispatch</a><span> on Oct. 10 that condemned the Hamas attack on Israel, noting that deliberately "killing civilians is a war crime, as is hostage taking."</span></p></div><div><p><span>The efforts to discredit HRW stem directly from its outspoken criticism of Israel’s record in the occupied territories and its military conduct. An HRW </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/22/israel/gaza-hostilities-take-horrific-toll-children" rel="">report</a><span> released the same day as Fisher’s remarks cited the World Health Organization’s </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/child-killed-average-every-10-minutes-gaza-says-who-chief-2023-11-10/" rel="">conclusion</a><span> that the IDF had killed roughly one child in Gaza every 10 minutes since the outbreak of violence in October.</span></p><p><span>Other efforts to defend Israel coming from Silicon Valley involve technological attempts to censor critics and promote a pro-Israel message to shape opinions about the war.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Gadi Hutt, senior director of business development at Amazon-owned subsidiary Annapurna Labs, has helped the J-Ventures team pressure the Amazon online marketplace to remove t-shirts and other merchandise that feature the slogan, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” – a campaign that was ultimately successful, he announced to the WhatsApp group.</span></p><p><span>Hutt also informed the WhatsApp group that he was leading “a group of technologists to implement multiple projects aiding the war effort.” One of the J-Ventures documents lists Hutt as the point person for </span><a href="https://canarymission.org/" rel="">Canary Mission</a><span>, a controversial group that </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/22/israel-boycott-canary-mission-blacklist/" rel="">blacklists</a><span> pro-Palestinian figures on college campuses, to help the group train "AI models to classify antisemitic posts from Twitter.”</span></p><p><span>Earlier this week, members of the J-Ventures group chat also internally circulated a </span><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/netflix-removfe-the-antisemitic-blood-libel-film-farha" rel="">petition</a><span> for Netflix to remove the </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11555492/awards/" rel="">award-winning</a><span> Jordanian film ‘Farha,’ claiming that its portrayal of the actions of IDF soldiers during the 1948 displacement of Palestinians constituted “blood libel,” while another said the film was based “antisemitism and lies.” </span></p><p><span>Last year, the Israeli government </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/12/03/farha-netflix-nakba-palestine-israel/" rel="">revoked</a><span> funding for a theater in Jaffa for screening the film, while government figures called for other repercussions to Netflix for streaming it. </span></p><p><span>In the WhatsApp group, demand faced some pushback. One member noted that despite the controversy over a scene in the film in which Israeli soldiers execute a Palestinian family, Israeli historians have documented that “such actions have indeed happened.” The critique was rejected by other members of the group, who said the film constituted “incitement” against Jews.</span></p></div><div><p><span>J-Ventures documents and affiliated WhatsApp discussions also show support for a variety of automated attempts to remove pro-Palestinian content on social media. In one instance, J-Ventures donated $19,531 to </span><a href="https://www.digitaldome.io/" rel="">DigitalDome.io</a><span>, an initiative that promotes itself as an online version of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, promising that “offensive and malicious content is intercepted here.” Hermoni and Rami Lipman, an investor in Israel, are listed as the points of contact for the contribution.</span></p><p><span>An Oct. 25 posting in the J-Ventures WhatsApp channel asserted that DigitalDome’s “recent achievements” included the </span><a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-769852" rel="">censorship</a><span> of Hamas’ channels on the Telegram communications platform using Android phones, allegedly as a result of Telegram being forced to comply with Google Play’s guidelines. DigitalDome likewise </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0ZTn_5op62/" rel="">touts</a><span> various efforts to remove pro-Palestinian content from Instagram and Twitter/X. In one case, the site </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0YjCW2ojo7/?img_index=2" rel="">claims</a><span> it had successfully reported an account to a European Union legal body for posting videos with Hamas fighters.</span></p></div><p><span>The little-known DigitalDome.io website is labeled by J-Ventures as part of its hasbara</span><em>,</em><span> or pro-Israel public relations efforts, and is run in </span><a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2023/11/10/Exclusive-Inside-Israel-s-war-room-cracking-down-on-fake-news" rel="">partnership</a><span> with the Israeli fact-checking website </span><a href="https://fakereporter.net/?lang=en" rel="">FakeReporter</a><span>, which was founded by </span><a href="https://www.middleeastinitiatives.org/who-we-are" rel="">Achiya Schatz</a><span>, a veteran of the IDF’s undercover commando unit, </span><a href="https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-brigades/commando/duvdevan/duvdevan-unit/" rel="">Duvdevan</a><span>. Schatz has had a curious career trajectory, however; prior to founding FakeReporter, he served as communications director for the left-wing Israeli group </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/14/1212836719/ex-idf-soldier-calls-for-international-intervention-to-stop-settler-violence" rel="">Breaking the Silence</a><span>. Breaking the Silence documents the stories of IDF veterans who feel guilty about what they see as immoral practices in which they were complicit during their military service, and now advocate for peaceful resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict.&nbsp;</span></p><p>​When reached for comment, Schatz stated that he started FakeReporter out of a genuine concern about the impact of misinformation on the public discourse. The nonprofit group is "devoted to fact-based conversation, anti-hate speech, anti-violence … because I believe that the democratic space has shrunk to a place that conversation almost doesn't even matter anymore," he said.</p><p>Schatz vehemently denied the suggestion that his group is part of the hasbara ecosystem or otherwise aims to help Israel shape its public image.&nbsp; “Maybe people … think I'm doing it for different [reasons], or even to fight pro-Palestinian activists,” he said. “I do not.”</p><p><span>In the WhatsApp group, J-Ventures also promoted </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dannykg_israel-hamas-hamasisis-activity-7119952867225985024-nzuV/" rel="">IronTruthBot</a><span>, a bot that automates the process of removing “inflammatory, false, and defamatory posts against Israel from all platforms.” The project was described as being developed by a group of volunteers, receiving 700 reports a day and succeeding in removing “hundreds of inappropriate posts.”</span></p><div><p><span>Over the last two months, dozens of individuals have been fired for expressing opinions related to the war in Gaza and Israel. Most have been dismissed for expressing pro-Palestinian views, including a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/10/philadelphia-sports-reporter-loses-job-pro-palestinian-comments" rel="">writer for PhillyVoice</a><span>, the </span><a href="https://news.artnet.com/news/artforum-editor-fired-over-pro-palestine-open-letter-2385950" rel="">editor of ArtForum</a><span>, an apprentice at German publishing giant </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/26/axel-springer-fires-employee-israel/" rel="">Axel Springer</a><span>, and Michael Eisen, the editor-in-chief of eLife, a prominent science journal. Eisen’s offense was a </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/11/michael-eisen-tweet-elife-firing-science-editor-palestinians-israel-gaza/" rel="">tweet sharing</a><span> a satirical article from The Onion seen as sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. </span></p><p><span>The WhatsApp chats provide a rare look at the organizing efforts behind the broad push to fire critics of Israel and suppress public events featuring critics of the Israeli government. The scope is surprisingly broad, ranging from investigating the funding sources of student organizations such as </span><a href="https://ncusar.org/modelarableague/" rel="">Model Arab League</a><span>, to monitoring an </span><a href="https://bit.ly/pali-toolkit" rel="">organizing toolkit</a><span> of a Palestine Solidarity Working Group – “They are verrrry well organized”, one member exclaimed – to working directly with high-level tech executives to fire pro-Palestinian employees.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Sometimes it is unclear whether the group’s members actually have elite IDF and Israeli government connections, or are merely engaging in idle bluster. Saar Gillai, chair of Liquid Instruments and board member to several other tech companies, said he had passed the Palestinian solidarity organizing document "to 'friends' in places s tarting [sic] with 8....," an apparent reference to Israeli military intelligence Unit 8200. </span><a href="https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/directorates/military-intelligence-directorate/military-intelligence-directorate/" rel="">Unit 8200</a><span> is both a massive communications interception operation -- Israel’s rough equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency -- and an elite intelligence analysis and cybersecurity unit that has become a springboard for Israel’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/20/from-the-8200-to-silicon-valley/" rel="">booming tech startup sector</a><span>. Gillai served in the IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate, the parent organization of Unit 8200, from 1985 to 1992, according to his </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillai/" rel="">LinkedIn page</a><span>.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/batsheva-moshe/" rel="">Batsheva Moshe</a><span>, the Wix executive who organized the firing of Ms. Carey, moderated the Zoom call with Fisher and Major Weiss, and promoted the event within the WhatsApp group run by Mr. Hermoni, the managing partner of </span><a href="https://www.j-ventures.com/" rel="">J-Ventures</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></div><p>Ms. Moshe did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div><p><span>The organized firing of Carey was one many attempts by tech executives and other participants in the WhatsApp logs to penalize pro-Palestinian speech. J-Ventures similarly mobilized efforts among its team to place pressure on several university campuses against student-led events. On Oct. 16, a WhatsApp member Daniel A. Bock, an Arizona-based technology lawyer, forwarded a message calling attention to Rep. Tlaib’s scheduled appearance at Arizona State University for an event with Arizona Palestine Network, a pro-Palestine advocacy group. "Let’s call ASU and get this thing cancelled [sic]. Can we do this in one day?” Bock wrote, alongside contact information for ASU officials and the Scottsdale, Ariz. mayor's office.</span></p><p><span>Several members chimed in with approval for the effort. One participant even suggested that they appeal to the university’s “woke” aversion to exposing students to uncomfortable ideas. &nbsp; The participant drafted a sample letter claiming that Tlaib’s appearance threatened ASU’s “commitment to a safe and inclusive environment.” The following day, ASU officially canceled the Tlaib event, citing “procedural issues.” The WhatsApp group shared the news and celebrated the decision. </span></p><p><span>The WhatsApp group mustered similar efforts against pro-Palestinian activists and writers. Lior Netzer, a business consultant based in Massachusetts, and a member of the J-Ventures WhatsApp group, requested help pressuring the University of Vermont to cancel a lecture with Mohammed El-Kurd, a Palestinian writer for The Nation magazine. Netzer shared a sample script that alleged that El-Kurd had engaged in anti-Semitic speech in the past.</span></p><p><span>The effort also </span><a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/2023/10/25/uvm-cancels-palestinian-speaker-mohammed-el-kurd-middle-east-war/71304336007/" rel="">appeared</a><span> to be successful. Shortly after the letter-writing campaign, UVM canceled the talk, citing safety concerns. </span></p><p><span>The pro-Israel organizing efforts to silence pro-Palestinian speech raises concerns with some observers of the conflict.</span></p><p><span>“You can disagree with critics of Israel, you can oppose what they're saying,” noted the Quincy Institute’s Clifton. “But this is an effort to constrain the debate in an underhanded manner.”</span></p></div><div><p><span>The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a civil libertarian group that has long defended controversial speech on campus, likewise expressed its disapproval.</span></p><p><span>“FIRE is deeply concerned by cancellations of speaking events and retaliation against individuals for their speech about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Aaron Terr, FIRE’s director of public advocacy, said in a statement. “This censorship raises First Amendment issues when perpetrated by government actors like state colleges.”</span></p><p><span>“In times like these, with political tensions running high, it’s especially important that colleges and other institutions whose very purpose is to foster free expression facilitate dialogue instead of shutting it down,” Terr added.</span></p><p><span>The WhatsApp group maintained a special focus on elite universities and white-collar professional positions. Group members not only circulated multiple petitions to fire professors and blacklist students from working at major law firms for allegedly engaging in extremist rhetoric, but a J-Ventures spreadsheet lists specific task force teams to "get professors removed who teach falcehoods [sic] to their students." The list includes academics at Cornell University, the University of California, Davis, and NYU’s Abu Dhabi campus, among others.</span></p></div><p><span>Many of the messages in the group focused on ways in which to shape student life at Stanford University, including support for pro-Israel activists. The attempted interventions into campus life at times hinged on the absurd.

In the midst of its pro-Israel advocacy, the firm’s leadership reminded the WhatsApp group of their high-profile ties. The investment fund touted the fact that two of its portfolio companies were the only two start-ups to be included in the </span><a href="https://apecceosummit2023.com/program/" rel="">APEC CEO Summit</a><span> in San Francisco with President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The CEO of one of these two start-ups, Adam Tartakovsky of Epic Cleantec, was also widely described as the primary lobbying connection between J-Ventures and California Governor Gavin Newsom.</span></p><p>The influence extended beyond the business and tech world and into politics. The J-Ventures team includes advocates with the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying organization, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC. Officials in the J-Ventures group include investor David Wagonfeld, whose biography states he is “leading AIPAC Silicon Valley;” Tartakovsky, listed as “AIPAC Political Chair;” Adam Milstein, a real estate executive and major AIPAC donor; and AIPAC-affiliated activists Drs. Kathy Fields and Garry Rayant. Kenneth Baer, a former White House advisor to President Barack Obama and communications counsel to the Anti-Defamation League, is also an active member of the group. </p><p>Members of the group who are involved with AIPAC helped advise other group members on how to approach Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) about a meeting. Although the lawmaker was initially scheduled to address the group over Zoom, J-Ventures repeatedly rescheduled, and ultimately canceled the event after members of the WhatsApp group objected to Khanna’s ties to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom Saar Gillai, chair of Liquid Instruments, called "the ultimate anti Israel Jew." Despite the group meeting never taking place, as confirmed by Rep. Khanna, Hermoni shared a photo with the group on Nov. 6 of the two having lunch outside of an Italian restaurant in Los Altos, Calif.</p><div><p><span>J-Ventures also had to cancel a planned Oct. 30 meeting with former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, the </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/06/14/israels-pm-tech-millionare-naftali-bennett" rel="">founder</a><span> of a multimillion-dollar tech startup. The in-person meeting with Bennett had been scheduled long before the Oct. 7 terror attacks, after which Bennett was no longer available. </span></p><p><span>Reached for comment, Rep. Khanna confirmed that he met with Hermoni, but that the scheduled J-Ventures Zoom call was canceled. The congressman noted that he enjoys broad support from the tech community. “Some have commented on my strong stance against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and appreciated that,” he said. “I’ve tried to bring people in my district together and foster civil dialogue.”</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png" width="1200" height="675" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda2cc7b-407f-4b7e-b732-250fd9024872_1600x900.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A photo of U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA) and J-Ventures managing partner Oded Hermoni sitting outside of The American Italian Delicatessen at 139 Main Street in Los Altos, Calif. Mr. Hermoni shared the picture with the J-Ventures WhatsApp group on November 6, 2023.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The extensive donor network of J-Ventures also helped bankroll high-priced advocacy efforts. The group raised money for 84 billboards in Toronto, Canada, a digital billboard in Las Vegas, and, “in key locations such as Times Square in New York and all over London,” according to their planning documents. One of the biggest coups by the J-Ventures team was a successful effort to secure funding to air a special television advertisement on the Tonight Show, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN calling for the release of the hostages taken by Hamas.</p><p>Other fundraising efforts from J-Ventures included an emergency fund to provide direct support for IDF units, including the naval commando unit Shayetet-13. The leaked planning document also uncovers attempts to supply the mostly female Caracal Battalion with grenade pouches and to donate M16 rifle scope mounts, “FN MAG” machine gun carrier vests, and drones to unnamed IDF units. According to the planning document, customs enforcement barriers have stranded many of the packages destined for the IDF in Montana and Colorado.</p><p>We reached out to Hermoni with a detailed request for comment about J-Ventures and the WhatsApp group’s goals, including the military materiel shipments; the extent of Andy David’s involvement in the initiative; and what he sees as the group’s biggest accomplishments to date.&nbsp;</p><p>Hermoni did not reply directly. Instead, the morning after being reached for comment, Hermoni warned the WhatsApp group against cooperating with our inquiries. “Two journalists … are trying to have an anti semi[tic] portrait of our activity to support israel and reaching out to members,” he wrote. “Please ignore them and do not cooperate.” he advised.

An automated form letter provided by the group denounces the BBC for, among other things, employing a journalist who "writes of casualties in Gaza" and blames "Western media for being complicit in Israel's attack." Another BICOM campaign encourages residents of the UK to write to Ofcom, the media regulator, to complain of anti-Israel bias in British media. </span></p><p><span>The J-Ventures group pooled efforts to guide reporters from ABC News and other major stations. In its list of action items, the group noted that “NPR is looking for personal stories of how the ‘Mideast crisis’ is affecting people in the US” and called for assistance with locating college students to respond.</span></p></div><p>And at times, the boundaries between journalism and advocacy have significantly blurred since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. One notable group is HonestReporting, a nonprofit that describes itself as a journalism watchdog devoted to "truth, integrity and fairness, and to combat ideological prejudice in journalism and the media, as it impacts Israel." The website for the organization touts its "objectivity" and educational resources designed to filter out what it sees as anti-Israel media bias.</p><p><span>HonestReporting </span><a href="https://honestreporting.com/photographers-without-borders-ap-reuters-pictures-of-hamas-atrocities-raise-ethical-questions/" rel="">produced a report</a><span> in November alleging that Palestinian photojournalists who captured pictures of Hamas fighters during the Oct. 7 attack had coordinated with the terror group, making the journalists legitimate targets for the IDF. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s office agreed, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/1722548245430141186" rel="">writing on X</a><span>, “These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics.” And Danny Danon, an Israeli cabinet minister, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/dannydanon/status/1722700128224473143" rel="">promised on X</a><span> to “hunt them down together with the terrorists.”</span></p><p><span>HonestReporting drew some blood. CNN and AP cut ties with Gaza-based freelance photographer </span><a href="https://themessenger.com/news/cnn-fires-journalist-gaza-hassan-eslaiah" rel="">Hasan Eslaiah</a><span> after HonestReporting released its report, and later, posted a photo of Eslaiah </span><a href="https://twitter.com/HonestReporting/status/1722374178991444219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1722374178991444219%7Ctwgr%5E01070129b5472f1da3c67e9817def45fe87837f0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthemessenger.com%2Fnews%2Fgaza-journalist-who-worked-for-cnn-and-ap-reportedly-seen-getting-kiss-from-hamas-leader" rel="">getting a kiss</a><span> from Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza.</span></p><p><span>But the advocacy group’s “just asking questions”-style report mostly backfired. </span><a href="https://www.reutersagency.com/en/media-center/reuters-statement-on-baseless-report-november-11-2023/" rel="">Reuters</a><span>, </span><a href="https://blog.ap.org/ap-statement-on-gaza-freelancers" rel="">AP</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/statement-on-yousef-masoud/" rel="">the New York Times</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/09/media/news-outlets-deny-prior-knowledge-of-hamas-attack/index.html" rel="">CNN</a><span> denied any prior knowledge of Eslaiah or other freelancers coordinating with Hamas. Some of the outlets went further, condemning HonestReporting’s work for jeopardizing the safety of freelance journalists working in a war zone. The New York Times, for example, </span><a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/statement-on-yousef-masoud/" rel="">said in a statement</a><span>, “We are gravely concerned that unsupported accusations and threats to freelancers endangers them and undermines work that serves the public interest.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>HonestReporting ended up on the defensive. Rather than apologize though, the lead author of the report, Gil Hoffman, a former Jerusalem Post reporter who is now executive director of HonestReporting, deflected criticism by asserting that his organization had “raised questions” without providing definitive answers. Hoffman </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231203150156/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-advocacy-group-accepts-news-outlets-had-no-prior-warning-hamas-attack-2023-11-10/" rel="">told Reuters</a><span> that he accepted the news organizations’ denials and was “so relieved” to hear them. He also condemned Israeli government officials for what he saw as taking liberties with the report.&nbsp;</span></p><p>When speaking to an audience of fellow hasbara warriors though, Hoffman was more celebratory, touting the report as an unadulterated success. In a Nov. 15 talk he gave to the Hasbara Fellowships as part of its leadership briefing series, Hoffman explained that his exposé “attracted attention all around the world” and made “the world remember October 7, which they had forgotten.” The release of the HonestReporting report suggesting that Palestinian journalists are actually Hamas operatives, Hoffman continued, shifted attention away from the IDF war in Gaza and cast doubt on the reliability of reports from inside Gaza. “You can’t trust the journalists that come out of Gaza,” Hoffman argued. “They could have saved lives and instead took pictures that highlighted the achievements of Hamas.”</p><p><span>Speaking to the Hasbara Fellowships audience, Hoffman also characterized himself as a foot soldier in a wider war on behalf of Israel, rather than a media watchdog primarily concerned with combating bias, as its </span><a href="https://honestreporting.com/about/" rel="">website suggests</a><span>. “There are three battles going on right now for Israel’s existence,” he said. Those battles, he explained, take place on the military battlefield, on college campuses, and the one in which HonestReporting engages, “the media battlefield.” </span></p><p>Victory on the “media battlefield,” Hoffman concluded, “eases pressure on IDF to go quicker, to wrap up” and “goes a long way to deciding how much time Israel has to complete an operation.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

Hi,

I encountered a kernel panic with the 3.1.0 kernel on a Dell Latitude
E6410 while inputting simultaneously from the integrated keyboard with
a cat and from the external keyboard myself. I was trying to type my
password with the external keyboard (pw dialog already visible), but I
noticed that the computer didn't seem responsive to my typing. Then
suddenly the cat shifted his position and there was a kernel panic
involving input handling. I'm now using i8042.nokbd kernel parameter
as a workaround, something I've found useful also earlier.

I wonder if anyone else is experiencing similar problems? This didn't
seem to happen with 3.0, which was the first kernel version I used on
this E6410. Although it has to be noted that the internal keyboard
input was not yet as heavy either at that time. Please test if you can
reproduce the problem.

Photos of the panic at <a href="http://people.debian.org/~timo/kernelpaniccat/">http://people.debian.org/~timo/kernelpaniccat/</a>.
The first one was taken about ten seconds after the panic and shows
the original cat positioning. The two other ones show alternative
possible positions together with more of the panic text. There is also
one photo showing the pre-crash setup, which I happened to take
without anticipating a panic. The similar but black input weight was
not in use.

The kernel was tainted because the Intel "mei" module from staging was
loaded. The kernel used was the final 3.1 from the ubuntu mainline ppa
archives for amd64.

Thank you,

Timo Jyrinki

Your cat wanted to find out what the magic in "magic SysRq key" means

Yes, it was a catastrophe.

Truth is, cats are great panic generators and as fuzzy beings themselves,
they're also great fuzzers.  Only, normally they restrict themselves to
fuzzing clothes, computer fans, their owner's food, spreadsheets, the nose
of anyone alergic to catty fuzzy feelings in a 100m radius, word
processors, and IRS forms.

However, it is the first time I've seen documented proof that a cat
sucessfully fuzzed an input device into a panic.  Must be a lolcat's revenge
to the lack of mouses since touchpads took over.  And Linux has no
cat-proofing for the keyboard and touchpads[1], which will leave us
wide-open to surprise fuzzer attacks from the lolcats!  Maybe we should
issue a CVE about it?

;-)

[1] Windows _has_ third-party cat-proofing for keyboards, by detecting
clustered pressing of nearby keys.  I don't think it can yet figure out a
catpaw press on the touchpad, however.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>T</span></span>he Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the world’s first medicine based on CRISPR gene-editing technology, a groundbreaking treatment for <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/04/sickle-cell-crispr-exa-cel-casgevy-history/">sickle cell disease</a> that delivers a potential cure for people born with the chronic and life-shortening blood disorder.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/16/crispr-vertex-sickle-cell-beta-thalassemia-casgevy-approval/">new medicine</a>, called Casgevy, is made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics. Its authorization is a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/19/crispr-casgevy-jennifer-doudna-feng-zhang-emmanuelle-charpentier-george-church/">scientific triumph</a> for the technology that can efficiently and precisely repair DNA mutations — ushering in a new era of genetic medicines for inherited diseases.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial, Casgevy was shown to eliminate recurrent episodes of debilitating pain caused by sickle cell, which afflicts approximately 100,000 people in the U.S., a vast majority of whom are Black. The therapy, whose scientific name is exa-cel, is described as a potential cure because the genetic fix enabled by CRISPR is designed to last a lifetime, although confirmation will require years of follow-up.</p>
<p>The FDA decision comes three weeks after <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/16/u-k-approves-worlds-first-crispr-based-medicine/">regulators in the U.K.</a> were the first to clear the drug. Approval in the European Union is expected next year. The FDA is also expected to rule on exa-cel as a treatment for beta thalassemia, another inherited blood disorder, by March 30.</p>
<p>The FDA on Friday also approved another sickle cell treatment, a gene therapy from Bluebird Bio called Lyfgenia. Patients will now have the option of two cutting-edge therapies that provide potentially curative benefits.</p>
<p>“We are celebrating,” said Lewis Hsu, chief medical officer at the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and director of the pediatric sickle cell program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “This decision has been a long time coming, pretty much since the first description of sickle cell as a genetic disease some 70 years ago.”</p>
<p>Scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna published their first CRISPR paper just over a decade ago. In 2020, the research <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/07/two-crispr-scientists-win-nobel-prize-in-chemistry/">won the pair a Nobel Prize</a>. Reflecting on the approval of Casgevy, Charpentier told STAT via email that she was “excited and pleased” for what it means for patients and their families.</p>
<p>“This milestone certainly underscores the importance of fundamental research in the field of microbiology,” added Charpentier, who is also a scientific co-founder of CRISPR Therapeutics. “I am truly amazed at the speed at which CRISPR research and applications have developed to get us to this historic moment.”</p>
<p><iframe title="New CRISPR-based sickle cell treatment, explained" width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sAGtqm3o1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biotechnology era began in the 1980s with the invention of protein-based drugs made from genetically modified animal cells. Four decades later, the arrival of the first CRISPR therapy establishes a new industry benchmark that could deliver cures for an array of inherited diseases.</p>
<p>“Casgevy’s approval by the FDA is momentous: It is the first CRISPR-based gene-editing therapy to be approved in the U.S.,” Vertex CEO Reshma Kewalramani said. “As importantly, Casgevy is a first-in-class treatment that offers the potential of a one-time transformative therapy for eligible patients with sickle cell disease. I want to convey my deepest gratitude to the patients and investigators whose trust in this program paved the way for this landmark approval.”</p>
<p>But for all its virtues, whether or not Casgevy, as well as Lyfgenia, becomes a widely used treatment for people living with sickle cell — undoing decades of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/12/deluge-genome-editing-therapies-sickle-cell-disease/">scientific neglect</a> and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/18/sickle-cell-pain-treatment/">medical racism</a> — remains an open question.</p>
		
		
<p>Vertex set the price of Casgevy at $2.2 million compared to $3.1 million for Bluebird’s Lyfgenia. Bluebird’s gene therapy for thalassemia, approved last year, has a list price of $2.8 million.</p>
<p>The therapies are also not easy to receive. Patients must spend weeks, even months, in the hospital before and after the therapy is administered. And some of the preparatory steps can cause serious side effects, including severe infections, nausea, painful mouth sores, and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/06/sickle-cell-infertility-crispr-vertex-casgevy-bluebird/">infertility</a>.</p>
<p>“I think there will be immediate uptake in some portion of the patients who have more severe disease — frequent pain episodes that cause hospitalization and require opioids for the treatment of pain,” David Williams, chief of the division of hematology-oncology at Boston Children’s Hospital and an expert in treating sickle cell disease, said ahead of the anticipated approval of Casgevy. “But there could be bumps in the road,” he added, if Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics run into trouble making the complicated treatment, or if its high price tag <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/07/crispr-sickle-cell-access/">erects barriers</a> to reimbursement and access.</p>
		
		
<p>“I’m skeptical that this will open the floodgates, as some people are predicting,” said Akshay Sharma, a physician who treats children with sickle cell at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Casgevy has the potential to be a “transformative therapy,” Sharma added, but “I would expect physicians and patients to be nervous and hesitant” until its long-term efficacy and safety are better defined.</p>
<p>Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for the production of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. The mutation causes red blood cells to become misshapen. Under a microscope, they look like crescents or sickles, which gives the disease its name. When sickled red cells clump together, they clog blood vessels, robbing tissues of oxygen and causing bouts, or “crises,” of extreme pain, hospitalizations, organ damage, stroke, and early death.</p>
<p>Physicians who treat people with sickle cell today prescribe a number of medicines that can reduce the frequency of pain crises, increase hemoglobin levels, or ameliorate symptoms, but none targets the underlying genetic cause of the disease. Stem cell transplants can be curative, but the procedure requires patients to have a donor with matched immune cells, which occurs infrequently.</p>

<p>This is what makes Casgevy different. It edits a patient’s own blood stem cells to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin — the healthy, oxygen-carrying form of the protein that is produced during fetal development but normally shuts down soon after birth. Researchers had previously identified a certain genetic mutation that causes fetal hemoglobin to persist into adulthood. When this happens to people with sickle cell, their disease is mild and outcomes are greatly improved.</p>
<p>Casgevy uses the CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme to mimic this protective genetic mutation. It makes a cut at a specific spot in a gene called BCL11A. The edit, in turn, disables a DNA brake on the production of fetal hemoglobin.</p>
<p>Bluebird’s gene therapy works through another route, delivering, with the help of a virus, a copy of a gene into patients’ cells that enables them to produce healthy hemoglobin. In a clinical trial, 28 out of 32 patients lived free of pain crises during the study period after receiving Lyfgenia.</p>
<p>The clinical trial conducted by Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics that supported Casgevy’s approval enrolled 30 people with sickle cell, aged 12 to 35, who were, on average, experiencing four severe pain episodes per year and just under three hospitalizations per year.</p>

<p>Within three months of receiving a single Casgevy infusion, all of the study participants began producing protective levels of fetal hemoglobin. All but one of the participants achieved the main goal of the study — freedom from severe pain episodes for at least one year following treatment. Twenty-eight participants remained free of pain episodes for an average of 22 months. The first person treated with Casgevy in the clinical trial, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/07/crispr-sickle-cell-access/">a woman named Victoria Gray</a>, has now gone more than four years without a severe pain episode.</p>
<p>The FDA recently <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/31/fda-advisory-panel-vertex-crispr-exa-cel-sickle-cell/">held a</a> meeting with outside experts about Casgevy, which focused on “off-target” editing — that is, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/27/fda-has-some-safety-concerns-about-crispr-based-sickle-cell-treatment-documents-show/">any potential inadvertent changes</a> the medicine may make in patients’ cells — underscoring how scientists and regulators are adapting to this new class of genetic medicines. On Friday, the FDA said the treatment’s label will include a caution about the “potential” risk of off-target edits.</p>
<p>“Genome editing is something special and it may redefine the paradigm of medicine over the next 30-40 years,” said CRISPR Therapeutics CEO Samarth Kulkarni. “Exa-cel’s approval represents the start of it. “We can fundamentally alter the genes that cause disease to create a functional, lifelong solution with a single administration. That’s a new paradigm, and it’s only powered by genome editing.”</p>
<p>CRISPR Therapeutics was founded in 2013 soon after Charpentier and Doudna published their seminal CRISPR paper. Work on what is now <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/04/sickle-cell-crispr-exa-cel-casgevy-history/">Casgevy started in earnest two years later,</a> with Vertex on board as a partner and investor. The first clinical trial involving patients with sickle cell began in 2019.</p>
<p>Casgevy is often described as a one-time treatment, but that convenience underrepresents the arduous and lengthy steps required before it’s administered. Patients first have their blood stem cells removed through a process called apheresis; the cells are then shipped off to a company-run manufacturing lab where they are edited. While cells are prepared, patients must undergo a preparatory treatment with a chemotherapy drug to remove any native stem cells that might remain in their bone marrow.</p>
<p>This “conditioning” step is crucial because it provides space in the bone marrow for the functional, CRISPR-edited cells to engraft and grow. But the chemotherapy drug used, called busulfan, wipes out germ-fighting immune cells and can cause serious side effects, including infertility — a particularly troublesome risk factor for people who wish to have children.</p>
<p>The actual injection of Casgevy is quick, but patients must remain in the hospital for weeks until their immune system recovers and the risk of serious infection abates.</p>
		
		
<p>Vertex estimates about 25,000 people in the U.S. and Europe might be good candidates for Casgevy — consisting mostly of people with more severe disease who are willing to undergo the arduous procedure and accept the risks.</p>
<p>“The initial patients will be motivated because they’ve been following, they’re interested, and they believe the benefits outweigh the risks and the current challenges,” said David Altshuler, Vertex’s chief scientific officer. “But I think the other thing that will happen is a sort of community aspect, where patients will be watching other patients in their care centers and in their community. Over time, that will build confidence and trust.”</p>
<p>Both regulators in the U.K. and the FDA approved Casgevy for people as young as 12.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard consistently from physicians that they are interested in treating patients who are younger,” said Stuart Arbuckle, Vertex’s chief operating officer. “The disease has taken hold less, and so these patients have fewer complications and more of a lifetime of benefit to gain. And they tend to be able to schedule this procedure into their life a bit easier than a working adult. They also tend to do really well versus older people.”</p>
<p>Sharma, the sickle cell expert at St. Jude’s, intends to take a more cautious approach.</p>
<p>“As long as we don’t have evidence of long-term safety, I would be hesitant to expose young children to this therapy, which is still so novel,” he said. “I think the ideal patient is an adult who has severe disease not controlled by currently available treatments.”</p>
<p>Hsu, the University of Illinois physician, has already started speaking to his patients about undergoing treatment with Casgevy. Patients with more severe sickle cell disease “who have seen how bad it can be, especially as they grow older” are likely to be the first to seek out treatment, he said.</p>
<p>He’s also counseled some adolescent patients who expressed initial interest in Casgevy but have since decided to wait because the medicines they take today to control their disease are working. “These are younger people whose organs are in good enough shape that they could go through this, and their disease severity is high enough that they would be eligible.”</p>
<p>Vertex, which is running point on Casgevy’s commercial launch, has said previously that it expects a slow uptake, given the complexity of treatment and the need to sort out reimbursement and access.</p>
<p>Lyfgenia’s approval came with a black box warning about the possibility that patients who receive the therapy might later develop blood cancer and should be monitored for that risk. Two patients in trials of the drug died of blood cancers, and studies <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109167" data-sk="tooltip_parent">concluded</a>&nbsp;that the cancers were caused by the chemotherapy conditioning regimen for the treatment, not Lyfgenia itself.</p>

Scientists studying their vocalizations have already picked out key elements of their communication, namely clicks, sequences of which are called codas. Now, researchers led by Gašper Beuš from the University of California, Berkeley report the discovery that the acoustic properties of these clicks—for example, pitch—are “on many levels analogous to human vowels and diphthongs,” which is when one vowel sound morphs into another such as in the word “coin.” The researchers even identify two unique “coda vowels” that are “actively exchanged” in conversation between whales, which they term the a-vowel and i-vowel.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The researchers explain in their paper, <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/285cs" target="_blank">published as a preprint online this week</a>, that the first clue that so-called spectral properties could be meaningful for whale speech was provided by AI. Beuš <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608021001052" target="_blank">previously developed a deep learning model</a> for human language called fiwGAN which “was trained to imitate sperm whale codas and embed information into these vocalizations.” Not only did the AI predict elements of whale vocalizations already thought to be meaningful, such as clicks, but it also singled out acoustic properties.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>To follow up on the AI’s tip, the researchers analyzed a dataset of 3948 sperm whale codas recorded with hydrophones placed directly on whales between 2014 and 2018. They only analyzed one channel from the hydrophones to control for underwater effects and whale movement, and removed click timing from their visualization to better isolate patterns in the acoustic properties themselves.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>These visualizations vindicated the AI’s prediction: The whales reliably exchanged codas with one or two formants—frequency peaks in the sound wave—below the 10kHz range. The researchers termed these codas “vowels,” with single-formant codas being a-vowels and two-formant codas being i-vowels. “This is by analogy to human vowels which differ in their formant frequencies,” the authors wrote. They also identified upward and downward frequency “trajectories” in these codas, which they considered analogous to diphthongs in human language.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Considering that these coda vowel patterns were very distinct and not intermixed, plus the existence of diphthongs, the researchers argue that whales are controlling the frequency of their vocalizations.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Under our proposed view, whale clicks are equivalent to the pulses of vocal folds in human speech production,” the authors wrote. “In other words, we treat clicks as the source and the sperm whales’ resonant body (the nasal complex, including the spermaceti organ) as the filter that modulates resonant frequencies.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The analogies to human speech are readily apparent. The authors note, for example, that vocal tone in Mandarin can change the meaning of otherwise identical syllables.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“If our findings are correct, it means that the communication of sperm whales is much more complex and can carry more information than previously thought,” the researchers concluded.</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>This holiday season, we’re excited to introduce the newest addition to the iA family: iAノートブック, the Notebook for Writers.</p>
<p>Watermark lines guide your pen. As your words come into focus, the lines fade into the background. The iA&nbsp;Notebook has been a labor of love, spanning several years of trials and fails and deeply engaging our designer team.

<figcaption>Get a sneak peek of the iA Notebook this holiday season.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>If iA&nbsp;Writer Was a Notebook</h2>
<p>It all began with a simple question: What if iA&nbsp;Writer took the form of a physical notebook? Ten years in the making, we doubled our efforts in times of exponentially growing artificial text.</p>
<p>In the iA&nbsp;Notebook, every element is crafted to minimize distractions and enhance the joy of writing, mirroring the philosophy of iA&nbsp;Writer. Our goal was to extend the immersive focus experience enjoyed on our app to the offline realm.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSCF1299-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683">
<figcaption>iAノートブック, made with love in Japan</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Functionality was a key consideration in our design process. We carefully selected the paper thickness and color; the binding method was chosen to ensure the books lay flat, for an unbothered writing experience. The concept of transparency also influenced the design: you will find it in the subtle watermarking on the band and the transparent wrapping paper.</p>
<h2>Fading Watermark Guidelines</h2>
<p>We wanted guidelines in the notebook, serving as a temporary scaffold to support your writing without causing distraction. The design had to reflect the core spirit of iA&nbsp;Writer: simple, clean, uncluttered. The use of ink had to be exclusively reserved for the owner’s handwritten text. After exploring different approaches, the decision to adopt delicate watermark guidelines became clear, even though its implementation demands high technical expertise and attention to detail.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-backlight-empty.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption><b>“It’s impossible”</b> Watermark lines. They are noticeable when holding the paper against the light. After ten iterations, the Swiss paper makers and bookbinders stopped answering our emails.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-backlight-written.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption><b>“We have to try harder”</b> Making waterlines work required a lot of testing and optimization. We went through over 100 prototypes and 20 test prints with our binder in Japan.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/full-page-blank-scaled-1.jpg" alt="">
<figcaption><b>Before:</b> When the light comes from above they are barely just noticeable. Ideal for guiding the pen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/full-page-written-scaled-1.jpg">
<figcaption><b>After:</b> As your words come into focus, the lines fade into the background.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-lines-online.jpg">
<figcaption><b>The lines are here:</b> On an empty page the lines are visible. This needed just the right amount of ink and the right line thickness, and the right paper. Design takes time.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iA-Notebook-no-lines.jpg">
<figcaption><b>The lines fade:</b> The stronger contrast between ink and paper make the lines fade. It’s noticeable but less striking on a photograph, since the camera doesn’t act exactly like the human eye.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These watermark guidelines are subtle and unobtrusive, offering direction without overpowering the page. The high contrast between the discreet guidelines and the ink from your pen creates an optical illusion: the lines seem to vanish gradually as you write.</p>
<p>Once your thoughts have taken shape on the page, the lines fade into the background, allowing your text to take center stage. It’s an optical illusion, based on the way our eyes work. We focus on the highest contrast. Since the ink is stronger than the watermark lines, the watermarks appear to be invisible.</p>

<h2>Japanese Craftsmanship Extraordinaire</h2>
<p>Bringing this small project to life required a printing company with dedication, attention to detail, and a deep commitment to their craft. In the cultural context of Japanese companies, patience and continual improvement until reaching a high standard are highly valued.</p>
<p>Our bookbinding partner, located in Tokyo not far from our office, was chosen for the excellence of their past work and their genuine interest in product design. What sets them apart is not just their role as a supplier but as a true partner, actively contributing ideas to enhance the collaborative process.</p>



<h2>Want? Well…</h2>
<p>Following numerous prototypes and years of continuous collaboration, we take great pride in the final result we can share with you today. A first batch as a Christmas gift for friends and family is underway.</p>
<p>As a little gesture for Christmas this year, we’ve set aside three prototypes to be gifted to lucky raffle participants. Sign-ups are open until December 25th, and the winners will be revealed on January 15th. Oh, and we have three additional surprises coming in this year’s <a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-winterfest" title="iA Winterfest">iA&nbsp;Winterfest</a> so head over there to join the raffle and get hints of what else is waiting under the tree.</p>
<p>If you’d like one, send us a signal. We need to simplify the production and figure out the logistics. The price depends a bit on how much interest we get. Simply sign up to our iA&nbsp;Notebook newsletter or join the raffle to show your interest. We’ll send out a preorder, early next year.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

                    Abstract
                </h3>
                <p>
                    3D reconstruction methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) excel at rendering photorealistic novel views of complex scenes. However, recovering a high-quality NeRF typically requires tens to hundreds of input images, resulting in a time-consuming capture process. We present ReconFusion to reconstruct real-world scenes using only a few photos. Our approach leverages a diffusion prior for novel view synthesis, trained on synthetic and multiview datasets, which regularizes a NeRF-based 3D reconstruction pipeline at novel camera poses beyond those captured by the set of input images. Our method synthesizes realistic geometry and texture in underconstrained regions while preserving the appearance of observed regions. We perform an extensive evaluation across various real-world datasets, including forward-facing and 360-degree scenes, demonstrating significant performance improvements over previous few-view NeRF reconstruction approaches.

                    (a) We optimize a NeRF to minimize a reconstruction loss \(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{recon}\) between renderings and a few input images, as well as a sample loss \(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{sample}\) between a rendering from a random pose and an image predicted by a diffusion model for that pose. (b) To generate the sample image, we use a PixelNeRF-style model to fuse information from the input images and to render a predicted feature map corresponding to the sample view camera pose. (c) This feature map is concatenated with the noisy latent (computed from the current NeRF rendering at that pose) and is provided to a diffusion model, which additionally uses CLIP embeddings of the input images via cross-attention. The resulting decoded output sample is used to enforce an image-space loss on the corresponding NeRF rendering (\(\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{sample}\)).

                    ReconFusion recovers consistent 3D reconstructions (top) from a diffusion model that produces image samples independently for each viewpoint (bottom). These samples are not multiview consistent, but can produce high-quality 3D reconstructions when used as a prior in optimization.

<h3>from the <i>do-not-pass-go,-do-not-collect-$200</i> dept</h3>

<p>Last year agricultural equipment giant John Deere found itself <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/01/28/biden-praises-right-to-repair-as-john-deere-hit-with-two-fresh-repair-lawsuits/">on the receiving end of an antitrust lawsuit</a> for its efforts to monopolize tractor repair. The lawsuits noted that the company consistently purchased competing repair centers in order to consolidate the sector and force customers into using the company’s own repair facilities, driving up costs and logistical hurdles dramatically for farmers.</p>
<p>The lawsuits also noted how the company routinely makes repair difficult and costly through the act of software locks, obnoxious DRM, and “<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/21/despite-some-progress-ifixit-says-apples-dedication-to-right-to-repair-still-sucks/">parts pairing</a>” — which involves only allowing the installation of company-certified replacement parts — or mandatory collections of company-blessed components. </p>
<p>One of the lawsuits by a collection of 18 farms and farmers was <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-massive-repair-lawsuit-against-john-deere-clears-a-major-hurdle/">allowed to move forward last week</a> after a judge <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24178008/deere-doc.pdf">ruled against</a> the company’s motion to dismiss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In a forceful, 89-page memorandum, U.S. District Court Judge Iain Johnson wrote that the founder of John Deere “was an innovative farmer and blacksmith who—with his own hands—fundamentally changed the agricultural industry.” Deere the man “would be deeply disappointed in his namesake corporation” if the plaintiffs can ultimately prove their antitrust allegations against Deere the company, which are voluminous and well-documented.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Deere has spent years promising farmers that they’d reverse course on their efforts to monopolize repair, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/06/01/john-deere-still-sucks-on-right-to-repair-despite-years-of-promises/">only to ignore their own promises</a>. The company has also been striking <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/24/american-farm-bureau-continues-to-sell-out-farmers-on-meaningful-right-to-repair-reform/">meaningless “memorandums of understanding”</a> with key trade groups, pinky swearing to stop their bad behavior if the groups agree to not support state or federal right to repair legislation. </p>
<p>The market isn’t going to fix this problem by itself. It’s clearly going to require a combination of antitrust reform, regulatory action, new state/federal legislation, and meaningful class action penalties before John Deere executives finally get the message. And unfortunately for them, right to repair reform continues to see stunning levels of bipartisan public support. </p>
