Our team was small (~23
employees), and we knew that we needed many more people to execute on our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikn7ovpjdIg">audacious vision</a>.  While we had
had success hiring in our personal networks, those networks now felt tapped;
we needed to get further afield.  As is our wont, we got together as a team
and brainstormed: how could we get a bigger and broader applicant pool?  One
of our engineers, Sean, shared some personal experience: that
<a href="https://oxide.computer/principles">Oxide’s principles and values</a> were very
personally important to him — but that when he explained them to people
unfamiliar with the company, they were (understandably?) dismissed as
corporate claptrap.  Sean had found, however, that there was one surefire way
to cut through the skepticism:  to explain our approach to compensation.
Maybe, Sean wondered, we should talk about it publicly?</p><p>"I could certainly write a blog entry explaining it," I offered.  At this
suggestion, the team practically lunged with enthusiasm: the reaction was so
uniformly positive that I have to assume that everyone was sick of explaining
this most idiosyncratic aspect of Oxide to friends and family.  So what was
the big deal about our compensation?  Well, as a I wrote in the resulting
piece,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values">Compensation
as a Reflection of Values</a>, our compensation is not merely transparent, but
uniform.  The piece — unsurprisingly, given the evergreen hot topic that is
compensation — got a ton of attention.  While some of that attention was
negative (despite the piece trying to frontrun every HN hater!), much of it was
positive — and everyone seemed to be at least intrigued.</p><p>And in terms of its initial purpose, the piece succeeded beyond our wildest
imagination: it brought a surge of new folks interested in the company.  Best
of all, the people new to Oxide were interested for all of the right reasons:
not the compensation <em>per se</em>, but for the values that the compensation
represents.  The deeper they dug, the more they found to like — and many who
learned about Oxide for the first time through that blog entry we now count as
long-time, cherished colleagues.</p><p>That blog entry was a long time ago now, and today we have ~75 employees
(and a <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">shipping product</a>!);
how is our compensation model working out for us?</p></div></div><div><h2 data-sectnum=""><a href="#_how_its_going">How it’s going<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" role="img"><g fill="currentColor"><path d="m6.586 12.243 1.59-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.061 0l.354.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06L8 13.658A4 4 0 0 1 2.343 8l1.591-1.591a.75.75 0 0 1 1.06 0l.354.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.06l-1.59 1.591a2 2 0 1 0 2.828 2.829M12.066 9.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.06 0l-.354-.354a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06l1.59-1.591a2 2 0 1 0-2.828-2.829l-1.59 1.591a.75.75 0 0 1-1.061 0l-.354-.353a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.06L8 2.342A4 4 0 0 1 13.657 8z"></path><path d="M9.945 5.702a.75.75 0 0 0-1.061 0L5.702 8.884a.75.75 0 0 0 0 1.06l.353.354a.75.75 0 0 0 1.061 0l3.182-3.182a.75.75 0 0 0 0-1.06z"></path></g></svg></a></h2><div><p>Before we get into our deeper findings, two updates that are so important that
we have updated the blog entry itself.  First, the dollar figure itself
continues to increase over time (as of this writing in 2025, $207,264);
things definitely haven’t gotten (and aren’t
getting!) any cheaper.  And second, we <em>did</em> introduce variable compensation for
some sales roles.  Yes, those roles can make more than the rest of us — but
they can also make less, too.  And, importantly:  if/when those folks are
making more than the rest of us, it’s because they’re selling a lot — a
result that can be celebrated by everyone!</p><p>Those critical updates out of the way, how is it working?  There have been a
lot of surprises along the way, mostly (all?) of the positive variety.  A
couple of things that we have learned:</p><p><strong>People take their own performance really seriously.</strong>  When some outsiders
hear about our compensation model, they insist that it can’t possibly work
because "everyone will slack off." I have come to find this concern to be more
revealing of the person making the objection than of our model, as our
experience has been in fact the opposite: in my one-on-one conversations with
team members, a frequent subject of conversation is people who are concerned
that they aren’t doing enough (or that they aren’t doing the right thing, or
that their work is progressing slower than they would like).  I find my job is
often to help quiet this inner critic while at the same time stoking what I
feel is a healthy urge:  when one holds one’s colleagues in high regard, there
is an especially strong desire to help contribute — to prove oneself worthy
of a superlative team.  Our model allows people to focus on their own
contribution (whatever it might be).</p><p><strong>People take hiring <em>really</em> seriously.</strong>  When evaluating a peer (rather
than a subordinate), one naturally has high expectations — and because (in
the sense of our wages, anyway) everyone at Oxide is a peer, it shouldn’t be
surprising that folks have very high expectations for potential future
colleagues.  And because the
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/3">Oxide hiring process</a> is writing
intensive, it allows for candidates to be thoroughly reviewed by Oxide
employees — who are tough graders!  It is, bluntly, really hard to get
a job at Oxide.</p><p><strong>It allows us to internalize the importance of different roles.</strong>  One of the
more incredible (and disturbingly frequent) objections I have heard is: "But
is that what you’ll pay support folks?" I continue to find this question
offensive, but I no longer find it surprising: the specific dismissal of
support roles reveals a widespread and corrosive devaluation of those closest
to customers. My rejoinder is simple: think of the best support engineers
you’ve worked with; what were they worth? Anyone who has shipped complex
systems knows these extraordinary people — calm under fire, deeply technical,
brilliantly resourceful, profoundly empathetic — are invaluable to the
business. So what if you built a team entirely of folks like that? The
response has usually been: well, sure, if you’re going to only hire <em>those</em>
folks. Yeah, we are — and we have!</p><p><strong>It allows for fearless versatility.</strong> A bit of a corollary to the
above, but subtly different: even though we (certainly!) hire and select for
certain roles, our uniform compensation means we can in fact think primarily
in terms of <em>people</em> unconfined by those roles.  That is, we can be very fluid
about what we’re working on, without fear of how it will affect a perceived
career trajectory.  As a concrete example: we had a large customer that wanted
to put in place a program for some of the additional work they wanted to see
in the product.  The complexity of their needs required dedicated program
management resources that we couldn’t spare, and in another more static
company we would have perhaps looked to hire.  But in our case, two folks came
together — CJ from operations, and Izzy from support — and did something
together that was in some regards new to both of them (and was neither of
their putative full-time jobs!)  The result was indisputably successful:  the
customer loved the results, and two terrific people got a chance to work
closely together without worrying about who was dotted-lined to whom.</p><p><strong>It has allowed us to organizationally scale.</strong> Many organizations describe
themselves as flat, and a reasonable rebuttal to this are the "shadow
hierarchies" created by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness">tyranny of
structurelessness</a>.  And indeed, if one were to read (say)
<a href="https://cdn.fastly.steamstatic.com/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf">Valve’s
(in)famous handbook</a>, the autonomy seems great — but the stack ranking
decidedly less so, especially because the handbook is conspicuously silent on
the subject of compensation.  (Unsurprisingly,
<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ex-valve-employee-describes-ruthless-industry-politics/">compensation
was weaponized at Valve</a>, which descended into
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/07/wireduk-valve-jeri-ellsworth/">toxic
cliquishness</a>.) While we believe that autonomy <em>is</em> important to do one’s best
work, we also have a clear structure at Oxide in that Steve Tuck (Oxide
co-founder and CEO) is
in charge.  He has to be:  he is held accountable to our investors — and he
must have the latitude to make decisions.  Under Steve, it is true that
we <em>don’t</em> have layers of middle management.  Might we need some in the
future?  Perhaps, but what fraction of middle management in a company is
dedicated to — at some level — determining who gets what in terms of
compensation?  What happens when you eliminate that burden completely?</p><p><strong>It frees us to both lead and follow.</strong> We expect that
every Oxide employee has the capacity to lead others — and we tap this
capacity frequently.  Of course, a company in which everyone is trying to
direct all traffic all the time would be a madhouse, so we also very much rely
on following one another too!  Just as our compensation model allows us to
internalize the values of different roles, it allows us to appreciate the
value of <strong>both</strong> leading and following, and empowers us each with the judgement
to know when to do which.  This isn’t always easy or free of ambiguity, but
this particular dimension of our versatility has been essential — and
our compensation model serves to encourage it.</p><p><strong>It causes us to hire carefully and deliberately.</strong> Of course, one should
<em>always</em> hire carefully and deliberately, but this often isn’t the case — and
many a startup has been ruined by reckless expansion of headcount.  One of the
roots of this can be found in a dirty open secret of Silicon Valley middle
management: its ranks are taught to grade their career by the number of
reports in their organization.  Just as if you were to compensate software
engineers based on the number of lines of code they wrote, this results in
perverse incentives and predictable disasters — and any Silicon Valley vet
will have plenty of horror stories of middle management jockeying for reqs or
reorgs when they should have been focusing on product and customers.  When
you can eliminate middle management, you eliminate this incentive.  We grow
the team not because of someone’s animal urges to have the largest possible
organization, but rather because we are at a point where adding people will
allow us to better serve our market and customers.</p><p><strong>It liberates feedback from compensation.</strong> Feedback is, of course, very
important:  we all want to know when and where we’re doing the right thing!
And of course, we want to know too where there is opportunity for improvement.
However, Silicon Valley has historically tied feedback so tightly to
compensation that it has ceased to even pretend to be constructive:  if it
needs to be said, performance review processes aren’t, in fact, about
improving the performance of the team, but rather quantifying and
stack-ranking that performance for purposes of compensation.  When
compensation is moved aside, there is a kind of liberation for feedback
itself:  because feedback is now entirely earnest, it can be expressed and
received thoughtfully.</p><p><strong>It allows people to focus on doing the right thing.</strong>  In a world of
traditional, compensation-tied performance review, the organizational priority
is around those things that affect compensation — even at the expense of
activity that clearly benefits the company.  This leads to all sorts of wild
phenomena, and most technology workers will be able to tell stories of doing
things that we’re clearly right for the company, but having to hide it from
management that thought only narrowly in terms of their own stated KPIs and
MBOs.  By contrast, over and over (and over!) again, we have found that people
do the right thing at Oxide — even if (especially if?) no one is looking.
The beneficiary of that right thing?  More often than not, it’s our customers,
who have uniformly praised the team for going above and beyond.</p><p><strong>It allows us to focus on the work that matters.</strong>  Relatedly, when
compensation is non-uniform, the process to figure out (and maintain) that
non-uniformity is laborious.  All of that work — of line workers assembling
packets explaining themselves, of managers arming themselves with those
packets to fight in the arena of organizational combat, and then of those same
packets ultimately being regurgitated back onto something called a review — is <em>work</em>. Assuming such a process is executed perfectly (something which I
suppose is possible in the abstract, even though I personally have never seen
it), this is work that does not in fact advance the mission of the company.
Not having variable compensation gives us all of that time and energy back to
do the <em>actual</em> work — the stuff that matters.</p><p><strong>It has stoked an extraordinary sense of teamwork.</strong> For me personally — and
as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFD2bq1_tU&amp;t=2854s">I relayed on an episode
of <em>Software Misadventures</em></a> — the highlights of my career have been being a
part of an extraordinary team.  The currency of a team is mutual trust, and
while uniform compensation certainly isn’t the only way to achieve that trust,
boy does it ever help!  As Steve and I have told one another more times that
we can count:  we are so lucky to work on this team, with its extraordinary
depth and breadth.</p><p>While our findings have been very positive, I would still reiterate what we
said four years ago:  we don’t know what the future holds, and it’s easier to
make an unwavering commitment to the transparency rather than the uniformity.
That said, the uniformity has had so many positive ramifications that the model
feels more important than ever.  We are beyond the point of this being a
curiosity; it’s been essential for building a mission-focused team taking on
a problem larger than ourselves.  So it’s not a fit for everyone — but if
you are seeking an extraordinary team solving hard problems in service to
customers, <a href="https://oxide.computer/careers">consider Oxide</a>!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span>Dangers come but dangers also go and when they do, the brain has an “all-clear” signal that teaches it to extinguish its fear. A new study in mice by MIT neuroscientists shows that the signal is the release of dopamine along a specific interregional brain circuit. The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn’t.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,” said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author <a href="https://picower.mit.edu/susumu-tonegawa">Susumu Tonegawa</a>, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In 2020 <a href="https://picower.mit.edu/news/these-neurons-extinguishing-fear-its-own-reward">Tonegawa’s lab showed</a> that learning to be afraid, and then learning when that’s no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain’s amygdala region. When a mouse learns that a place is “dangerous” (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2. When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn’t recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread. Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories. The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> show that it’s dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,” said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm. “We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn’t just about suppressing it—it’s a positive learning process powered by the brain’s reward machinery. This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Forgetting fear</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The VTA was the lab’s prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them. The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect. They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.</span></span></span></p>

<figure role="group">


<figcaption>An edited version of a figure from the research shows the ventral tegmental area, highlighting dopamine-associated neurons in green and one that connects to the posterior amygdala (magnified in inset) in red.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p><span><span><span>The circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine? The team showed that indeed they express “D1” receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Dopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment. On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet. On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn’t experience any new shocks –at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes. On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early moments of day 2 when the anticipated shocks didn’t come and the mice eased up on freezing in fear, the Ppp1r1b neurons showed the stronger dopamine activity. More strikingly, the mice that learned to extinguish their fear most strongly also showed the greatest dopamine signal at those neurons.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Causal connections</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The final sets of experiments sought to show that dopamine is not just available and associated with fear encoding and extinction, but also actually causes them. In one set, they turned to optogenetics, a technology that enables scientists to activate or quiet neurons with different colors of light. Sure enough, when they quieted VTA dopaminergic inputs in the pBLA, doing so impaired fear extinction. When they activated those inputs, it accelerated fear extinction. The researchers were surprised that when they activated VTA dopaminergic inputs into the aBLA they could reinstate fear even without any new foot shocks, impairing fear extinction.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The other way they confirmed a causal role for dopamine in fear encoding and extinction was to manipulate the amygdala neurons’ dopamine receptors. In Ppp1r1b neurons, overexpressing dopamine receptors impaired fear recall and promoted extinction, whereas knocking the receptors down impaired fear extinction. Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“We showed that fear extinction requires VTA dopaminergic activity in the pBLA Ppp1r1b neurons by using optogenetic inhibition of VTA terminals and cell-type-specific knockdown of D1 receptors in these neurons,” the authors wrote.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The scientists are careful in the study to note that while they’ve identified the “teaching signal” for fear extinction learning, the broader phenomenon of fear extinction occurs brainwide, rather than in just this single circuit.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>But the circuit seems to be a key node to consider as drug developers and psychiatrists work to combat anxiety and PTSD, Pignatelli di Spinazzola said.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“Fear learning and fear extinction provide a strong framework to study generalized anxiety and PTSD,” he said. “Our study investigates the underlying mechanisms suggesting multiple targets for a translational approach such as pBLA and use of dopaminergic modulation.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Marianna Rizzo is also a co-author of the study. Support for the research came from the RIKEN Center for Brain Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Freedom Together Foundation and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</span></span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>An Arizona woman who created a "laptop farm" in her home to help fake IT workers pose as US-based employees has pleaded guilty in a scheme that generated over $17 million for herself... and North Korea.</p>
<p>Christina Marie Chapman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in a US District Court on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16, and under the terms of her plea deal, all parties will recommend the court put her behind bars for between 94 and 111 months. Chapman was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/three_arrested_for_helping_north_korea/">arrested</a> in May.</p>

    

<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/usao-dc/media/1352191/dl">court documents</a>, Chapman ran a laptop farm out of her home from October 2020 to October 2023. During this time she hosted computers for overseas IT workers — who were posing as American citizens and residents — to ensure the devices had local IP addresses, making them appear to be in the US.</p>

        


        

<p>Chapman also helped the foreign fraudsters steal the identities of more than 70 US nationals, then use those identities to apply for remote IT jobs, according to the Feds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who successfully obtained employment as part of the scam then received payroll checks at Chapman's home with direct deposits sent to her US bank accounts before ultimately being laundered and funneled to North Korea, and then potentially contributing to the DPRK's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/08/us_lazarus_group_crypto_seizure/">weapons programs</a>, the court document says.</p>

        

<p>It's unclear how much of the ill-gotten gains Chapman pocketed, but according to the Justice Department, Chapman's overseas IT workers received <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/arizona-woman-pleads-guilty-fraud-scheme-illegally-generated-17-million-revenue-north">more than $17.1 million</a> for their work. Much of the income was falsely reported to the IRS and Social Security Administration in the names of real US individuals whose identities had been stolen.</p>

</ul>
<p>Some of the overseas workers were hired at Fortune 500 companies, including a top-five television network, a premier Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace and defense manufacturer, an American car manufacturer, a luxury retail chain, and a US-hallmark media and entertainment company.</p>
<p>The Norks specifically targeted some of these companies, likely for their sensitive IP and other valuable data in addition to providing a paycheck, and even "maintained postings for companies at which they wanted to insert IT workers," according to the DOJ.</p>
<p>In total, more than 300 US companies were scammed, and more than 70 people had false tax liabilities created in their name. Additionally, phony documents were submitted to the Department of Homeland Security on more than 100 occasions.</p>
<p>These types of scams have netted Pyongyang at least <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/doj_dpkr_fake_tech_worker_indictment/">$88 million</a> over six years. Earlier this week, <em>The Register</em> interviewed someone who was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/11/it_worker_scam/">twice targeted</a>. In both cases, the fraudsters used AI-based tools during video interviews with — wait for it — a security startup using AI to find vulnerabilities. ®</p>

<p>Welcome, weary traveller from the orange site! Let me tell you the tale of <span>roons</span> — a kit for building mechanical computers.</p>

<p>I got inspired a couple of years ago when I binged a bunch of mechanical logic gate YouTube videos. There are some unbelievably clever implementations — Steve Mould’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxXaizglscw">water computer</a> was a particular inspiration.</p>



<p>Still, these mechanical logic gates usually end up too big to make any practical devices. I figured, how hard can it be to miniaturise them into a usable kit?</p>



<div><fieldset data-hintbox-type="foreshadowing"><legend>foreshadowing</legend><p>Very! It turned out the answer was <em>very hard</em>.</p></fieldset></div>



<h2>loom automaton</h2>



<blockquote>
<p>The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.</p>
<cite>Ada Lovelace</cite></blockquote>



<p>After noodling around with far too many prototypes, I settled on what I call a <strong>loom automaton</strong>. We place tiles (“<span>roons</span>”) on a loom of alternating bars that move up and down. The contours on these tiles guide marbles <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> and holes <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="hole"></span> in discretised steps, representing bitstreams.</p>

<p>Isn’t it <em>incredibly neat</em> that a literal physical loom turns out to be a great substrate for Lovelace’s metaphorical loom?</p>



<p>Anyway — you can think of this loom as a cellular automaton, where each cell is:</p>







<p>If you know of prior work on this kind of system, please <a href="https://whomtech.com/whomtech/contact/" data-type="page" data-id="156">get in touch</a>! I don’t claim the loom automaton is original; I just haven’t seen it elsewhere.</p>



<h2>why loom good</h2>



<p>Initially, I was making ad-hoc devices for each computer component — a gadget for number comparison, which worked <em>like this</em>; and a gadget for addition, which worked <em>like that</em>; etc.</p>



<p>The loom was a turning point. Instead of a loose collection of dissimilar gadgets that plug in together, <em>everything</em> is implemented on the loom. (Except peripherals, which we’ll get to later.) This gives us a <strong>common interface </strong>for stitching together whatever devices we need — memory, instruction sets, whatever. It makes it trivial to deliver power in synchronised discrete steps to every component.</p>



<p>I tried several variations on the loom: moving the marbles using alternating pins; continuously guiding the marbles using slides rippling in a wave; replacing gravity with magnetic potentials; etc. You can read more about these failed attempts in the hardware/prototypes deep dive.</p>

<h2>Turing completeness</h2>



<p>You can skip this section if it’s obvious that discretised marble movements are Turing complete, but then you’d miss out on the beautiful interactive simulator:</p>







<p>I learned JavaScript for this.</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/xor">xor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/xor.png" alt="xor"></a> <span>roon</span> above receives its inputs, a single <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> (<span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"></span> or <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span>) can fall into the central channel, while <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span> will block each other. So an <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/xor">xor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/xor.png" alt="xor"></a> implements XOR.</p>



<p>Other <span>roons</span> implement other logic gates. The <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch-back">canute <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch-back.png" alt="canute"></a> performs a check then kicks an <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> back one step, which lets us implement carry-like functions on a marble bitstream. There are also <span>roons</span> like the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/trap">trap <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/trap.png" alt="trap"></a> that can permanently store a piece of state.</p>



<p>Though actually, you don’t need any stateful <span>roons</span> to store state — you can just cycle a stream of <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="hole"></span> round in a loop, bam, you’ve got a register:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/static-register.gif" alt="7-bit static register"><figcaption>7-bit static register</figcaption></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dynamic-register.gif" alt="7-bit read/write register"><figcaption>7-bit read/write register</figcaption></figure>



<p>We read from this register using a <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch">switch <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch.png" alt="switch"></a> to divert the path of an infinite stream of <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="true" alt="marble"></span>. Meanwhile, the register is constantly reading in from one of two data sources: itself, or an input stream, depending on a 3rd signal channel. While this channel is <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-hole.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="hole"></span>, the data loops; when it’s <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span>, it gets overwritten by the external input, letting us perform a write.</p>



<p>But I’m getting off track. Trivially, XOR gates are Turing complete; my job is done, that’s a computer, we can all go home. Thank you.</p>



<h2>convenience</h2>



<p>“But wait! Being Turing complete isn’t enough to not suck!”</p>



<p>That’s a good point. To actually make a <em>good</em> mechanical computer kit, we need a few other things:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compactness</strong> — build interesting devices in a small area, with very few pieces — no warehouse-sized processors!</li>



<li><strong>Promptness</strong> — reasonable processing rate; don’t have to wait for <code>BB 10</code> steps before a computation finishes</li>



<li><strong>Fast editing</strong> — minimal friction to changing a pattern and running it. “Hot reloading” so a pattern can be edited while running.</li>



<li><strong>Saving and loading</strong> — can save your work to compact storage, then bring it back later</li>



<li><strong>Minimal</strong> — build many complex systems from a small number of core parts</li>
</ul>



<p>Basically I wanted a kit that’s actually practical and fun for building circuits.</p>



<h2>did you make one?</h2>



<p>… yes!</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here’s a binary adder made of a <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/long-turn">long turn <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/long-turn.png" alt="long turn"></a>, <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/switch-back">canute <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/switch-back.png" alt="canute"></a>, and <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/distributor">distributor <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/distributor.png" alt="distributor"></a> — which together are not much bigger than a postage stamp. (Wave your hands and amortise away the space occupied by the disk drive itself, I/O plumbing etc etc)</p>



<p>Because space is at such a premium, instead of staggering multiple XORs and ANDs, we just bundle it all into a single unit — it’s small but slow.</p>



<p>We can also do memory, latches, processors, counters, timers, counters etc. Follow the <a href="https://whomtech.com/tutorials/" data-type="page" data-id="178">tutorial</a> sequence to learn more.</p>



<h2>modularity</h2>



<p>I wanted it to be easy to store and run lots of different patterns. Each disk drive is reasonably pocket-sized, but there’s still a lot of space dedicated to the internal gear mechanism.</p>



<p>So here’s the removable disk system:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/disk-load.gif" alt="loading a disk onto a drive"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/save.gif" alt="removing a disk from a drive"></figure>



<p>This is pretty simple, but it took a long time to get right! Challenges included:</p>



<ul>
<li>Figuring out exactly how much of the mechanism I could shunt down into the disk drive, and how much I had to retain in the disk</li>



<li>Optimising magnet strengths and positions — need the save/load to work smoothly, while preventing the base from popping back up in operation</li>
</ul>



<p>We can also move individual bars between disks, or rearrange the order within a disk. This makes it easy to adjust a pattern if we started it in the wrong place.</p>



<h2>extendability</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="216" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/snap-drives.gif" alt="connecting two drives together"></figure>



<p>If we need a bigger workspace, we just put drives next to each other. This works along both X and Y axes, so you can build 2D grids.</p>



<div><fieldset data-hintbox-type="foreshadowing"><legend>foreshadowing</legend><p>I’m fully aware there’s a whole other dimension available here — working on it!</p></fieldset></div>



<h3>binding</h3>



<p>Each face of the drive has a pair of north-south magnets at its ends. This lets it pair up with a 180-degree-rotated copy of itself.</p>



<p>The centre of each face also has a small raised nub next to a corresponding pocket. This locks the drive into a precise position.</p>



<h3>power</h3>



<p>We also need to transfer power through the system. Originally I used horizontal axles with hidden magnetic couplers, which looked very cool but had too many design issues.</p>



<p>Instead, each drive has a 2 x 2 gear grid, where each gear has an integrated barrel cam to move the bars up and down. When two drives are placed next to each other, the gears bind together.</p>



<p>Because <code>N</code> is even in our <code>N x N</code> gear grid, the drives all spin the same way. This matters because certain peripherals expect a particular direction of rotation.</p>



<h3>phase</h3>



<p>We want all the bars to move in phase. Connecting the drives up correctly is fiddly — it’s easy to accidentally offset the connection by a tooth or two.</p>



<p>To prevent this, the gears have a layer of <strong>phase baffles</strong> (I don’t know the technical term). These physically block the gears from connecting until they’re perfectly synced up.</p>

<p>Combining all these principles together gives us a lot of freedom in how we set up our workspace:</p>

<p>How practical are these big grids, though? More details in the hardware deep dive.</p>



<h2>storage</h2>



<p>I wanted to make <span>roons</span> easy to store. I already had the stud system for binding tiles to bars, so I just extended that. The bases of the drives accept studs, so you can stack them up.</p>



<p>I also looked for convenient places to store the smaller pieces. For example, the encabulator has a hollow core for marbles, <span>roons</span> can be stored upside-down in the travel lid.</p>

<h2>peripherals?</h2>



<p>What an odd question, but — yes! Yes, <span>roons</span> has peripherals. These use the same 2×2 gear interface as the disk drives, so they plug into the grid and sync up.</p>



<p>There are two boring feature-complete peripherals:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/tech-rundown/encabulator/" data-type="page" data-id="3037">encabulator</a> lets the user supply rotation to the system, powering each device.</li>



<li>The <strong>bucket</strong> is a bucket. <span><img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/bit-marble.png" data-is-seq="false" alt="marble"></span> can fall into it. This one was particularly challenging and took billions of research hours.</li>
</ul>



<p>The WIP peripherals are where things get spicy:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>7-segment display</strong> (WIP) intakes 4-bit numbers on a cycle, converting them into the corresponding base ten digit (plus 6 special characters)</li>
</ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="771" src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1024x771.jpg" alt="mockup of a 7-segment display peripheral" srcset="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-300x226.jpg 300w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-768x578.jpg 768w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://whomtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250422_122728642_AE.jpg 2040w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>mockup 7-segment display for illustration — prototype coming soon</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>numpad</strong> (WIP) converts keypresses of the digits 0-9 into 4-bit marble bitstreams.</li>



<li>The <strong>alphanumeric display</strong> (WIP) is a 6-bit extension of the 7-segment display, capable of displaying all letters of the alphabet, digits, and your favourite punctuation marks.</li>



<li>The <strong>hard drive</strong> (WIP) is space efficient marble data storage that can be used as input/output for other patterns.</li>



<li>The <strong>turbo encabulator</strong> (NES, Not Even Started) is a motorised encabulator for powering larger grids.</li>
</ul>



<p>Expect some big updates soon — these peripherals are what makes <span>roons</span> look like actual magic. For example, plugging a display into an adder:</p>







<p>Or chaining multiple displays together to get scrolling text (the bitstream passes through):</p>







<p>But I am just one person, and physically implementing these designs takes me a <em>long</em> time. So no mechanical text displays for you — yet.</p>



<h2>materials and manufacturing</h2>



<p>Most components are prototyped in 3D-printed PLA. Plans are to switch to injection-moulded ABS for mass production, though I’ve got a couple of more complex plans up my sleeve depending on demand.</p>



<p>I print these using three Bambu Labs A1 Minis. These are <em>really really good</em>, by the way.</p>



<p>Many of these pieces would be better prototyped in something like resin, but FDM turned out to be good enough; it’s what I was familiar with and had access to.</p>



<h3>magnets</h3>



<p>Each <span>roon</span> needs to cling to the bars of the loom. Consequently, I have manually superglued approximately 6,000 tiny neodymium magnets, and no longer have fingerprints.</p>



<h3>bars</h3>



<p>The bars of the disk need to be magnetic (or at least magnetically receptive). But inserting individual magnets would be too expensive and tedious.</p>



<p>Therefore, I manually trim down Copper-Coated Mild Steel (CCMS) brazing rods with a pair of bolt cutters, then embed them in the bars. You wouldn’t believe how many failed approaches it took to find this solution — could be an entire post in itself.</p>



<h2>website</h2>



<p>I took a calculated risk in setting up the whomtech website, and used two unproven technologies:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>WordPress</strong> is a little-known website builder. We hope that the endorsement of an industry titan like whomtech can give this underused piece of tech some exposure.</li>



<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a fresh, new approach to minimising your serotonin. It combines the elegance of Java with the type safety of punching yourself in the throat.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can read more JS slander in the software deep dive.</p>



<h2>disappointments</h2>



<p>So is <span>roons</span> an unmitigated success?</p>



<p>No! Don’t worry, there are many mitigations:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Peripherals behind schedule</strong> –The really cool peripheral prototypes are nowhere near production ready. The challenge is to integrate them with the marble bitstream concept, while minimising the number of parts and maximising reliability. I’d hoped to have this done by now — it’s absolutely possible, but I am slow.</li>



<li><strong>Piece reliability</strong> — Newer <span>roons</span> like the <a href="https://whomtech.com/docs/list-of-roons/crossing">crossing <img src="https://whomtech.com/wp-content/plugins/roons-multi-block/build/assets/images/piece/crossing.png" alt="crossing"></a> haven’t hit the level of reliability I want. “Mostly working” isn’t good enough — we need 99.9%+ reliability to build anything interesting. This isn’t a threat to the underlying Turing completeness, but it does reduce the kit’s convenience.</li>



<li><strong>Piece interoperability</strong> — This is the real curse. Getting each <span>roon</span> to interoperate reliability with every other <span>roon</span> is exponentially (quadratically?) difficult. I’m happy with the basic interactions, but there are esoteric cases where an interaction “should” work but doesn’t.</li>



<li><strong>Ease of use</strong> — <span>roons</span> can be small and fiddly. I’m used to them by now, but there’s still work to be done to make it easier for newcomers.</li>



<li><strong>Simulator</strong> — I design the tutorials using a janky simulator tool I built. I wanted to polish it up before general release, but here we are.</li>



<li><strong>Site and tutorials</strong> — There’s still tons of tutorial content to write, and parts of the site that need attention.</li>



<li><strong>Additional <span>roons</span></strong> — There are many, many specific <span>roons</span> that I haven’t had time to develop yet: e.g. enhanced lateral movement, more state, general conveniences, 3D movement, etc</li>
</ul>



<h2>more technical stuff</h2>



<p>A <em>ton</em> of research and experimentation went into this project over the last couple of years. Some of it’s pretty interesting! You can read the mind-numbing details here:</p>

<h2>can I get a <span>roons</span> kit?</h2>



<p>Maybe!</p>



<p>I have a <a href="https://whomtech.com/whomtech/kickstarter/" data-type="page" data-id="2501">Kickstarter campaign</a> launching on May 21st. I’m also sending out a limited number of <a href="https://whomtech.com/whomtech/request-a-review-kit/" data-type="page" data-id="2510">review kits</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<section id="newslist"><article data-news-id="151"></article></section><topcomment><article data-comment-id="151-" id="151-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 34 minutes ago. 15371 views.  </span><pre>Five months ago, I rejoined Redis and quickly started to talk with my colleagues about a possible switch to the AGPL license, only to discover that there was already an ongoing discussion, a very old one, too. Many people, within the company, had the feeling that the AGPL was a better pick than SSPL, and while eventually Redis switched to the SSPL license, the internal discussion continued.

I tried to give more strength to the ongoing pro-AGPL license side. My feeling was that the SSPL, in practical terms, failed to be accepted by the community. The OSI wouldn’t accept it, nor would the software community regard the SSPL as an open license. In little time, I saw the hypothesis getting more and more traction, at all levels within the company hierarchy.

I’ll be honest: I truly wanted the code I wrote for the new Vector Sets data type to be released under an open source license. Writing open source software is too rooted in me: I rarely wrote anything else in my career. I’m too old to start now. This may be childish, but I wrote Vector Sets with a huge amount of enthusiasm exactly because I knew Redis (and my new work) was going to be open source again.

I understand that the core of our work is to improve Redis, to continue building a good system, useful, simple, able to change with the requirements of the software stack. Yet, returning back to an open source license is the basis for such efforts to be coherent with the Redis project, to be accepted by the user base, and to contribute to a human collective effort that is larger than any single company. So, honestly, while I can’t take credit for the license switch, I hope I contributed a little bit to it, because today I’m happy. I’m happy that Redis is open source software again, under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.

Now, time to go back to the terminal, to show Redis users some respect by writing the best code I’m able to write, and make Vector Sets more useful and practical: I have a few more ideas for improvements, and I hope that more will be stimulated by your feedback (it is already happening). Good hacking!

P.S. Redis 8, the first version of Redis with the new license, is also GA today, with a many new features and speed improvements of the core: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/">https://redis.io/blog/redis-8-ga/</a>

<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Vegetative electron microscopy began to appear more frequently in the 2020s. To find out why, we had to peer inside modern AI models – and do some archaeological digging through the vast layers of data they were trained on.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->

<!-- END single/mrec --><h2>The scale problem</h2><p>Finding errors of this sort is not easy. Fixing them may be almost impossible.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>One reason is scale. The CommonCrawl dataset, for example, is millions of gigabytes in size. For most researchers outside large tech companies, the computing resources required to work at this scale are inaccessible.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Another reason is a lack of transparency in commercial AI models. OpenAI and many other developers refuse to provide precise details about the training data for their models.

  <p><span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-30T11:15:00-04:00">April 30, 2025</span></p><div><p>I am excited to announce that one of my first actions as NIH Director is pushing the accelerator on policies to make NIH research findings freely and quickly available to the public. The 2024 Public Access Policy, originally slated to go into effect on December 31, 2025, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-101.html">will now be effective as of July 1, 2025</a>.</p>

<p>To be clear, maximum transparency regarding the research we support is our default position. Since the release of NIH’s 2008 Public Access Policy, more than 1.5 million articles reporting on NIH-supported research have been made freely available to the public through PubMed Central.&nbsp;While the 2008 Policy allowed for an up to 12-month delay before such articles were required to be made publicly available, in 2024, NIH revised the Public Access Policy to remove the embargo period so that researchers, students, and members of the public have rapid access to these findings.</p>

<p>NIH is the crown jewel of the American biomedical research system.&nbsp; However, a recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/">Pew Research Center study</a> shows that only about 25% of Americans have a “great deal of confidence” that scientists are working for the public good.&nbsp; Earlier implementation of the Public Access Policy will help increase public confidence in the research we fund while also ensuring that the investments made by taxpayers produce replicable, reproducible, and generalizable results that benefit all Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Providing speedy public access to NIH-funded results is just one of the ways we are working to earn back the trust of the American people. Trust in science is an essential element in Making America Healthy Again.&nbsp; As such, NIH and its research partners will continue to promote maximum transparency in all that we do.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Every day, our dedicated security and IT teams successfully repel a wide range of attacks from various bad actors. From our years of experience, we know how vast the attack vectors of any major company are. And as we’re disclosing today, they can include unexpected areas, such as the company’s recruitment process.</p>



<p>Our teams recently identified a North Korean hacker’s attempts to infiltrate our ranks by applying for a job at Kraken.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2vXHlnjKbBI?si=7jufdYZuCbe96Sm2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p><em>Watch CBS News’ full coverage of how Kraken identified — and then strategically interacted with — a North Korean hacker who tried to get a job at Kraken</em></p>



<p>What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role&nbsp;quickly turned into an intelligence gathering operation, as our teams carefully advanced the candidate through our hiring process to learn more about their tactics at every stage of the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an established challenge for the crypto community, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/north-korea-stole-over-659m-in-crypto-heists-during-2024-deploys-fake-job-seekers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimates</a> indicating that North Korean hackers stole over $650 million from crypto firms in 2024 alone. We’re disclosing these events today as part of our ongoing transparency efforts and to help companies, both in crypto and beyond, to strengthen their defenses.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-candidate-s-red-flags-nbsp"><strong>The candidate’s red flags&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>From the outset, something felt off about this candidate. During their initial call with our recruiter, they joined under a different name from the one on their resume, and quickly changed it. Even more suspicious, the candidate occasionally switched between voices, indicating that they were being coached through the interview in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before this interview, industry partners had tipped us off that North Korean hackers were actively applying for jobs at crypto companies. We received a list of email addresses linked to the hacker group, and one of them matched the email the candidate used to apply to Kraken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this intelligence in hand, our Red Team launched an investigation using Open-Source Intelligence gathering (OSINT) methods. One method involved analyzing breach data, which hackers often use to identify users with weak or reused passwords. In this instance, we discovered that one of the emails associated with the malicious candidate was part of a larger network of fake identities and aliases.</p>



<p>This meant that our team had uncovered a hacking operation where one individual had established multiple identities to apply for roles in the crypto space and beyond. Several of the names had previously been hired by multiple companies, as our team identified work-related email addresses linked to them. One identity in this network was also a known foreign agent on the sanctions list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-as-our-team-dug-deeper-into-the-candidate-s-history-and-credentials-technical-inconsistencies-emerged-nbsp">As our team dug deeper into the candidate’s history and credentials, technical inconsistencies emerged&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The candidate used remote colocated Mac desktops but interacted with other components through a VPN, a setup commonly deployed to hide location and network activity.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Their resume was linked to a GitHub profile containing an email address exposed in a past data breach.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The candidate’s primary form of ID appeared to be altered, likely using details stolen in an identity theft case two years prior.</li>
</ul>



<p>By this point, the evidence was clear, and our team was confident this wasn’t just a suspicious job applicant, but a state-sponsored infiltration attempt.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-turning-the-tables-how-our-team-responded"><strong>Turning the tables – how our team responded</strong></h2>



<p>Instead of tipping off the applicant, our security and recruitment teams strategically advanced them through our rigorous recruitment process – not to hire, but to study their approach. This meant putting them through multiple rounds of technical infosec tests and verification tasks, designed to extract key details about their identity and tactics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final round interview? A casual chemistry interview with Kraken’s Chief Security Officer (CSO) Nick Percoco and several other team members. What the candidate didn’t realize was that this was a trap – a subtle but deliberate test of their identity.</p>



<p>Between standard interview questions, our team slipped in two-factor authentication prompts, such as asking the candidate to verify their location, hold up a government-issued ID, and even recommend some local restaurants in the city they claimed to be in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point, the candidate unraveled. Flustered and caught off guard, they struggled with the basic verification tests, and couldn’t convincingly answer real-time questions about their city of residence or country of citizenship. By the end of the interview, the truth was clear: this was not a legitimate applicant, but an imposter attempting to infiltrate our systems.</p>



<p><strong>Commenting on the events, CSO Nick Percoco, said:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“Don’t trust, verify. This core crypto principle is more relevant than ever in the digital age. State-sponsored attacks aren’t just a crypto, or U.S. corporate, issue – they’re a global threat. Any individual or business handling value is a target, and resilience starts with operationally preparing to withstand these types of attacks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-key-takeaways"><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Not all attackers break in, some try to walk through the front door. As cyber threats evolve, so must our security strategies. A holistic, proactive approach is critical to protect an organization.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Generative AI is making deception easier, but isn’t foolproof. Attackers can trick parts of the hiring process, like a technical assessment, but genuine candidates will usually pass real-time, unprompted verification tests. Try to avoid patterns in the types of verification questions that hiring managers use.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>A culture of productive paranoia is key. Security isn’t just an IT responsibility. In the modern era, it’s an organizational mindset. By actively engaging this individual, we identified areas to strengthen our defenses against future infiltration attempts.</li>
</ul>



<p>The next time a suspicious job application comes through remember: Sometimes, the biggest threats come disguised as opportunities.</p>

<p>With the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., brain worms have gotten a bad rap.</p>
<p>A year ago, the long-time anti-vaccine advocate and current US health secretary famously told The New York Times that a parasitic worm "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html">got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died</a>." The startling revelation is now frequently referenced whenever Kennedy says something outlandish, false, or offensive—which is often. For those who have followed his anti-vaccine advocacy, it's frightfully clear that, worm-infested or not, Kennedy's brain is marinated in wild conspiracy theories and dangerous misinformation.</p>
<p>While it's certainly possible that worm remnants could impair brain function, it remains unknown if the worm is to blame for Kennedy's cognitive oddities. For one thing, he was also diagnosed with mercury poisoning, which can cause brain damage, too. As prominent infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said last June <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-585-dr-anthony-fauci/id1043593599?i=1000660407241">in a conversation</a> with political analyst David Axelrod: "I don't know what's going on in [Kennedy's] head, but it's not good."</p>
<p>The trouble is that now that Kennedy is the country's top health official, his warped ideas are contributing to the rise of a dystopian reality. Federal health agencies are spiraling into chaos, and critical public health services for Americans have been brutally slashed, dismantled, or knee-capped—from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/cdc-rocked-by-top-level-departures-loss-of-11-4b-in-covid-funding/">infectious disease responses</a>, the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-hhs-layoffs-cdc-lead-poisoning/">lead poisoning team</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/01/g-s1-57716/hhs-layoffs-seniors-disabled-liheap-acl">Meals on Wheels</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/19/cdc-cuts-maternal-mortality-fertility/">maternal health programs</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/14/cdc-closing-office-smoking-health-called-gift-to-big-tobacco-by-former-osh-director/">anti-smoking initiatives</a>, just to name a few. The health of the nation is at stake; the struggle to understand what goes on in Kennedy's head is vital.</p>
<p>While we may never have definitive answers on his cognitive situation, one thing is plain: Kennedy's thoughts and actions make a lot more sense when you realize he doesn't believe in a foundational scientific principle: germ theory.</p>

<h2>Dueling theories</h2>
<p>Germ theory is, of course, the 19th-century proven idea that microscopic germs—pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi—cause disease. It supplanted the leading explanation of disease at the time, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1121911/">the miasma theory</a>, which suggests that diseases are caused by <em>miasma</em>, that is, noxious mists and vapors, or simply bad air arising from decaying matter, such as corpses, sewage, or rotting vegetables. While the miasma theory was abandoned, it is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/miasma-theory">credited with spurring improvements in sanitation and hygiene</a>—which, of course, improve health because they halt the spread of germs, the cause of diseases.</p>
<p>Germ theory also knocks back a lesser-known idea called the terrain theory, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/deep-dive-into-stupid-meet-the-growing-group-that-rejects-germ-theory/">we've covered before</a>. This is a somewhat ill-defined theory that generally suggests diseases stem from imbalances in the internal "terrain" of the body, such as malnutrition or the presence of toxic substances. The theory is linked to ideas by French scientist Antoine Béchamp and French physiologist Claude Bernard.</p>
<p>Béchamp, considered a bitter crank and rival to famed French microbiologist Louis Pasteur, is perhaps best known for wrongly suggesting the basic unit of organisms is not the cell, but nonexistent microanatomical elements he called "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Th%C3%A9orie-Microzyma-Syst%C3%A8me-Microbien-French/dp/1148133852">microzyma</a>." While the idea was <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8343086/#:~:text=Antoine%20Bechamp%2C%20a%20vocal%20rival,of%20highly%20personalized%2C%20precision%20medicine.">largely ignored by the scientific community</a>, Béchamp suggested that disruptions to microzyma are a predisposition to disease, as is the state of the body's "terrain." French physiologist Claude Bernard, meanwhile, came up with an idea of balance or stability of the body's internal environment (<em>milieu intérieur</em>), which was a precursor to the concept of homeostasis. Ideas from the two figures came together to create an ideology that has been enthusiastically adopted by modern-day germ theory denialists, including Kennedy.</p>
<p>It's important to note here that our understanding of Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory isn't based on speculation or deduction; it's based on Kennedy's own words. He wrote an entire section on it in his 2021 book vilifying Fauci, titled <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Anthony_Fauci">The Real Anthony Fauci</a>.</em> The section is titled "Miasma vs. Germ Theory," in the chapter "The White Man's Burden."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But, we did reach out to Health and Human Services to ask how Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory influences his policy decisions. HHS did not respond.</p>
<h2>Kennedy’s beliefs</h2>
<p>In the chapter, Kennedy promotes the "miasma theory" but gets the definition completely wrong. Instead of actual miasma theory, he describes something more like terrain theory. He writes: "'Miasma theory' emphasizes preventing disease by fortifying the immune system through nutrition and by reducing exposures to environmental toxins and stresses."</p>
<p>Kennedy contrasts his erroneous take on miasma theory with germ theory, which he derides as a tool of the pharmaceutical industry and pushy scientists to justify selling modern medicines. The abandonment of miasma theory, Kennedy bemoans, realigned health and medical institutions to "the pharmaceutical paradigm that emphasized targeting particular germs with specific drugs rather than fortifying the immune system through healthy living, clean water, and good nutrition."</p>
<p>According to Kennedy, germ theory gained popularity, not because of the undisputed evidence supporting it, but by "mimicking the traditional explanation for disease—demon possession—giving it a leg up over miasma."</p>
<p>To this day, Kennedy writes, a "$1 trillion pharmaceutical industry pushing patented pills, powders, pricks, potions, and poisons, and the powerful professions of virology and vaccinology led by 'Little Napoleon' himself, Anthony Fauci, fortify the century-old predominance of germ theory."</p>
<p>In all, the chapter provides a clear explanation of why Kennedy relentlessly attacks evidence-based medicines; vilifies the pharmaceutical industry; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/">suggests HIV doesn't cause AIDS and antidepressants are behind mass shootings</a>; believes that vaccines are harmful, not protective; claims <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/top-10-moments-of-rfk-jr-s-reality-bending-confirmation-hearings/">5G wireless networks cause cancer</a>; suggests chemicals in water are changing children's gender identities; and is quick to promote supplements to prevent and treat diseases, such as recently recommending vitamin A for measles and falsely claiming children who die from the viral infection are malnourished.</p>

    <div>
          
          

<h2>A religious conviction</h2>
<p>For some experts, the chapter was like a light bulb going on. "I thought 'it now all makes sense'... I mean, it all adds up," Paul Offit, pediatrician and infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told Ars Technica. It's still astonishing, though, he added. "It's so unbelievable, because you can't imagine that someone who's the head of Health and Human Services doesn't believe that specific viruses or bacteria cause specific diseases, and that the prevention or treatment of them is lifesaving."</p>
<p>Offit has a dark history with Kennedy. Around 20 years ago, Kennedy called Offit out of the blue to talk with him about vaccine safety. Offit knows a lot about it—he's not only an expert on vaccines, he's the <a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/diseases/rotavirus">co-inventor of one</a>. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14760258/">The vaccine he co-developed</a>, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/rotateq">RotaTeq</a>, protects against rotaviruses, which cause deadly diarrheal disease in young children and killed an <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/routine-vaccines-extraordinary-impact-rotavirus">estimated 500,000 people worldwide each year</a> before vaccines were available. RotaTeq has been proven safe and effective and is credited with <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2696431">saving tens of thousands of lives</a> around the world each year.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Offit spent about an hour talking, mostly about thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative that was once used in childhood vaccines but was mostly abandoned by 2001 as a precautionary measure. RotaTeq doesn't and never did contain thimerosal—because it's a live, attenuated viral vaccine, it doesn't contain any preservatives. But Kennedy has frequently used thimerosal as a vaccine bogeyman over the years, claiming it causes harms (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html">there is no evidence for this</a>).</p>
<p>After their conversation, Kennedy published a story in Rolling Stone and Salon.com titled "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_Immunity">Deadly Immunity</a>," which erroneously argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism. The article was riddled with falsehoods and misleading statements. It described Offit as "<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/robert-f-kennedy-jr-vaccine-misinformation-20240530.html">in the pocket</a>" of the pharmaceutical industry and claimed RotaTeq was "laced" with thimerosal. Rolling Stone and Salon amended some of the article's problems, but eventually Salon retracted it and Rolling Stone deleted it.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Looking back, Offit said he was <a href="https://pauloffit.substack.com/p/my-conversation-with-robert-f-kennedy">sandbagged</a>. "He's a liar. He lied about who he was; he lied about what he was doing. He was just wanting to set me up," Offit said.</p>
<p>Although that was the only time they had ever spoken, Kennedy has continued to disparage and malign Offit over the years. In his book dedicated to denigrating Fauci, Kennedy spends plenty of time spitting insults at Offit, calling him a "font of wild industry ballyhoo, prevarication, and outright fraud." He also makes the wildly false claim that RotaTeq "almost certainly kills and injures more children in the United States than the rotavirus disease."</p>
<h2>Inconvincible</h2>
<p>Understanding that Kennedy is a germ theory denialist and terrain theory embracer makes these attacks easier to understand—though no less abhorrent or dangerous.</p>
<p>"He holds these beliefs like a religious conviction," Offit said. "There is no shaking him from that," regardless of how much evidence there is to prove him wrong. "If you're trying to talk him out of something that he holds with a religious conviction—that's never going to happen. And so any time anybody disagrees with him, he goes, 'Well, of course, they're just in the pocket of industry; that's why they say that.'"</p>
<p>There are some aspects of terrain theory that do have a basis in reality. Certainly, underlying medical conditions—which could be considered a disturbed bodily "terrain"—can make people more vulnerable to disease. And, with recent advances in understanding the microbiome, it has become clear that imbalances in the microbial communities in our gastrointestinal tracts can also predispose people to infections.</p>
<p>But, on the whole, the evidence against terrain theory is obvious and all around us. Terrain theorists consider disease a symptom of an unhealthy internal state, suggesting that anyone who gets sick is unhealthy and that all disease-causing germs are purely opportunistic. This is nonsense: Plenty of people fall ill while being otherwise healthy. And many germs are dedicated pathogens, with evolved, specialized virulence strategies such as toxins, and advanced defense mechanisms such as antibacterial resistance. They are not opportunists.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>(There are some terrain theory devotees who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/germtheory.vs.terraintheory/posts/9795477983862455/">do not believe in the existence of microbes at all</a>—but Kennedy seems to accept that bacteria and viruses are real.)</p>

<h2>Terrain theory applied</h2>
<p>Terrain theory's clash with reality has become painfully apparent amid Kennedy's handling—or more accurately, mishandling—of the current measles situation in the US.</p>
<p>Most health experts would consider the current measles situation in the US akin to a five-alarm fire. An outbreak that began at the end of January in West Texas is now the largest and deadliest the country has seen in a quarter-century. Three people have died, including two unvaccinated young children who were otherwise healthy. The outbreak has spread to at least three other states, which also have undervaccinated communities where the virus can thrive. There's no sign of the outbreak slowing, and the nation's overall case count is on track to be the highest since the mid-1990s, before measles was declared eliminated in 2000. Modeling indicates the country will lose its elimination status and that measles will once again become endemic in the US.</p>
<p>Given the situation, one might expect a vigorous federal response—one dominated by strong and clear promotion of the highly effective, safe measles vaccine. But of course, that's not the case.</p>
<p>"When those first two little girls died of measles in West Texas, he said immediately—RFK Jr.—that they were malnourished. It was the doctors that stood up and said 'No, they had no risk factors. They were perfectly well-nourished,'" Offit points out.</p>
<p>Kennedy has also heavily pushed the use of vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin that accumulates in the body and can become toxic with large or prolonged doses. It does not prevent measles and is mainly used as supportive care for measles in low-income countries where vitamin A deficiency is common. Nevertheless, vaccine-hesitant communities in Texas have embraced it, leading to reports from doctors that they have had to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/04/04/texas-vitamin-a-toxicity-measles-patients/82871895007/">treat children for vitamin A toxicity</a>.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>Poisons</h2>
<p>Despite the raging outbreak, Kennedy spent part of last week drumming up fanfare for a rickety plan to rid American foods of artificial food dyes, which are accused of making sugary processed foods more appealing to kids, in addition to posing their own health risks. It's part of his larger effort to improve Americans' nutrition, a tenet of terrain theory. Though Kennedy has organized zero news briefings on the measles outbreak, he appeared at a jubilant press conference on removing the dyes.</p>
<p>The conference was complete with remarks from people who seem to share similar beliefs as Kennedy, including famed pseudoscience-peddler Vani Hari, aka "Food Babe," and alternative-medicine guru and fad diet promoter Mark Hyman. Wellness mogul and special government employee Cally Meads also took to the podium to give a fury-filled speech in which he claimed that 90 percent of FDA's spending is because we are "poisoning our children," echoing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/11/15/rfk-jr-views-conspiracies-false-claims/">a claim Kennedy has also made</a>.</p>
<p>Kennedy, for his part, declared that "sugar is poison," though he acknowledged that the FDA can't ban it. While the conference was intended to celebrate the removal of artificial food dyes, he also acknowledged that there is no ban, nor forthcoming regulations, or even an agreement with food companies to remove the dyes. Kennedy instead said he simply had "an understanding" with food companies. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary explained the plan by saying: "I believe in love, and let’s start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes." Bloomberg reported the next day that food industry lobbyists said <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/food-industry-says-there-s-no-agreement-with-hhs-to-cut-dyes">there is no agreement to remove the dyes</a>.</p>
<p>However feeble the move, a focus on banning colorful cereal during a grave infectious disease outbreak makes a lot of sense if you know that Kennedy is a germ theory denialist.</p>
<p>But then again, there's also the brain worm.</p>

                    	<p>My fellow Vanguard investor,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fifty years ago today, Jack Bogle started a different kind of investment firm—one owned by its investors, ensuring a focus on making money for them, not from them.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <div>
                        <p><b>John C. Bogle:</b> What made Vanguard different from everybody else in this industry was the structure that I picked in the first place, way back in 1974. We are owned by the shareholders. Our mission is to serve them and not some outside management company owner.</p>
<p>And I don't think it's self-serving to say that we are a company that is of the shareholder, by the shareholder, and for the shareholder, with a crew that understands that and implements it really quite beautifully.</p>
<p>People are the key to everything we do and everything we ever have done. I've often talked about human beings being the hallmark of this operation—people that care about our values, people that care about our integrity, each with their own hopes and fears and financial goals.</p>

                    </div>

                </p></div>

<div>
                    	<p>Vanguard was founded on the ideal that all investors deserve a fair shake—that investing ought to be lower-cost and more accessible. Bogle’s idealism was audacious at the time. In 1975, investing was reserved for the very wealthy and was stubbornly expensive, and the U.S. stock market was down by half over the prior couple years.</p>
<p>The "Vanguard experiment" did not take off right away, but as generations of crew persistently took action to bring us closer to our founding ideals, more people were attracted to what we had to offer. Today, more than 50 million investors have entrusted Vanguard with their financial hopes—a responsibility we embrace with great care.</p>
<p>I am writing first to thank you for your trust in Vanguard. It is a trust that demands our constant effort, especially given the market fluctuations this year. So, I also want to highlight actions we are taking to serve your needs today and for the long term. Finally, I offer our unwavering commitment that Vanguard will always be your firm, one that takes a stand for your needs and where our focus is on your long-term investment success.&nbsp;</p>

                <h5><p><a id="02"></a>Lowering cost matters to performance – in index and active portfolios</p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p>One of Bogle’s contrarian insights was that in investing, you get what you <i>don’t</i> pay for. The less you pay for your funds, the more you keep. A benefit of being a Vanguard investor-owner is that as we realize greater economies of scale, we pass those savings on to you through lower fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is why <b>Vanguard has reduced expense ratios more than two thousand times.</b> Our relentless focus on fees is also why this February we announced the largest expense ratio cuts in our history—we expect our U.S. investors to save more than $350 million this year alone.<sup>2</sup> The Vanguard Effect has also spurred price competition across the industry, as our low-cost offerings draw attention to the importance of fees to long-term results.</p>

<div>
                    <p>Bogle’s insight was contrarian because lower cost portfolios tend to outperform higher cost ones—in index and active.<sup>4</sup> Skilled, low-fee active managers can be more prudent and disciplined than higher-fee managers who can feel compelled to take on greater risk to offset their higher fees. This is the main reason why Vanguard’s index and active funds have outperformed over the past decade.</p>

</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p>If the market turmoil of the past few months has highlighted one thing, it is the importance of diversification—especially between stocks and bonds. Bonds can be sound diversifiers and, as <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/vemo/vemo-return-forecasts.html" target="_self">Vanguard’s long-term outlook</a> indicates, they can be good sources of return and income—which is especially important if you are retired.</p>
<p>The bond market is significantly larger than the stock market and much more complex and inefficient, providing greater opportunities for active management to outperform. But competitors’ fees for active fixed income have remained persistently high. You deserve a better deal.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>At Vanguard we have been managing fixed income portfolios for forty years. Our combination of high skill and low fees (a quarter of the industry average) has resulted in <b>92% of our active fixed income funds outperforming</b> their peer group averages over the last 10 years.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>You also deserve a better deal on cash savings. Vanguard’s money market funds already provide strong performance at low fees but, you probably also hold traditional savings accounts—whether for the convenience of paying bills or FDIC insurance. But the typical savings account yields less than half a percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing we could do far better than that, we launched our Cash Plus offer. At present, it pays 3.65%, nearly 9x what you could earn with the average savings account, and it includes features like the ability to pay bills and FDIC insurance.<sup>8</sup> In two years, a Cash Plus account with a $10,000 balance could have earned nearly $1,000 more with our bank sweep program than with a traditional bank savings account.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Beyond extending The Vanguard Effect to fixed income and cash, we are expanding our long-standing alliances with third-party managers to provide better access to institutional-quality private assets and guaranteed income solutions — as we believe they can play a role in certain long-term portfolios. We are at work developing solutions for your needs and will have more to announce on that front later this year.</p>

<p>11 Vanguard received the first overall ranking in Morningstar's 2025 "Robo-Advisor Report" among 15 other robo-advisors selected by Morningstar. Morningstar evaluated each provider across the following weighted criteria as of December 2024, to determine their rankings: total price (30%); the process used to select investments, construct portfolios, and match portfolios with investors (30%); the parent organization behind the digital platform (20%); and breadth of services (20%). Additional details about Morningstar's methodology are available on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/specials/your-guide-to-getting-started-with-robo-investing" target="_blank"><b>website</b></a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/specials/your-guide-to-getting-started-with-robo-investing" target="_blank"><b>https://www.morningstar.com/specials/your-guide-to-getting-started-with-robo-investing</b></a>). Current fees may vary for Vanguard advisory services and the other robo-advisors considered. Although Vanguard compensates Morningstar for marketing services, Morningstar's opinions and evaluations are independent and unrelated to the selection of Vanguard for this ranking. Following the independent announcement of this ranking, Vanguard purchased a license from Morningstar for the right to include this rating in Vanguard marketing.

<p>12 According to Cerulli research, the industry average asset-based advisory fee ranges from 1.25% for a client with $100,000 in investable assets to 0.67% for a client with $10 million. Advisory fees exclude products’ embedded management fees and are self-reported by advisors. Source: Cerulli Associates.

<p>Vanguard Personal Advisor Select and Vanguard Personal Advisor Wealth Management charge fees based on a tiered fee schedule (maximum 0.30%) calculated as an average advisory fee on all advised assets. Vanguard Digital Advisor charges Vanguard Brokerage Accounts an annual gross advisory fee of 0.20% for its all-index investment options and 0.25% for an active/index mix. Vanguard Personal Advisor charges Vanguard Brokerage Accounts an annual gross advisory fee of 0.35% for its all-index investment options and 0.40% for an active/index mix. Vanguard Digital Advisor and Vanguard Personal Advisor reduce those fees by the amount of revenue that Vanguard (or a Vanguard affiliate) retains from your portfolio in order to calculate your net&nbsp;advisory fee. Note that this fee doesn't include investment expense ratios charged by a fund, such as fees paid to the funds' third-party managers which are not credited. While we generally recommend using low-cost Vanguard funds to build your portfolio, actively managed funds will have higher expense ratios than index funds. Please review each service's advisory brochure for more fee information. You should consult your plan fee disclosure notice for the applicable annual gross advisory fees that apply to your 401(k) account.</p>

                        <p><b>For more information about Vanguard funds, visit vanguard.com to obtain a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.</b></p>
<p>All investing is subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.</p>
<p>Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time, and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vanguard is reducing expense ratios for certain share classes of some funds. There is no guarantee that any individual investor will save money due to the reductions in fund expense ratios. Not all fund share classes will have a reduced expense ratio and therefore not all investors will experience the estimated savings. Investors that purchase the relevant funds after the expense ratios have been reduced will not experience savings. Savings means future money not spent on expense ratios and does not entail a rebate or deposit of any sort. Savings figures are estimates and should not be relied upon. Savings is based on data as of November 30, 2024; if other data is used, savings may differ. Estimated savings accrue to existing investors holding relevant share classes for 2024 and 2025. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Vanguard Cash Plus Account is a brokerage account offered by Vanguard Brokerage Services, a division of Vanguard Marketing Corporation, member FINRA and SIPC. Under the Sweep Program, Eligible Balances swept to Program Banks are not securities: they are not covered by SIPC, but are eligible for FDIC insurance, subject to applicable limits. Money market funds held in the account are not guaranteed or insured by the FDIC, but are securities eligible for SIPC coverage.

<p>Savings accounts may have characteristics that differentiate them from bank sweep programs offered by Vanguard Cash Plus. For example, they may offer overdraft protection, ATM access (immediate access to your money), and other convenience features. Each company's products differ, so it's important to ask questions to understand account features.</p>

</p><p>In 1991, which preceded the last year that demonstrations were held in Red Square, International Workers' Day grew into high-spirited political action. Around 50,000 people participated in a rally in Red Square in 1991 after which the tradition was interrupted for 13 years. In the early post-Soviet period the holiday turned into massive political gatherings of supporters of radically minded politicians. For instance, an action dubbed as "a rally of communist-oriented organisations" was held in Red Square in 1992. The rally began with performance of the Soviet Union anthem and raising the Red Flag and ended with appeals from the leader of opposition movement Working Moscow, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Anpilov" title="Viktor Anpilov">Viktor Anpilov</a>, "for early dismissal of President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" title="Boris Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a>, ousting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Mayor" title="Moscow Mayor">Moscow Mayor</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavriil_Kharitonovich_Popov" title="Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov">Gavriil Popov</a> from power and putting the latter on trial". Since 1992, International Workers' Day is officially called "Spring and Labor Day", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia.

The crowd was the biggest in Turkish workers' history with the number of people approximating 500,000. In the next two years, provocations and confusion continued and peaked before the 1980 coup d'état. The 1 May holiday was cancelled after the coup d'état. Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces.

<li id="cite_note-22"><span><b><a href="#cite_ref-22">^</a></b></span> <span>I saw a man, whom I afterwards identified as Fielding [<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>], standing on a truck wagon at the corner of what is known as Crane's Alley. I raised my baton and, in a loud voice, ordered them to disperse as peaceable citizens. I also called upon three persons in the crowd to assist in dispersing the mob. Fielding got down from the wagon, saying at the time, "We are peaceable," as he uttered the last word, I heard a terrible explosion behind where I was standing, followed almost instantly by an irregular volley of pistol shots in our front and from the sidewalk on the east side of the street, which was immediately followed by regular and well directed volleys from the police and which was kept up for several minutes. I then ordered the injured men brought to the stations and sent for surgeons to attend to their injuries. After receiving the necessary attention most of the injured officers were removed to the County Hospital and I highly appreciate the manner in which they were received by Warden McGarrigle who did all in his power to make them comfortable as possible.<sup id="cite_ref-William_Ward,_Capt._3rd_Prect_report_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-William_Ward,_Capt._3rd_Prect_report-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></span>

Subsequently, the authorities failed to rationally justify such a decision: the movement took place in the direction <i>from</i> the city center. The version that "the demonstrators are going to smash Gorbachev's dacha" remained unconfirmed.<br>The demonstrators, who were moving along Leninsky Avenue from Oktyabrskaya Square, noticing the truck barriers, as well as the cordon of police officers and OMON, reorganized, putting forward a vanguard of 500–600 people, the most organized part of which was the squad of the National Salvation Front. A few tens of meters before the cordon, the column stepped up and almost immediately broke through the cordon.<br>See the cited report by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_(society)" title="Memorial (society)">Memorial</a>.</span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Ok, two quick pieces of good news. The first is that a judge in Northern California, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, issued a very harsh rebuke to Apple over its control of the iPhone app store. The order is part of a long-standing antitrust case brought by Epic Games against Apple </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war" rel="">in 2020</a><span>.</span></p><p>In 2021, Epic Games lost on the Federal antitrust charges, but won on a state claim of unfair conduct, specifically over its refusal to let app developers communicate with or give consumers a place outside of the app store to pay for apps. The judge found that Apple’s conduct “allowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins,” and ordered it to let app developers communicate with customers and buy apps outside the App store. The case went on appeal, with the Ninth Circuit upholding the decision and order. In January of 2024, the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal, and Gonzalez Rogers’s order went into effect. </p><p><span>Since then, Apple has engaged in bad faith tactics to avoid complying.  Today, Gonzalez Rogers sanctioned the company and </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf" rel="">ordered</a><span> Apple to allow app developers to sell their apps outside of the App Store without a fee. That’s a huge deal. For some context, the New York Times says </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/technology/apple-epic-app-store-ruling.html" rel="">that app store fees</a><span> “makes up a large portion of the nearly $100 billion in annual services revenue that Apple collects.”</span></p><p>Epic’s CEO was jubilant, explaining what the decision means.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png" width="960" height="918" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:918,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:652379,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/162582632?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6f6ebb9-b1f8-4635-8d82-44dad5c32227_960x918.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>That’s not all. For a year and a half, Apple has engaged in bad faith, levying a variety of different and new fees to app developers to get around the spirit of the judicial order. It put up scare screens, engaged in sleazy privilege claims, and lied under oath to the judge about its decision-making. Normally these kinds of tactics happen without consequence for important business executives. But this time, the judge accused Apple Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, of having “outright lied under oath,” and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for a criminal contempt investigation. She also went out of her way to blame Apple CEO Tim Cook directly.</p><p>It’s really worth reading these two full paragraphs of the judge’s decision.</p><blockquote><p>In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein, more than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a violation. The Court refers the matter to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.</p><p>This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases</p></blockquote><p><span>Now that is brutal. Apple says it </span><a href="http://Judge Rules Apple Executive Lied Under Oath, and Seeks Criminal Contempt Investigation" rel="">will comply</a><span>, though it will also appeal the decision. That means tomorrow, developers will have a bunch of new options for how to sell apps; the whole app economy could change if the Ninth Circuit doesn’t issue a stay of the order, meaning that this decision is the first time we’ll see a big tech remedy in an antitrust case actually make a serious real-world difference</span></p><p>And here’s a headline that puts a fine point on what happened.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg" width="1170" height="658" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/da96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:658,&quot;width&quot;:1170,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda96f910-8e48-4155-bac3-1d7b034dfccc_1170x658.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>And now on to the second piece of good news. On Monday, I traced a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/house-gop-proposes-eliminating-key" rel="">proposal</a><span> from Republican leader Jim Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, to eliminate a key antitrust law, which is the Federal Trade Commission’s authority to ban “unfair methods of competition.” That’s the authority used in several important cases, including one involving Amazon, another targeting UnitedHealth Group and CVS, as well as a seed and chemical case where the defendants are Corteva and Syngenta. The committee hearing was today, and Jordan ultimately pulled the proposal.</span></p><p><span>Jordan was seeking to hide a significant change to antitrust underneath a procedural shift. His legislation would have merged the FTC’s competition division into the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, which sounds like some boring bureaucratic reshuffling, bit it’s not. The trick however, is though both enforcers apply the Sherman and Clayton Act, they also have different authorities. The FTC can go beyond the Sherman and Clayton Act, barring “unfair methods of competition” that don’t quite meet the standards of the other antitrust laws. And when Jordan put out text folding the FTC staff and resources into the Antitrust Division, he </span><em>didn’t </em><span>move the FTC’s extra authority to the Antitrust Division. So it was a tricky way to kill this authority, and harm the cases based on it.</span></p><p>In other words, it was a sneak attack. It makes sense why he’d try it this way; changing antitrust law is very hard. You need to pass it out of the House of Representatives with a majority, and then get 60 votes in the Senate. Jordan’s approach was to short-circuit this path by attaching this legislation to the much bigger tax cut bill moving forward, the hope being no one would really notice. Such an approach had two advantages. First, while individual Congressmen might not like each particular component of such a bill, most wouldn’t sink the whole thing over a shift of this authority. And second, the tax bill, for boring reasons, only requires 50 votes in the Senate.</p><p>Jim Jordan is a conservative Republican leader who is very well-respected on the right. But in this case, he stepped on a rake. Our work set off a bit of a firestorm. First, a host of former antitrust enforcers expressed concern, pointing out that the legislation wasn’t just a harmless set of seating chart changes. Naturally, the Democrats were not on board with rolling back antitrust law and weakening the FTC, with Congresswomen Becca Balint and Pramila Jayapal speaking out in the committee markup. That was important, though expected. </p><p><span>What was *not* expected was opposition from populist right and small business groups. Yesterday, Steve Bannon went on his show </span><a href="https://rumble.com/BannonsWarRoom" rel="">War Room</a><span> with Mike Davis, a conservative anti-big tech foe. The two of them absolutely laid into Jordan for taking the side of firms like Meta and Google, and in their view undermining the Trump antitrust agenda. A lot of War Room listeners presumably called into Republican offices.</span></p><p>But that’s not all. There are a lot of business people, like pharmacists, app developers, grocers, and farmers who are reliant on the increasingly active antitrust enforcement regime. And some of them no doubt started getting into contact with GOP members on the committee. It’s rare for trade associations to move particularly quickly, but the National Grocers Association, which leads a coalition seeking to revive price discrimination laws, put out a note of concern.  </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png" width="948" height="972" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:972,&quot;width&quot;:948,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:214363,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/162582632?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc00799ea-53c8-4aab-8ca0-4fc57faae9e0_948x972.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Anyway, the net effect is that today, at the committee markup, Jordan quietly announced some technical changes to the bill.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" tabindex="-1"> <article>   <p>I store a lot of data in SQLite databases on remote servers, and I often want to copy them to my local machine for analysis or backup.</p> <p>When I’m starting a new project and the database is near-empty, this is a simple rsync operation:</p> <div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>rsync <span>--progress</span> username@server:my_remote_database.db my_local_database.db
</code></pre></div> <p>As the project matures and the database grows, this gets slower and less reliable. Downloading a 250MB database from my web server takes about a minute over my home Internet connection, and that’s pretty small – most of my databases are multiple gigabytes in size.</p> <p>I’ve been trying to make these copies go faster, and I recently discovered a neat trick.</p> <p>What really slows me down is my indexes. I have a lot of indexes in my SQLite databases, which dramatically speed up my queries, but also make the database file larger and slower to copy. (In one database, there’s an index which single-handedly accounts for half the size on disk!)</p> <p>The indexes don’t store anything unique – they just duplicate data from other tables to make queries faster. Copying the indexes makes the transfer less efficient, because I’m copying the same data multiple times. I was thinking about ways to skip copying the indexes, and I realised that SQLite has built-in tools to make this easy.</p> <h2 id="dumping-a-database-as-a-text-file">Dumping a database as a text file</h2> <p>SQLite allows you to <a href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html#converting_an_entire_database_to_a_text_file">dump a database as a text file</a>. If you use the <code>.dump</code> command, it prints the entire database as a series of SQL statements. This text file can often be significantly smaller than the original database.</p> <p>Here’s the command:</p> <div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>sqlite3 my_database.db .dump <span>&gt;</span> my_database.db.txt
</code></pre></div> <p>And here’s what the beginning of that file looks like:</p> <div><pre><code><span>PRAGMA</span> <span>foreign_keys</span><span>=</span><span>OFF</span><span>;</span>
<span>BEGIN</span> <span>TRANSACTION</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"tags"</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>[</span><span>name</span><span>]</span> <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
   <span>[</span><span>count_uses</span><span>]</span> <span>INTEGER</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>tags</span> <span>VALUES</span><span>(</span><span>'carving'</span><span>,</span><span>260</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>tags</span> <span>VALUES</span><span>(</span><span>'grass'</span><span>,</span><span>743</span><span>);</span>
<span>…</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>Crucially, this reduces the large and disk-heavy indexes into a single line of text – it’s an instruction to create an index, not the index itself.</p> <div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>[</span><span>idx_photo_locations</span><span>]</span>
    <span>ON</span> <span>[</span><span>photos</span><span>]</span> <span>([</span><span>longitude</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>latitude</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>This means that I’m only storing each value once, rather than the many times it may be stored across the original table and my indexes. This is how the text file can be smaller than the original database.</p> <p>If you want to reconstruct the database, you pipe this text file back to SQLite:</p> <div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>cat </span>my_database.db.txt | sqlite3 my_reconstructed_database.db
</code></pre></div> <p>Because the SQL statements are very repetitive, this text responds well to compression:</p> <div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>sqlite3 explorer.db .dump | <span>gzip</span> <span>-c</span> <span>&gt;</span> explorer.db.txt.gz
</code></pre></div> <p>To give you an idea of the potential savings, here’s the relative disk size for one of my databases.</p> <table id="sizes"> <tbody><tr> <th>File</th> <th>Size on disk</th> </tr> <tr> <td>original SQLite database</td> <td title="7,081,912&nbsp;bytes">3.4 GB</td> </tr> <tr> <td>text file (<code>sqlite3 my_database.db .dump</code>)</td> <td title="2,785,408&nbsp;bytes">1.3 GB</td> </tr> <tr> <td>gzip-compressed text (<code>sqlite3 my_database.db .dump | gzip -c</code>)</td> <td title="491,904&nbsp;bytes">240 MB</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The gzip-compressed text file is 14× smaller than the original SQLite database – that makes downloading the database much faster.</p> <h2 id="my-new-sshrsync-command">My new ssh+rsync command</h2> <p>Rather than copying the database directly, now I create a gzip-compressed text file on the server, copy that to my local machine, and reconstruct the database. Like so:</p> <div><pre><code><span># Create a gzip-compressed text file on the server</span>
ssh username@server <span>"sqlite3 my_remote_database.db .dump | gzip -c &gt; my_remote_database.db.txt.gz"</span>

<span># Copy the gzip-compressed text file to my local machine</span>
rsync <span>--progress</span> username@server:my_remote_database.db.txt.gz my_local_database.db.txt.gz

<span># Remove the gzip-compressed text file from my server</span>
ssh username@server <span>"rm my_remote_database.db.txt.gz"</span>

<span># Uncompress the text file</span>
<span>gunzip </span>my_local_database.db.txt.gz

<span># Reconstruct the database from the text file</span>
<span>cat </span>my_local_database.db.txt | sqlite3 my_local_database.db

<span># Remove the local text file</span>
<span>rm </span>my_local_database.db.txt
</code></pre></div> <h2 id="a-database-dump-is-a-stable-copy-source">A database dump is a stable copy source</h2> <p>This approach fixes another issue I’ve had when copying SQLite databases.</p> <p>If it takes a long time to copy a database and it gets updated midway through, rsync may give me an invalid database file. The first half of the file is pre-update, the second half file is post-update, and they don’t match. When I try to open the database locally, I get an error:</p> <div><pre><code>database disk image is malformed
</code></pre></div> <p>By creating a text dump before I start the copy operation, I’m giving rsync a stable copy source. That text dump isn’t going to change midway through the copy, so I’ll always get a complete and consistent text file.</p> <hr> <p>This approach has saved me hours when working with large databases, and made my downloads both faster and more reliable. If you have to copy around large SQLite databases, give it a try.</p> </article> </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/29/north_korea_worker_interview_questions/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/29/north_korea_worker_interview_questions/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43853382">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>RSAC</span> Concerned a new recruit might be a North Korean stooge out to steal intellectual property and then hit an org with malware? There is an answer, for the moment at least.</p>
<p>According to Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike's senior veep in the counter adversary division, North Korean infiltrators are bagging roles worldwide throughout the year. Thousands are said to have <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-north-korean-workers-infiltrated-110000417.html">infiltrated</a> the Fortune 500.</p>
<p>They're masking IPs, exporting laptop farms to America so they can connect into those machines and appear to be working from the USA, and they are using AI – but there's a question during job interviews that never fails to catch them out and forces them to drop out of the recruitment process.</p>

    

<p>"My favorite interview question, because we've interviewed quite a few of these folks, is something to the effect of 'How fat is Kim Jong Un?' They terminate the call instantly, because it's not worth it to say something negative about that," he <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://path.rsaconference.com/flow/rsac/us25/FullAgenda/page/catalog/session/1728070288065001o6bO">told</a> a panel session at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/special_features/spotlight_on_rsac/">RSA Conference</a> in San Francisco Monday.</p>

        


        

<p>Meyers explained the North Koreans will use generative AI to develop bulk batches of LinkedIn profiles and applications for remote work jobs that appeal to Western companies. During an interview, multiple teams will work on the technical challenges that are part of the interview while the "front man" handles the physical side of the interview, although sometimes rather ineptly.</p>
<p>"One of the things that we've noted is that you'll have a person in Poland applying with a very complicated name," he recounted, "and then when you get them on Zoom calls it's a military age male Asian who can't pronounce it." But it works enough that quite a few score the job and millions of dollars are being funneled back to North Korea via this route.</p>

        

<p>Once placed in the coveted role, such workers are usually very successful in the company, since they have multiple people working on one job to produce the best work possible - with the hope of getting a promotion and more access to the business' systems - explained panelist FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Pelker.</p>
<p>"I think more often than not, I get the comment of 'Oh, but Johnny is our best performer. Do we actually need to fire him?" she said.</p>
<p>The aims of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/dprk-it-workers-expanding-scope-scale">these phony workers</a> are two-fold, she explained. Firstly, they earn a wage and use their access to steal intellectual property from the victim. This is usually exfiltrated in tiny chunks so as to not trigger security systems.</p>

        

<p>One mitigation strategy, she said, was to insist that any interviewee performed coding tests within the corporate environment. These allow the actual IP being used to get checked, interviewers to see how often the prospect is switching between screens, and can allow other clues to leak out that all is not as it seems.</p>
<p>If the interloper is exposed and fired, however, they will usually have already collected login details, planted unactivated malware, and will then attempt to extort the maximum they can from the victim. She urged anyone who spots a fake employee to contact their local FBI field office immediately.</p>
<h3>The Red Queen's race</h3>
<p>But the attackers are getting smarter, and in some ways the FBI is a victim of its own success.</p>
<p>The agency has been distributing <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123">advice</a> to US companies but these memos are also being read in Pyongyang and the workers are adapting their tactics. This sometimes involves using both aware and unwitting accomplices.</p>
<p>For example, to get around the IP address problem, laptop farms are springing up all over America. If an applicant gets a job, the firm will usually send him a laptop, at which point the interviewee explains that they've moved or have a family emergency, so could they send it to a new address please?</p>

</ul>
<p>This is most likely a laptop farm, where someone in the US agrees to run the laptop from a legitimate address for a fee, typically around $200 a computer, according to Meyers. Last year the FBI <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-north-korean-remote-it-worker-fraud-schemes-through-charges-and">busted</a> one such operation in Nashville, Tennessee, and charged the operator with conspiracy to cause damage to protected computers, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, intentional damage to protected computers, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to cause the unlawful employment of aliens.</p>
<p>Rather than creating identities, the North Korean workers have now taken to either stealing the ones they want, or fooling people into handing them over for a good cause. There's a growing business in Ukraine of convincing people to share their identity with third parties under the pretext of using them against Chinese agents who are propping up Russia.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, because this is supporting North Koreans, the money then goes back through to filter through to North Korea regime," said Chris Horne, senior director at jobs site Upworthy. "Then, in turn, it goes to support the troops that come back in through Russia. So they're basically paying for their own demise in Ukraine right now."</p>
<p>We've also seen deepfake job interviewees that are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/11/it_worker_scam/">good enough</a> to fool IT professionals, sometimes more than once. This technology is only improving and will get more and more convincing, Pelker warned.</p>
<p>The key to fixing this, the panelists agreed, was to educate everyone in the interview process – right down to the lowest staffer – and to be hyper vigilant for warning signs. If possible, they said, one should have someone local swing around for a personal meeting, and maybe also avoid hiring fully remote employees. ®</p>

			Microsoft continues to add to the conversation by unveiling its newest models, Phi-4-reasoning, Phi-4-reasoning-plus, and Phi-4-mini-reasoning.&nbsp;		</p>
		
		
<p><strong>A new era of AI&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>One year ago, Microsoft introduced <strong>small language models</strong> (SLMs) to customers with the release of <strong>Phi-3</strong> on <a href="https://ai.azure.com/?tid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47">Azure AI Foundry</a>, leveraging research on SLMs to expand the range of efficient AI models and tools available to customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are excited to introduce <strong>Phi-4-reasoning, Phi-4-reasoning-plus, and Phi-4-mini-reasoning</strong>—marking a new era for small language models and once again redefining what is possible with small and efficient AI.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="reasoning-models-the-next-step-forward">Reasoning models, the next step forward</h2>



<p><strong>Reasoning models</strong> are trained to leverage inference-time scaling to perform complex tasks that demand multi-step decomposition and internal reflection. They excel in mathematical reasoning and are emerging as the backbone of agentic applications with complex, multi-faceted tasks. Such capabilities are typically found only in large frontier models.&nbsp;Phi-reasoning models introduce a new category of small language models. Using distillation, reinforcement learning, and high-quality data, these models balance size and performance. They are small enough for low-latency environments yet maintain strong reasoning capabilities that rival much bigger models. This blend allows even resource-limited devices to perform complex reasoning tasks efficiently.</p>



<h2 id="phi-4-reasoning-and-phi-4-reasoning-plus">Phi-4-reasoning and Phi-4-reasoning-plus&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>Phi-4-reasoning </strong>is a 14-billion parameter open-weight reasoning model that rivals much larger models on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated reasoning demonstrations from OpenAI o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains that effectively leverage additional inference-time compute. The model demonstrates that meticulous data curation and high-quality synthetic datasets allow smaller models to compete with larger counterparts.</p>



<p>Phi-4-reasoning-plus builds upon Phi-4-reasoning capabilities, further trained with reinforcement learning to utilize more inference-time compute, using 1.5x more tokens than Phi-4-reasoning, to deliver higher accuracy.</p>



<p>Despite their significantly smaller size, both models achieve better performance than OpenAI o1-mini and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B at most benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning and Ph.D. level science questions. They achieve performance better than the full DeepSeek-R1 model (with 671-billion parameters) on the AIME 2025 test, the 2025 qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad. Both models are available on <a href="https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-4-reasoning/version/1/registry/azureml?tid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47">Azure AI Foundry</a> and HuggingFace.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-9-1024x416.webp" alt="A graph of different colored bars"><figcaption>Figure 1. Phi-4-reasoning performance across representative reasoning benchmarks spanning mathematical and scientific reasoning. We illustrate the performance gains from reasoning-focused post-training of Phi-4 via Phi-4-reasoning (SFT) and Phi-4-reasoning-plus (SFT+RL), alongside a representative set of baselines from two model families: open-weight models from DeepSeek including DeepSeek R1 (671B Mixture-of-Experts) and its distilled dense variant DeepSeek-R1 Distill Llama 70B, and OpenAI’s proprietary frontier models o1-mini and o3-mini. Phi-4-reasoning and Phi-4-reasoning-plus consistently outperform the base model Phi-4 by significant margins, exceed DeepSeek-R1 Distill Llama 70B (5x larger) and demonstrate competitive performance against significantly larger models such as Deepseek-R1.</figcaption></figure>


<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-1024x359.webp" alt="A graph of numbers and a number of people" srcset="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-1024x359.webp 1024w, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-300x105.webp 300w, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-768x269.webp 768w, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-1536x539.webp 1536w, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2.webp 1600w" data-orig-src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-1024x359.webp"><figcaption>Figure 2. Accuracy of models across general-purpose benchmarks for: long input context&nbsp;QA (FlenQA), instruction following (IFEval), Coding (HumanEvalPlus), knowledge &amp; language understanding (MMLUPro), safety detection (ToxiGen), and other general skills (ArenaHard and PhiBench).&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>Phi-4-reasoning models introduce a major improvement over Phi-4, surpass larger models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B and approach Deep-Seek-R1 across various reasoning and general capabilities, including math, coding, algorithmic problem solving, and planning. The <a href="https://aka.ms/phi-reasoning/techreport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical report</a> provides extensive quantitative evidence of these improvements through diverse reasoning tasks.</p>



<p>
<h2 id="phi-4-mini-reasoning">Phi-4-mini-reasoning</h2>
</p>



<p><strong>Phi-4-mini-reasoning</strong> is designed to meet the demand for a compact reasoning model. This transformer-based language model is optimized for mathematical reasoning, providing high-quality, step-by-step problem solving in environments with constrained computing or latency. Fine-tuned with synthetic data generated by Deepseek-R1 model, Phi-4-mini-reasoning balances efficiency with advanced reasoning ability. It’s ideal for educational applications, embedded tutoring, and lightweight deployment on edge or mobile systems, and is trained on over one million diverse math problems spanning multiple levels of difficulty from middle school to Ph.D. level.&nbsp;Try out the model on <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-4-mini-reasoning/blob/main/Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure AI Foundry</a> or <a href="https://aka.ms/phi4-mini-reasoning/hf">HuggingFace</a> today.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-30-193715-1024x328.webp" alt="A graph of numbers and a number of marks"><figcaption>Figure 3. The graph compares the performance of various models on popular math benchmarks for long sentence generation. Phi-4-mini-reasoning outperforms its base model on long sentence generation across each evaluation, as well as larger models like OpenThinker-7B, Llama-3.2-3B-instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, and Bespoke-Stratos-7B. Phi-4-mini-reasoning is comparable to OpenAI o1-mini across math benchmarks, surpassing the model’s performance during Math-500 and GPQA Diamond evaluations. As seen above, Phi-4-mini-reasoning with 3.8B parameters outperforms models of over twice its size. </figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="safety-and-microsoft-s-approach-to-responsible-ai">Safety and Microsoft’s approach to responsible AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>At Microsoft, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?msockid=2e923f4e6e1064c017fe2d466fa365a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responsible AI</a> is a fundamental principle guiding the development and deployment of AI systems, including our Phi models. Phi models are developed in accordance with Microsoft AI principles: accountability, transparency, fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, and inclusiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Phi family of models has adopted a robust safety post-training approach, leveraging a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) techniques. These methods utilize various datasets, including publicly available datasets focused on helpfulness and harmlessness, as well as various safety-related questions and answers. While the Phi family of models is designed to perform a wide range of tasks effectively, it is important to acknowledge that all AI models may exhibit limitations. To better understand these limitations and the measures in place to address them, please refer to the model cards below, which provide detailed information on responsible AI practices and guidelines.</p>

<p>You know how every annoying Windows program wants to launch as soon as you boot up your computer? Well, now Office is going to do that, too. A new “Startup Boost” function will set Office to load when Windows starts up, which will make apps like Word and Excel launch faster—while making the rest of your computer slower. Whoopie.</p>



<p>I’m being flippant, but it’s understandable that Microsoft would want to give Office a performance boost, even if it is somewhat illusory. And in the company’s defense, the announcement in the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://mc.merill.net/message/MC1041470&amp;xcust=2-1-2651749-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2651749/office-is-too-slow-so-microsoft-is-making-it-load-at-windows-startup.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2651749-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="merill" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Message Center Archive</a> (spotted by <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/news/637469/microsoft-office-speed-boost-faster-launch&amp;xcust=2-1-2651749-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2651749/office-is-too-slow-so-microsoft-is-making-it-load-at-windows-startup.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2651749-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="theverge" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) does say that the new tool will only be enabled on PCs that have at least 8GB of RAM and 5GB of free disk space. I think even trying to run Windows 11 on just 8GB of RAM is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/395018/how-much-ram-do-you-need-in-a-laptop.html">kind of optimistic these days</a>, but at least there’s a floor.</p>



<p>A cynic might wonder why Microsoft is making Office start when the computer boots instead of, you know, just making Office more efficient so it can run faster. (There’s no second part to that statement. The cynic is me. I want Office to be more efficient.)</p>



<p>The update to the Microsoft 365 installer will initially only apply to Microsoft Word when it rolls out in mid-May, then spread to other Office programs later. And yes, you will be able to disable this feature. End users can turn it off in Word’s settings or in the Task Scheduler.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p><a href="https://ladybird.org/">Ladybird</a> is a relatively new browser engine originating from the
<a href="https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity">SerenityOS project</a>. Currently, it’s in pre-alpha and improving quickly.
Take a look at the website and the GitHub for more information!</p><p>I’ll be researching the JavaScript engine of Ladybird,
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/tree/278666edcd74/Libraries/LibJS">LibJS</a>.</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>LibJS has an interpreter tier and no compilation tiers (yet!). It includes common modern JS engine<br>optimizations and is built with extensive verification checks across its critical code paths and data<br>structures, including vectors, making scenarios such as integer overflows leading to out-of-bounds<br>accesses harder to exploit.</p><h2 id="fuzzing">Fuzzing</h2><p>We’ll be using Fuzzilli, a popular fuzzer for JavaScript interpreters. Here’s the description from the GitHub:</p><blockquote>A (coverage-)guided fuzzer for dynamic language interpreters based on a custom
intermediate language ("FuzzIL") which can be mutated and translated to JavaScript.
<cite>- <a href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/fuzzilli">Fuzzilli</a></cite></blockquote><p>Fuzzilli can be configured with additional code generators that can be specialized to trigger
specific bugs. LibJS isn’t actively being OSS-fuzzed, so I didn’t add any custom generators and hoped
there would be enough shallow bugs around. There was already some persistent fuzzing code
in LibJS. After some work — like needing to compile and link Skia with RTTI (Nix 💜), fixing
some build scripts, and compiling Fuzzilli with an additional profile (again, Nix was great for this) — I
got it all working!</p><p>I ran the fuzzer for ~10 days and found 10 unique crashes. A lot of the bugs were boring:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/88c4f71114f7cfcf7e667eb07dae21553c0e10c6">Verification failure</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/911b9157637653c984ccbbd2c0b990499f5597a0">Stack exhaustion</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/3615">OOM bugs</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/356728b1e0c33aac879db285302f067a694ad28f">Bad bytecode generation</a>.</li></ul><p>There were a few bugs that were more interesting:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/83e46b372815d28475269d04ca6b98e97861b33a">A caching bug in the regex parser</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/f3a937ee769c2d9b4a78964641812171c4d03dd1">An integer overflow in <code>TypedArray</code></a></li></ul><p>Initially, I thought the regex bug was an integer overflow… unfortunately, it wasn’t. The real integer overflow<br>in <code>TypedArray</code> looked really promising — but it seems hard to exploit, with all the bounds checks protecting<br>vectors from bad accesses.</p><p>There were three bugs that looked really good: a heap buffer overflow, freelist corruption (or UAF) in the garbage
collector, and a heap use-after-free (UAF) in the malloc heap. But unfortunately, only the last UAF was reproducible outside of Fuzzilli.
<label for="sn-1"></label>

<span>I'm still not sure why the others didn't reproduce. <a href="https://jessie.cafe/posts/pwning-ladybirds-libjs/files/heap-buff-overflow.js">This</a>
is the crash report for the
heap buffer overflow, and <a href="https://jessie.cafe/posts/pwning-ladybirds-libjs/files/gc-uaf.js">this</a> is the one for the freelist corruption,
if interested.</span></p><h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2><h3 id="a-vulnerable-function">A Vulnerable Function</h3><p>The bug is a use-after-free (UAF) on the interpreter’s argument buffer. It’s triggered by using a

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It does the following:</p><ul><li>Gets the prototype of the constructor function</li><li>Creates a new JavaScript object with that prototype</li></ul><p>It’s a simple method, but it can have side effects if the constructor happens to be a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">proxy object</a>.
If we override the constructor function’s <code>[[Get]]</code> internal method, the call to <code>get_prototype_from_constructor</code>
can execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This is useful if we can get that code to free the argument buffer.</p><h3 id="the-argument-buffer">The Argument Buffer</h3><p>The interpreter stores arguments for function calls in a vector called <code>m_argument_values_buffer</code>.
It can grow, shrink, be freed, or reallocated — and we have some control over when that happens.
For example, if the current buffer holds $5$ JS values, and we run:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="js"><span><span><span>foo</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>10</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>then the buffer will need to be freed and reallocated somewhere with space for 10 JS values.
Using this, we can free the interpreter’s internal argument buffer — the same one that <code>arguments_list</code>
<em>still</em> points to — before it’s used to set up the <code>callee_context</code> for the proceeding constructor call.</p><p>The fix is to do the prototype <code>[[Get]]</code> strictly <em>after</em> the callee context has been constructed.
<a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/f5a670421954fc7130c3685b713c621b29516669">Here’s</a>
the patch.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="js"><span><span><span>function</span> <span>Construct</span>() {}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>let</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> {

(since that’s where the argument buffer is allocated), rather than in a garbage-collected arena
where a lot of objects actually reside. The malloc heap mainly holds backing buffers and such,
introducing a bit of complexity when it comes to finding the right objects for a leak; although this is
somewhat mitigated by the powerful primitives available.</p><h3 id="leaking-an-object">Leaking an Object</h3><p>We can craft an <code>addrof</code>-capability by fitting a pointer somewhere inside the old <code>arguments_list</code> allocation,

The chain begins with a pointer into the LibJS mapping (the vtable pointer of our object). From there,
we leak a GOT entry taking us to libc, where we finally leak a pointer to the stack (via <code>__libc_argv</code>).</p><p>Once we’ve found the stack, we search for a specific return pointer (<code>__libc_start_call_main</code>)
and overwrite it with a ROP chain. The POC ROP chain is simple; it <code>execve</code>’s <code>/calc</code>
(<a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/linux-constants/syscalls#x86_64-64-bit">syscall <code>0x3b</code></a>),
which is a symbolic link to the calculator app. A more complex payload would map RWX pages for a second
stage.</p><p>All that’s left is to close the tab, which will collapse the stack and trigger the ROP chain.</p><p><a href="https://jessie.cafe/posts/pwning-ladybirds-libjs/files/uaf-browser.zip">This</a> is the final exploit code for the browser, and <a href="https://jessie.cafe/posts/pwning-ladybirds-libjs/files/uaf-shell.js">this</a> is

</p>


<p><span size="+2"><b>Hegseth's government equipment</b></span></p><p>

Like his predecessors, Trump's defense secretary Pete Hegseth has access to a range of secure and non-secure telephone and computer networks. The equipment is installed at a table behind his back, when sitting at his big writing desk in the Pentagon.</p><p>

In the photo above we can see that equipment in a set-up that has basically been <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Defense_Secretary_Chuck_Hagel_speaks_from_his_Pentagon_office_by_phone_with_Malaysian_Defense_Minister_Datuk_Seri_Hishammuddin_Tun_Hussein,_July_18,_2014,_to_offer_his_condolences_for_those_who_lost_their_lives_140718-D-NI589-005c.jpg" target="_blank">unchanged</a> since Chuck Hagel, who was Obama's secretary of Defense from 2013 to 2015. In the photo of Pete Hegseth we see from left to right:</p><div><p>
- On top of a wooden stand sits a Cisco IP Phone 8851 with a 14-key <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/ip-phone-8851-8861-key-expansion-module/index.html" target="_blank">expansion module</a>. This phone is part of the Crisis Management System (CMS), which connects the President, the National Security Council, Cabinet members, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, intelligence agency watch centers, and others. Its bright yellow bezel indicates that it can be used for conversations up to Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). </p><p>

- Below the CMS phone on the wooden stand is (hardly visible) an <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/raytheon/ist2/" target="_blank">Integrated Services Telephone-2</a> (IST-2), which can be used for both secure and non-secure phone calls. This phone belongs to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Red_Switch_Network" target="_blank">Defense Red Switch Network</a> (DRSN), also known as the Multilevel Secure Voice service, which connects the White House, all military command centers, intelligence agencies, government departments and NATO allies.</p><p>

- Right in front of the IST-2 is another Cisco IP Phone 8851 with a 14-key expansion module, but this time with a green bezel, which indicates that it's for unclassified phone calls. This phone is part of the internal telephone network of the Pentagon and replaced an <a href="https://www.metrolinedirect.com/def64tel1.html" target="_blank">Avaya Lucent 6424</a> executive phone.</p></div>
<p>
A better view of these phones is provided by the following photo from 2021:</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhd5Vycz7MhvSOBVlkUbA5pINdcIDHJ1jySWLk5fW_ugxdT2BNSz7n7M71oR7PWPcqcVXWoDz5ZWG1cG2ORioLJ4KS_R6gV_9yWnxqVCrnDGiPTDAhx1VLz3LuZJ9udkzKe4PNGD2F6btXoIhZQiqfAP84ZAd_iLzFSIO1cGRBnlyaW2ToBxKESJ4m9tc/s1000/secdef-austin-2021.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-original-height="728" data-original-width="1000" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhd5Vycz7MhvSOBVlkUbA5pINdcIDHJ1jySWLk5fW_ugxdT2BNSz7n7M71oR7PWPcqcVXWoDz5ZWG1cG2ORioLJ4KS_R6gV_9yWnxqVCrnDGiPTDAhx1VLz3LuZJ9udkzKe4PNGD2F6btXoIhZQiqfAP84ZAd_iLzFSIO1cGRBnlyaW2ToBxKESJ4m9tc/s1000/secdef-austin-2021.jpg" width="550"></a></p><p><span size="2">

- Besides the telephones there are two computer screens, both with a bright green wallpaper, which again indicates that they are connected to an unclassified network, most likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIPRNet" target="_blank">NIPRNet</a>. In the photo of Lloyd Austin's office we see that there's also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch" target="_blank">KVM switch</a> which is used to switch securely to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNet" target="_blank">SIPRNet</a> (Secret) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Worldwide_Intelligence_Communications_System" target="_blank">JWICS</a> (Top Secret/SCI) networks, using the same keyboard, video and mouse set.</p><p>

- Finally, at the right side of the table there are two <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/collaboration-endpoints/webex-desk-series/datasheet-c78-731879.html" target="_blank">Cisco Webex DX80</a> videoteleconferencing screens. The one at the right has a yellow label, which indicates that it's approved for Top Secret/SCI and most likely belongs to the Secure Video Teleconferencing System (SVTS), which is part of the aforementioned Crisis Management System (CMS). The other screen might then be for videoconferences at a lower classification level.</p></div>



  <p><span size="+2"><b>Hegseth's personal computer</b></span></p><p>

Despite the wide range of options for communicating via the proper and secure government channels, secretary Hegseth insisted on using Signal. Apparently it wasn't allowed or possible to install this app on one of the government computers, nor on a smartphone that is approved for classified conversations.</p><p>
  
Therefore, Hegseth initially went to the back area of his office where he could access Wi-Fi to use Signal, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-signal-chat-dirty-internet-line-6a64707f10ca553eb905e5a70e10bd9d" target="_blank">according</a> to AP News. It's not clear whether he used a private laptop or his personal smartphone, both of which would have been strictly forbidden to use in secure areas like this.</p>
  <p>
Somewhat later, Hegseth requested an internet connection to his desk where he could use a computer of his own. This line connects directly to the public internet and bypassed the Pentagon's security protocols. This new computer must be the one that can be seen in the photo below, as it wasn't there yet on <a href="https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/4073962/hegseth-addresses-strengthening-military-by-cutting-excess-refocusing-dod-budget/" target="_blank">February 21</a> and has no labels that indicate its classification level:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAlv8am9q3K3oLKPcxUf0CsQeC-nUfFQBCHIhCdh1tGchtEv3TvpP3FQd4e6YSK5JZ9mNXa0Epr0Xd603kwfQ9aHdy7jHjLJUP519RAgzNrzne3PwZfnEXApk1i0ApByBkrHghn5DQzHXtZaCPEZQfxYZABglRMeQx5GWv_tCSeJeAu9AGcTI6ouPY6P0/s961/hegseth-march2025.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-original-height="626" data-original-width="961" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAlv8am9q3K3oLKPcxUf0CsQeC-nUfFQBCHIhCdh1tGchtEv3TvpP3FQd4e6YSK5JZ9mNXa0Epr0Xd603kwfQ9aHdy7jHjLJUP519RAgzNrzne3PwZfnEXApk1i0ApByBkrHghn5DQzHXtZaCPEZQfxYZABglRMeQx5GWv_tCSeJeAu9AGcTI6ouPY6P0/s600/hegseth-march2025.jpg" width="600"></a></p>

Some other employees at the Pentagon also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-signal-chat-dirty-internet-line-6a64707f10ca553eb905e5a70e10bd9d" target="_blank">use</a> direct lines to the public internet, for example when they don't want to be recognized by an IP address assigned to the Pentagon. That's risky because such a line is less well monitored than NIPRNet, which allows limited access to the outside internet.</p><p>
  
At his new desktop computer, Hegseth <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/23/hegseth-signal-pentagon-computer/" target="_blank">had</a> Signal installed, which means he effectively 'cloned' the Signal app that is on his personal smartphone. He also had interest in the installation of a program to send conventional text messages from this personal computer, according to some press sources.</p><p>
  
The move was intended to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/23/hegseth-signal-pentagon-computer/" target="_blank">circumvent</a> a lack of cellphone service in much of the Pentagon and enable easier communication with the White House and other Trump officials who are using the Signal app.</p><p><span size="+2"><b>SecDef Cables</b></span></p><p>
 
It is remarkable to what great lengths Hegseth went to use the Signal app, because as defense secretary he has his own communications center which is specialized in keeping him in contact with anyone he wants. This center is commonly called SecDef Cables and is part of <a href="https://www.disa.mil/Careers/SecDef-Comms-Support" target="_blank">Secretary of Defense Communications</a> (SDC) unit.</p><p>

SecDef Cables provides operational information management and functions as a command and control support center. It is staffed by 26 service members and 4 civilians. They provide "comprehensive voice, video, and data capabilities to the secretary and his immediate staff, regardless of their location, across multiple platforms and classifications."</p><p>

Furthermore, SecDef Cables serves as a liaison to the National Military Command Center (NMCC), the White House Situation Room, the State Department Operations Center and similar communication centers. Finally, Cables provides the connections for the Defense Telephone Link (DTL), which is a lower-level hotline with military counterparts in about 25 countries, including Russia and China.</p>
