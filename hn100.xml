<hr>
<p dir="auto">Project Overview</p>
<p dir="auto">Vanta is a lightweight, fast, command-line-based network behavior analyzer. It reconstructs protocol-level flows and extracts structured activity from captured data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike full-featured GUI tools like Wireshark, Vanta focuses on clarity, structure, and simplicity — ideal for custom scripting and minimal setups.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Features</p>
<p dir="auto">Protocol-Level Parsing</p>
<p dir="auto">Supports HTTP, DNS, TLS (with partial fingerprinting)</p>
<p dir="auto">Connection Tracking</p>
<p dir="auto">Automatically reconstructs bidirectional flows</p>
<p dir="auto">Behavior Exporting</p>
<p dir="auto">Outputs clean JSON-formatted summaries</p>
<p dir="auto">Portable &amp; Dependency-Free</p>
<p dir="auto">Single binary, no external dependencies</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Quick Start (See usage/ folder for full guide)</p>
<p dir="auto">go run main.go</p>
<p dir="auto">Refer to the usage folder for complete usage documentation in Chinese.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Development Environment</p>
<p dir="auto">OS: macOS 15.5 (Apple Silicon)</p>
<p dir="auto">Editor: Visual Studio Code</p>
<p dir="auto">Language: Go</p>
<p dir="auto">Go Module: go 1.23.0</p>
<p dir="auto">Toolchain: go1.24.3</p>
<p dir="auto">Terminal: zsh (macOS default)</p>

<p dir="auto">Why I Built This</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is not just code — it's a response. Amid political pressure, some universities like Harvard, MIT, and CMU stood up for international students.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I’m just an ordinary undergraduate with no resources or background. This is my way of responding — not by petition, but through code. Vanta may be small, but it’s real, and it’s mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I know Vanta is a "toy version" of Wireshark — I still use Wireshark myself in real scenarios.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to Professors and Schools</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you for standing up for students.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project might not be perfect, but it is heartfelt.</p>

We’ve built something really good, something that clinicians really need and love. We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles.</p><p>We are a team of ~40 with strong product market fit — in Q4 last year we’ve had to push out onboarding because engineering can’t build quickly enough, something we’ve scaled out of.

Our interest rates are less than 1/3 of the rates our customers are able to get from other financing options.</p><p>We are a VC backed company and have been in business for 6 years. We have been profitable for the past year and with a new debt facility closing at the end of June, we will be dramatically ramping up origination volume in the second half of the year.

You will join our engineering team of 10 and work in a dynamic environment where you are frequently writing net new code to support business objectives.</p><p>Our tech stack for the back-end is fully on AWS, using Lambda and ECS for compute and Typescript as the language, but experience with this specific stack is not necessary for talented candidates.

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security.</p><p>We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.</p><p>We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.</p><p>--</p><p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.</p><p>Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule.</p><p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-junior-software-engineer-global-remote">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-j...</a></p><p>--</p><p>Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more.

Robotics is a place where multiple fields converge and if you find a good team they will help you to grow.</p><p>Embedded is the adjacent field after you complete the course. Maybe something like zephyr project.</p><p>If you want to get you feet wet with mechanical. Buy a A1 mini and play with onshape (www.onshape.com) to design your first pieces, supports for the motors or the board, try create you own gripper.</p><p>As for the electrical engineering, is the one with most pitfalls and the most expensive. A wrong voltage will release the magical smoke and is another 30$ for a board. Tread carefully. Start with the RP2040 or the RP2350, they are cheap and well documented. This skill will evolve hand by hand with the embedded coding. Start small. Learn about H-bridge and brushed motors before doing the jump to the bigboys and FOC control with brushless. Get a cheap soldering iron. If you can, a clone of the JBC C245 tips. Is the most versatile and you can find stuff in alie xpress for 45 or 50$ and would be similar to the tools you will find in the field without breaking the bank.</p><p>Search for ROS meetups. I could point you to some depending where in the world you are.</p><p>And above all, it will be a long journey. Don't dispear, do at your own time but don't forget the objective.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Microcontrollers and PLC are historically different fields that have some overlap as the fields converge somewhat. PLC come from relay logic and so learning Ladder Logic and playing with a cheaper Automation Direct PLC might be good if you're looking to do control systems like industrial machines and those robotics. RPi series micros are good to learn embedded electronics, servo controls and Realtime OS. Computer Engineering and Control System Engineering are treated differently even in the California State Engineering License Exams, so they tend to be different paths but the skills have some overlap. My degree was in computer engineering and didn't cover any PLC, but I contract and PLC comes up a lot in one-off things that need to be reliable.</p>

So I'd recommend doing a bit of everything then picking a specialty to learn in depth. Build a really simple kit robot and then program it to do simple stuff using ROS. Write a few ROS nodes from scratch to do something simple, things that existing ROS nodes already do. Then learn why the STL ROS options are (most likely) better than yours.</p><p>I strongly recommend taking the generalist approach. It makes you a much better engineer in the long run. I had a friend call me up enraged one day. He got woken up at 1am and ordered to drive across the state to get a site back up and running because his hardware was broken and the very expensive software team was sitting around wasting their time. So he got to the site at three or four AM and found that the room full of software engineers, three PhDs among them, didn't understand that BOTH of the battery terminals needed to be connected. Yes, batteries in fact have a positive and a negative. And these people were each getting paid twice as much as him. He left that company and became hardware leadership at a much better company, thank goodness. My point is, super-specializing in the most profitable hyper-niche right off the bat is going to make you a very mediocre robotics engineer who might be successful in the short term, but might find yourself unemployed in a few years when we find a better modality to replace your hyper-niche. Specialists win the sprints, generalists win the marathons.</p></div></td></tr>

Courses, ROS, Programs etc. Just picking one is a fine start and you will learn something, but you may not have fun or appreciate the context for what you are learning, which makes it hard to care.</p><p>It also depends on what you're trying to learn. Programming? control? electronics? mechanism design? There are many different aspects that require their own expertise. I personally think of a roboticist as someone that can be functional in all the disciplines and bring it all together. Some one that can build a robot from scratch.</p><p>This advice is targeted towards someone starting in robotics with an emphasis on building a totally custom robot. You are doing the whole thing from scratch, no kit. (kits are super useful, but I personally like building everything and making hardware that works for me). In my eyes, if you haven't built it in hardware, it probably isn't a robot.</p><p>As a research roboticist, my best advice is forget Learning it all up front and just start building. You will probably have strengths and weaknesses, but robotics is a very multi-disciplinary problem and at the start, requires some head banging in what we like to call integration hell. Just Trying to build something does a couple things. It gets you acquainted with the interaction of all aspects (mechanical, electrical, software) of a robot and how they interact. Most importantly it gives you context for sll the things you learn later on. Build something, come across a problem, and google/brute force your way to a solution. You will stumble across context relevant resources and lessons in the moment. Especially at the start, a more "formal" education is too broad and comprehensive for the curious roboticist.</p><p>My simple advice is to just come up with something simple and SEND IT!</p><p>For mechanical - Onshape for 3D design (free tier) and a bambu A1 mini 3d printer can get you building anything you want for &lt;$400. A couple nights of CAD tutorials will get you started. Hell you can even start with cardboard and hot glue if this is cost/time prohibitive.</p><p>For electronics - Browse www.adafruit.com or www.sparkfun.com for sensors and microcontroller boards. They both support QWICC connections which makes getting sensors plugged in and running super easy for a beginner. For computation and control a basic Arduino Uno or one of the adafruit feathers will do just fine. Don't get caught up in the internet debate on what the best microcontroller/single board computer is. The best robot is one that works and it is VERY easy to get in over your head in this realm and fall into the premature optimization track. Better to get something working that under performs than to never build at all.</p><p>For software - Most lower level robotics uses c++, which I think scares people. It is mostly because it is one level above hardware. Arduino/common libraries take care of all the hard stuff and you don’t have to worry about large scale things like garbage collection, memory leaks, or efficient code off the bat. The websites above have libraries, examples, and tutorials for every sensor. Even a non programmer type can smush the example code together in a functional way and get something up and running.</p><p>As you try to build you will learn and get more complicated. Robotics is so vast and large its best to focus on learning the skill you need at the time. But my main advice is just go build the thing and the learning resources/skills will present themselves when they are needed. Otherwise it is just too much to take a more planned approach.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>As you progress in your career, understanding the difference between being useful and being valued is very important. At first glance, they might look similar because the signals you get are more or less the same: a promotion, a higher than expected bonus, a special stock award. This is why it’s important to dig deeper and try to detect subtler signals.</p><p><span>Being </span><em>useful</em><span> means that you are good at getting things done in a specific area, so that people above you can delegate that completely. You are reliable, efficient, maybe even indispensable in the short term. But you are seen primarily as a gap-filler, someone who delivers on tasks that have to be done but are not necessarily a core component of the company strategy. “Take care of that and don’t screw up” is your mission, and the fewer headaches you create for your leadership chain, the bigger the rewards.</span></p><p><span>Being </span><em>valued</em><span>, on the other hand, means that you are brought into more conversations, not just to execute, but to help shape the direction. This comes with opportunities to grow and contribute in ways that are meaningful to you and the business.</span></p><p>It took me a few years to truly grasp the difference. If you’re valued, you’ll likely see a clear path for advancement and development, you might get more strategic roles and involvement in key decisions. If you are just useful, your role might feel more stagnant. </p><p>Let me walk you through two contrasting experiences from my own career that made this difference clearer to me.</p><p>When I was an IC, there was a period when my company was going through a tough time. We missed earnings guidance by a lot in one quarter, and layoffs were inevitable. Entire teams were disbanded, and my own manager was among those let go, so I was quite nervous. But instead of being on the chopping block, I was not only retained but also offered a significant retention bonus: 50% of my total comp, with a one year vesting schedule. </p><p>Leadership made it clear that they saw me as critical to the company’s future, not just because of what I had delivered in the past, but to help shape what came next. The business was changing, becoming more digital, and they needed the skills I was bringing to the table. Interestingly, this validation didn’t come from a performance review or a bonus alone. It came in a moment of crisis, when hard choices had to be made about who mattered most to the mission ahead.</p><p>Later on, I found myself in a role that, on the surface, looked like a success story. I was consistently hitting targets, getting recognition from leadership, and receiving generous bonuses and retention grants. The company clearly saw me as someone worth keeping around. But over time, I started to notice that while I was being rewarded, I wasn’t really being asked to take on new kinds of problems or invited into strategic conversations. No one was talking to me about where I wanted to go next or how I could grow. </p><p>I had become the go-to person for making things run smoothly, for fixing urgent problems, for delivering. But every time I pushed toward more strategic and ambitious directions, there was a lot of can-kicking and “let’s think about it” that went nowhere. I was incredibly useful to the organization, but not necessarily valued, and at some point, I started feeling a sense of stagnation. Compensation was good, the actual job was aligned with my interests, but that sense of being just a useful caretaker was hitting my motivation. In the end, I had to move on to another role.</p><p>If you’re reading this and wondering which side of the line you are on, I encourage you to take a moment to step back and look beyond the surface. Are you valued, or just useful?</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>MicroSD cards seem to be the preferred storage for Raspberry Pis and many other SBCs.  Of course, there's other applications for microSD cards -- cameras, smart phones, gaming consoles...and other stuff I'm sure.  But sooner or later, people start to run into issues with their microSD cards, which begs a question -- just how reliable are they?</p>

<p>When I first started searching around for an answer, I got a range of different answers -- some people said "modern flash should last practically forever"; others said "they should last for at least a million program/erase cycles"; while more pessimistic sources said "don't expect them to last more than a few thousand program/erase cycles".  But empirical data seems to be hard to come by.</p>

<p>So...about a year and 10 months ago, I set out to answer this question.  (Well, truth be told, I was actually trying to answer a slightly different question -- but it quickly morphed into this one.)  And since then, I've acquired 256 microSD cards of various brands, product lines, and sizes.  I've at least started testing 223 of them by continuously writing to them (and reading back the data and verifying that it's correct).  I've tested 105 of them to the point of failure.  I've written over 47 <em>petabytes</em> of random data to them so far -- trying to sus out just how reliable they are.</p>

<p>The results are pretty interesting.  I'll spare the finer details here (see <a href="https://www.bahjeez.com/the-great-microsd-card-survey/">my website</a> for more info), but some of the highlights?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Occasional errors seem to be a fact of life with microSD cards, even for name-brand cards:</strong> Of the cards I've tested, 82% have experienced at least one error so far.  The results seem to run the gamut: some cards experienced their first error before completing even 10 read/write cycles (and yes, there are a couple name-brand cards included in that), while others went for several thousand read/write cycles.  (I have one card that's closing in on 100,000 read/write cycles and still hasn't experienced a single error -- but that one is an outlier.)  So far, the average time to first error is around 2,400 read/write cycles.  The median value is just 1,450 read/write cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Overall, the reliability of microSD cards has been pretty poor:</strong> I arbitrarily chose 0.1% -- as in "0.1% of the card's sectors have experienced errors" -- as the point where you'd likely have noticed that something is wrong with your card.  And of the cards that I've tested so far, almost half have reached that point -- with the average being around 4,500 read/write cycles.  The median value is just 3,100 read/write cycles.  The caveat here is that this doesn't include cards that are still going and haven't failed yet -- but we should be able to infer from this that about a quarter of all microSD cards will fail completely or hit the 0.1% failure threshold before they hit 3,100 read/write cycles -- a pretty depressing figure if you ask me.</li>
<li><strong>Some brands have surprised me:</strong> Before I started this project, I admittedly had some bias towards/against certain name brands.  Others were brands I'd never heard of or had any experience with, so I didn't have much in terms of a bias.  However, as this project has gone on, those biases have shifted, and new biases have been formed.  Here's a quick run-down on how some of the more notable brands did:

<ul>
<li><strong>ADATA:</strong> This is a brand that I didn't have much experience with before starting this project, but I had come across their name several times and assumed that they were a decent brand (and also they're listed as a member of the SD Association -- so that lent a little bit of credibility to them, at least in my mind).  However, all three failed at a point that was below average (at an average of just 2,352 read/write cycles).</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Basics:</strong> These cards have actually been surprisingly good in terms of reliability.  I have four of them, and they've been in testing for almost a year now -- and none of them have failed.  All four are well below the 0.1% failure threshold, while two of them haven't experienced a single error yet.</li>
<li><strong>Delkin Devices:</strong> Another brand I didn't have any personal experience with beforehand.  I picked up three of these, and while they've only been in testing for 6-8 months, they've all made it past the average time to first error and haven't experienced a single error so far.</li>
<li><strong>Gigastone:</strong> Meh.  I've tested 9 of their cards so far (and I still have two more in the package), and 8 of them have failed completely -- with the best performer failing after only 6 months.  That should tell you something right there.</li>
<li><strong>Kingston:</strong> Like many of you, I've have had issues with Kingston cards in the past, but the data seems to indicate that Kingston has changed their tune.  Of the 15 Kingston cards I have right now, only one has completely failed -- and many of those cards have been in testing for a year or more now.  Even their industrial grade cards have fared better than SanDisk's -- whereas the 3 SanDisk Industrial cards I bought all failed before hitting the 21,000 read/write cycle mark, my 3 Kingston Industrial cards have gone 2-3x that number and are still going strong.  Overall, Kingston has been above average in terms of reliability (even if you don't include the industrial-grade cards in that mix).  (On an unrelated note: I do a little bit of performance testing on these cards before I start doing endurance testing on them, and my top performer so far is a Kingston -- specifically, the Kingston Canvas Go! Plus.)</li>
<li><strong>Kioxia:</strong> This one has been a little bit of a mixed bag.  I have 10 of their cards -- four Excerias, three Exceria Plus's, and three Exceria G2s.  As a whole, the Excerias didn't do very well: all four have failed completely, and three of the four were below average in terms of endurance.  The Exceria Plus's and the Exceria G2s, on the other hand, have done pretty well: all 6 of them have been in testing for over a year now, all 6 have made it more than 10,000 read/write cycles, and all 6 are well below the 0.1% failure threshold.  One of the G2s has yet to experience its first error.  Overall, Kioxia's cards have scored above average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Lexar:</strong> I have 6 Lexar cards -- three that date to before their Micron days, and three that date after Lexar's sale to Longsys.  Two of the three Micron-made cards experienced a strange issue: in almost every round of testing, there would be a handful of sectors where 4 bytes -- in the same location (within the sector) every time -- would be completely off from what they were supposed to be.  On top of that, it was the same 4 bytes on both cards -- which tells me that this was more of a manufacturing issue.  Due to what I can only assume was wear leveling, different sectors would be affected by this issue every time.  (The third card wasn't actually made by Micron -- it was made by Phison.)  Regardless, all 6 cards have been in testing for over a year now, and all of them are well below the 0.1% failure threshold.  Overall, Lexar has been above average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>onn.:</strong> This is Walmart's private label.  I saw these while in one of their stores, and picked up four of them on a whim.  I was pretty disappointed by the results: they all failed before hitting even 2,000 read/write cycles, with the average point of failure being just 1,400 read/write cycles.</li>
<li><strong>OV:</strong> This is a brand I found on AliExpress.  While I don't want to call this a <em>good</em> brand (they're actually pretty terrible in terms of read/write performance), I have three of their cards -- one has been in testing for over a year and a half, while the other two are a little shy of that -- and they've done pretty well in endurance tests, with all three completing over 10,000 read/write cycles and staying far shy of the 0.1% failure threshold.  Overall, these cards have scored above average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>PNY:</strong> I have 9 of their cards in testing right now.  Six of them have been in testing for over a year, while the other three have only been in testing for a couple of months.  All of them are well below the 0.1% failure threshold, but I just don't have enough data yet to say whether they're above average or below average in terms of endurance.</li>
<li><strong>Samsung:</strong> Samsung has actually done pretty well in terms of endurance.  I have 9 of their cards; all of them have been in testing for more than a year now, and all of them are well below the 0.1% failure threshold -- with 5 of them not having even experienced their first error yet.  However, these cards actually have pretty bad sequential write speeds -- meaning that I don't have enough data yet to say whether they're above average or below average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>SanDisk/WD:</strong> My bias at the start of this project was <em>in favor</em> of SanDisk -- I have a few Raspberry Pi's, and a lot of Orange Pi's, and I've been using SanDisk Ultra's with almost all of them.  However, I've noticed a rather disturbing trend with SanDisk cards: they tend to fail suddenly and without warning.  Of course, this is true of a lot of cards -- but what's unusual is that one company (<a href="https://support.embeddedts.com/support/solutions/articles/22000202866-sd-card-testing">who did a similar test</a>) noticed that they were sensitive to brownouts; and frankly, I've found the same to be true in my testing: a few cards suddenly quit working after a power failure, while a couple others stopped working after I plugged in a new card reader into a nearby USB port.  Overall, I have 29 SanDisk cards that I've tested (including 3 WD-branded cards), and 14 of them have failed completely (with two more on their way out the door as of the time of this writing).</li>
<li><strong>Silicon Power (SP):</strong> I didn't have any personal experience with Silicon Power before starting this project, but I've heard anecdotes from a few people saying that they like their cards.  However, the data seems to show that they're actually below average in terms of reliability: out of the 8 cards that I've tested so far, 5 of them have failed completely.  The average point at which they failed was just under 2,000 read/write cycles, putting them well below average in terms of reliability.  And out of those five, four of them failed at or near the point at which they experienced their first error -- so I guess the lesson here is, if you start to notice issues with your SP card, replace it immediately!</li>
<li><strong>Transcend:</strong> I have three of their cards, and they've been in testing for 10 months now.  All three of them have made it well past the average time to the 0.1% failure threshold (with one of them having yet to experience its first error), but I don't have enough data yet to say whether they're above average or below average in terms of reliability.</li>
<li><strong>XrayDisk:</strong> Another random brand I found on AliExpress.  I have three of their cards: one has failed completely, while the other two are still going.  While not great in terms of read/write performance, they've all done above average in terms of reliability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Off-brand cards have done about as well as name-brand cards:</strong> Of the cards I've tested (not including any that I've labelled as "fake flash"), I have 111 name-brand cards and 91 that I've labelled as "off-brand" -- brands that a tech-savvy consumer wouldn't necessarily recognize or who wouldn't normally be associated with SD cards or flash memory in general.  (And yes -- I have a few HP cards in my mix that I've labelled as "off-brand", because you don't normally associate HP with SD cards or flash memory.)  However, the data so far seems to indicate that there isn't much of a difference -- in terms of reliability -- between name-brand cards and off-brand cards.  In fact, the data right now is leaning slightly in favor of off-brand cards: the average number of read/write cycles to the 0.1% failure threshold for name-brand cards is currently sitting at about 5,300; for off-brand cards, it's about 4,900.  Of course, fake flash did significantly worse: the average for fake flash is currently sitting at about 2,200.</li>
<li><strong>There's a variety of ways in which cards can fail:</strong> SD cards have a register called the CSD register.  This register stores information about the card's capabilities, its timing parameters, and its performance characteristics; it also stores the size of the card and couple of write-protection bits: a "permanent" write-protect bit and a "temporary" write-protect bit.  If you're lucky, the permanent write-protect bit will get flipped, and you'll find yourself unable to write anything new to the card -- but this is kind of a best case scenario, because it means that most (if not all) of your data is still intact and you have time to back it up.  But this isn't the only way in which cards fail -- I've had cards whose CSD register was completely corrupted, causing the reader to believe it was only 127MB in size; and I've had cards where every sector returns corrupt data.  But the most common failure mode?  To explain that requires a little bit of explanation.  When a card reader is initializing an SD card, the reader sends a command to the card indicating which voltages it supports.  Once the card receives this command, it's supposed to start its initialization and power-up sequence, and it's supposed to complete it within one second.  Most cards, when they fail, will respond to basic commands, but when instructed to start their power-up sequence, never finish it.  Some of them will reset themselves during this process -- which makes me wonder if the failure is due to something shorting out within the card.</li>
<li><strong>Cards from Amazon did better than cards from AliExpress:</strong> Amazon and AliExpress have been my two main suppliers (although I've gotten cards from a few other places) -- and there does seem to be at least a little bit of a difference between the two.  Admittedly, a bigger chunk of the cards I ordered from AliExpress were fake flash or off-brand cards; but even if I narrow it down to just name-brand cards, the same holds true.</li>
</ul>

<p>So...this is an ongoing project -- which I imagine won't be done for quite some time still.  But hopefully this helps you when deciding what microSD card to put in your Raspberry Pi!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jeetmehta.com/posts/thrive-in-obscurity">https://www.jeetmehta.com/posts/thrive-in-obscurity</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44155746">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>The path to creative mastery begins with years of silence. Publish anyway.</p><hr><p>Most things take <em>forever</em> to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Even the most successful creators have spent years (if not decades) putting content out in obscurity. Just a complete total void. Youtube videos with 4 views. Newsletters with 3 subscribers. Podcasts with 10 listeners. Blogs with 6 readers. Songs with 4 downloads. No one but their parents and their spouse consuming their work. And sometimes not even that.</p>
<p>If you’re in it purely for the promised land of love, praise, followers, and fame from millions of people - it’s impossible to sustain. In every field, it takes years of practice, repetition, and “failed performances” before the first hit. In the worst case, artists go their entire life without ever receiving the praise they deserved. Look at Van Gogh - an incredible artist who died unappreciated &amp; broke, in a mental asylum. All of his fame came after his death.</p>
<hr>
<h3>So how do you keep going?</h3>
<p>How do you keep hitting that publish button, over and over again, knowing there’s no one on the other side?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I’m still trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>But I have come across a few frameworks and quotes that I’ve found useful, so I’m sharing them below.</p>
<hr>
<h3>1 — Do things you like, and sometimes the world will agree</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBATMZSVPOw&amp;t=1171s&amp;ab_channel=MyFirstMillion">interview between Shaan Puri and Mike Posner</a> is awesome. In it, Mike talks about his (seemingly) sudden rise to stardom, the rapid fall, and the slow climb back.</p>
<p>After writing music for 10 years — since the age of 6 — Mike’s single <em>Cooler Than Me</em> blew up. No one other than his mom had heard any of his previous songs. <em>Cooler Than Me</em> hit #6 on the Billboard Top 100 — while he was still in college at Duke.</p>
<p>Mike spent the next 7 years trying to chase the same hit, and every song ended up worse than the last. The chase pushed him into depression, drugs, a near-fatal snake bite, a walking journey across the US, and climbing Everest.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he came out with a much healthier attitude (that led to more hits).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do things that you like, and sometimes the world will agree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of chasing hits, Mike only produces music he likes.
Music he thinks is good.<br>
<!-- -->Music he’d listen to.<br>
<!-- -->Music that’s a hit for <strong>him</strong>.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the world agrees.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2 — Push yourself out</h3>
<p>Similar to Mike Posner’s mindset: Instead of trying to figure out <em>what your audience likes</em>, just create what <strong>you</strong> like.</p>
<p>That’ll help sustain motivation when your audience doesn’t really exist. You’ll be more likely to push through plateaus, and you’ll enjoy the process. You’ll also just produce <em>better</em> work.</p>
<p>Best of all? It’ll attract like-minded followers — people who love the work <em>you</em> like to create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your audience is just <strong>you</strong>, pushed outwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>3 — Build your Binge Bank</h3>
<p>Instead of being disappointed when no one consumes your content, treat these initial pieces of content as an investment. An investment in your <strong>Binge Bank</strong>. What’s that?</p>
<p>Your Binge Bank is the collection of content that your <em>future</em> fans will want to consume. It’s the rabbit hole of content they'll go down. Your audience might not exist now, but when it does in the future (and you can bet it will), they’ll want to go back in time and see everything you’ve produced.</p>
<p>This is why YouTubers with millions of followers have hundreds of thousands of views on their first few videos. Those videos didn’t get any views when they were first published. They were revisited <em>after</em> they became famous, by their most loyal fans.</p>
<hr>
<p>So if you (like me) are publishing into obscurity, this is your gentle reminder.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/c164fd0b-de22-4dd6-919e-881b023dbe6d/ical-header.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>It is with great excitement that we share the original INTERCAL-72 compiler source code, as both scans and transcriptions (see below). INTERCAL was created by Don Woods (<a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/don-woods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously interviewed here</a>) and Jim Lyon as undergrads at Princeton in an infamous late-night session after freshman finals in 1972. Don recently rediscovered a print-out, on green-barred, continuous-feed pages, of the SPITBOL source code for the original compiler. If the legend holds true, this code had not been run since Woods and Lyon's Princeton days. Sean Haas (of the <a href="https://adventofcomputing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Computing</a> podcast) and I transcribed the code from these scans, proof-reading each others' interpretations of fading characters. Haas has also produced a refined, runnable version of the script.</p>
<p>INTERCAL ("Compiler Language with No Pronounceable Acronym") is the first language that can unequivocally be called an esolang. While previous languages had odd designs as pl research and experimentation, INTERCAL intentionally subverts its programmers' effort to write what Dijkstra called "good code": that which "shortens the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process." In INTERCAL, code is circuitous, full of symbols used in bizarre ways and with unique designations (#, for example, is the "mesh" sign). It is a challenge to read or to run in ones head, even for those deeply immersed in the language. Furthermore, it does this for parody and play, not with any practical aim in mind.</p>
<p>The length of INTERCAL's shadow cannot be overstated. It was twenty years after its creation that a series of minimalist languages (FALSE, Befunge, brainfuck) took the next steps toward what would become the esolang movement. INTERCAL-72 offered somewhat of a different path from these; it was less concerned with minimalism, and more explicitly dramatized the act of programming. Woods and Lyon described it as eschewing conventions of languages like ALGOL, SNOBOL, FOCAL, and AP/I, yet it is also clearly parody, embracing and exaggerating their worst eccentricities and inefficiencies for an alienating experience.</p>
<p>INTERCAL's most striking feature is its humanizing of the interpreter, a mercurial being who we literally plead with to get our programs to run. Use the command PLEASE too little and the interpreter will be offended and ignore the whole program; use it too much and it writes you off as a suck-up and... also ignore the whole program. Its subjectivity feels particularly relevant in an age when AI systems are designed to deliberately confuse the human and algorithmic. The influence of just this one feature can be seen in early parody languages like Chicken and Ook! that undermine the seriousness of the interpreter, to <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/English" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English</a>, where the interpreter was once literally another person but is now downgraded to an AI prompt system. More personally, the interpreter for my <a href="https://github.com/rottytooth/Olympus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">language Olympus</a> has many, competing personalities in the form of the Greek gods, any of which might become offended and ignore the rest of the program, in INTERCAL style.</p>
<p>However, for such an influential esolang, it is one that we experience primarily in derivative forms. The most well-known INTERCAL keyword (apart from PLEASE) is not part of the INTERCAL-72 language at all. That would be the COME FROM statement, an inverse of GOTO, where one has to trace back jumps from destination to source, like cheating in a choose-your-own-adventure book. It was added in 1990 by Eric S Raymond (<a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-eric-s-raymond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed here</a>) for his adaptation C-INTERCAL. The original INTERCAL-72 compiler never left Princeton according to Woods; it is likely that ESR worked from the INTERCAL-72 manual without access to the reference compiler. Almost all who have used the language since then have actually used C-INTERCAL or one of its successors (CLC-INTERCAL etc). These later versions capture much of the spirit of the original but differ significantly in style and content. Now, with access to the original, we can experience INTERCAL-72 first-hand and make new discoveries.</p>
<p>Sean Haas describes the process of getting the ical.sbl (INTERCAL compiler) program running on a modern system, using SPITBOLx64. As he points out, ICAL is actually a transpiler; some of its infamous slowness is due to the overhead of generating a SPITBOL program and executing it. More surprisingly, it avoids SPITBOL's math functions, performing math through pure string manipulation. Sean discusses this in <a href="https://adventofcomputing.libsyn.com/website/episode-158-intercal-rides-again-restoring-a-lost-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latest episode</a> of his podcast, Advent of Code, explaining the infamous thirty seconds needed to perform a single division:</p>
<blockquote><span>The two operations you get, called MINGLE and SELECT, operate on binary data. Internally, ICAL will store numbers as a string of binary digits. A 4 becomes "100", for instance. When you operate on that number it's done as a string operation. The result is that any operation with numbers become this convoluted mess, both in INTERCAL and in the final output SPITBOL. Hence, 30 second divides.</span></blockquote>

See episode eight, which finds Jack battling a copy of himself — made from his own anger. Lingering shots of trees on fire, gorgeously painted, punctuate the fight.</span></p><p>Toward the end, Jack realizes that his emotions are out of control. We cut to a burning tree again, and the camera moves in closer, up to the bark. Then the flames stop, and the tree dissolves, and a calm waterfall appears. After almost a minute and 20 seconds of no talking (and no characters on screen), we snap to Jack’s face. Yet a story’s been told.</p><p><span>This stuff asked a lot of the kids in Cartoon Network’s audience. Tartakovsky was defiant about it. “I’ve always felt that kids are a lot smarter than we’ve given them credit for, but we’ve never given them a chance to figure things out as they’re watching television,” he said in one interview. Elsewhere: “as long as I can make films, I’ll always treat kids as adults and at the same intelligence level as I am.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-3-158580375" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>The network execs gave him that freedom. Mike Lazzo greenlit the show’s loose, bare pitch over dinner. Linda Simensky explained, “Genndy had done such a good job up until that point — if there was anyone we could trust, it was Genndy.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-4-158580375" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p>In fact, she said, “[W]e were really just excited about the fact that it was so different and so unusual.”</p><p><span>Tartakovsky’s team put together a test for </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0g8zOF7RCQ" rel="">watch</a><span>), animated by the outsource crew in Korea. The higher-ups didn’t </span><em>request</em><span> a test, but Tartakovsky wanted proof. “[I]t came back. And it </span><em>worked</em><span>,” he remembered. Two minutes of wordless action and atmosphere held up. Something similar happened with episode one:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… luckily for us, the overseas </em><span>[team]</span><em> did an amazing job, and the first episode came back, and I remember being like, “Wow. There’s something here.” ... And the first episode was so silent, too, ‘cause we had that whole flashback sequence ... Mike Lazzo and Linda Simensky ... </em><span>[go in to watch it]</span><em>, and then you’re sitting in this little editing office … and it’s complete silence. ... I’m looking at them, and they don’t have any expression on their faces. And I go, “Wow.” Then I start sweating.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He figured the show was dead — but the execs were fascinated. “Speechless” was the word Lazzo used.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-5-158580375" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> This huge, costly experiment in visual storytelling went ahead.</span></p><p><span>Tartakovsky credits a lot of </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span>’s success to art director Scott Wills. “It really came together when [he] came aboard. ‘Cause when Scott started to paint, all of a sudden, we had lighting, we had mood and atmosphere,” he said in the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>These things were critical for the show. Again: images couldn’t carry without depth and richness. Tartakovsky was looking at live-action movies from the ‘60s and ‘70s — </span><em>Doctor Zhivago</em><span>, </span><em>Lawrence of Arabia</em><span>, Kurosawa films.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-6-158580375" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> Another main influence was Hayao Miyazaki’s work. As Tartakovsky said, films like these:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>… really made the background a character. ... It all kind of came down to filmmaking with me. Because usually we are drawing these backgrounds and they’ll just get a pan and then we’ll just go to the next sequence. I wanted to do, maybe, a minute or two sequence of just establishing the environment. You really get to feel where Jack is … It’s like watching </em><span>Lawrence of Arabia</span><em>, you really </em><span>feel</span><em> that desert. And it’s a really cool feeling and so I thought, “Ah, how much cooler would you feel if you’re looking at these great drawings with this really unique color and a great mood?”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>He wanted to treat background paintings like classic movies treat landscapes — which wasn’t </span><em>done</em><span> on American television. But </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> did it. And Wills’ painting techniques (which we covered </span><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/162725246/painting-the-samurai-jack-way" rel="">in a recent issue</a><span>) made it possible.</span></p><p>The style was unique. Wills took from mid-century cartoons — the abstract geometry and color — and blended them with other things. He wanted to “combine everything that’s good about realistic painting and feature [animation] painting, and everything that’s good about [UPA-type] stylization,” he said. The idea was to “have cinematic lighting, with mood and depth, but at the same time have it feel stylized.”</p><p><span>For the backgrounds to remain engaging across the series, freshness mattered: there were frequent new locations and surprising color choices. “We’d have … a rule: no green grass, no blue sky,” Tartakovsky recalled.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-7-158580375" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3807719,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/158580375?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07071bb1-d085-4dbc-91e1-2752fea1dcbc_2000x1500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Stills from </span><em>Samurai Jack</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>And all of this stuff had to be handled delicately, for technical reasons. </p><p><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> doesn’t use black outlines for its characters.

There were communication gaps between the studios. Dan Krall, the show’s co-art director, put it this way:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Samurai Jack is like a flesh tone, right? And the way that it works — you don’t paint every single background. You paint a giant key of a location and ship it overseas, and they do all the layout shots overseas. So, if ... </em><span>[a]</span><em> portion of the sky, or whatever, ...</em><span> [ends up]</span><em> flesh-toned, the sequence comes back and then Jack’s nose disappears against the sky because they’re the same color.

Here’s Linda Simensky:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Tartakovsky noted that most people would associate </em><span>Dexter</span><em>’s art direction with UPA, but to him, timing was most important, and the director Robert “Bobe” Cannon in his UPA period was most influential. Cannon, he noted, developed funny, interesting movement and timing for each character, so that every character moves in its own unique way. Tartakovsky noted that he tried to do the same with Dexter and Dee Dee and that each character moved with his or her own stylized animation.</em><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-14-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-14-158580375" target="_self" rel="">14</a></span></p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif" width="550" height="414" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:414,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1147790,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://animationobsessive.substack.com/i/158580375?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc513a7-2ba3-47c4-bd71-99932d4f6434_550x414.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>A snippet of animation from </span><em>Samurai Jack</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>You find a Cannon-like approach across </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span>. Everything is clipped and defined — and there isn’t much interest paid to realism. There are long, long holds and looping motions. Action is segmented: Jack and the others tend to move quickly and then abruptly pause, in a rhythm. Above all, we feel the characters </span><em>through</em><span> their timing, and each bit of motion is treated as a creative problem to solve.</span></p><p><span>Tartakovsky argued that animation “was created … to show funny, new, interesting movements and images,” and that kind of invention was his goal here.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-15-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-15-158580375" target="_self" rel="">15</a></span></p><p>Once again, it was the hard work of the artists in Korea that made it happen. “I wanted it to not just be an overseas studio,” Tartakovsky said. He was looking for more of a partnership with Rough Draft: “we gave them front credit, and then when we won awards, they won awards.” </p><p><span>One crucial figure was directing animator Jim Jeong — Tartakovsky wrote that he “was one of the best animators on </span><em>Dexter’s Lab</em><span> and then I hand-picked him to supervise </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span>.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-16-158580375" href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-visual-world-of-samurai-jack#footnote-16-158580375" target="_self" rel="">16</a></span><span> Like Paul Rudish of the</span><em> Jack</em><span> team said:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>... it was just really great that</em><span> </span><em>Jim could get involved and really try to, you know, inject his own personal stuff into it. And feel like he had an opportunity to do that. Usually, it’s just, you know, “Get it done, get it done, get it done.” But he actually cared and ...

But Cartoon Network took risks back then. Craig McCracken’s </span><em>Powerpuff</em><span> had been a risk — a large one, which had paid off.</span></p><p><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> never reached that level. It was </span><em>popular</em><span>, though. And that, according to the cynical view, shouldn’t have been possible. Even with its robots and samurai and demons and zombies, </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> didn’t really fit with the mass culture of its time. </span></p><p><span>“All this stuff we do is classic film techniques.

Not much on TV was willing to tell stories this way — especially in animation. The show talked up to its viewers. It was often goofy, but it was rarely less than smart. </span></p><p><span>What it did was hard to do. Tartakovsky and the team — in the States and abroad — did it anyway. Plenty of shows went safer than </span><em>Samurai Jack</em><span> and were bigger in its day.

<p>In 1995, musician and producer Brian Eno made a profound observation about computer sequencers that has become increasingly relevant in our AI-powered world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The great benefit of computer sequencers is that they remove the issue of skill, and replace it with the issue of judgement. With Cubase or Photoshop, anybody can actually do anything, and you can make stuff that sounds very much like stuff you’d hear on the radio, or looks very much like anything you see in magazines. So the question becomes not whether you can do it or not, because any drudge can do it if they’re prepared to sit in front of the computer for a few days, the question then is, ‘Of all the things you can now do, which do you choose to do?’”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-parallel-to-ai">The Parallel to AI</h2>
<p>Eno’s insight perfectly captures what’s happening with AI tools today. Just as computer sequencers democratized music production, AI is democratizing a wide range of creative and professional tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing and content creation</li>
<li>Image generation and design</li>
<li>Code development</li>
<li>Data analysis</li>
<li>Problem-solving</li>
</ul>
<p>The technical barriers that once separated amateurs from professionals are rapidly dissolving. Anyone with access to AI tools can now produce work that, at least superficially, resembles professional output.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-differentiator-judgement">The New Differentiator: Judgement</h2>
<p>As Eno predicted, the key differentiator is no longer technical skill but judgement. When everyone can generate content, code, or designs, the real value lies in:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowing what to create</strong>: Understanding what’s worth making in the first place</li>
<li><strong>Making meaningful choices</strong>: Selecting the right approach from countless possibilities</li>
<li><strong>Evaluating quality</strong>: Distinguishing between good and great outputs</li>
<li><strong>Understanding context</strong>: Applying the right solution to the right problem</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-future-of-work">The Future of Work</h2>
<p>As AI continues to evolve, we’ll see more roles shift from technical execution to strategic judgement. The most valuable professionals will be those who can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the right questions</li>
<li>Frame problems effectively</li>
<li>Make sound decisions</li>
<li>Provide meaningful direction to AI tools</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Eno’s observation from nearly 30 years ago has become a blueprint for thriving in the AI era. The question is no longer “Can you do it?” but “What should you do, and why?” As technical barriers continue to fall, our ability to exercise good judgement becomes our most valuable asset.</p> </div></div>]]></description>
