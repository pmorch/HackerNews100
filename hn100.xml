            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.alaindichiappari.dev/p/software-engineering-is-back">https://blog.alaindichiappari.dev/p/software-engineering-is-back</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46923543">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I don’t post a lot. But when I do, it’s because I think few people are saying out loud what I’m noticing.</p><p>I’ve been building a product from the ground up. Not the “I spun up a Next.js template” kind of ground up. I mean from network configuration to product design to pricing decisions. Truly end to end. And I’ve been doing it using frontier models and coding agents for hours and hours every single day, both on this project and in my full time work. I’ve been trying to stay away from the chaos and the hype, filtering hard for what is actually valuable.</p><p>Since December 2025, things have dramatically changed for the better. Many have noticed. Few are drawing the right conclusions.</p><p>Antirez likes to call it “automated programming”, and I really like that framing. It captures the essence far better than the shallow, almost dismissive label of “vibe coding”. Automation was at the core of most of the work and cultural revolutions of human history. The printing press, the loom, the assembly line. This one doesn’t differ much.</p><p>Most of my work is still there. I still have to deeply think about every important aspect of what I want to build. The architecture, the trade offs, the product decisions, the edge cases that will bite you at 3am. What’s gone is the tearing, exhausting manual labour of typing every single line of code.</p><p>At this point in time, models and tools, when put in a clean and maniacally well set up environment, can truly make the difference. I can be the architect without the wearing act of laying every single brick and spreading the mortar. I can design the dress without the act of cutting and sewing each individual piece of fabric. But I can do all of this with the experience on my back of having laid the bricks, spread the mortar, cut and sewn for twenty years. If I don’t like something, I can go in, understand it and fix it as I please, instructing once and for all my setup to do what I want next time.</p><p>Automated programming especially allows me to quickly build the tools I need so fast that every blacksmith that ever existed on this earth would envy me deeply. Finally able to really focus on the things they have in mind. Finally dedicating more time of their craft to the art they conceive, not the sweat of the forge.</p><p>It’s been months now that I have this thought crystallized in my mind. It is so clear to me that I genuinely don’t understand why everyone is not screaming it to the world.</p><p>We can finally get rid of all that middle work. That adapting layer of garbage we blindly accepted during these years. A huge amount of frameworks and libraries and tooling that has completely polluted software engineering, especially in web, mobile and desktop development. Layers upon layers of abstractions that abstract nothing meaningful, that solve problems we shouldn’t have had in the first place, that create ten new problems for every one they claim to fix.</p><p>Think about what happened. We, as an industry, looked at the genuine complexity of building software and instead of sharpening our thinking, we bought someone else’s thinking off the shelf. We wrapped everything in frameworks like wrapping a broken leg in silk. It looks nice. The leg is still broken.</p><p>In my mind, besides the self declared objectives, frameworks solve three problems. Two explicit and one obvious but never declared.</p><p><strong>“Simplification”.</strong><span> Software engineers are scared of designing things themselves. They would rather accept someone else’s structure, despite having to force fit it into their product, rather than taking the time to start from the goal and work backwards to create the perfect suit for their idea. Like an architect blindly accepting another architect’s blueprints and applying them regardless of the context, the needs, the terrain, the new technological possibilities. We decided to remove complexity not by sharpening our mental models around the products we build, but by buying a one size fits all design and applying it everywhere. That is not simplification. That is intellectual surrender.</span></p><p><strong>Automation.</strong><span> This is the only point I can actually, more or less, understand and buy. Boilerplate is boring work. I hate it. And I especially hate using libraries that I then need to study, keep updated, be aware of vulnerabilities for, just for the purpose of removing the creation of duplicated but necessary code. Think about ORMs, CRUD management, code generation, API documentation and so on. The grunt work that nobody wants to do but everybody needs done. Fair enough. But hold that thought, because this is exactly the point where everything changes.</span></p><p><strong>Labour cost.</strong><span> This is the quiet one. The one nobody puts on the conference slide. For companies, it is much better having Google, Meta, Vercel deciding for you how you build product and ship code. Adopt their framework. Pay the cost of lock in. Be enchanted by their cloud managed solution to host, deploy, store your stuff. And you unlock a feature that has nothing to do with engineering: you no longer need to hire a software engineer. You hire a React Developer. No need to train. Plug and play. Easy to replace. A cog in a machine designed by someone else, maintaining a system architected by someone else, solving problems defined by someone else. This is not engineering. This is operating.</span></p><p>In my opinion Software engineering, the true one, is back again.</p><p>I am not speaking out of my lungs only. I’ve been developing this way almost flawlessly for over two years at this point. But the true revolution happened clearly last year, and since December 2025 this is obvious to anyone paying attention. From now on it will be even more so.</p><p>We have the chance again to get rid of useless complexity and keep working on the true and welcome complexity of our ideas, our features, our products. The complexity that matters. The complexity that is actually yours.</p><p>Automation and boilerplating have never been so cheap to overcome. I’ve been basically never writing twice the same line of code. I’m instantly building small tools I need, purpose built, exactly shaped around the problem at hand. I don’t need any fancy monorepo manager. A simple Makefile covers 100% of my needs for 99% of my use cases. When things will get very complicated, and if they get very complicated, I’ll think about it. But only then. Not a second before. This is engineering. You solve the problem you have, not the problem someone on a conference stage told you that you’ll eventually have.</p><p>Agents are really well prepared when it comes to basic tools. Tools that have been around not for months, but literally for decades. Bash was born in 1989, just preceding me by two months. The most mediocre model running at this time knows bash better than any person in the world. Bash is the universal adapter. It is not a coincidence that coding agents are shifting from complex and expensive MCP configurations to a simple agent loop with bash as a way to interact, literally, with the world. The oldest tool turned out to be the most future proof. There’s a lesson in there if you care to listen.</p><p>Really think about it.</p><p>Why do you ever need, for most of the use cases you can think of, a useless, expensive, flawed, often vulnerable framework, and the parade of libraries that comes with it, that you probably use for only 10% of its capabilities? With all the costs associated with it. From the “least” expensive: operational costs like keeping everything updated because they once again found a critical vulnerability in your Next.js version. To the most expensive one: the cost to your Design Choices. The invisible cost. The one you pay every day without even realizing it, because you’ve been paying it so long you forgot what freedom felt like.</p><p>If you keep accepting this trade off, you are not only losing the biggest opportunity we’ve seen in software engineering in decades. You are probably not recognizing your own laziness in once again buying whatever the hyperscalers have decided for you. You’re letting Google and Meta and Vercel be your architect, your designer, your thinker. And in exchange, you get to be their operator.</p><p>The tools are here. The models are here. The revolution already happened and most people are still decorating the old house.</p><p>Stop wrapping broken legs in silk. Start building things that are yours.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The staggering and fast-growing cost of AI datacenters is a call for performance engineering like no other in history; it's not just about saving costs – it's about saving the planet. I have joined OpenAI to work on this challenge directly, with an initial focus on ChatGPT performance. The scale is extreme and the growth is mind-boggling. As a leader in datacenter performance, I've realized that performance engineering as we know it may not be enough – I'm thinking of new engineering methods so that we can find bigger optimizations than we have before, and find them faster. It's the opportunity of a lifetime and, unlike in mature environments of scale, it feels as if there are no obstacles – no areas considered too difficult to change. Do anything, do it at scale, and do it today.</p>

<p>Why OpenAI exactly? I had talked to industry experts and friends who recommended several companies, especially OpenAI. However, I was still a bit cynical about AI adoption. Like everyone, I was being bombarded with ads by various companies to use AI, but I wondered: was anyone actually using it? Everyday people with everyday uses? One day during a busy period of interviewing, I realized I needed a haircut (as it happened, it was the day before I was due to speak with Sam Altman). </p>

<p>Mia the hairstylist got to work, and casually asked what I do for a living. "I'm an Intel fellow, I work on datacenter performance." Silence. Maybe she didn't know what datacenters were or who Intel was. I followed up: "I'm interviewing for a new job to work on AI datacenters." Mia lit up: "Oh, I use ChatGPT all the time!" While she was cutting my hair – which takes a while – she told me about her many uses of ChatGPT. (I, of course, was a captive audience.) She described uses I hadn't thought of, and I realized how ChatGPT was becoming an essential tool for everyone. Just one example: She was worried about a friend who was travelling in a far-away city, with little timezone overlap when they could chat, but she could talk to ChatGPT anytime about what the city was like and what tourist activities her friend might be doing, which helped her feel connected. She liked the memory feature too, saying it was like talking to a person who was living there.</p>

<p>I had previously chatted to other random people about AI, including a realtor, a tax accountant, and a part-time beekeeper. All told me enthusiastically about their uses of ChatGPT; the beekeeper, for example, uses it to help with small business paperwork. My wife was already a big user, and I was using it more and more, e.g. to sanity-check quotes from tradespeople. Now my hairstylist, who recognized ChatGPT as a brand more readily than she did <em>Intel</em>, was praising the technology and teaching <em>me</em> about it. I stood on the street after my haircut and let sink in how big this was, how this technology has become an essential aide for so many, how I could lead performance efforts and help save the planet. Joining OpenAI might be the biggest opportunity of my lifetime.</p>

<p>It's nice to work on something big that many people recognize and appreciate. I felt this when working at Netflix, and I'd been missing that human connection when I changed jobs. But there are other factors to consider beyond a well-known product: what's my role, who am I doing it with, and what is the compensation?</p>

<p>I ended up having <strong>26 interviews and meetings</strong> (of course I kept a log) with various AI tech giants, so I learned a lot about the engineering work they are doing and the engineers who do it. The work itself reminds me of Netflix cloud engineering: huge scale, cloud computing challenges, fast-paced code changes, and freedom for engineers to make an impact. Lots of very interesting engineering problems across the stack. It's not just GPUs, it's everything.</p>

<p>The engineers I met were impressive: the AI giants have been very selective, to the point that I wasn't totally sure I'd pass the interviews myself. Of the companies I talked to, OpenAI had the largest number of talented engineers I already knew, including former Netflix colleagues such as Vadim who was encouraging me to join. At Netflix, Vadim would bring me performance issues and watch over my shoulder as I debugged and fixed them. It's a big plus to have someone at a company who knows you well, knows the work, and thinks you'll be good at the work.</p>

<p>Some people may be excited by what it means for OpenAI to hire me, a well known figure in computer performance, and of course I'd like to do great things. But to be fair on my fellow staff, there are many performance engineers already at OpenAI, including veterans I know from the industry, and they have been busy finding important wins. I'm not the first, I'm just the latest.</p>

<h2>Building Orac</h2>

<p>AI was also an early dream of mine. As a child I was a fan of British SciFi, including Blake's 7 (1978-1981) which featured a sarcastic, opinionated supercomputer named Orac. Characters could talk to Orac and ask it to do research tasks. Orac could communicate with all other computers in the universe, delegate work to them, and control them (this was very futuristic in 1978, pre-Internet as we know it). </p>

<p>Orac was considered the most valuable thing in the Blake's 7 universe, and by the time I was a university engineering student I wanted to build Orac. So I started developing my own natural language processing software. I didn't get very far, though: main memory at the time wasn't large enough to store an entire dictionary plus metadata. I visited a PC vendor with my requirements and they laughed, telling me to buy a mainframe instead. I realized I needed it to distinguish hot versus cold data and leave cold data on disk, and maybe I should be using a database… and that was about where I left that project.</p>

<p>Last year I started using ChatGPT, and wondered if it knew about Blake's 7 and Orac. So I asked:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/images/2026/chatgpt_orac_01.png" width="450"></center>

<p>ChatGPT's response nails the character. I added it to Settings-&gt;Personalization-&gt;Custom Instructions, and now it always answers as Orac. I love it. (There's also surprising news for Blake's 7 fans: A <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/blakes-7-reboot-peter-hoar-newsupdate/">reboot</a> was just announced!)</p>

<h2>What's next for me</h2>

<p>I am now a Member of Technical Staff for OpenAI, working remotely from Sydney, Australia, and reporting to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbeck449/">Justin Becker</a>. The team I've joined is ChatGPT performance engineering, and I'll be working with the other performance engineering teams at the company. One of my first projects is a multi-org strategy for improving performance and reducing costs.</p>

<p>There's so many interesting things to work on, things I have done before and things I haven't. I'm already using Codex for more than just coding. Will I be doing more eBPF, Ftrace, PMCs? I'm starting with OpenAI's needs and seeing where that takes me; but given those technologies are proven for finding datacenter performance wins, it seems likely -- I can lead the way. (And if everything I've described here sounds interesting to you, OpenAI is hiring.)</p>

<p>I was at Linux Plumber's Conference in Toyko in December, just after I announced leaving Intel, and dozens of people wanted to know where I was going next and why. I thought I'd write this blog post to answer everyone at once. I also need to finish part 2 of <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2025-08-04/when-to-hire-a-computer-performance-engineering-team-2025-part1.html">hiring a performance engineering team</a> (it was already drafted before I joined OpenAI). I haven't forgotten.</p>

<p>It took months to wrap up my prior job and start at OpenAI, so I was due for another haircut. I thought it'd be neat to ask Mia about ChatGPT now that I work on it, then realized it had been months and she could have changed her mind. I asked nervously: "Still using ChatGPT?". Mia responded confidently: "twenty-four seven!"</p>

<p><span size="-1"><i>I checked with Mia, she was thrilled to be mentioned in my post. This is also a personal post: no one asked me to write this.</i></span></p>

We landed in Kona and shared a sunset dinner by the water. We watched Kīlauea erupt together, lava shooting hundreds of feet into the sky and soot falling from the air like snow. We laughed. We snorkeled. I remember feeling Amy rest her head on my shoulder as we watched the sky burn itself out over the island. It was one of those moments where time seems to slow. Where all you want is for the weight of another person, the sound of their breathing, to stay exactly the same forever. I held that feeling more tightly than I realized at the time.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg" width="568" height="609.046875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1647,&quot;width&quot;:1536,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:568,&quot;bytes&quot;:590333,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47991a71-712c-45ce-b78d-f3e81cd5835b_1536x2048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Omv_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98cad66c-adf3-46aa-86a7-b4dc2ad53d15_1536x1647.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Windy sunset from Mauna Kea</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It was beautiful. It was also haunted. Haunted, because while we were laughing and taking pictures, I was carrying a thought I didn’t want to say: </span><strong>something is wrong</strong><span>.</span></p><p>For weeks before our vacation, I could feel that my girlfriend had a brain tumor. Not in a mystical way. But in the mundane way that comes from living with someone and noticing the small, unexplainable things. Amy was in constant fatigue. Her period inexplicably disappeared for 6 months. Her bone density was poor. All of this despite averaging 10 hours of sleep per night and consistent physical activity.</p><p>We met with some doctors. They initially fixated on the fatigue, citing that it could be any of allergies, stress, vision problems, or burnout. One even suggested that some people just need 10-11 hours of sleep to feel normal. But no one told us exactly what was wrong.</p><p><span>Day by day, Amy experienced more moments of fatigue and sadness. It didn’t just inflict fear in me. It made me feel </span><strong>time</strong><span>. I felt scarcity. I felt pangs of anger every time I wasn’t fully present in the moment with her while dark thoughts pulled me away. Every day we waited to see the next doctor, I tried to salvage moments of joy amidst my running imagination.</span></p><p>When we got back from vacation, Amy turned 25. We had a lovely 12 course dinner. Her roommates and I threw her a surprise party at home. People showed up with less than 24 hours notice on a Monday night. She looked tired but happy, held by all this love.</p><p>And I remember thinking; quietly, privately:</p><p><em>I have no idea what her 26th birthday will look like.</em></p><p>Because earlier that day, Amy had a doctor’s appointment. While I waited for her, my mind juggled between two realities: one where this is nothing, and one where everything is about to change.</p><p>Then I saw the images:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png" width="462" height="442.6442307692308" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1395,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:462,&quot;bytes&quot;:1648037,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JyIG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F758fe8f6-f547-475f-969b-2ea6f6da451c_1761x1687.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>First MRI, Sagittal View</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>My life partner has a brain tumor</em><span>.</span></p><p>The diagnosis was both devastating and relieving.</p><p>Relieving because it wasn’t metastatic. It wasn’t widespread. It wasn’t the worst-case story our brains had been writing.</p><p>Devastating because it was still a brain tumor.</p><p>Amy has a prolactinoma: a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes the body to massively overproduce prolactin. Prolactin is best known for helping mammals produce milk for their babies, but is involved in hundreds of processes, including menstruation. Clinicians often call it “chill,” because it usually doesn’t spread and often responds to dopamine agonists like Cabergoline.</p><p>Amy’s case hasn’t been chill.</p><p><span>Her prolactin levels were supposed to be between 5–20 ng/mL. They were </span><strong>330 ng/mL</strong><span>. The tumor was large, caught late, and growing quickly on the back of her posterior pituitary gland. Normally, you can try Cabergoline for a few months to see if it shrinks the tumor and lowers your prolactin. But according to her care team, if the tumor grew by even 20%, it would threaten her vision.</span></p><p>Surgery was the only option. Prolactinoma resection occurs through a process called a transnasal transsphenoidal surgery. The procedure involves passing a fiberoptic cable up one nostril and surgical tools up the other, cutting an opening in the nasal septum and sphenoid sinus to reach the base of the skull (sella turcica).</p><p>Normally, this surgery is very low risk: the majority of these tumors occur on the anterior (front) pituitary gland, which is easily accessible via the nose. She has a less common posterior (back) pituitary tumor. Her tumor was large and caused intracranial pressure, so the surgeons needed to perform a riskier procedure to lift the pituitary gland to access the tumor.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic" width="424" height="565.2362637362637" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:424,&quot;bytes&quot;:953949,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6c6a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F832eb500-f802-4a09-9634-929489a939bc_1536x2048.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Amy in good spirits in pre-op, first surgery</figcaption></figure></div><p>The morning of Amy’s first surgery, I wrote a journal entry:</p><blockquote><p>It’s currently 9:36am and I’m sitting in a crepe place near UCSF.

She couldn’t bend. I played human-forklift for her backpack and shoes. I held her hand when the intense headaches left her bedridden. I read every page on r/prolactinoma for solutions to her nasal congestion; she couldn’t blow her nose for fear of triggering a spinal fluid leak. I bought a humidifier that left our bedroom musky and damp. She couldn’t use straws or taste food, and still does saline nasal rinses to this day.</p><p>Up until Amy started having symptoms, I worked day and night as an independent consultant on projects advancing human health. In the first half of 2025, I worked on several projects and presentations that have been seen by some of the richest people on Earth, Vitalik, and tons of Tier 1 VCs.</p><p>But when conditions got worse, I happily chose to be Amy’s full-time nurse. I downsized to 10-20 hours of part-time consulting, I feel immense gratitude to have had a work structure that allowed me to be so present.</p><p>Eventually, Amy was well enough to travel again, and we celebrated our wins by taking a vacation to the base of Mt.

One with arguably the top prolactinoma neuroendocrinologist in the world, one with her ENT, and one with her surgeon. We were expecting the doctors to treat her with dopamine agonists to kill the residual tumor tissue. We were expecting her to finally have a “chill” brain tumor.</p><p><span>But Amy’s tumor continued to grow rapidly and had granulated features that made it more likely to spread if untreated. Within weeks of surgery, her prolactin rose again to 100 ng/mL. The prolactinoma neuroendocrinologist warned us that he had seen patients with similar tumors who now faced surgery #4 and radiation treatment #6. Medication was </span><em>technically</em><span> an option, but given the information we were provided, it felt like suicide.</span></p><p>After that appointment, we sat at a Starbucks waiting for the next. I watched Amy swirl a straw around her drink. A straw I then watched her remove. I almost lost it. But I had to keep looking forward. Right there, I promised her that if things were really bad, we’d go to city hall that afternoon. We’d get married and spend the rest of our time together.</p><p>We met the surgeon. He explained that we had a 90% chance at a full cure with a second attempt. We were happy to hear that the remaining tumor healed in a way that made it much more accessible, but confused to have two medical titans paint two pictures of different levels of severity.</p><p>The chance of a full cure shook us out of despair.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png" width="472" height="564.8020833333334" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1838,&quot;width&quot;:1536,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:472,&quot;bytes&quot;:4904968,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://andrewjrod.substack.com/i/186112551?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0a809-0def-4567-a5f4-ee4f5af7d7f8_1536x2048.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FBwJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55e1d305-becc-487d-af33-b9ee42a50d77_1536x1838.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Still in good spirits in pre-op, second surgery</figcaption></figure></div><p>More time off work. More space for prolactin-induced mood swings. More occasions where I didn’t feel present with my closest friends due to emotional burnout. I pinned all of my hopes on this 90% probability. And I hoped that even if the odds were somehow not in our favor, surely the tumor would be so small that the cabergoline could then treat her.</p><p>But I also knew that every time you surgically manipulate the pituitary gland, you increase the risk of permanent brain damage. You increase your risk of getting a condition called diabetes insipidus, or DI which requires a lifetime of cumbersome medication.</p><p>—</p><p>I got the call. The surgery was proclaimed a complete success with no complications! Her surgeon described how they thoroughly examined all suspect areas and removed all suspicious tissue. I finally let myself relax. Amy was in a daze, but recovering well. She even got her own room this time, so I was able to stay overnight.</p><p>The next afternoon, I took a walk to get Amy a caffeine-free, strawless boba with her care team’s blessing. I returned while in the middle of a phone call with a friend when Amy signaled that I needed to get off the phone immediately. She just got back her post-op prolactin levels.</p><p>Prolactin has a half-life of ~50 minutes in our bodies. Because of this quirk, we can tell within 24 hours how a prolactinoma resection went because one’s prolactin could only be elevated if you’re actively secreting excessive amounts. This is how we knew the first surgery was not a complete success when her level was 60ng/mL.</p><p><span>This time, her level was 65ng/mL. </span><em><strong>Higher than after the first surgery</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p>—</p><p><span>My mask came off. I was completely beside myself. I sprinted over to the nurse’s station and demanded to speak to the surgeon, the resident on call, anyone who could explain this, </span><em>immediately</em><span>. It’s the closest I’ve ever come to screaming at someone who didn’t deserve it.</span></p><p><span>A nurse came in and rolled Amy off to get an expedited post-op MRI, something that normally happens 6 weeks after the surgery. After she left, I fell into a fetal position and cried. All the months of being the rock caught up to me at once. I couldn’t hold it anymore. I believed the tumor had spread beyond the pituitary. My whole world collapsed in on itself. My future wife was going to die. I was all but promised this would be over. It was so unfair. I was so </span><em>tired</em><span>.</span></p><p>Since Amy’s second surgery, we’ve spoken with most of the world’s leading prolactinoma experts. Yet even they disagree: some see residual tumor in Amy’s post-op MRIs; others don’t. Some advise cabergoline; others recommend a third surgery. The uncertainty is maddening, but at least they all agree it hasn’t spread.</p><p>A third surgery would have a 5-15% chance of permanent pituitary dysfunction, so Amy’s taking cabergoline. So far, she’s only experienced mild side-effects. We’re optimistic.</p><p>When we asked one of the top prolactinoma experts what causes these tumors, he shrugged: “It’s random, but there’s possibly some genetic weighting.” Amy’s mother may have had one.</p><p><strong>That’s when a horrifying but clarifying thought hit me.</strong></p><p>We want children one day. If there’s a hereditary component (more on this in a future post), there is a non-trivial chance our kids could develop brain tumors. Given how early Amy’s symptoms started, we would have ~20 years before any child of ours might show signs.</p><p>It also happens that today we are on the cusp of a transformation in AI-driven science.</p><p>Do I wait for that transformation to arrive? Or do I choose to use the tools available and deepen our understanding today?</p><p><span>If there’s one thing this year taught me, it’s that the future is uncertain, and you can wake up one day with a “chill” brain tumor just after turning 25. </span><strong>So I’m choosing to act.</strong></p><p>Prolactinomas have a standard of care, yes. But “standard of care” often means “the least bad option we currently have.” The gap between what the best doctors know and what is actually actionable for patients is shockingly wide. I’ve watched in real time how slowly and incompletely scientific knowledge translates into decisions in the clinic.</p><p>At the same time, I’ve consulted with researchers who are building “AI Scientist” systems - agents that can read thousands of papers, propose hypotheses, design experiments, and reason about biology far beyond a human’s cognitive bandwidth. The juxtaposition is impossible to ignore.</p><p>So here’s the real question I’m trying to answer:</p><blockquote><p>Can one motivated researcher with undergraduate-level biology training, armed with state-of-the-art AI scientist tools, and open data, meaningfully advance our understanding of brain tumors?</p></blockquote><p>This isn’t entirely foreign territory for me.</p><p><span>I used to do biophysics research at Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute under Stavros Lomvardas. I’m no stranger to molecular biology, neuroscience, or scientific reasoning. And I’ve spent the last few years embedded in the techbio and AI ecosystems, most recently as an investor at Side Door Ventures. I have above average knowledge about biology. </span><strong>A future state where I comfort myself with thoughts like “there was nothing I could do anyway” is completely wrong, self-soothing bullshit.</strong></p><p>I’m committing to work on this full time. I’ve been reading papers about prolactinomas and trying AI research tools. </p><p>And I’m inviting you to be part of my journey.</p><p>I’ll share my procedure, the papers, the tools, and my goals in much more detail next week.

<p><strong>OpenCiv3</strong> (formerly known by the codename “C7”) is an open-source, cross-platform, mod-oriented, modernized reimagining of <em>Civilization III</em> by the fan community built with the Godot Engine and C#, with capabilities inspired by the best of the 4X genre and lessons learned from modding Civ3. Our vision is to make Civ3 as it could have been, rebuilt for today’s modders and players: removing arbitary limits, fixing broken features, expanding mod capabilities, and supporting modern graphics and platforms. A game that can go beyond C3C but retain all of its gameplay and content.</p>

<p><strong><em>OpenCiv3 is under active development and currently in an early pre-alpha state.</em></strong> It is a rudimentary playable game but lacking many mechanics and late-game content, and errors are likely. Keep up with our development for the latest updates and opportunities to contribute!</p>

<h2 id="get-openciv3-dutch">Get OpenCiv3 “Dutch”</h2>

<h2 id="december-2025-v03-dutch-preview-1-has-been-released">December 2025: v0.3 Dutch Preview 1 Has Been Released!</h2>

<p>The OpenCiv3 team is pleased to announce the first preview release of the v0.3 “Dutch” milestone.  This is a major enhancement over the “Carthage” release, and our debut with standalone mode featuring placeholder graphics without the need for Civ3 media files. A local installation of Civ3 is still recommended for a more polished experience. See the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/">release notes</a> for a full list of new features in each version.</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>Download the appropriate zip file for your OS from <strong><a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/tag/v0.3-dutch-preview-1">the Dutch Preview 1 release</a></strong></p>

<p>All official releases of OpenCiv3 along with more detailed release notes can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/">GitHub releases page.</a></p>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>64-bit Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Other platforms may be supported in future releases.</li>
  <li>Minimum hardware requirements have not yet been identified. Please let us know if OpenCiv3 does not perform well on your system.</li>
  <li>Recommended: A local copy of <em>Civilization III</em> files (the game itself does NOT have to run) from <em>Conquests</em> or the <em>Complete</em> edition. Standalone mode is available with placeholder graphics for those who do not have a copy.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Civilization III Complete</em> is available for a pittance from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3910/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_III_Complete/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">GOG</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="windows-installation">Windows Installation</h3>

<p>This is a Windows 64-bit executable. OpenCiv3 will look for a local installation of <em>Civilization III</em> in the Windows registry automatically, or you may use an environment variable to point to the files.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and extract the zip file</li>
  <li>Double-click <code>OpenCiv3.exe</code></li>
  <li>If it is blocked, you may need to unblock it by
    <ul>
      <li>Right click</li>
      <li>Click on Properties</li>
      <li>Check the “Unblock” checkbox near the bottom buttons in the “Security” section</li>
      <li>Click OK</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If your <em>Civilization III</em> installation is not detected, you can set the environment variable <code>CIV3_HOME</code> pointing to it and restart OpenCiv3</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linux-installation">Linux Installation</h3>

<p>This is an x86-64 Linux executable. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a <em>Civilization III</em> installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Linux system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and extract the tgz file</li>
  <li>Set the <code>CIV3_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. <code>export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"</code></li>
  <li>From that same terminal where you set <code>CIV3_HOME</code>, run <code>OpenCiv3.x86_64</code></li>
  <li>To make this variable permanent, add it to your <code>.profile</code> or equivalent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mac-installation">Mac Installation</h3>

<p>This is a universal 64-bit executable, so it should run on both Intel and M1 Macs. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a <em>Civilization III</em> installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Mac system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the zip; it may complain bitterly, and you may have to tell it to keep the download instead of trashing it</li>
  <li>Double click the zip file, and a folder with <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> and a json file will appear</li>
  <li>If you try to open <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> it will tell you it’s damaged and try to trash it; it is not damaged</li>
  <li>To unblock the downloaded app, from a terminal run <code>xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code>; you can avoid typing the path out by typing <code>xattr -cr </code> and then dragging the <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> icon onto the terminal window</li>
  <li>Set the <code>CIV3_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. <code>export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"</code></li>
  <li>From that same terminal where you set <code>CIV3_HOME</code>, run <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> with <code>open /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code>, or again just type <code>open </code> and drag the OpenCiv3 icon onto the terminal window and press enter</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>OpenCiv3 uses many primitive placeholder assets; loading files from a local <em>Civilization III</em> install is recommended (see platform specific setup instructions above)</li>
  <li>Support for playing Civ3 BIQ or SAV files is incomplete; some files will not load correctly and crashes may occur</li>
  <li>For Mac:
    <ul>
      <li>Mac will try hard not to let you run this; it will tell you the app is damaged and can’t be opened and helpfully offer to trash it for you. From a terminal you can <code>xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code> to enable running it.</li>
      <li>Mac will crash if you hit buttons to start a new game (New Game, Quick Start, Tutorial, or Load Scenario) because it cant find our ‘new game’ save file we’re using as a stand-in for map generation. But you can Load Game and load <code>c7-static-map-save.json</code> or open a Civ3 SAV file to open that map</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other specific bugs will be tracked on the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug">GitHub issues page.</a></li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezydemo">https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezydemo</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46918429">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BreezyBox shell demo for ESP32-S3</h2><a id="user-content-breezybox-shell-demo-for-esp32-s3" aria-label="Permalink: BreezyBox shell demo for ESP32-S3" href="#breezybox-shell-demo-for-esp32-s3"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a demo for how you can turn an ESP32-S3 microcontroller into a <strong>tiny instant-on PC</strong> with its own shell, editor, compiler, and online apps installer. Something like Raspberry Pi, minus the overhead of a full server/desktop grade OS. I think ESP32 is underrated in hobby maker community for this PC-like use case. This demo uses <a href="https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezybox">BreezyBox</a>, my mini-shell ESP-IDF component.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">That sounds too good to be true. What is BreezyBox anyway?</h2><a id="user-content-that-sounds-too-good-to-be-true-what-is-breezybox-anyway" aria-label="Permalink: That sounds too good to be true. What is BreezyBox anyway?" href="#that-sounds-too-good-to-be-true-what-is-breezybox-anyway"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First of all, seeing is believing (click to watch the video):</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://youtu.be/wlDsaQgWCaI" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9645483c92e8eb33557ff954e1f0bedcc64f6cb11587012aa4903117895f428/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f776c4473615167574361492f6d617872657364656661756c742e6a7067" alt="Watch the video" data-canonical-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/wlDsaQgWCaI/maxresdefault.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It started as a "cyberdeck" style crafting project. Then I got carried away with the software part. I chose ESP32-S3 for the base platform. It has the nostalgic appeal of the DOS era PCs, with similar resources, and elbow-deep-in-bytes coding experience, plus modern wireless comms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">ESP32-S3 can do everything those PCs did and more, but that is inconvenient out of the box, because that is not the commercial use case it is positioned for. It also forces away the code bloat. If you are like me, and love small elegant things, and technology that punches way above its weight, you ought to try it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">So anyway, I decided to try and package some key missing parts: a basic vterm, the current working directory (CWD) tracking, a few familiar UNIX-like commands, and an app installer. Believe it or not, the rest is already there in ESP-IDF components, including the elf_loader with dynamic linking.</p>
<p dir="auto">The result is called "BreezyBox", by analogy with the BusyBox commands suite. The name is just a light joke, it is not meant to be a full clone. You can import it with one command in your ESP-IDF project, and if you have some stdio going, even at "Hello World" level, it should mostly just work. I call it a "mini shell", a naïve user might call it an OS (it is not, it runs on FreeRTOS), and you can also call it the userland layer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">This repo is just one possible example</h2><a id="user-content-this-repo-is-just-one-possible-example" aria-label="Permalink: This repo is just one possible example" href="#this-repo-is-just-one-possible-example"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The BreezyBox component leaves the display and other board configuration details to the user's firmware project, providing mainly the vterm/vfs features, and some shell commands. This particular example/demo project supports only one specific dev board: <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-lcd-7b.htm" rel="nofollow">Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B</a> (no affiliation). But you can see how all the parts connect, and adapt it to your display/board, or just copy some code snippets from here.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to Use</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-use" aria-label="Permalink: How to Use" href="#how-to-use"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I suggest just fork it, clone it, and try to make it work on your board. Mine was about 40€; you can start with some random $10 two inch LCD S3 dev board if you like. Hint: LVGL text label control is the easiest path to stdout on LCD that works almost everywhere. You can also start with a headless board over USB console, that takes zero code, and gives you free ANSI codes in standard IDF Monitor in VSCode (or in Tabby).</p>
<p dir="auto">You do not have to write your own font renderer like I did here; that was just to push past 30 FPS on a display slightly too large for this chip.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">License</h2><a id="user-content-license" aria-label="Permalink: License" href="#license"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is free software under <a href="https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezydemo/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing: Help Wanted!</h2><a id="user-content-contributing-help-wanted" aria-label="Permalink: Contributing: Help Wanted!" href="#contributing-help-wanted"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The best help is currently more testing beyond "works on my computer", more shared examples and fun use cases:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">More ELF apps – see the examples at my <a href="https://github.com/valdanylchuk/breezyapps">breezyapps repo</a>, they are super easy to follow. Even a carefully written stdlib C program with no platform-specific bits may work sometimes, also with some ANSI codes. But be sure to verify on the actual ESP32-S3: the memory is tight, the larger PSRAM requires alignment, and there are other limits and quirks. You can publish and install the apps using your own repo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">More full example firmware repositories: for different boards, with different styles. Maybe you provide the basic LVGL text label example on some popular board. Maybe you prefer C++ to plain C. Maybe you embrace the GUI. Maybe you port some retro games. Maybe you even make it work on P4, or C6 (RISC-V, a completely different CPU). Maybe you attach some cool gadgets to it. Maybe you build an extra cool cyberdeck case. Or maybe you reproduce the exact same thing, and just share your setup experience and hands-on impressions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">It would be so cool to see more people using BreezyBox, and to have more ready-to-clone examples for everyone!</p>
<p dir="auto">Have fun!</p>

</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Experimental</strong> - This project is still in development, and not ready for the prime time.</p>
<p dir="auto">A minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust for use by AI.</p>
<p dir="auto">Monty avoids the cost, latency, complexity and general faff of using full container based sandbox for running LLM generated code.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, it let's you safely run Python code written by an LLM embedded in your agent, with startup times measured in single digit microseconds not hundreds of milliseconds.</p>
<p dir="auto">What Monty <strong>can</strong> do:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run a reasonable subset of Python code - enough for your agent to express what it wants to do</li>
<li>Completely block access to the host environment: filesystem, env variables and network access are all implemented via external function calls the developer can control</li>
<li>Call functions on the host - only functions you give it access to</li>
<li>Run typechecking - monty supports full modern python type hints and comes with <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/" rel="nofollow">ty</a> included in a single binary to run typechecking</li>
<li>Be snapshotted to bytes at external function calls, meaning you can store the interpreter state in a file or database, and resume later</li>
<li>Startup extremely fast (&lt;1μs to go from code to execution result), and has runtime performance that is similar to CPython (generally between 5x faster and 5x slower)</li>
<li>Be called from Rust, Python, or Javascript - because Monty has no dependencies on cpython, you can use it anywhere you can run Rust</li>
<li>Control resource usage - Monty can track memory usage, allocations, stack depth, and execution time and cancel execution if it exceeds preset limits</li>
<li>Collect stdout and stderr and return it to the caller</li>
<li>Run async or sync code on the host via async or sync code on the host</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">What Monty <strong>cannot</strong> do:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Use the standard library (except a few select modules: <code>sys</code>, <code>typing</code>, <code>asyncio</code>, <code>dataclasses</code> (soon), <code>json</code> (soon))</li>
<li>Use third party libraries (like Pydantic), support for external python library is not a goal</li>
<li>define classes (support should come soon)</li>
<li>use match statements (again, support should come soon)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">In short, Monty is extremely limited and designed for <strong>one</strong> use case:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>To run code written by agents.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For motivation on why you might want to do this, see:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/" rel="nofollow">Codemode</a> from Cloudflare</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling" rel="nofollow">Programmatic Tool Calling</a> from Anthropic</li>
<li><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp" rel="nofollow">Code Execution with MCP</a> from Anthropic</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents">Smol Agents</a> from Hugging Face</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In very simple terms, the idea of all the above is that LLMs can be work faster, cheaper and more reliably if they're asked to write Python (or Javascript) code, instead of relying on traditional tool calling. Monty makes that possible without the complexity of a sandbox or risk of running code directly on the host.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> Monty will (soon) be used to implement <code>codemode</code> in <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai">Pydantic AI</a></p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>Oh my god, this solves so many problems, I want it.</li>
<li>Why not X?</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Where X is some alternative technology. Oddly often these responses are combined, suggesting people have not yet found an alternative that works for them, but are incredulous that there's really no good alternative to creating an entire Python implementation from scratch.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'll try to run through the most obvious alternatives, and why there aren't right for what we wanted.</p>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: all these technologies are impressive and have widespread uses, this commentary on their limitations for our use case should not be seen as a criticism. Most of these solutions were not conceived with the goal of providing an LLM sandbox, which is why they're not necessary great at it.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Monty</h3><a id="user-content-monty-1" aria-label="Permalink: Monty" href="#monty-1"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: No classes (yet), limited stdlib, no third-party libraries</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Explicitly controlled filesystem, network, and env access, strict limits on execution time and memory usage</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Starts in microseconds</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: just <code>pip install pydantic-monty</code> or <code>npm install @pydantic/monty</code>, ~4.5MB download</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Strictly controlled, see <a href="https://github.com/pydantic/monty/pull/85" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/pydantic/monty/pull/85/hovercard">#85</a></li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Monty's pause and resume functionality with <code>dump()</code> and <code>load()</code> makes it trivial to pause, resume and fork execution</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Docker</h3><a id="user-content-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Docker" href="#docker"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Process and filesystem isolation, network policies, but container escapes exist, memory limitation is possible</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Container startup overhead (~195ms measured)</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Requires Docker daemon, container images, orchestration, <code>python:3.14-alpine</code> is 50MB - docker can't be installed from PyPI</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Volume mounts work well</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, or snapshotting an image and saving it as a Docker image.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pyodide</h3><a id="user-content-pyodide" aria-label="Permalink: Pyodide" href="#pyodide"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython compiled to WASM, almost all libraries available</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Relies on browser/WASM sandbox - not designed for server-side isolation, python code can run arbitrary code in the JS runtime, only deno allows isolation, memory limits are hard/impossible to enforce with deno</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: WASM runtime loading is slow (~2800ms cold start)</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Need to load WASM runtime, handle async initialization, pyodide NPM package is ~12MB, deno is ~50MB - Pyodide can't be called with just PyPI packages</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Virtual filesystem via browser APIs</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal presumably, but hard</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">starlark-rust</h3><a id="user-content-starlark-rust" aria-label="Permalink: starlark-rust" href="#starlark-rust"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://github.com/facebook/starlark-rust">starlark-rust</a>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Configuration language, not Python - no classes, exceptions, async</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Deterministic and hermetic by design</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: runs embedded in the process like Monty, hence impressive startup time</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Usable in python via <a href="https://github.com/inducer/starlark-pyo3">starlark-pyo3</a></li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: No file handling by design AFAIK?</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Impossible AFAIK?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">sandboxing service</h3><a id="user-content-sandboxing-service" aria-label="Permalink: sandboxing service" href="#sandboxing-service"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Services like <a href="https://daytona.io/" rel="nofollow">Daytona</a>, <a href="https://e2b.dev/" rel="nofollow">E2B</a>, <a href="https://modal.com/" rel="nofollow">Modal</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are similar challenges, more setup complexity but lower network latency for setting up your own sandbox setup with k8s.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Professionally managed container isolation</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Network round-trip and container startup time. I got ~1s cold start time with Daytona EU from London, Daytona advertise sub 90ms latency, presumably that's for an existing container, not clear if it includes network latency</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: Pay per execution or compute time</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: API integration, auth tokens - fine for startups but generally a non-start for enterprises</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Upload/download via API calls</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, also the services offer some solutions for this, I think based con docker containers</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">YOLO Python</h3><a id="user-content-yolo-python" aria-label="Permalink: YOLO Python" href="#yolo-python"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Running Python directly via <code>exec()</code> (~0.1ms) or subprocess (~30ms).</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: None - full filesystem, network, env vars, system commands</li>
<li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Near-zero for <code>exec()</code>, ~30ms for subprocess</li>
<li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: None</li>
<li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Direct filesystem access (that's the problem)</li>
<li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal</li>

No, you can get started with Vecti for free and use Vecti for as long as you want
                without needing a card on file. You're only asked to provide a card when you want to
                upgrade your plan.
</p> <div data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw=""><p>
You can choose between a monthly or annual billing cycle.</p><p>
Annual pricing gives you the ability to pay for a plan upfront at a discounted rate.
                Paying for a plan upfront can save up to 20% compared to paying monthly.
</p></div> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">
Your plan automatically renews at the end of each billing cycle, but you can stop it
                from renewing by cancelling at any time. You will still pay the remainder of the
                term for the professional plan.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">
You will not lose any of your work if you downgrade. The projects and workspaces
                will still be available, yet with some limitations. You will not be able to create
                more projects (if you have more than 5 already). You will also lose the
                professional features.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">Yes, we provide free plans for students and teachers! Please contact us.</p> <p data-astro-cid-z6gx6xcw="">

        This is a tool that encrypts files and splits the decryption key among trusted friends
        using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing" target="_blank">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a>.
        For example, you can give pieces to 5 friends and require any 3 of them to cooperate to recover the key.
        No single friend can access your data alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each friend receives a self-contained bundle with <code>recover.html</code>—a browser-based tool that works
        offline, with no servers or internet required. If this website disappears, recovery still works.
      </p>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>Your file is encrypted, the key is split into shares, and friends combine shares to recover it.</p>

      

      <p>Different friend combinations can recover the file (any 3 of 5)</p>

      <p>
          <strong>Your File</strong> → <strong>Encrypt</strong> → <strong>Split key into 5 shares</strong> → <strong>Distribute to friends</strong><br>
          ↓<br>
          <strong>Any 3 friends</strong> → <strong>Combine shares</strong> → <strong>Decrypt</strong> → <strong>File recovered</strong>
        </p>

      <h2>What this is and isn't</h2>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>It is:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>An offline tool that runs in your browser</li>
            <li>A way to split a recovery key among friends</li>
            <li>Open source (Apache-2.0)</li>
            <li>Self-contained—recovery works without this site</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>It isn't:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A service or a company</li>
            <li>An account system or cloud product</li>
            <li>Something that stores your data anywhere</li>
            <li>A backup solution by itself</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Try it in 2 minutes</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/releases/latest/download/demo-bundles.zip">Download the demo bundles</a> (contains 3 sample bundles)</li>
        <li>Open <code>bundle-alice/recover.html</code> in your browser</li>
        <li>Add Bob's and Carol's shares (drag their README.txt files onto the page)</li>
        <li>Watch the automatic decryption when threshold is met</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is the best way to understand what your friends would experience during a real recovery.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>On trust and verification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The code is open source—you can <a href="https://github.com/eljojo/rememory" target="_blank">read it on GitHub</a></li>
        <li>There's a <a href="https://github.com/eljojo/rememory/blob/main/docs/security-audit.md" target="_blank">self-audit document</a> explaining the cryptographic choices</li>
        <li>Everything runs locally in your browser; your files don't leave your device</li>
        <li>Try the demo bundles first to see exactly how it works before using it with real secrets</li>
        <li>Uses <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age" target="_blank">age</a> for encryption—a well-regarded modern tool</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why I built this</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted a way to ensure trusted friends could access important files if something happened to me—without
        trusting any single person or service with everything. Shamir's Secret Sharing seemed like the right approach,
        but I couldn't find a tool that gave friends a simple, self-contained way to recover files together.
        So I built one. I'm sharing it in case it's useful to others.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="1-establish-a-clear-vision"><a href="#1-establish-a-clear-vision">1 Establish a Clear Vision</a></h2><p>You are a human, you know how this world behaves, how your team and colleagues behave, and what your users expect. You have experienced the world, and you want to work together with a system that has no experience in this world you live in. Every decision in your project that you don’t take and document will be taken for you by the AI.</p><p>Your responsibility of delivering quality code cannot be met if not even you know where long-lasting and difficult-to-change decisions are taken.<br>You must know what parts of your code need to be thought through and what must be vigorously tested.</p><p>Think about and discuss the architecture, interfaces, data structures, and algorithms you want to use.
Think about how to test and validate your code to these specifications.</p><h2 id="2-maintain-precise-documentation"><a href="#2-maintain-precise-documentation">2 Maintain Precise documentation</a></h2><p>You need to communicate to the AI in detail what you want to achieve, otherwise it will result in code that is unusable for your purpose.</p><p>Other developers also need to communicate this information to the AI. That makes it efficient to write as much documentation as practical in a standardized format and into the code repository itself.</p><p>Document the requirements, specifications, constraints, and architecture of your project in detail.<br>Document your coding standards, best practices, and design patterns.<br>Use flowcharts, UML diagrams, and other visual aids to communicate complex structures and workflows.<br>Write pseudocode for complex algorithms and logic to guide the AI in understanding your intentions.</p><h2 id="3-build-debug-systems-that-aid-the-ai"><a href="#3-build-debug-systems-that-aid-the-ai">3 Build debug systems that aid the AI</a></h2><p>Develop efficient debug systems for the AI to use, reducing the need for multiple expensive CLI commands or browsers to verify code functionality. This will save time and resources while simplifying the process for the AI to identify and resolve code issues.</p><p>For example: Build a system that collects logs from all nodes in a distributed system and provides abstracted information like “The Data was send to all nodes”, “The Data X is saved on Node 1 but not on Node 2”.</p><h2 id="4-mark-code-review-levels"><a href="#4-mark-code-review-levels">4 Mark code review levels</a></h2><p>Not all code is equally important. Some parts of your codebase are critical and need to be reviewed with extra care. Other parts are less important and can be generated with less oversight.</p><p>Use a system that allows you to mark how thoroughly each function has been reviewed.</p><p>For example you can use a prompt that will let the AI put the comment <code>//A</code> behind functions it wrote to indicate that the function has been written by an AI and is not yet reviewed by a human.</p><h2 id="5-write-high-level-specifications-and-test-by-yourself"><a href="#5-write-high-level-specifications-and-test-by-yourself">5 Write high level specifications and test by yourself</a></h2><p>AIs will cheat and use shortcuts eventually. They will write mocks, stubs, and hard coded values to make the code tests succeed while the code itself is not working and most of the time dangerous. Often AIs will adapt or outright delete test code to let the code pass tests.</p><p>You must discourage this behavior by writing property based high level specification tests yourself. Build them in a way that makes it hard for the AI to cheat without having big code segments dedicated to it.<br>For example, use property based testing, restart the server and check in between if the database has the correct values.</p><p>Separate these test so the AI cannot edit them and prompt the AI not to change them.</p><h2 id="6-write-interface-tests-in-a-separate-context"><a href="#6-write-interface-tests-in-a-separate-context">6 Write interface tests in a separate context</a></h2><p>Let an AI write property based interface tests for the expected behavior with as little context of the rest of the code as possible.<br>This will generate tests that are uninfluenced by the “implementation AI” which will prevent the tests from being adapted to the implementation in a way that makes them useless or less effective.</p><p>Separate these tests so the AI cannot edit them without approval and prompt the AI not to change them.</p><h2 id="7-use-strict-linting-and-formatting-rules"><a href="#7-use-strict-linting-and-formatting-rules">7 Use strict linting and formatting rules</a></h2><p>Use strict linting and formatting rules to ensure code quality and consistency. This will help you and your AI to find issues early.</p><h2 id="8-use-context-specific-coding-agent-prompts"><a href="#8-use-context-specific-coding-agent-prompts">8 Use context specific coding agent prompts</a></h2><p>Save time and money by utilizing path specific coding agent prompts like <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#:~:text=Create%20CLAUDE.md%20files">CLAUDE.md</a>.</p><p>You can generate them automatically which will give your AI information it would otherwise as to create from scratch every time.</p><p>Try to provide as much high level information as practical, such as coding standards, best practices, design patterns, and specific requirements for the project. This will help the AI to generate code that is more aligned with your expectations and will reduce lookup time and cost.</p><h2 id="9-find-and-mark-functions-that-have-a-high-security-risk"><a href="#9-find-and-mark-functions-that-have-a-high-security-risk">9 Find and mark functions that have a high security risk</a></h2><p>Identify and mark functions that have a high security risk, such as authentication, authorization, and data handling. These functions should be reviewed and tested with extra care and in such a way that a human has comprehended the logic of the function in all its dimensions and is confident about its correctness and safety.</p><p>Make this explicit with a comment like <code>//HIGH-RISK-UNREVIEWED</code> and <code>//HIGH-RISK-REVIEWED</code> to make sure that other developers are aware of the importance of these functions and will review them with extra care.</p><p>Make sure that the AI is instructed to change the review state of these functions as soon as it changes a single character in the function.<br>Developers must make sure that the status of these functions is always correct.</p><h2 id="10-reduce-code-complexity-where-possible"><a href="#10-reduce-code-complexity-where-possible">10 Reduce code complexity where possible</a></h2><p>Aim to reduce the complexity of the generated code where possible. Each single line of code will eat up your context window and make it harder for the AI and You to keep track of the overall logic of your code.<br>Each avoidable line of code is costing energy, money and probability of future unsuccessful AI tasks.</p><h2 id="11-explore-problems-with-experiments-and-prototypes"><a href="#11-explore-problems-with-experiments-and-prototypes">11 Explore problems with experiments and prototypes</a></h2><p>AI written code is cheap, use this to your advantage by exploring different solutions to a problem with experiments and prototypes with minimal specifications. This will allow you to find the best solution to a problem without investing too much time and resources in a single solution.</p><h2 id="12-do-not-generate-blindly-or-to-much-complexity-at-once"><a href="#12-do-not-generate-blindly-or-to-much-complexity-at-once">12 Do not generate blindly or to much complexity at once</a></h2><p>Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable tasks for the AI. Instead of asking the AI to generate the complete project or component at once, break it down into smaller tasks, such as generating individual functions or classes. This will help you to maintain control over the code and it’s logic.</p><p>You have to check each component or module for its adherence to the specifications and requirements.<br>If you have lost the overview of the complexity and inner workings of the code, you have lost control over your code and must restart from a state where you were in control of your code.</p></article></div>]]></description>
