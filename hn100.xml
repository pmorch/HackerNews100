<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    <p>Well, if you are reading this obituary, it looks like I’m dead. WOW, it actually happened … I died of FOMO due to complications of Bulbar ALS.</p>
<p>My name is Linda Brossi Murphy, and I was just 60 years old when I died on Sunday evening, September 21, 2025 – way too young!&nbsp; As the saying goes, I “died peacefully while surrounded by loved ones” … &nbsp;I was loved, comforted, and hugged until my last breath by my beautiful family and a couple of my besties!</p>
<p>My stupid Bulbar ALS got me to the sad point of not being able to talk. Never speaking means never being able to say, “I love you!” It means not being able to call my Mr. BoJangles over for a snack, and it means not being able to order at the Dunkin’ drive through.&nbsp;As far as eating, it totally stinks to sit at the table while people around you are eating juicy burgers hot off the grill, heaping piles of Chinese food, a healthy portion of pasta Alfredo, or Chipotle — and I just have to smile and act like I’m enjoying my bowl of puréed baby mush! Living had gotten to be such an overwhelming burden every day, day after day. I always did my very best not to let anyone know “the back story” of my daily suffering and struggles with ALS. Hubby and I just plowed through each day trying to put our best selves out there for the public eye. Hair and make up done, smiles on….</p>
<p>I am leaving behind some amazing people. My husband, David, aka “Hubby,” who I have adored, unconditionally from the first moment I laid eyes on him 42 years ago! We were together from teenagers to grandparents. Our marriage was mostly good and crazy fun. We both agreed, I was an “A” wife and he was a “B+” husband for a total “A-” which is pretty decent for 42 years together!!! We became a thruple about 1.5 years ago when, Hosee, (my respirator) moved into our marital bed. From then on, David woke up next to what looked like a fighter pilot with smooshed hair!</p>
<p>I had a wonderful family, David Jr. and Ali (Bragg) &amp; Bode and Scottie Murphy of Charlestown, Doug and Kate (Farrell) &amp; Connall Murphy of Milton and Adam and Justine (Murphy) &amp; Harvey Hastings of Bolton. My family has been amazing and the absolute best thing about my life. These peeps have filled my heart to overflowing levels! Michael Brossi of Marlborough and Dave Brossi of Westboro, my brothers, have been my life long support system and partners, I loved them deeply.&nbsp;A lot of dear cousins, my wonderful Auntie Terry Ciarcia, Aunt Pam Nicolazzo, and lots of nieces and nephews.&nbsp;I was recently predeceased by my amazing father, David Brossi. The salt of the earth- a pillar of wisdom, grace, and character. He was always my example of exemplary integrity and as well as one of my favorite humans. Sadly, he lost his mother and daughter of the same sucky disease, Bulbar Onset ALS.</p>
<p>Sticking with formality for a moment… I was born March 7, 1965 in Boston to David and the late Patricia Brossi. I grew up in Framingham, MA. I attended St. Bridget’s School, Marian High School, and Assumption University (Class of 1987). After I graduated, I had a brief stint as a Nursing Home Administrator until David Jr. was born, then stayed home and hatched a couple more pups over the next few years.&nbsp;In 2000, I formally joined the family real estate business and worked there until I was diagnosed… with ALS (I kept working through my long battle with cancer 12 years ago) … Yikes!! Cancer…THEN ALS. Ugh, Honestly, you can’t make this stuff up! I am very proud of the book I wrote about my journey through cancer. Check it out, it’s called “F Off Cancer” by Linda Brossi Murphy.</p>
<p>My favorite pastime was being with my family &amp; friends, hence why FOMO did me in! I also adored having fun, anytime, anywhere! No matter what I was doing, I had fun. I was a very happy person to the core. I also enjoyed feeding the birds, gardening, “playing” the piano when no one was home, playing games on my phone (especially Words With Friends! Overall, I think I was a nice person, except on ‘WWF’- sorry, losers!) drinking wine, boating, playing Rummikub with great friends, walking 9 holes of golf on a lovely day, a half-day of skiing, traveling and dancing every chance I could (with my arms in the air, of course).</p>
<p>I lived my life with two super powers. My first, of which everyone was jealous, was that I could drink as much as I wanted and never seemed to get a hangover … the real wonder is why I didn’t die of liver failure. My second super power is that I was always genuinely happy and absolutely loved to be with nice people.</p>
<p>In addition to my awesome family, I leave a bunch of very dear Murphy in-laws, too many to name, and my father-in-law, Joseph Murphy, who was married to my awesome late mother-in-law and dear friend, Betty Murphy. I was blessed to have had the very mostest bestie Michelle Loranger, along with with a plethora of very dear friends, too many to mention, you know who you are and how important you were to me… My advice is to say “yes” to the party, the trip, the adventure – and while you are there, please raise a glass and “Cheers” for me!</p>
<p>Please be kind to everyone: the telemarketer, the grocery clerk, the Dunkin’s staff, the tailgater, your family, your friends. Speak nicely and positively. Is there really ever a reason to be negative? I don’t think so…</p>
<p>My last donation was made on the way to the funeral home. They swung my body through Massachusetts General Hospital so I could drop off my brain and spinal cord for ALS research. I sincerely ask you all,&nbsp;in lieu of flowers, please consider a generous donation to Compassionate Care ALS.org &nbsp;<a href="https://ccals.org/in_memory_of/linda-murphy/">https://ccals.org/in_memory_of/linda-murphy/</a>&nbsp; as CCALS has helped me and so many other live a better life while struggling with ALS.</p>
<p>So to my earthly existence, I say farewell. It was a blast while it lasted. We sure did have fun!</p>
<p>If you want to come and say hi to my peeps, calling hours are at the McCarthy, McKinney &amp; Lawler Funeral Home, 11 Lincoln Street in Framingham on Sunday, September 28, 2025 from 3:00 – 7:00 pm.</p>
<p>If you were a stinker and meanie to me or my family or friends during my lifetime … Please do everyone a favor and STAY AWAY, we don’t want your negative drama &amp; energy. Only nice, loving people are welcome!</p>
<p>The family will have a private burial.</p>
<p>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don’t waste money on flowers.&nbsp;Buy a bunch of scratch tickets and give them out to strangers along your way.&nbsp;Make people happy, that is the best way that you can honor my memory.</p>
<p>A celebration of life will be held at The Verve Hotel, 1360 Worcester St. Natick, on Monday, September 29, 2025 from&nbsp;6:00 – 9:00 pm. Please join my family to celebrate my life, have a glass of wine…some tasty nibbles… and don’t forget to bring your dancing shoes and your favorite story to share about me and my shenanigans! This is a great location for out-of-town guests to stay in a hotel as well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was lucky enough to make a few friends my first semester of college. We ended up hanging out quite a bit during those early months.</p><p>We’d all get excited for the weekends because Friday nights meant going out to party. Everyone except for Anna, that is.</p><p>Anna was quiet, shy, and a definitely a goody-two-shoes. She was from Alabama and spoke with a pronounced southern drawl I’d rarely heard in Maryland. She was reserved but friendly once you got to know her. Anna cared about school a lot. She was almost always studying whenever I saw her.</p><p>Every Friday night we’d make plans to go out together and party. But Anna would always refuse to come. She’d say something along the lines of “I have to study” or “I just don’t feel like it tonight.”</p><p>Eventually, we stopped inviting Anna out. Everyone except Alexei.</p><p>I liked Alexei the most in our friend group. He was valedictorian of his high school, played tennis at a competitive level, and was remarkably smart. If anyone deserved to have an ego, it was Alexei. Yet somehow he managed to be the kindest person I’d ever known. But my absolute favorite thing about Alexei was that he always invited Anna to come party with us.</p><p>One Friday night as we were all about to leave the dorms for a house party, Alexei stopped us. “Hold on, let’s invite Anna.” We headed over to her dorm and invited her to come with us. She said “Sorry, I have to study for my Arabic exam next week, but you guys have fun.”</p><p>Alexei continued to invite Anna every time we went out for the rest of the semester. And Anna said no every single time.</p><p>Curious about his persistence, I asked him “Why do you keep inviting Anna out when she’ll just say no?”</p><p>I’ll never forget what he told me: “I know she’s always going to say no, but that’s not the point. I invite her out so she’ll always feel included in the group.”</p><p>After that first semester, the friend group disbanded and we all went our separate ways. Many years later I ran into Anna and we ended up catching up. She told me how difficult her first semester of college had been. She was very close with her mom and sister and missed them them terribly.</p><p>But then she said something that stayed with me: She was grateful. She was grateful to be part of that brief friend group because she felt like she had a family away from home. And that even though she never partied with us, she always felt included because we would stop by her room and invite her anyway.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Ruby Central recently took over a collection of open source projects from their maintainers without their consent. <a href="https://pup-e.com/goodbye-rubygems.pdf">News</a> of the takeover was first <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckinator.bsky.social/post/3lz6exzgtcc2j">broken</a> by <a href="https://pup-e.com/">Ellen</a> on 19 September.</p>
<p>I have spoken to about a dozen people directly involved in the events, and seen a recording of a key meeting between Ruby Gems maintainers and Ruby Central, to uncover what went on.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary of what I know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ruby Central was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S6l_RZwuxM">struggling for money</a>.</li>
<li>Sidekiq withdrew its $250,000/year sponsorship for Ruby Central because they <a href="https://ruby.social/@rubycentral/114585914969796428">platformed DHH at RailsConf 2025</a>.</li>
<li>Shopify demanded that Ruby Central take full control of the RubyGems GitHub repositories and the <code>bundler</code> and <code>rubygems-update</code> gems, threatening to withdraw funding if Ruby Central did not comply.</li>
<li>HSBT jumped the gun and implemented the takeover plan adding Marty Haught as an owner and reducing maintainers permissions before Marty had discussed this with the maintainers.</li>
<li>Marty met with the maintainers after their access was temporarily restored.</li>
<li>Marty (and by extension, Ruby Central) understood that Ruby Central did not have the right to take over these GitHub repositories or gems from their long established community maintainers.</li>
<li>Marty presented alternatives such as making a fork of the relevant RubyGems projects and warned Ruby Central of the consequences of doing the takeover.</li>
<li>The board voted to execute the takeover anyway and Marty executed it immediately.</li>
<li>A number of board members subsequently misrepresented the takeover to the Ruby community on social media.</li>
<li>This was premeditated. Shopify had organised an on-call rotation to take over from the previous maintainers, some of which at the time were also operating the RubyGems Service.</li>
<li>Shopify specifically demanded that at least one of the RubyGems maintainers, André Arko, be excluded from returning to the project. André has been working on RubyGems for over a decade and was also one of the founders of Ruby Together, an organization that merged with Ruby Central.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-takeover">The Takeover</h2>
<p>On <strong>9 September</strong>, HSBT (Hiroshi Shibata) — a member of Ruby core and maintainer of RubyGems — renamed the RubyGems GitHub enterprise to “Ruby Central”, added a new owner, Marty Haught, and downgraded the permissions of several other maintainers.</p>
<p>According to one of the maintainers, when HSBT was challenged, he refused to revert these changes claiming he needed permission from Marty. On <strong>15 September</strong>, Marty said the changes were a mistake and HSBT reverted <em>some</em> of the changes. However, Marty was not removed as an owner, even though the other maintainers never agreed to him being added.</p>
<p>On <strong>17 September</strong>, RubyGems maintainers met with Marty on Zoom.</p>
<p>Marty explained he’s been working on “operational planning” for the RubyGems Service. He was putting together a new Operator Agreement that all the operators of the RubyGems Service would need to sign.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that it had been identified as a risk that there were external individuals with ownership permissions over repositories that are necessary for running the RubyGems Service. He said HSBT prematurely changed the ownership permissions before the operational plan was complete.</p>
<p>During the discussion, the maintainers clarified with Marty the distinction between the RubyGems source code and the RubyGems Service.</p>
<p><strong>RubyGems</strong> is a collection of community owned, community maintained repositories of code that are held in commons for everyone in the Ruby community to use.</p>
<p>The <strong>RubyGems Service</strong> is entirely separate from that. It’s a specific deployment: a domain name and servers that happen to be running RubyGems source code. It is operated by Ruby Central.</p>
<p>This distinction is important. Anyone else could run the RubyGems source code on their own servers with their own domains. And Ruby Central could decide to run <em>different</em> source code on its servers — whether that be a fork of the RubyGems source code or otherwise.</p>
<p>The RubyGems maintainers have been developing this software for decades, predating Ruby Central’s operation of the RubyGems Service. Their contributions represent countless hours of unpaid work, establishing a clear history of community ownership and stewardship.</p>
<p>Ruby Central did contribute financially towards RubyGems maintenance, but these contributions did not confer ownership. Ruby Central’s funding of RubyGems development is no different than if they had contributed to the development of Rails, RSpec, or any other open source project. In no case would such funding grant them ownership rights over the project itself.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ruby Central’s employment of some RubyGems maintainers to operate the RubyGems Service does not transfer ownership of the separate open source projects.</p>
<p>Having personally reviewed a recording of this meeting, I have no doubt that Marty understood this distinction. The RubyGems source code and GitHub organisation was <em>not</em> owned by Ruby Central, even though Ruby Central operated a service with the same name.</p>
<p>On <strong>18 September</strong>, the team started losing access again. This time they were <em>removed</em> from the GitHub organisation, their <code>rubygems.org</code> email accounts were disabled and they were removed as owners of the <code>bundler</code> and <code>rubygems-update</code> gems. One maintainer, André Arko, was on-call for the RubyGems Service at the time when his access to GitHub and Fastly was revoked.</p>
<p>The Ruby Central board had voted for Ruby Central to take control of the RubyGems GitHub repositories and gems. And since Marty was now an owner, he was able to execute this order.</p>
<h2 id="ruby-central-becomes-mostly-dependent-on-shopify">Ruby Central becomes mostly dependent on Shopify</h2>
<p>When Ruby Central decided to platform DHH at the final RailsConf, they lost $250,000 USD of annual sponsorship from Sidekiq, and this I understand left them almost entirely dependent on Shopify.</p>
<p>An anonymous source told me that during Rails World, members of Ruby Central, Ruby Core, Rails Core and representatives from major companies (Shopify, GitHub) discussed possible funding options.</p>
<p>According to this source, Ruby Central was presented with a proposal for long-term support, but this would only happen if certain RubyGems maintainers were removed.</p>
<p>Another source has confirmed to me that a meeting between Rails Foundation and Ruby Central did take place at Rails World, however they were not able to verify the agenda or who was in attendance.</p>
<p>I do know that the Rails World conference was attended by HSBT, DHH, Aaron Patterson, Amanda Perino, Shan Cureton, Marty Haught, Ufuk Kayserilioglu and Rafael França.</p>
<p>I also know that Shopify specifically put immense financial pressure on Ruby Central to take full control of the RubyGems GitHub organisation and Ruby gems.</p>
<p>Freedom Dumlao, a Ruby Central board member, described the board vote saying “if I had voted the other way, I felt I’d be voting to start the process of shutting down Ruby Central”.</p>
<p>A source familiar with the events told me that Shopify’s pressure was both carrot and stick. Essentially, do what we ask and we’ll reward you with <em>more</em> funding, long-term financial stability. Don’t do this and you’ll never see a dollar of enterprise money again.</p>
<p>This to me strongly suggests that other companies were involved, perhaps through the Rails Foundation. But I have not been able to confirm anything beyond Shopify’s involvement.</p>
<h2 id="the-vote">The Vote</h2>
<p>According to a source familiar with the events, the Ruby Central board was made aware by Marty of the risks and damage this takeover would likely do to the community. Apparently he also highlighted other options besides the takeover, such as forking some of the projects.</p>
<p>Despite this, the board voted in favour of carrying out the takeover and Marty executed it immediately with his new owner privileges.</p>
<p>Shopify had given Ruby Central a hard deadline and it seems that Ruby Central only capitulated at the last moment.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the timing was intentional, but this takeover happened on the second day of the EuRuKo conference in Europe, which meant many outspoken European Rubyists were distracted at the time.</p>
<p>Because this takeover meant locking out most of the RubyGems Service operators including André who was on-call at the time, Shopify had contributed engineers to a new on-call rotation ready to spring into action after the takeover.</p>
<p>Shopify developers had been warming up with their <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commits/master/?author=tenderlove">first commits in six years</a> coming in at the same time as the takeover.</p>
<h2 id="the-response">The Response</h2>
<p>About six hours after Ellen broke the news, Ruby Central published their response: <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/strengthening-the-stewardship-of-rubygems-and-bundler/">Strengthening the Stewardship of RubyGems and Bundler</a>.</p>
<p>A post that feels like AI-generated corporate speak and bears no signature from anyone at Ruby Central willing to take responsibility.</p>
<p>The response says, “To strengthen supply chain security, we are taking important steps to ensure that administrative access to the RubyGems.org, RubyGems, and Bundler is securely managed. This includes both our production systems and GitHub repositories. In the near term we will temporarily hold administrative access to these projects while we finalize new policies that limit commit and organization access rights. This decision was made and approved by the Ruby Central Board as part of our fiduciary responsibility.”</p>
<p>But while Ruby Central has the right to lock down the RubyGems Service infrastructure, it never owned the RubyGems GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>DHH ignored Ellen’s post but instead retweeted the Ruby Central announcement with the caption “Ruby Central is making the right moves to ensure the Ruby supply chain is beyond reproach both technically and organisationally.”</p>
<p>A position that seems to stand in stark contrast to his other opinions. For example, he criticised <a href="https://www.hey.com/apple/">Apple’s control of the App Store</a> and takes the <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-open-source-gift-exchange-2171e0f0">ownership of his own open source projects</a> seriously.</p>
<p>Ruby Central board member and Shopify employee Ufuk Kayserilioglu misrepresented what happened, responding to Bluesky threads. For example he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ufuk.dev/post/3lz757f6zlc2s">said</a>, “Ruby Central has been running the rubygems.org system for years now, so this can hardly be considered a supply chain attack. On the contrary, we have a legal obligation to all the users of the system to keep it safe and secure.”</p>
<p>But no one accused Ruby Central of taking over the RubyGems Service and the takeover of the RubyGems GitHub organization and gems was not required to meet Ruby Central’s legal obligations. Remember, Ruby Central was in full control of what source code it deployed to the RubyGems Service which it operated.</p>
<p>He also said “How is limiting access to critical and shared infra &amp; code a supply chain attack?” once again conflating the RubyGems source code with the RubyGems Service.</p>
<p>On 21 September, Freedom Dumlao published <a href="https://apiguy.substack.com/p/a-board-members-perspective-of-the?triedRedirect=true">A board member’s perspective of the RubyGems controversy</a> in which he claimed “Ruby Central has been responsible for RubyGems and Bundler for a long time. This isn’t a new development, and I’m honestly very confused about the confusion.”</p>
<p>This is a misrepresentation of the real situation where Ruby Central was responsible for operating the RubyGems Service but did not own the RubyGems source code, repositories or gems.</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about supply chain attacks, which I admit is a convenient cover, but I don’t believe is the genuine reason for the takeover.</p>
<p>He then confirms that a deadline loomed. “Either Ruby Central puts controls in place to ensure the safety and stability of the infrastructure we are responsible for, or lose the funding that we use to keep those things online and going. With less than 24 hours to go, we were still working on this. Conversations with some maintainers were still happening as far as I know but the cooperation we were hoping for was not emerging.”</p>
<p>He doesn’t mention Shopify, but based on my other sources, I know it was Shopify that applied this pressure.</p>
<p>“It was clear that we weren’t quite ready yet, but in the end we were out of time. A vote had to be cast so we could ensure we did not lose funding necessary to operate RubyGems. What I voted for, was to direct Marty, Ruby Central’s Director of Open Source, to temporarily remove access and lock down the systems, get operator agreements in place with maintainers, and then re-enable access to those folks who needed and wanted it. Marty did exactly what the board asked of him.”</p>
<p>This again highlights the pressure Shopify put on Ruby Central.</p>
<p>Two sources directly involved told me that access specifically would not be re-enabled for André who had been singled out. Sources have also suggested that Shopify had been pressuring Ruby Central to end their relationship with André and remove him from the RubyGems project for some period of time prior to this taking place.</p>
<p>On 23 September, Ruby Central shared a video address by Shan Cureton (Executive Director, Ruby Central) on behalf of Ruby Central’s board and team.</p>
<p>In it she claims that Bundler and RubyGems came under Ruby Central’s responsibility through the merger with Ruby Together. But Ruby Together never owned Bundler or RubyGems.</p>
<p>She mentioned the departure of a “lead maintainer” [André] and transition of security engineer [Samuel Giddins] as raising questions around access to RubyGems, Bundler and the RubyGems Service.</p>
<p>She says sponsors (plural) and companies who depend on Ruby tooling came to them with supply chain concerns. She explained that they couldn’t reach agreement with existing maintainers in the timelines they were facing.</p>
<p>I have seen the meeting with the maintainers and can tell you the conversation was primarily about ownership, not security. None of the maintainers had a problem with Ruby Central restricting access to the RubyGems Service that it operated.</p>
<p>They had a problem with Ruby Central taking control of the RubyGems open source code repositories and gems, which Ruby Central never owned.</p>
<p>She explains that the board voted to remove administrative and commit privileges until agreements could be put in place. She said it was never meant to be permanent.</p>
<p>She said “this is not a shutdown of community contribution and it’s not permanent”. However, my sources tell me this will be permanent for at least André and likely Samuel.</p>
<p>She said on-call coverage remains in place. We know that André was on-call when his access was revoked, so she must be talking about the new on-call rotation which Shopify contributed to.</p>
<p>She said “all of these changes are being made in good faith.” But we know that these changes were made at Shopify’s request to take control of the RubyGems projects and specifically to exclude André (and likely Samuel too).</p>
<p>She also talked about two new agreements: <strong>Operator Agreements</strong> cover access to production systems for on-call and maintenance responsibilities. <strong>Contributor Agreements</strong> cover access to Bundler and RubyGem code repositories, covering both paid and volunteer maintainers.</p>
<p>The Operator Agreements make sense, but it is not Ruby Central’s place to run the RubyGems projects including Bundler and the RubyGems.org source code, which are community owned as explained previously.</p>
<p>She said, “in most open source projects where the code is a library or framework, you usually don’t see formal operator agreements. People contribute under contributor license agreements, codes of conduct or decisions made by a steering committee. But RubyGems.org is different. It’s not just code, it’s a production service. It runs critical infrastructure for the Ruby ecosystem, processes billions of downloads, stores sensitive metadata and is relied on by companies that have compliance requirements. Because it’s a service, Ruby Central carries the legal liability, the financial exposure and the operational risk. This is why Operator Agreements are necessary. They ensure access is tied to responsibility and accountability.”</p>
<p>Here she conflates RubyGems.org (the source code) with the RubyGems Service operated by Ruby Central and running on the domain name <code>rubygems.org</code>.</p>
<p>Claiming that Ruby Central owns the RubyGems.org repository because it operates a service that uses the source code is like claiming you own Rails because you have a Rails app and sponsored someone who contributed a PR to the project.</p>
<p>It’s confusing because of how the projects are named, and Ruby Central are taking advantage of that confusion.</p>
<p>The reality is Ruby Central never owned the Ruby Gems source code. They could only take it because Marty was added by HSBT without the consent of other maintainers.</p>
<h2 id="rv">RV</h2>
<p>An important piece of context is that André and Samuel started a new cooperative with Kasper Timm Hansen and Sam Stephenson called <a href="https://spinel.coop/">Spinel</a>.</p>
<p>Spinel is developing a new Ruby management tool called <code>rv</code>. It was <a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/08/25/rv-a-new-kind-of-ruby-management-tool/">introduced</a> on 25 August 2025, right before Rails World.</p>
<p>In his blog post, André says, “For the last ten years or so of working on Bundler, I’ve had a wish rattling around: I want a better dependency manager. It doesn’t just manage your gems, it manages your ruby versions, too. It doesn’t just manage your ruby versions, it installs pre-compiled rubies so you don’t have to wait for ruby to compile from source every time. And more than all of that, it makes it completely trivial to run any script or tool written in ruby, even if that script or tool needs a different ruby than your application does.”</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rmfranca.bsky.social/post/3lz7alpobhc2x">Bluesky threads</a> reveal that Rafael França (Shopify / Rails Core) saw this tool as a threat, saying “some of the “admins” even announced publicly many days ago they were launching a competitor tool [rv] and were funding raising for it. I’d not trust the system to such “admin”.”</p>
<p>He also quoted the <code>rv</code> README which says, “Get rid of rvm, rbenv, chruby, asdf, mise, ruby-build, ruby-install, bundler, and rubygems, all at once”, adding the caption “I’m not so sure I trust them to not sabotage rubygems or bundler.”</p>
<h2 id="what-i-dont-know">What I don’t know</h2>
<ol>
<li>I don’t know how each member voted or exactly how the information was presented to the board. I was hoping that someone would leak it to me, but so far that has not happened.</li>
<li>I don’t know if other groups or companies were involved, though circumstantial evidence and hearsay seems to point to this.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any information you can provide, please <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/APOpciMlK7Ek66pnVBSl2kFCZeh3QgemN_lcFjMrHJVjI6Ibyi9PZZToA_jl715i">contact me on Signal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is not clear that Ruby Central’s plans include returning control of the RubyGems codebases to their original owners.</p>
<p>I am concerned that Ruby Central seems to be vulnerable to coercion by Shopify.</p>
<p>I am concerned that Ruby Central’s board with full knowledge of the consequences and the alternatives voted to take over a collection of open source projects from their maintainers without consent. Especially when these maintainers were acting in good faith at the time. This is the organisation we are meant to trust to host our Ruby gems.</p>
<p>I am concerned that Rails Core seems to consider <code>rv</code> a “threat” rather than an exciting development, and I wonder if the “threat” is more Spinel than <code>rv</code>. It seems likely that Spinel would be less susceptible to enterprise coercion and could offer a genuine alternative to RubyCentral’s RubyGems Service.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over two years ago, in <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-and-useful-zig-patterns">one of my first public talks about Ghostty</a>,
I shared my vision for <code>libghostty</code>: an embeddable library for any application
to embed their own fully functional, modern, and fast terminal emulator.
Libghostty is finally starting to take shape, and I'm excited to share
more details about my plans for it.</p>
<p>The first libghostty library will be <code>libghostty-vt</code>: a zero-dependency
library that provides an API for parsing terminal sequences and
maintaining terminal state, extracted directly from Ghostty's real-world proven
core. It doesn't even require libc!</p>
<div><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This post is predominantly a roadmap update for libghostty and announcing what
will be the first shippable component of it. The Zig API is available for testing now, but the C
API is not ready and will be coming very shortly. In both cases, it is early testing quality and
not ready for general usage.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-libghostty">Why libghostty?</h2>
<p>Let's start with some background on why I believe libghostty must exist.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of programs that implement some form of terminal emulation.
The most obvious are the actual general purpose terminal emulators like
Ghostty, Kitty, iTerm2, etc. But terminal multiplexers like
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://zellij.dev/">zellij</a> are
also full terminal emulators!<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Editors embed their own terminal
emulators too, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jediterm">jediterm</a> for
JetBrains products, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xtermjs.org/">Xterm.js</a> for VS Code,
or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/a0514af58955a21401b4c10918a45c9c241a4a74/Cargo.toml#L444">Alacritty</a>
in Zed.</p>
<p>In addition to fully functional terminal emulators, many websites and applications
implement read-only terminal emulation to display logs or command output.
For example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/a-better-logs-experience-with-github-actions/#opening-the-door-to-a-more-colorful-experience">GitHub Actions output</a>
parses simple color sequences (but not much else). And hosting providers
like Vercel or Render implement a simple form of terminal emulation
allowing line clearing and redrawing within build logs as well as
parsing colors.</p>
<p>Many of these implementations are ad-hoc, one-off solutions. They aren't
using any shared library or codebase.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> Terminal emulation is a classic
problem that appears simple on the surface but is riddled with unexpected
complexities and edge cases.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> As a result, most of these implementations
are incomplete, buggy, and slow.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond correctness, implementing any form of terminal emulation is a
<em>waste of time</em> for most developers. Terminal emulation is not the core
business of JetBrains, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Vercel, Render, etc.
It'd benefit them if they could have a stable, reusable solution
that's consistent everywhere.</p>
<p>My answer to this is libghostty: a cross-platform, minimal dependency
library that exposes a C API so feature-rich, correct, and fast terminal
functionality can be embedded by any application anywhere.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-beginning-libghostty-vt">The Beginning: <code>libghostty-vt</code></h2>
<p>The first libghostty library will be <code>libghostty-vt</code>: a zero-dependency
(not even libc) library that provides an API for parsing terminal sequences
and maintaining terminal state such as cursor position, current styles,
text wrapping, and more.</p>
<p>Parsing terminal sequences is the most core functionality of a terminal
emulator, and is required by full terminal emulators like Ghostty down to
simple read-only style-only views such as GitHub Actions or Vercel build output.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser">state diagram</a> might
appear relatively simple at first glance, but an implementation
is unexpectedly challenging to get right. For example,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jediterm/pull/311">Jediterm doesn't handle intermediates correctly</a>,
causing the widely supported "change cursor shape" sequence to swallow
a character in every JetBrains editor at the time of this post.</p>
<p>For style-only parsing, many developers skip the full state diagram. Instead,
they do some light web searching, parse simple
ANSI sequences such as <code>\e[31</code> or <code>\e[41m</code>, and claim "color support."
But style-only sequences are vastly more complex than that, for example they
support RGB which itself can be in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/8cb52323e5575877eef44029c153eda006cece80/src/terminal/color.zig#L400-L438">a dozen formats</a>.
And I still haven't found a single web console that renders
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/8cb52323e5575877eef44029c153eda006cece80/src/terminal/Parser.zig#L672-L722">this complex style sequence</a>
correctly.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup></p>
<p><code>libghostty-vt</code> aims to fix all of this.</p>
<p><code>libghostty-vt</code> is extracted from Ghostty and inherits all of the real world
benefits: SIMD-optimized parsing, very good Unicode support, highly optimized
memory usage, a robust fuzzed and Valgrind-tested codebase, excellent feature
compatibility such as parsing Kitty Graphics Protocol or Tmux Control Mode, and more.</p>
<p>All of this is packaged up into a single zero-dependency C API (it doesn't
even rely on libc), allowing it to be easily embedded into any popular
language ecosystem.</p>
<p>Given the minimal footprint, <code>libghostty-vt</code> will be <strong>widely portable.</strong>
Initial targets will be macOS and Linux for both <code>x86_64</code> and <code>aarch64</code>
architectures, since those are the primary targets for Ghostty the
application. But I plan to expand support to additional targets such as Windows,
embedded devices, and the web via WASM. <code>libghostty</code> will have broader
support than Ghostty the GUI, due to its tighter scope.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-long-term">The Long Term</h2>
<p><code>libghostty-vt</code> is just the beginning. Longer term, we will provide more
<code>libghostty-&lt;x&gt;</code> libs that expose additional functionality such as input
handling (keyboard encoding is a big one), GPU rendering (provide us with
an OpenGL or Metal surface and we'll take care of the rest), GTK widgets
and Swift frameworks that handle the entire terminal view, and more.</p>
<p>As fundamental pieces stabilize, we will continue to offer more and more
functionality. These will be structured as a family of libraries to minimize
dependency requirements, code size, and overall maintenance complexity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="libghostty-vt-status"><code>libghostty-vt</code> Status</h2>
<p>I just merged the pull request
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/8840">exposing <code>libghostty-vt</code> as a Zig module</a>.
This PR includes a minimal example program, too. If you're a Zig developer,
you can start experimenting with <code>libghostty-vt</code> immediately.</p>
<p>The C API isn't ready yet, but it is what I'm working on <em>right now</em> and
it'll be available for testing soon. All of the work required is defining the
C API, since the core logic is of course all there and has been used by Ghostty
for years. Plus, the Ghostty macOS app already consumes an
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/include/ghostty.h">internal-only C API</a>.</p>
<div><p>If you look at the internal-only C header, please ignore the mess. It isn't a <em>good</em> C API. It is
internal-only and exists to satisfy the needs of the macOS application. This isn't a generally
consumable libghostty, although it is used by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://orbstack.dev/">real commercial products
already</a> to embed Ghostty. We'll take a clean slate approach defining the C
API for wider usage.</p></div>
<p>I plan to version <code>libghostty</code> separately from Ghostty the application.
This blog post marks the public alpha (not promising API stability)
and I'm hoping to motivate some developers to come use it and eventually
write some language bindings once the C API is ready.</p>
<p>I hope to ship a tagged version of <code>libghostty-vt</code> within the next 6 months,
but it'll all depend on if its ready or not.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="looking-for-feedback">Looking for Feedback</h2>
<p>We're at the critical stage of libghostty where we're designing the API,
and the best way to design an API is with feedback from real consumers.
Ghostty is one consumer, we have some community members working on other
libghostty-consuming projects, but we could use as many as we can get!</p>
<p>If you see a use case in your projects or organization for libghostty,
please <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/ghostty">join the Ghostty Discord</a> and collaborate
with the developers working on this. If you don't want to join Discord,
email me (email in the footer of this website).</p>
<p>The state of <code>libghostty</code> at this stage could be considered <em>alpha</em>,
so don't expect a polished, stable experience. We're looking for hackers
that want to get on the ground early.</p>
<div><p>The "alpha" quality is with respect to the API (functions and types) itself. The core logic is
shared with Ghostty and is extremely stable and proven in the real world.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-next-frontier">The Next Frontier</h2>
<p>I'm super excited that Ghostty the application has finally reached the
stability where we can start moving towards the <code>libghostty</code> goal.
<code>libghostty</code> is the next frontier for Ghostty and I think it has the
ability to make a far larger impact than Ghostty can as a standalone
application itself.</p>
<p>Don't worry, there's plenty of changes for Ghostty the application
and none of this diminishes my excitement or plans for that. Wider
usage of <code>libghostty</code> will result in a more feature rich and stable
Ghostty application, too, since Ghostty itself is a consumer of
<code>libghostty</code>.</p>
<p>Boo. 👻</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
                

                New York, NY – September 18, 2025 - Following its marketplace monitoring of children’s advertising, BBB National Programs’ Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) recommended that MrBeastYouTube, LLC, and its affiliate Feastables, update their advertising and data collection practices for the MrBeast YouTube channel, Feastables’ Sweepstakes, and the Feastables website to comply with CARU’s Advertising Guidelines, CARU’s Privacy Guidelines, and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p><p>

MrBeast, the online persona of Jimmy Donaldson, is one of the world's most popular content creators on the YouTube platform, with a large fan base of children and young adults. The MrBeast YouTube channel has over 400 million subscribers. In 2022, MrBeast launched Feastables, a chocolate brand that generated over $215 million in revenue in 2024.</p><p>

CARU’s inquiry focused on whether certain advertising on the MrBeast YouTube channel was identifiable as advertising; whether certain claims for Feastables chocolate bars were misleading; whether promotions for Feastables sweepstakes clearly disclosed free means of entry, odds of winning, and minimum age requirements; and whether personally identifiable information was collected from children prior to obtaining verifiable parental consent (VPC).</p><h2>MrBeast YouTube Advertising</h2><p>
CARU observed several MrBeast YouTube videos where the video descriptions and pinned comments contained advertising content unrelated to the videos. This content was not clearly labeled or otherwise identifiable as advertising to children in the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>

Because it would not be clear to children that the video descriptions and pinned comments were advertising messages, CARU determined that MrBeast’s YouTube channel did not comply with CARU’s Ad Guidelines’ provision that advertising should be presented in a way that makes clear to the child audience that it is advertising.&nbsp;</p><p>

CARU accordingly recommended that the channel update its advertising practices to ensure that all advertisements are identifiable as ads to children.</p><p>
In a promotional video later removed from his YouTube channel, MrBeast posted a “Massive Announcement!” where MrBeast debuted the new Feastables chocolate bars and purported to conduct a blind taste test between the new Feastables chocolate bars and “top European chocolates” that showed all tasters preferring the Feastables bar.</p><p>

Although MrBeast contended the taste test demonstration was not intended to be taken seriously, CARU concluded that it would appear to be a valid taste test to children.&nbsp;</p><p>

CARU determined Feastables violated CARU’s Ad Guidelines by misrepresenting that the taste test was a valid demonstration that consumers prefer Feastables chocolate bars’ taste compared to similar chocolates. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>

CARU recommended that Feastables ensure ad claims are truthful and not misleading to children.&nbsp;</p><h2>Feastables Sweepstakes</h2><p>
At the end of the “Massive Announcement” Feastables video, MrBeast announced the “Blue Wave $10K sweepstakes” saying, “…for 30 days straight, we are giving away $10,000 to a lucky customer who scans the QR code on the back of any new Feastables bar…You might win 10 grand…” and to “Upload Your Receipt &amp; Enter to Win. Confirm your purchase below to enter for a chance to win 10k + a year’s supply of our new chocolate. MORE BARS = MORE ENTRIES.”&nbsp;</p><p>

Contrary to CARU’s Ad Guidelines’ provision that sweepstakes promotions must clearly and conspicuously disclose a free means of entry, the free means of entering the sweepstakes was only disclosed in the FAQ section linked to halfway down the page. The FAQ also stated that the minimum age of participation is 16.&nbsp;</p><p>

Based on the overall net impression of the ads for the Blue Wave sweepstakes, CARU determined that the free method of entry was not adequately disclosed. CARU determined that a child may have the reasonable takeaway that they must purchase Feastables chocolate bars to enter the sweepstakes. A second reasonable takeaway is that a child should purchase as many as 10 chocolate bars every day and scan the QR codes to maximize their chances of winning.</p><p>

In MrBeast’s 2024 Halloween sweepstakes, Feastables encouraged participants to submit up to 24 entries daily until October 30 for a chance to win $10,000, with a grand prize of $1,000,000 on Halloween Day. The ad copy stated, “$10,000 USD Daily Winner. Enter with Purchase Through October 30.” In very small print was the disclaimer, “No purchase necessary, Click below for details.” The official rules stated that participants must be at least 13 years old with parental permission and entrants under 13 are not allowed.&nbsp;</p><p>

CARU noted the sweepstakes did not include an age gate to ensure that participants were at least 13 years old, nor did the sweepstakes provide a method, at any point in the sweepstakes entry flow, where participants could enter their parent or guardian’s information to obtain VPC. The entry form required a participant to enter personal information including full name, phone number, address, and email address. To upload the receipt photo, the prompt, “I affirm that I have read, understand and agree to the Official Rules,” was pre-checked.&nbsp;</p><p>

Additionally, the advertisement featured a large countdown timer with the text “Time is Running Out. Buy Feastables for a chance to win $10K,” which CARU determined constituted sales pressure.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sweepstakes Advertising Issues</h2><p>
CARU determined that the Feastables Blue Wave $10K and Halloween $10K sweepstakes did not comply with CARU’s Ad Guidelines by failing to clearly and conspicuously disclose the free means of entry, the minimum age requirements, and the likelihood of winning, and by promoting the overconsumption of chocolate bars.&nbsp;</p><p>

CARU recommended ensuring that material information is disclosed clearly and conspicuously to children in language they can understand, that advertising is clearly identifiable as advertising to the children, and that advertising is truthful, not misleading, and appropriate to the child audience.</p><h2>Sweepstakes Privacy Issues</h2><p>
CARU’s Privacy Guidelines and COPPA require websites directed to children, including mixed audience sites, to obtain VPC before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13. Pursuant to COPPA, mixed audience sites may implement a neutral age-screening mechanism to ensure the site does not collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without first obtaining VPC.</p><p>

CARU determined that the Feastables website was a mixed audience site that appealed to children under the age of 13 as a secondary audience and, therefore, Feastables had a reasonable expectation that children under 13 would visit the website.&nbsp;</p><p>

Therefore, CARU determined that the Feastables Blue Wave $10K and Halloween $10K sweepstakes did not comply with CARU’s Privacy Guidelines and potentially COPPA by failing to provide a neutral age-screening mechanism to ensure the sweepstakes website did not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining VPC.&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Feastables Website Privacy Issues</h2><p>
In its review of the Feastables website, CARU observed a full-page popup that repeatedly solicited the user’s email address with a call to action stating, “MrBeast Wants You to Join the Crew.” When CARU provided an email address through this popup, it discovered that a second popup would generate, soliciting the user’s phone number this time. When testing the network traffic of the site during this interaction, CARU saw evidence that the email and phone contact information was sent to non-affiliate third parties.</p><p>

In light of Feastables’ future plans to solely run sweepstakes for ages 18 and up, CARU further recommended that Feastables consider whether a neutral and effective age gate would be appropriate for future sweepstakes and promotions.</p><p>

Since the opening of the inquiry, CARU has worked with the MrBeast team, which has cooperated to implement CARU’s recommendations regarding CARU’s Advertising Guidelines, CARU’s Privacy Guidelines, and COPPA.</p><p>

In the advertiser statement, MrBeast and Feastables stated that it “appreciates CARU’s mission to promote responsible children's advertising. However, they do not agree with all the conclusions made in the decision or the premises on which they were based. Furthermore, a variety of the issues raised by CARU relate to practices long since revised and/or discontinued. Notwithstanding, MrBeast and Feastables certainly will take CARU's concerns under advisement as it develops future advertisements which appear in children's media.”</p><p>

<p>So when it comes to memory management there are two terms you really need to know, the stack and the heap.</p>
<p>The stack is a region of memory that stores temporary data that is only needed for a short period of time. It operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, meaning that the most recently added data is the first to be removed, as the name suggests. Basically imagine a stack of plates, if you wanna remove one plate you remove the top one, remove the middle plate and disaster awaits in this analogy. The stack is typically used for storing function parameters, local variables, and return addresses. It is fast and efficient because it has a fixed size and does not require dynamic memory allocation.</p>
<p>The size of the stack is usually limited, and if a program tries to use more stack space than is available, it can result in a stack overflow error. This can happen if a function calls itself recursively too many times or if a program allocates too much memory on the stack.</p>
<p>Whereas the heap as the name suggests is a region of memory that is used for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike the stack, the heap does not have a fixed size and can grow or shrink as needed. The heap is typically used for storing data that needs to persist beyond the lifetime of a single function call, such as objects or data structures that are created at runtime. Imagine the heap as a pile of clothes in a disorganized household, you can add or remove clothes as needed and as long as the pile isn’t too big you can find what you need with relative speed and ease. But it will quickly become a nightmare if you let it grow out of control. The heap is managed by the operating system and requires dynamic memory allocation, which can be slower and less efficient than stack allocation.</p>
<p>The heap can also become fragmented over time, since we do not always store data in a contiguous block of memory. This can lead to performance issues and make it more difficult to allocate large blocks of memory.</p>
<h3 id="rusts-borrow-checker">Rust’s Borrow Checker</h3>
<p>Rust’s borrow checker is a a pretty powerful tool that helps ensure memory safety during compile time. It enforces a set of rules that govern how references to data can be used, preventing common programming memory safety errors such as null pointer dereferencing, dangling pointers and so on. However you may have notice the word <strong>compile time</strong> in the previous sentence. Now if you got any experience at systems programming you will know that compile time and runtime are two very different things. Basically compile time is when your code is being translated into machine code that the computer can understand, while runtime is when the program is actually running and executing its instructions. The borrow checker operates during compile time, which means that it can only catch memory safety issues that can be determined statically, before the program is actually run.</p>
<p>This means that basically the borrow checker can only catch issues at comptime but it will not fix the underlying issue that is developers misunderstanding memory lifetimes or overcomplicated ownership. The compiler can only enforce the rules you’re trying to follow; it can’t teach you good patterns, and it won’t save you from bad design choices.</p>
<h3 id="story-time">Story Time</h3>
<p>Last weekend I’ve made a simple CLI tool for myself to help me manage my notes it parses <code>~/.notes</code> into a list of notes, then builds a tag index mapping strings to references into that list. Straightforward, right? Not in Rust. The borrow checker blocks you the moment you try to add a new note while also holding references to the existing ones. Mutability and borrowing collide, lifetimes show up, and suddenly you’re restructuring your code around the compiler instead of the actual problem.</p>
<p>In Zig, we would just allocate the list with an allocator, store pointers into it for the tag index, and mutate freely when we need to add or remove notes. No lifetimes, no extra wrappers, no compiler gymnastics, that’s a lot more straightforward.</p>
<h3 id="but-dave-isnt-that-the-exact-point-of-rusts-borrow-checker">But Dave isn’t that the exact point of Rust’s borrow checker?</h3>
<p>Yes it is, however by using Zig I managed to get most of the benefits of Rust’s memory safety without the complexity or ceremony of the borrow checker. All it took was some basic understanding of memory management and a bit of discipline. I was able to produce two CLI’s that are both memory safe and efficient however the Zig one was way more straightforward and easier to reason about and took less time to write.</p>

<p>This is where a lot of developers trip up, Rust markets itself as a language that produces safe software, great marketing hook, but one tiny problem, memory safety is one puzzle piece of overall software safety. I’m not sure if the Rust foundation does this on purpose sort of a blanket statement to make it seem like memory safety is the end all be all of software safety, or if they just don’t want to constantly prefix safety with memory safety(even though they should).</p>
<p>But back to the main point, memory safety is just one aspect of software safety. You can argue if it’s a big or small piece of the puzzle, I’d say it depends on the software and use-case but it’s definitely not the only piece.</p>
<p>So What exactly is safety in terms of CLI tools?</p>
<p>Memory safety alone does not make a program safe. Your CLI tool can still crash, produce wrong results, corrupt files, leak sensitive data, be vulnerable to various types of attacks or just behave in a way that is not expected. Let’s go back to my <code>Notes CLI</code> it’s rust version may never segfault but it could silently overwrite my index or tags or corrupt my files if I make a mistake in my logic, or perhaps it could store my file in a temporary location that is world readable, exposing my notes to anyone on the system. Is that safe? No.</p>
<p>Would using Zig solve any of those issues automatically, also no.
Is my example a bit contrived, yes, but it illustrates the point that memory safety is not the only thing that matters when it comes to software safety.</p>
<p>In fact you should also consider other aspects of safety such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Predictable Behavior</strong>: The program should do what the user expects, even when input is malformed or unexpected. A CLI that panics on a missing file or fails silently on a corrupted note is not safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding Crashes or Silent Corruption</strong>: The program should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to the user instead of crashing or corrupting data. A CLI that crashes on a malformed note or silently overwrites existing notes is not safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manageable Performance</strong>: The program should perform well under expected workloads, avoiding excessive resource consumption or slowdowns. A CLI that becomes unresponsive when managing a large number of notes is not safe. This is where it really helps to understand memory allocations and performance characteristics of your language of choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensitive Data Handling</strong>: The program should protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or exposure. A CLI that stores notes in a world-readable temporary file is not safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Robustness Against Attacks</strong>: The program should be resilient against common attack vectors, such as injection attacks or buffer overflows. A CLI that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or corrupt data is not safe. And this is precisely where Rust’s memory safety shines, it can help prevent certain types of vulnerabilities that arise from memory mismanagement. However, it’s not a silver bullet that guarantees overall safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-borrow-checker-strengths-and-limitations">The Borrow Checker: Strengths and Limitations</h2>
<p>The borrow checker is impressive. It prevents dangling references, double frees, and mutable aliasing at compile time, things that would otherwise cause segfaults or undefined behavior. It’s why Rust can claim “memory safe without a garbage collector.”</p>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero data races / mutable aliasing issues</strong>: The compiler guarantees that only one mutable reference exists at a time, and that immutable references cannot be combined with mutable ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong compile-time guarantees</strong>: Many memory-related bugs are caught before you even run the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early bug detection</strong>: You find mistakes before shipping code, which is a huge win in long-lived services or concurrent systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations--pain-points">Limitations / Pain Points:</h3>
<p><strong>Cognitive overhead</strong>: You’re constantly thinking about lifetimes, ownership, and borrow scopes, even for simple tasks. A small CLI like my notes tool suddenly feels like juggling hot potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>Boilerplate and contortions</strong>: You end up introducing clones, wrappers (Rc, RefCell), or redesigning data structures just to satisfy the compiler. Your code starts serving the compiler, not the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Compile-time only</strong>: The borrow checker cannot fix logic bugs, prevent silent corruption, or make your CLI behave predictably. It only ensures memory rules are followed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge cases get messy</strong>: Shared caches, global state, or mutable indexes often trigger lifetime errors that are annoying to work around.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the Rust borrow checker can feel more like a mental tax than a helpful tool, especially for short-lived CLI projects. You’re trading developer ergonomics for a compile-time guarantee that, in many CLI scenarios, may be overkill.</p>
<h2 id="zigs-approach-to-safety-and-simplicity">Zig’s Approach to Safety and Simplicity</h2>
<p>Zig takes a different approach to safety and simplicity. It provides manual memory management with optional safety checks, allowing developers to choose the level of control they need. This can lead to more straightforward code for certain use cases, like CLI tools. However where it really shines is how it does manual memory management, I’ve briefly touched upon this in my other blog post <a href="https://dayvster.com/blog/zig-allocators-explained/">Zig Allocators Explained</a>.</p>
<p>But basically long story short Zig gives you allocators, a set of tools that helps you manually manage your memory in a more structured and predictable way. You can choose to use a general purpose allocator like the <code>std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator</code> or you can create your own custom allocator that fits your specific needs. This allows you to have more control over how memory is allocated and deallocated, which can lead to more efficient and predictable memory usage. This combined with Zig’s <code>defer</code> statement which allows you to schedule cleanup code to run when a scope is exited, makes it easy to manage resources gives you most of the power of Rust’s borrow checker at your disposal without the complexity and ritual. However it asks one thing in return of you, discipline, your software will be only as safe as you make it. We can make the same claim about Rust, you can throw <code>copy</code> and <code>clone</code> and <code>unsafe</code> around your code and throw away all the benefits of the borrow checker in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>The two languages are polar opposites in this regard, Zig places the burden on the developer and makes it easy for them to produce memory safe software, whereas Rust places the burden on the compiler and makes it hard for developers to produce memory unsafe software.</p>
<p>Back to the main point, zig’s approach to memory management is in my subjective opinion more practical for most of my use cases, especially for CLI tools. It allows me to write straightforward code that is easy to reason about and maintain, without the overhead of the borrow checker. I can allocate a list of notes, store pointers to them in a tag index, and mutate the list freely when I need to add or remove notes. No lifetimes, no extra wrappers, no compiler gymnastics, that’s a lot more straightforward.</p>
<p>Oh I almost forgot, Zig also has the <code>comptime</code> feature which allows you to execute code at compile time. This can be useful for generating code, performing static analysis, or optimizing performance and even for testing which is a really nice bonus and can be a small helper when it comes to memory safety.</p>
<h2 id="developer-ergonomics-matter-and-developers-are-not-idiots">Developer Ergonomics Matter and Developers are not Idiots</h2>
<p>When developing software we want to be productive and efficient, most of all we want to be correct and produce good software, however we also want to enjoy the process of creation and not feel like we are fighting the tools we use. Developer ergonomics is a term that refers to how easy and comfortable it is to use a programming language or framework. It encompasses things like syntax, tooling, documentation, and community support. A language with good developer ergonomics can make it easier to write correct code, while a language with poor developer ergonomics can make it harder to do so. I’d say as it currently stands Rust has poor developer ergonomics but produces memory safe software, whereas Zig has good developer ergonomics and allows me to produce memory safe software with a bit of discipline.</p>
<p>I personally usually prefer languages where I do not have to succumb to too much ceremony and ritual to get things done, I want to be able to express my ideas in code without having to constantly think about the underlying mechanics of the language and yet I want to be responsible and produce good software. So with C and C++ this was a tiny bit harder as you basically had to learn some useful and practical memory management patterns and techniques, Zig comes with them baked in.</p>
<p>I feel like Zig really respects it’s developers and treats them like adults, it gives you the tools and expects you to use them wisely. Rust on the other hand feels like it treats developers like children that need to be constantly supervised and guided, which can be frustrating and demotivating.</p>
<p>Developers are not idiots, sure even the smartest amongst us still produce memory safety issues or bugs in their software and it’s silly to assume that with enough training and practice we can become perfect developers, but we can become better developers. We can learn from our mistakes and improve our skills, we can learn to write better code and produce better software.</p>
<p>It’s not good to abstract that away to the compiler and assume that it will magically make us better developers, I don’t personally think it will. In fact not to sound too cliche but I think that the journey to becoming a better developer is a series of mistakes and fixes, we learn from our mistakes and improve our skills. What does it say about a language that tries to abstract away the mistakes we make, does it really help us become better developers ?</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Rust is amazing, if you’re building something massive, multithreaded, or long-lived, where compile-time guarantees actually save your life. The borrow checker, lifetimes, and ownership rules are a boon in large systems.</p>
<p>But for small, practical CLI tools? Rust can feel like overkill. That’s where Zig shines. Lightweight, fast, and straightforward, you get memory safety without constantly bending over backward for the compiler. You can allocate a list, track pointers, and mutate freely without extra wrappers, lifetimes, or contortions. Iterating feels natural, the code is easier to reason about, and you get stuff done faster.</p>
<p>Memory safety is important, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Predictable behavior, maintainable code, and robustness are just as critical, and that’s exactly why Zig often feels more practical for real-world CLI tools.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s not about which language is “better.” It’s about what fits your workflow and the kinds of projects you build. For me, Zig hits the sweet spot: memory safe, low ceremony, and developer-friendly, perfect for small tools that actually get things done.</p>

<p>Strategy – how to <em>be</em> strategic, and how to be <em>seen</em> as strategic – is one of my ongoing obsessions. Years ago, I read <a href="https://cate.blog/2019/01/30/book-good-strategy-bad-strategy/" data-type="post" data-id="51305">Good Strategy/Bad Strategy</a>, and it’s guided my thinking ever since.</p>



<p>One of the things that book helps clarify is that <em>being</em> strategic and <em>being seen as</em> strategic can work against each other – good strategy is obvious, and usually it is executed on more than it’s talked about. An ongoing frustration for other under indexed people in tech I talk to, as we build products and organizations without drama, whilst being told we’re just “not strategic” enough. The strategy required to sidestep problems that never happen or that creates optionality to quickly resolve is somehow invisible.</p>



<p>But I think as we rise up the org chart, strategy is the job. Strategy defines your job, and evolves it to meet the organizational need. Not just one strategy, but multiple strategies that need to fit together and be coherent.</p>



<p>Your product strategy. Your technical strategy. Your team strategy. Your you-as-a-leader-but-also-a-human-being strategy.</p>



<p>As we find our groove in the resource constrained era we are in currently as opposed to the everything strategy of ZIRP (zero interest rates), by definition we need to make more harder choices, and strategy is how we know what those choices are, and when and how to make them.</p>

<p>This is the first rule of strategy: strategy is contextual. A crucial insight, because often when leaders fail, it’s because they tried to apply a strategy that worked in one context, to a different one, without considering the difference.</p>



<p>This is true when you change companies, and I think the reason why there is such a high failure rate for executive hires*. Ones I’ve watched fail came in with a playbook, usually including the org chart they wanted, and expended all the goodwill and capital in pursuit of that goal, whilst achieving very little.</p>



<p>It’s also the case that when the market changes, our strategy must change. One of the core features of ZIRP-era engineering leadership was hiring for the sake of it, and number of people as a proxy for many things it maybe (probably) shouldn’t have been. One of the biggest shifts has been the layoffs and the mantra of “doing more with less”. Regardless of personal feelings on this topic and what is actually realistic, it is apparent that hard choices and discipline are a key feature of the post-ZIRP era.</p>

<p><br>We could talk about these strategies – product, technical, team, you, like some balanced stool. But realistically, I think it’s more like the image above. The product strategy is a storm (especially pre-product market fit). The technical strategy is a half built shelter (you’ll get to it properly once you have product market fit). The team strategy is an umbrella (the most flexible and controllable). And the you as a human strategy is nowhere to be found.</p>

This is illogical. The more dynamic the situation, the poorer your foresight will be. Therefore, the more uncertain and dynamic the situation, the more proximate a strategic objective must be. The proximate objective is guided by forecasts of the future, but the more uncertain the future, the more its essential logic is that of “taking a strong position and creating options,” not of looking far ahead.

<p>This is the second rule of strategy: timeframe varies with the level of uncertainty you’re navigating.</p>



<p>The idea of a proximate objective is the next logical step in pursuit of your overall strategy, if you achieve it, you confirm your course. If you fail, you learn and reconsider your options.</p>

<p>We often talk about strategy like it’s defining the end state, setting and describing the destination. But strategy is about defining the incremental steps – the proximate objectives – that can take us towards that end state. Strategy is understanding where we are at – context – and the path from there to where we need to go**. Any strategic “plan”, is best executed as a set of proximate objectives.</p>



<p>This mistake of how strategy is talked about is why it can be so hard for some people to be seen as strategic. When we think strategy is depicting the end state, and undervalue the proximate objective definitions and execution that it takes to get there, the person who talks more about the end state can be seen as more strategic than the person who actually <em>reaches</em> it. </p>



<p>We need four things for strategy:</p>



<ul>
<li>Time – energy – to think deeply about it</li>



<li>Context to situate it</li>



<li>Direction to identify proximate objectives</li>



<li>Expertise to chart the path</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these need to come together to create and deliver an effective strategy. It’s a balance between all of them, leaning into different ones at different times.</p>



<p>To illustrate, why each of these are important, I think it’s helpful to consider the extremes of each.</p>

<p>When someone is all proximate objectives, we call them a thought leader and it’s not a compliment. Execution is an exercise left to the reader.</p>

<p>When someone is all expertise, they present solutions in search of problems. They don’t seem to understand impact.</p>

<p>Devaluing these things gives us a reason not to do them. So many engineers will tell you they hate politics, and yes, there is definitely toxic workplace politics. But there’s a baseline where <strong>politics is getting things done</strong>. It’s convincing people that the idea is good, and that it can be executed. My favourite explanation of this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNGZTkM2xOU">Nik Means talking about Eiffel’s tower</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Context is important</strong>. Yes, you’re delivering something bigger, but the details need to add up. You can’t gloss over all of them, you need to learn how to distinguish which are important and which are not.</p>



<p><strong>Proximate objectives chart your path</strong>. They explain the steps you expect to take between where you are and where you plan to be. Explaining them helps bring people along with you.</p>



<p>Expertise is ultimately how you deliver things, you need to understand how to deliver and how to validate. <strong>Execution is when the strategy becomes real</strong>.</p>



<p>Strategy is hard, and being seen as strategic – especially for under-indexed people – can be even harder. We need all of these four things to develop our strategy and move things forward. And we need to be recognized as doing all of them in order to be seen as strategic.</p>

<p>Coming back to our problems of strategy – the product, technical, team, and you.</p>



<p><strong>Product strategy drives your proximate objectives</strong>. Whilst product strategy may seem like the job of product management – and to a certain extent it is, but hopefully your product team does not operate in a vacuum. Engineering needs to provide input, but engineering also needs to understand the product strategy, because everything else needs to fit in with it.</p>



<p><em>Your team exists for a purpose, and the clearest part of that purpose is delivery of the product strategy. </em>You need direction and alignment to identify proximate objectives. Direction – where the product strategy is going, alignment on what is most important, and what will be delivered when.</p>



<p><strong>Technical strategy evolves the context.</strong> Your technical strategy is often about surfacing the underlying work that allows you to deliver on the business need. It has to be well justified, because ideally it’s pro-active rather than reactive – i.e. you implement it before the emergency rather than during it.</p>



<p>Any technical strategy needs to start with what problem is being solved. A problem is not the absence of a technology – unless, I understand, that technology is AI – but rather the problems that technology would solve. So “we don’t have containers” is not a problem. Number of incidents or environment inconsistencies is.&nbsp;<em>Good technical strategy changes the context over time – making more possible – like building roads on the territory you’ve chartered.</em></p>



<p><strong>Your team strategy must be grounded in execution</strong>. The product and technical strategy define the organizational need. Your team strategy is about how your team is going to meet that organizational need, within the constraints of the business.</p>



<p>Post-ZIRP, this has been a big challenge. Doing more with less means having fewer people, less flexibility, less margin of error. You need to figure out how you retain key people when money is tighter and promotions are harder to come by. But amidst all of these challenges, <em>you have to execute</em>. If in a ZIRP era, you could build the team <em>then</em> deliver, now you must deliver as you build the team.</p>



<p><strong>The you as a person strategy requires that you carve out time to <em>be strategic</em></strong>. In this market, many of us are doing-doing-doing to prove that we’re worth keeping around, but at some point, your job is no longer what is being done this week, and more about what is possible next quarter (and the quarters after that). It’s never been easier to be DDOS’d by the job and think that means we’re doing a good one, but you could be missing key things if you’re too focused on the day to day, or week to week and not enough on the month to month.</p>



<p>To wrap up, strategy is about more than just a vision; it’s about navigating the path to get there. We need to balance time, context, direction, and expertise to ensure we’re not only seen as strategic but are genuinely creating a strategic path forward for the teams we’re responsible for – and our own evolving needs to competently lead them.</p>



<p>* I can’t find a great source here, although the search results suggest it’s commonly accepted <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=40%25+of+executive+hires+fail+&amp;atb=v315-1&amp;ia=web">#</a>. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reasons-executives-fail-2015-3">#</a> possibly, which links out to a site requiring login.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ajmoon.com/posts/mesh-i-tried-htmx-then-ditched-it">https://ajmoon.com/posts/mesh-i-tried-htmx-then-ditched-it</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45345950">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>There is a kind of exciting movement in Web dev right now. Web devs are talking about <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://allenpike.com/2025/javascript-fatigue-ssr">"JavaScript Fatigue"</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://blog.raed.dev/posts/framework-fatigue-the-real-reason-developers-get-angry-about-new-tech">"Framework Fatigue"</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://viktorstanchev.com/posts/exploring-htmx-and-the-revival-of-hypermedia/">"Revival of Hypermedia"</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://hotwired.dev/">"HTML Over The Wire"</a>. In a word: we're asking ourselves why we're building HTML in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The figurehead for this movement is undoubtedly <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>. It shows that much of what we do in JavaScript could instead be done declaratively, with HTML attributes. If browsers adopted these semantics natively, many websites - and even apps - wouldn't need JavaScript at all. I love this idea! Writing HTML first and adding JS on top is the way the Web should work.</p>
<p>At present, we write JavaScript first, and we use it to generate HTML. How did we get it so backwards? I believe the answer is pretty straightforward: SPA frameworks are a joy to use. They impose structure, enforcing conventions, ultimately making it easy to keep concerns separated in one's mind.</p>
<p>My big problem with HTMX, as it stands, is that it lacks that structure. Taking a look at HTMX the first time, my reaction was: "...so, declarative <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>." I could see, as if before my very eyes, the spaghetti that inevitably grows out of a library like this. HTMX leaves it up to the developer to impose discipline on their code, however they see fit.</p>
<p>So, I decided to accept the challenge. I want to do modular SSR the way HTMX encourages, but I want to do it with something like an SPA framework. I want nestable components, each with their own HTML, CSS, and JS - and back-end code - sitting side by side. I want there to be one, and only one, right way to do something.</p>
<p>The result of this journey is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/alex-moon/mesh">MESH - modular element SSR with hydration</a>. MESH is based on a simple principle: <strong>one component = one endpoint</strong>. This is a powerful idea - it allows us to write a HTML-first back-end in such a way that it <em>feels like</em> writing an SPA.</p>
<p><strong>This write-up includes a lot of code snippets. I've tried to keep these minimal. If you want to follow along with more context, you can find the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/alex-moon/mesh/commits/main">whole commit history for MESH on GitHub</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Basic Interactivity</h2>
<p>Looking around, it seemed the back-end of choice for HTMX devs is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://templ.guide/">Templ</a>. I've never really had my "Damascus moment" with Go, but this was a good opportunity to get my feet wet. I will say this much: it is a joy to work with something genuinely blazingly fast to build and deploy.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have a go with proper vibe coding - writing code without reading it - with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/junie/get-started-with-junie.html">Junie</a>. What fun this was! I can see why people would be tempted to write whole apps this way. I'll only say this much: as someone who's battled addiction in the past, I didn't like what I noticed my brain was doing with it. That's a subject for another blog post another time.</p>
<p>My mission was, in a word, to write something like an opinionated framework or "harness" for HTMX which would give me a standard way to use it with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</a>. Specifically, what I had in mind was a "one component one endpoint" model. HTMX would always swap the entire component, which would then be "hydrated".</p>
<p>It turns out there is a standard way to do server-side rendered custom elements, called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/articles/declarative-shadow-dom">Declarative Shadow DOM</a> (DSD). <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2024/08/20/server-first-web-components-with-dsd-htmx-and-islands/">Others have already had some success using HTMX and DSD together</a>. The combo looked promising.</p>
<p>There is one significant limitation, however: HTMX will not cross shadow root boundaries. This is by design, to be clear - this is how we should expect HTMX to behave. No sweat, we can do a simple hack to make it work - and, at the same time, to enforce component-level swaps:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>type</span> {<span>HtmxBeforeSwapDetail</span>} <span>from</span> <span>"./types/htmx"</span>;

<span>function</span> <span>enforceComponentSwap</span>(<span><span>evt</span>: <span>CustomEvent</span>&lt;<span>HtmxBeforeSwapDetail</span>&gt;</span>) {
  <span>const</span> detail = evt.<span>detail</span>;
  <span>let</span> elt = detail.<span>elt</span>;
  <span>let</span> root = elt.<span>getRootNode</span>();
  
  <span>if</span> (root <span>instanceof</span> <span>ShadowRoot</span>) {
    detail.<span>target</span> = root.<span>host</span> <span>as</span> <span>HTMLElement</span>;
    detail.<span>swapOverride</span> = <span>"outerHTML"</span>;
  }
}

<span>document</span>.<span>body</span>.<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>"htmx:beforeSwap"</span>, enforceComponentSwap <span>as</span> <span>EventListener</span>);
</code></pre><p>With this little helper, I can now start building out a very simple Trello clone to prove the concept. Let's build a little editable card component:</p>
<pre><code><span>package</span> card

<span>import</span> (
  <span>"mesh/src/services"</span>
  <span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>type</span> CardProps <span>struct</span> {
  *services.Card
}

templ Card(props CardProps) {
  &lt;mesh-card
    id={ fmt.Sprintf(<span>"card-%d"</span>, props.Card.ID) }
  &gt;
    &lt;template shadowrootmode=<span>"open"</span>&gt;
      &lt;base href=<span>"/"</span>/&gt;
      &lt;link rel=<span>"stylesheet"</span> href=<span>"/static/css/components/card.css"</span>/&gt;
      &lt;div data-view class=<span>"card"</span>&gt;
        &lt;div class=<span>"card-header"</span>&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;{ props.Card.Title }&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=<span>"card-content"</span>&gt;
          { props.Card.Content }
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=<span>"actions"</span>&gt;
          &lt;button <span>type</span>=<span>"button"</span> mesh-click=<span>"edit"</span>&gt;Edit&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;form data-form class=<span>"card hide"</span> hx-patch=<span>"/card"</span>&gt;
        &lt;input <span>type</span>=<span>"hidden"</span> name=<span>"cardID"</span> value={ props.Card.ID } /&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
          Title
          &lt;input <span>type</span>=<span>"text"</span> name=<span>"title"</span> value={ props.Data.Title } /&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
          Content
          &lt;textarea name=<span>"content"</span>&gt;{ props.Data.Content }&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;div class=<span>"actions"</span>&gt;
          &lt;button <span>type</span>=<span>"button"</span> mesh-click=<span>"cancel"</span>&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
          &lt;button <span>type</span>=<span>"submit"</span>&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;/mesh-card&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>Now let's hydrate it. I'm going to start with a simple base element that'll ensure that our shadow root is attached properly and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://htmx.org/examples/web-components/">processed by HTMX</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>MeshElement</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> {
  <span>connectedCallback</span>(<span></span>) { 
    <span>if</span> (!<span>this</span>.<span>shadowRoot</span>) {
      <span>// the browser should do this for us - oh well, what can you do?</span>
      <span>const</span> root = <span>this</span>.<span>attachShadow</span>({ <span>mode</span>: <span>'open'</span> });
      <span>const</span> template = <span>this</span>.<span>querySelector</span>(<span>'template[shadowrootmode="open"]'</span>);
      <span>if</span> (template) {

}
</code></pre><p>Then our card element is straightforward to implement:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> {<span>MeshElement</span>} <span>from</span> <span>"../base/mesh-element.ts"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Card</span> <span>extends</span> <span>MeshElement</span> {

  <span>show</span>(<span><span>selector</span>: <span>string</span></span>) {

    });
  }
}
<span>window</span>.<span>customElements</span>.<span>define</span>(<span>'mesh-card'</span>, <span>Card</span>);
</code></pre><p>This works great! I've enhanced my card component with some basic JS to show that it can be done, and otherwise this is all just plain old HTMX.</p>
<p>The next step is adding functionality to move the cards between columns. This is where we'll run into a common difficulty with HTMX: how to swap out "parent" components given an update on a child component.</p>
<p>Now, HTMX devs have <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/issues/44">a number of differing opinions</a> on how best to go about this. One common practice is to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://htmx.org/examples/update-other-content/">"expand the target"</a>, which means your component needs to be aware of parent components. Another way is to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://htmx.org/headers/hx-trigger/">trigger events in the response headers</a> - this is better, in that it moves responsibility for this back to the server. I believe front-end components shouldn't know anything their own placement on the page.</p>
<p>Fortunately, HTMX gives us another way to do this - and it appears to be the emerging "best practice" - with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap-oob/">"out of band" (OOB) swaps</a>. If, in our response to a call to the card endpoint, we return any other components that need updating, and simply flag them as OOB, HTMX will handle the swaps for us. This best reflects my own aims for MESH, so let's see how we get along doing it this way.</p>
<p>Let's add "promote" functionality to our card component - this will simply move the card one column to the right:</p>
<pre><code><span>package</span> card

<span>import</span> (
  <span>"mesh/src/services"</span>
  <span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>const</span> PutActionPromote = <span>"promote"</span>

<span>type</span> CardProps <span>struct</span> {
  *services.Card
  CanPromote <span>bool</span>
}

templ Card(props CardProps) {
  &lt;mesh-card
    id={ fmt.Sprintf(<span>"card-%d"</span>, props.Card.ID) }
  &gt;
    &lt;template shadowrootmode=<span>"open"</span>&gt;
      &lt;base href=<span>"/"</span>/&gt;
      &lt;link rel=<span>"stylesheet"</span> href=<span>"/static/css/components/card.css"</span>/&gt;
      &lt;div data-view class=<span>"card"</span>&gt;
        &lt;div class=<span>"card-header"</span>&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;{ props.Card.Title }&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=<span>"card-content"</span>&gt;
          { props.Card.Content }
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=<span>"actions"</span>&gt;
          <span>if</span> props.CanPromote {
            &lt;form hx-put=<span>"/card"</span>&gt;
              &lt;input <span>type</span>=<span>"hidden"</span> name=<span>"action"</span> value=<span>"promote"</span> /&gt;
              &lt;input <span>type</span>=<span>"hidden"</span> name=<span>"cardID"</span> value={props.Card.ID} /&gt;
              &lt;button <span>type</span>=<span>"submit"</span> aria-label=<span>"Move to next column"</span>&gt;
                &lt;i data-lucide=<span>"arrow-right"</span>&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
              &lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
          }
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;/mesh-card&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>To handle the OOB updates, we'll write a "context-enriched" pub-sub:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> EventContext <span>struct</span> {
	Context        context.Context
	ResponseWriter http.ResponseWriter
}

<span><span>func</span> <span>(e *EventContext)</span></span> Write(component templ.Component) {
	err := component.Render(e.Context, e.ResponseWriter)
	<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
		http.Error(e.ResponseWriter, <span>"Failed to render OOB updates"</span>, http.StatusInternalServerError)
	}
}

<span><span>func</span> <span>(e *EventService)</span></span> Publish(event Event, w http.ResponseWriter, ctx context.Context) {
  eventContext := EventContext{
    Context:        ctx,
    ResponseWriter: w,
  }
  <span>for</span> _, subscriber := <span>range</span> e.subscribers[event.Key()] {
    subscriber(event, eventContext)
  }
}

<span><span>func</span> <span>(e *EventService)</span></span> Subscribe(key <span>string</span>, subscriber <span><span>func</span><span>(event Event, context EventContext)</span></span>) {
  e.subscribers[key] = <span>append</span>(e.subscribers[key], subscriber)
}
</code></pre><p>Then we can publish in the card handler:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(h *Handler)</span></span> Put(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  card, err := h.getCardFromRequest(r)
  <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
    http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusNotFound)
    <span>return</span>
  }
  action := r.FormValue(<span>"action"</span>)
  <span>switch</span> action {
  <span>case</span> PutActionPromote:
    fromColumn, toColumn, err := h.CardService.Promote(card.ID)
    <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
      http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
    } <span>else</span> {
      h.EventService.PublishCardMoved(card.ID, fromColumn.ID, toColumn.ID, w, r.Context())
    }
    <span>break</span>
  }
}
</code></pre><p>And we can subscribe in the column handler:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(h *Handler)</span></span> OnCardMoved(event *services.CardMovedEvent, context services.EventContext) {
  column, err := h.CardService.GetColumn(event.ToColumnID)
  <span>if</span> err == <span>nil</span> {
    context.Write(h.RenderComponent(column, <span>true</span>))
  } <span>else</span> {
    http.Error(context.ResponseWriter, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
  }
  column, err = h.CardService.GetColumn(event.FromColumnID)
  <span>if</span> err == <span>nil</span> {
    context.Write(h.RenderComponent(column, <span>true</span>))
  } <span>else</span> {
    http.Error(context.ResponseWriter, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>This way, our components can communicate with each other without needing to know about each other. The subscriber takes the request context from the publisher and simply writes to the response. The result is a response from the back-end with</p>
<ol>
<li>the component-specific update, followed by</li>
<li>any other OOB updates simply appended to the response.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we once again run into the same limitation as before: HTMX will not cross shadow root boundaries. At this point, it seems clear that, if we want to use HTMX as intended, we are going to have to give up on shadow DOM entirely. Again, this is intended behaviour. JavaScript should not cross shadow root boundaries by default. What this means is that, if we're wedded to shadow DOM, we are going to have to fight HTMX all the way.</p>
<p>I'm undeterred, of course - all we need is another little hack:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>findInShadow</span>(<span><span>root</span>: <span>any</span>, <span>id</span>: <span>string</span></span>): <span>any</span> {
  <span>const</span> element = root.<span>getElementById</span>?.(id);
  <span>if</span> (element) {
    <span>return</span> element;
  }
  <span>const</span> allElements = root.<span>querySelectorAll</span>(<span>'*'</span>);
  <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> element <span>of</span> allElements) {
    <span>if</span> (element.<span>shadowRoot</span>) {
      <span>const</span> found = <span>findInShadow</span>(element.<span>shadowRoot</span>, id);
      <span>if</span> (found) {
        <span>return</span> found;
      }
    }
  }
  <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
}

<span>function</span> <span>enableOobSwap</span>(<span><span>evt</span>: <span>CustomEvent</span>&lt;<span>any</span>&gt;</span>) {
  <span>const</span> id = evt.<span>detail</span>.<span>content</span>.<span>id</span>;
  <span>const</span> found = <span>findInShadow</span>(<span>document</span>, id);
  <span>if</span> (found) {
    found.<span>outerHTML</span> = evt.<span>detail</span>.<span>content</span>.<span>outerHTML</span>;
    evt.<span>preventDefault</span>();
  }
}

<span>document</span>.<span>body</span>.<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>"htmx:oobErrorNoTarget"</span>, enableOobSwap <span>as</span> <span>EventListener</span>);
</code></pre><p>You'll notice we've done the <code>outerHTML</code> swap ourselves here, overriding HTMX entirely. I'm not a fan of this. I tried as many approaches as I could think of to get HTMX to do the swap - and, thus, leverage existing functionality HTMX provides for these (maintaining scroll position and focus and so on) - but did not succeed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this works for my purposes. I'm happy to leave the problem alone for now. Let's add some drag-and-drop functionality to our cards. In our card component:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> {<span>MeshElement</span>} <span>from</span> <span>"../base/mesh-element.ts"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Card</span> <span>extends</span> <span>MeshElement</span> {
  <span>setupDragAndDrop</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>one</span>(<span>'.grip'</span>, <span><span>grip</span> =&gt;</span> {
      grip.<span>draggable</span> = <span>true</span>;
      <span>this</span>.<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>'dragstart'</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>handleDragStart</span>.<span>bind</span>(<span>this</span>));
      <span>this</span>.<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>'dragend'</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>handleDragEnd</span>.<span>bind</span>(<span>this</span>));
    });
  }

  <span>handleDragStart</span>(<span><span>e</span>: <span>any</span></span>) {
    e.<span>dataTransfer</span>.<span>setData</span>(<span>'text/plain'</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>id</span>);
    <span>this</span>.<span>classList</span>.<span>add</span>(<span>'dragging'</span>);
    e.<span>dataTransfer</span>.<span>effectAllowed</span> = <span>'move'</span>;
  }

  <span>handleDragEnd</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>classList</span>.<span>remove</span>(<span>'dragging'</span>);
  }
}
</code></pre><p>And in our column component:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> {<span>MeshElement</span>} <span>from</span> <span>"../base/mesh-element.ts"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Column</span> <span>extends</span> <span>MeshElement</span> {
  <span>setupDropTarget</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>'dragover'</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>handleDragOver</span>.<span>bind</span>(<span>this</span>));
    <span>this</span>.<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>'drop'</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>handleDrop</span>.<span>bind</span>(<span>this</span>));
  }

  <span>handleDragOver</span>(<span><span>e</span>: <span>any</span></span>) {
    e.<span>preventDefault</span>();
    e.<span>dataTransfer</span>.<span>dropEffect</span> = <span>'move'</span>;
  }

  <span>handleDrop</span>(<span><span>e</span>: <span>any</span></span>) {
    e.<span>preventDefault</span>();
    <span>this</span>.<span>classList</span>.<span>remove</span>(<span>'drag-over'</span>);

    <span>const</span> cardId = e.<span>dataTransfer</span>.<span>getData</span>(<span>'text/plain'</span>);
    <span>const</span> columnId = <span>this</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>id</span>;
    <span>if</span> (!cardId || !columnId) {
      <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>'Missing card or column ID'</span>);
    }

    <span>const</span> position = <span>this</span>.<span>calculateDropPosition</span>(e);
    <span>this</span>.<span>moveCard</span>(cardId, +columnId, position);
  }

  <span>async</span> <span>moveCard</span>(<span><span>cardId</span>: <span>number</span>, <span>columnId</span>: <span>number</span>, <span>position</span>: <span>number</span></span>) {
    <span>window</span>.<span>htmx</span>.<span>ajax</span>(<span>'put'</span>, <span>'/card'</span>, {
      <span>swap</span>: <span>'none'</span>,
      <span>values</span>: {
        <span>action</span>: <span>'move'</span>,
        <span>cardID</span>: cardId,
        <span>columnID</span>: columnId,
        <span>position</span>: position,
      }
    } <span>as</span> <span>any</span>);
  }
}
</code></pre><p>This is great! This use case is precisely why HTMX provides the ajax JS API. With a bit of hacking, we've demonstrated that it's possible to use HTMX to handle modular SSR based on the premise of "component = endpoint". I'm pretty happy with how this has turned out.</p>
<h2>Realtime Collaboration</h2>
<p>From the moment I conceived of this project, one of the things I wanted to do was to support realtime collaboration with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events">server-sent events (SSE)</a>. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://htmx.org/extensions/sse/">HTMX supports SSE with a standard plugin</a> which is easy enough to set up:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>html</span> <span>lang</span>=<span>"en"</span> <span>hx-ext</span>=<span>"sse"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>body</span> <span>hx-ext</span>=<span>"sse"</span> <span>sse-connect</span>=<span>"/sse"</span> <span>sse-swap</span>=<span>"oob-update"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>In theory this should <em>just work</em> once I've written my SSE back-end. I ended up using <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/r3labs/sse">r3labs/sse</a> for this, which I found very easy to use.  We wrap this in a service and provide a "broadcast" method that sends OOB updates to all subscribed clients immediately:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(s *SSEService)</span></span> BroadcastOOBUpdate(component templ.Component) {
   <span>var</span> buf strings.Builder
   err := component.Render(context.Background(), &amp;buf)
   <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
       s.log.Error(<span>"Failed to render component for SSE broadcast"</span>, <span>"error"</span>, err)
       <span>return</span>
   }

   html := buf.String()
   s.server.Publish(<span>"oob-updates"</span>, &amp;sse.Event{
       Event: []<span>byte</span>(<span>"oob-update"</span>),
       Data:  html,
   })
}
</code></pre><p>Then we call it in our handler:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>func</span> <span>(h *Handler)</span></span> OnCardMoved(event *services.CardMovedEvent) {
  column, err := h.CardService.GetColumn(event.ToColumnID)
  <span>if</span> err == <span>nil</span> {
    component := h.RenderComponent(column, <span>true</span>)
    h.SSEService.BroadcastOOBUpdate(component)
  } <span>else</span> {
    h.Log.Error(<span>"Failed to get to-column for SSE broadcast"</span>, <span>"columnID"</span>, event.ToColumnID, <span>"error"</span>, err)
  }

  column, err = h.CardService.GetColumn(event.FromColumnID)
  <span>if</span> err == <span>nil</span> {
    h.SSEService.BroadcastOOBUpdate(h.RenderComponent(column, <span>true</span>))
  } <span>else</span> {
    h.Log.Error(<span>"Failed to get from-column for SSE broadcast"</span>, <span>"columnID"</span>, event.FromColumnID, <span>"error"</span>, err)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>This makes our back-end code a lot cleaner! We no longer need to pass the request context around with our event, and we no longer need to append a bunch of OOB updates to the response. Having done this both ways, I have come to believe that SSE is the most natural way to do these kind of asynchronous cross-context modular updates, even with only a single user.</p>
<p>I was hoping this would also allow me to get rid of my <code>outerHTML</code> hack, but alas it was not to be. The longer I worked on this project, the more it became clear to me that I'm not really using HTMX the way it's intended to be used. More importantly, there is a lot of other HTMX functionality that I'm not using at all.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was intrigued to see if I could just get rid of HTMX entirely. So I did, and the result is a lot cleaner and easier to reason about. We are left with two JS modules - one for the custom elements:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>MeshElement</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> {
  <span>connectedCallback</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span>if</span> (!<span>this</span>.<span>shadowRoot</span>) {
      <span>const</span> root = <span>this</span>.<span>attachShadow</span>({ <span>mode</span>: <span>'open'</span> });
      <span>const</span> template = <span>this</span>.<span>querySelector</span>(<span>'template[shadowrootmode="open"]'</span>);
      <span>if</span> (template) {
        root.<span>appendChild</span>((template <span>as</span> <span>any</span>).<span>content</span>.<span>cloneNode</span>(<span>true</span>));
      }
    }
    <span>this</span>.<span>bindFormHandlers</span>();
  }

  <span>protected</span> <span>bindFormHandlers</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span>const</span> supported = [
      <span>'get'</span>, <span>'post'</span>, <span>'put'</span>, <span>'patch'</span>, <span>'delete'</span>,
    ];

    supported.<span>forEach</span>(<span><span>verb</span> =&gt;</span> {
      <span>const</span> attribute = <span>"mesh-"</span> + verb;
      <span>this</span>.<span>all</span>(<span>'['</span> + attribute + <span>']'</span>, <span><span>el</span> =&gt;</span> {
        <span>const</span> form = el <span>as</span> <span>HTMLFormElement</span>;
        form.<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>'submit'</span>, <span>(<span><span>event</span>: <span>Event</span></span>) =&gt;</span> {
          event.<span>preventDefault</span>();
          <span>const</span> method = verb.<span>toUpperCase</span>();
          <span>const</span> url = form.<span>getAttribute</span>(attribute);

          <span>if</span> (!url) {
            <span>console</span>.<span>error</span>(<span>'No URL specified for form submission'</span>);
            <span>return</span>;
          }

          <span>const</span> formData = <span>new</span> <span>FormData</span>(form);
          <span>this</span>.<span>makeRequest</span>(method, url, formData)
            .<span>then</span>(<span><span>response</span> =&gt;</span> {
              <span>if</span> (response.<span>ok</span>) {
                <span>return</span> response.<span>text</span>();
              } <span>else</span> {
                <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>'Form submission failed: '</span> + response.<span>statusText</span>);

</code></pre><p>And that's it! That's all the JS it takes to replace all of HTMX that I'm using for this project.</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>This was a fun project. First, let me say, if you're writing apps with jQuery, please check out HTMX! It's very dev-friendly and a proper 2020s way of doing <em>that</em> kind of dev. Personally, however, I am happy to have convinced myself it's not for me.</p>
<p>I, for one, don't believe the HTMX spec, or something like it, will be merged back into HTML, at least until it can answer one fundamental question: what is the default swap behaviour? When I declare a <code>form</code> with a <code>method</code>, I understand how that form will behave: it will reload the entire page. What happens when I declare a <code>form</code> with <code>hx-post</code> or equivalent? The default behaviour in HTMX is that the <code>innerHTML</code> of <em>the form itself</em> becomes the swap target. This does not seem like a sane default to me.</p>
<p>So what's the answer? Well, as anyone who's aware of the state of the art on SSR will have noticed, all I've actually done with MESH is reinvent <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://hotwired.dev/">HotWire</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://livewire.laravel.com/">LiveWire</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> and friends. Personally, I find this encouraging! It is clear to me that there is a kind of best practice to be found here.</p>
<p>I believe the default swap behaviour should be: always swap the whole component. One component, one endpoint. This is how these frameworks do it. My problem with them is they lock you into a specific back-end. I believe the principle is generalisable, that there is a way to do this kind of modular SSR in a back-end-agnostic way, like HTMX does. MESH is my attempt to show what that would look like.</p>
<p>I will certainly keep using MESH for my projects, fleshing it out as I go. The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://mesh.ajmoon.com/">Trello clone</a> will always be online for anyone to play with.</p>

It aims to be a human-friendly format, but in striving for that it introduces so much complexity, that I would argue it achieves the opposite result. Yaml is full of footguns and its friendliness is deceptive. In this post I want to demonstrate this through an example.</p><p>This post is a rant, and more opinionated than my usual writing.</p><h2 id="yaml-is-really-really-complex"><a href="#yaml-is-really-really-complex"></a>Yaml is really, really complex</h2><p>Json is simple. <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">The entire json spec</a> consists of six railroad diagrams. It’s a simple data format with a simple syntax and that’s all there is to it. Yaml on the other hand, is complex. So complex, that <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/">its specification</a> consists of <em>10 chapters</em> with sections numbered four levels deep and a dedicated <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/errata.html">errata page</a>.</p><p>The json spec is not versioned. There were <a href="https://youtu.be/-C-JoyNuQJs?t=965">two changes</a> to it in 2005 (the removal of comments, and the addition of scientific notation for numbers), but it has been frozen since — almost two decades now. The yaml spec on the other hand is versioned. The latest revision is fairly recent, 1.2.2 from October 2021. Yaml 1.2 differs substantially from 1.1: the same document can parse differently under different yaml versions. We will see multiple examples of this later.</p><p>Json is so obvious that Douglas Crockford claims <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs">to have discovered it</a> — not invented. I couldn’t find any reference for how long it took him to write up the spec, but it was probably hours rather than weeks. The change from yaml 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 on the other hand, was <a href="https://yaml.com/blog/2021-10/new-yaml-spec/">a multi-year effort by a team of experts</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This revision is the result of years of work by the new <abbr>YAML</abbr> language development team. Each person on this team has a deep knowledge of the language and has written and maintains important open source <abbr>YAML</abbr> frameworks and tools.</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore this team plans to actively evolve yaml, rather than to freeze it.</p><p>When you work with a format as complex as yaml, it is difficult to be aware of all the features and subtle behaviors it has. There is <a href="https://yaml-multiline.info/">an entire website</a> dedicated to picking one of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210/135889">the 63 different multi-line string syntaxes</a>. This means that it can be very difficult for a human to predict how a particular document will parse. Let’s look at an example to highlight this.</p><h2 id="the-yaml-document-from-hell"><a href="#the-yaml-document-from-hell"></a>The yaml document from hell</h2><p>Consider the following document.</p><pre><code>server_config:

    - 9.5.25
    - 9.6.24
    - 10.23
    - 12.13</code></pre><p>Let’s break this down section by section and see how the data maps to json.</p><h2 id="sexagesimal-numbers"><a href="#sexagesimal-numbers"></a>Sexagesimal numbers</h2><p>Let’s start with something that you might find in a container runtime configuration:</p><pre><code>port_mapping:
  - 22:22
  - 80:80
  - 443:443</code></pre><div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>{</span><span>"port_mapping"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1342</span><span>,</span> <span>"80:80"</span><span>,</span> <span>"443:443"</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Huh, what happened here? As it turns out, numbers from 0 to 59 separated by colons are <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#id858600">sexagesimal (base 60) number literals</a>. This arcane feature was present in yaml 1.1, but silently removed from yaml 1.2, so the list element will parse as <code>1342</code> or <code>"22:22"</code> depending on which version your parser uses. Although yaml 1.2 is more than 10 years old by now, you would be mistaken to think that it is widely supported: the latest version libyaml at the time of writing (which is used among others by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/6.0/">PyYAML</a>) implements yaml 1.1 and parses <code>22:22</code> as <code>1342</code>.</p><p>The following snippet is actually invalid:</p><pre><code>serve:
  - /robots.txt
  - /favicon.ico
  - *.html
  - *.png
  - !.git</code></pre><p>Yaml allows you to create an <em>anchor</em> by adding an <code>&amp;</code> and a name in front of a value, and then you can later reference that value with an <em>alias</em>: a <code>*</code> followed by the name. In this case no anchors are defined, so the aliases are invalid. Let’s avoid them for now and see what happens.</p><pre><code>serve:
  - /robots.txt
  - /favicon.ico
  - !.git</code></pre><div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>{</span><span>"serve"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"/robots.txt"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/favicon.ico"</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now the interpretation depends on the parser you are using. The element starting with <code>!</code> is a <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#3212-tags">tag</a>. This feature is intended to enable a parser to convert the fairly limited yaml data types into richer types that might exist in the host language. A tag starting with <code>!</code> is up to the parser to interpret, often by calling a constructor with the given name and providing it the value that follows after the tag. This means that <strong>loading an untrusted yaml document is generally unsafe</strong>, as it may lead to arbitrary code execution. (In Python, you can avoid this pitfall by using <code>yaml.safe_load</code> instead of <code>yaml.load</code>.) In our case above, PyYAML fails to load the document because it doesn’t know the <code>.git</code> tag. Go’s yaml package is less strict and returns an empty string.</p><h2 id="the-norway-problem"><a href="#the-norway-problem"></a>The Norway problem</h2><p>This pitfall is so infamous that it became known as “<a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/">the Norway problem</a>”:</p><pre><code>geoblock_regions:
  - dk
  - fi
  - is
  - no
  - se</code></pre><div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>{</span><span>"geoblock_regions"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"dk"</span><span>,</span> <span>"fi"</span><span>,</span> <span>"is"</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>"se"</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What is that <code>false</code> doing there? The literals <code>off</code>, <code>no</code>, and <code>n</code>, in various capitalizations (<a href="https://yaml.org/type/bool.html">but not any capitalization</a>!), are all <code>false</code> in yaml 1.1, while <code>on</code>, <code>yes</code>, and <code>y</code> are true. In yaml 1.2 these alternative spellings of the boolean literals are no longer allowed, but they are so pervasive in the wild that a compliant parser would have a hard time reading many documents. Go’s yaml library therefore <a href="https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/tree/v3.0.1#compatibility">made the choice</a> of implementing a custom variant somewhere in between yaml 1.1 and 1.2 that behaves differently depending on the context:</p><blockquote><p>The yaml package supports most of <abbr>YAML</abbr> 1.2, but preserves some behavior from 1.1 for backwards compatibility. <abbr>YAML</abbr> 1.1 bools (yes/no, on/off) are supported as long as they are being decoded into a typed bool value. Otherwise they behave as a string.</p></blockquote><p>Note that it only does that since version 3.0.0, which was released in May 2022. <a href="https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/commit/b145382a4cda47600eceb779844b8090b5807c4f">Earlier versions behave differently</a>.</p><h2 id="non-string-keys"><a href="#non-string-keys"></a>Non-string keys</h2><p>While keys in json are always strings, in yaml they can be any value, including booleans.</p><pre><code>flush_cache:

  priority: background</code></pre><div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>{</span></span>

<span id="cb10-5">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Combined with the previous feature of interpreting <code>on</code> as a boolean, this leads to a dictionary with <code>true</code> as one of the keys. It depends on the language how that maps to json, if at all. In Python it becomes the string <code>"True"</code>. The key <code>on</code> is common in the wild because <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on">it is used in GitHub Actions</a>. I would be really curious to know whether GitHub Actions’ parser looks at <code>"on"</code> or <code>true</code> under the hood.</p><h2 id="accidental-numbers"><a href="#accidental-numbers"></a>Accidental numbers</h2><p>Leaving strings unquoted can easily lead to unintentional numbers.</p><pre><code>allow_postgres_versions:
  - 9.5.25
  - 9.6.24
  - 10.23
  - 12.13</code></pre><div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>{</span><span>"allow_postgres_versions"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"9.5.25"</span><span>,</span> <span>"9.6.24"</span><span>,</span> <span>10.23</span><span>,</span> <span>12.13</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Maybe the list is a contrived example, but imagine updating a config file that lists a single value of 9.6.24 and changing it to 10.23. Would you remember to add the quotes? What makes this even more insidious is that many dynamically typed applications implicitly convert the number to a string when needed, so your document works fine most of the time, except in some contexts it doesn’t. For example, the following Jinja template accepts both <code>version: "0.0"</code> and <code>version: 0.0</code>, but it only takes the true-branch for the former.</p><pre><code>{% if version %}
  Latest version: {{ version }}
{% else %}
  Version not specified
{% endif %}</code></pre><h2 id="runners-up"><a href="#runners-up"></a>Runners-up</h2><p>There is only so much I can fit into one artifical example. Some arcane yaml behaviors that did not make it in are <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#68-directives">directives</a>, integers starting with <code>0</code> being octal literals (but only in yaml 1.1), <code>~</code> being an alternative spelling of <code>null</code>, and <code>?</code> introducing a <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#example-mapping-between-sequences">complex mapping key</a>.</p><h2 id="syntax-highlighting-will-not-save-you"><a href="#syntax-highlighting-will-not-save-you"></a>Syntax highlighting will not save you</h2><p>You may have noticed that none of my examples have syntax highlighting enabled. Maybe I am being unfair to yaml, because syntax highlighting would highlight special constructs, so you can at least see that some values are not normal strings. However, due to multiple yaml versions being prevalent, and highlighters having different levels of sophistication, you can’t rely on this. I’m not trying to nitpick here: Vim, my blog generator, GitHub, and Codeberg, all have a unique way to highlight the example document from this post. No two of them pick out the same subset of values as non-strings!</p><h2 id="templating-yaml-is-a-terrible-terrible-idea"><a href="#templating-yaml-is-a-terrible-terrible-idea"></a>Templating yaml is a terrible, terrible idea</h2><p>I hope it is clear by now that working with yaml is subtle at the very least. What is even more subtle is concatenating and escaping arbitrary text fragments in such a way that the result is a valid yaml document, let alone one that does what you expect. Add to this the fact that whitespace is significant in yaml, and the result is a format that is <a href="https://twitter.com/memenetes/status/1600898397279502336">meme-worthily</a> difficult to template correctly. I truly do not understand why <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/templates/">tools based on such an error-prone practice</a> have gained so much mindshare, when there is a safer, easier, and more powerful alternative: generating json.</p><h2 id="alternative-configuration-formats"><a href="#alternative-configuration-formats"></a>Alternative configuration formats</h2><p>I think the main reason that yaml is so prevalent despite its pitfalls, is that for a long time it was the only viable configuration format. Often we need lists and nested data, which rules out flat formats like ini. Xml is noisy and annoying to write by hand. But most of all, we need comments, which rules out json. (As we saw before, json had comments very early on, but they were removed because people started putting parsing directives in there. I think this is the right call for a serialization format, but it makes json unsuitable as a configuration language.) So if what we really need is the json data model but a syntax that allows comments, what are some of the options?</p><ul><li><a href="https://toml.io/en/"><strong>Toml</strong></a> — Toml is similar to yaml in many ways: it has mostly the same data types; the syntax is not as verbose as json; and it allows comments. Unlike yaml it is not full of footguns, mostly because strings are always quoted, so you don’t have values that look like strings but aren’t. Toml is widely supported, you can probably find a toml parser for your favorite language. It’s even in the Python standard library — unlike yaml! A weak spot of toml is deeply nested data.</li><li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments"><strong>Json with comments</strong></a>, <a href="https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2021/json-with-commas-comments.html"><strong>Json with commas and comments</strong></a> — There exist various extensions of json that extend it just enough to make it a usable config format without introducing too much complexity. Json with comments is probably the most widespread, as it is used as the config format for Visual Studio Code. The main downside of these is that they haven’t really caught on (yet!), so they aren’t as widely supported as json or yaml.</li><li><strong>A simple subset of yaml</strong> — Many of the problems with yaml are caused by unquoted things that look like strings but behave differently. This is easy to avoid: always quote all strings. (Indeed, you can tell that somebody is an experienced yaml engineer when they defensively quote all the strings.) We can choose to always use <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> rather than <code>yes</code> and <code>no</code>, and generally stay away from the arcane features. The challenge with this is that any construct not explicitly forbidden will eventually make it into your codebase, and I am not aware of any good tool that can enforce a sane yaml subset.</li></ul><h2 id="generating-json-as-a-better-yaml"><a href="#generating-json-as-a-better-yaml"></a>Generating json as a better yaml</h2><p>Often the choice of format is not ours to make, and an application only accepts yaml. Not all is lost though, because yaml is a superset of json, so any tool that can produce json can be used to generate a yaml document.</p><p>Sometimes an application will start out with a need for just a configuration format, but over time you end up with many many similar stanzas, and you would like to share parts between them, and abstract some repetition away. This tends to happen in for example Kubernetes and GitHub Actions. When the configuration language does not support abstraction, people often reach for templating, which is a bad idea for the reasons explained earlier. Proper programming languages, possibly domain-specific ones, are a better fit. Some of my favorites are Nix and Python:</p><ul><li><a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/index.html"><strong>Nix</strong></a> — Nix is the language used by the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix package manager</a>. It was created for writing package definitions, but it works remarkably well as a configuration format (and indeed it is used to configure NixOS). Functions, let-bindings, and string interpolation make it powerful for abstracting repetitive configuration. The syntax is light like toml, and it can <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/builtins.html#builtins-toJSON">export to json</a> or xml. It works well for simplifying a repetitive GitHub Actions workflow file, for example.</li><li><a href="https://www.python.org/"><strong>Python</strong></a> — Json documents double as valid Python literals with minimal adaptation, and Python supports trailing commas and comments. It has variables and functions, powerful string interpolation, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html?highlight=json%20dump#json.dump"><code>json.dump</code></a> built in. A self-contained Python file that prints json to stdout goes a long way!</li></ul><p>Finally there are some tools in this category that I haven’t used enough to confidently recommend, but which deserve to be mentioned:</p><ul><li><a href="https://dhall-lang.org/"><strong>Dhall</strong></a> — Dhall is like Nix, but with types. It is less widespread, and personally I find the built-in function names unwieldy.</li><li><a href="https://cuelang.org/"><strong>Cue</strong></a> — Like Dhall, Cue integrates type/schema information into the config format. Cue is a superset of json, but despite that, I find the files that actually use Cue’s features to look foreign to me. Cue is on my radar to evaluate further, but I haven’t encountered a problem where Cue looked like the most suitable solution yet.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl"><strong>Hashicorp Configuration Language</strong></a> — I haven’t used <abbr>HCL</abbr> extensively enough to have a strong opinion on it, but in the places where I worked with it, the potential for abstraction seemed more limited than what you can achieve with e.g. Nix.</li></ul><p><strong>2025 update:</strong> After having used <abbr>HCL</abbr> more in practice, I consider it too ad-hoc to seriously recommend. My frustration with <abbr>HCL</abbr> is what prompted me to create <a href="https://rcl-lang.org/"><abbr>RCL</abbr></a>. It <a href="https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2024/a-reasonable-configuration-language">started as a toy project</a>, but is now at a point where it is both usable and useful.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Yaml aims to be a more human-friendly alternative to json, but with all of its features, it became such a complex format with so many bizarre and unexpected behaviors, that it is difficult for humans to predict how a given yaml document will parse. If you are looking for a configuration format, toml is a friendly format without yaml’s footguns. For cases where you are stuck with yaml, generating json from a more suitable language can be a viable approach. Generating json also opens up the possibility for abstraction and reuse, in a way that is difficult to achieve safely by templating yaml.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>“Wh— what did you say?”</p><p>It’s close to six o’clock on a weekday afternoon and the bar is starting to get noisy with the after-work crowd. It’s entirely possible I misheard that last part.</p><p>“Altoids! I find the spearmint works a little better overall, but recently I’ve started switching flavors depending on the situation.”</p><p>I’ve worked with James—“Jim” as everyone on the team knows him—for a little over two years and I’m used to this dance now. He gets a kind of tunnel vision in his excitement about whatever shiny new thing has captured his attention. It’s usually pretty easy to shake him out of it.</p><p>“No, Jim, the part before that.”</p><p>He looks at me for a moment, inquisitive, before pushing his beer aside. “Here, let me show you.” He reaches underneath the table and produces his beige-on-brown Timbuk2 messenger bag. There is a small wet spot left behind from his drink, and the bag plops right onto it. I watch as one of his stubby hands unbuckles the outermost pouch while the other one pulls out a small green and white tin. I am obviously intended to see this as clearly as possible, evidenced by the way he places it front and center between us.</p><p>“Regular everyday Altoids, right? You take about four of them, maybe five.” He flips the lid open and traps the requisite number of small white mints between his fingertips, which he then pops into his mouth. “This is the trick; you gotta half-chew it first.” At least two tiny shards fly in my direction as he speaks these words. It is like listening to a slow K-turn executed on a road covered in gravel and seashells. Three more slow and deliberate chomps, then his bite eases. “Mmm.” The communication style switches to mime: an index finger raised in a “one moment” gesture, followed by an exaggerated point downwards while unzipping the main pouch of the bag. It takes a few seconds of rooting around before the star of this particular show is found.</p><p>My eyes barely have enough time to resolve the object under the dismal light at this end of the bar before it’s in his mouth. He’s chewing the full concoction now—mouth closed, thank God. The crunching softens, then fades into the din from a nearby table of sales bros laughing at their sales bro anecdote. Jim is looking at me with a kind of confident smugness I haven’t seen since I bet my buddy at Guitar Center that he couldn’t spontaneously play “Everlong” from memory. A bet I lost, I might add.</p><p>There is a degree of intentional spectacle to this, I’d have to imagine. Each jaw movement is deliberate. Precise. He does not break eye contact with me, though I desperately want to break it with him. I can’t though. The absurdity of the scene is absolutely hypnotizing. One final swallow, a smack of his lips, then he opens his mouth wide like a child proving that they finished all their vegetables and have earned their dessert. “Easy peasy, no problem.”</p><p>“That was…” It’s like a significant piece of my brain has just completely locked up. I’m just saying words without thinking, filling the empty air.</p><p>“A cat turd!” he proclaims, finishing my sentence.</p><p>A beat.</p><p>“You just ate a cat turd.” It’s all I can do in this moment to plainly restate the facts as I understand them, although the sense of alarm is definitely carrying in my voice.</p><p>“Yup, and it didn’t taste bad at all. The spearmint masks it <em>completely.</em> Watch, I’ll do another one.” My eyes widen in dread as I shake my head weakly. I didn’t want to see him do that the first time; I sure as shit don’t want to see it again.</p><p>“No, that’s alright,” I balk.</p><p>There is an awkward reach across the bag as he grabs his glass, tips it toward me in a silent toast, then takes a long swill. Whether he admits it or not, there’s evidently something that needs to be washed down. He lets out a contented sigh as the almost-empty glass thumps back down on the table. I glance down at the chicken wings and carrot sticks I had been picking at. A minute ago, they were kinda bland—merely <em>okay</em> by the standards of pub food. With the abrupt loss of my appetite, now they are destined for the dumpster out back.</p><p>He lifts the small tin of mints and gives it a little shake in front of my face. It sounds a lot more papery and a lot less metallic than I would’ve guessed. “Altoids. I’m not exaggerating when I say these have completely changed the way I work.” I follow this little miracle box as they get tucked back into the bag, the buckles snapping shut to shield them from the lustful gaze of an angry world. He pauses and looks up at me again. “Would you like to try?”</p><p>“No, Jim, I don’t want your cat turds.”</p><p>I don’t want <em>your</em> cat turds. Why did I say it like that? I don’t want <em>anybody’s</em> cat turds!</p><p><em>…Right?</em></p><p>“Completely changed the way I work,” he repeats mechanically, sliding his bag onto the empty seat to his left. I’m finding it quite difficult to look at Jim, so I instead follow the motions of the bag until it is completely out of my view. How many more are in there?</p><p>“I used to spend so much of my day on cat turds, psyching myself up, trying strategies that didn’t work, all the cleanup when I was finished. That’s all gone now. I can never go back to the old way.”</p><p>“I just… I mean…” My brain has started working again, at least superficially, and it has generated so many questions that I’m having a hard time selecting which one to ask first. “How long have you been eating cat turds?” A fine question for this moment, I suppose.</p><p>“What do you mean? I’ve always had to eat cat turds. Since I was a kid in school, on through college, in all my jobs… They keep giving me cat turds and I keep having to eat them, otherwise it starts to pile up and then things really get messy.”</p><p>His face turns slightly serious as he parses my expression, his head tilting in suspicion. “You eat cat turds too, yeah?” I choose not to answer that question. He continues anyway. “Sure. We all do. We have to, ya know?”</p><hr><p><em>We all do.</em></p><p>Those words have been repeating in my head with the consistency of a drumline cadence. <em>We all do.</em></p><p>“Walk sign is on to cross Pawk Avenue. Walk sign is on to cross Pawk Avenue.” I’ve heard this prerecorded voice, clearly belonging to the most disgruntled DOT Traffic Signals employee available at the time of this crosswalk’s construction, at least twice per workday for the last two years. It stirs up a half-remembered dream of a career spent shoveling dirt into a hole—something that feels more like the idea of “honest work” than what I get paid to do every day. I bet nobody on the construction crew spent an entire workday fighting around with brittle, poorly designed automation tooling like I did today.</p><p>I’m quickly but unintentionally refilling my conscious mind with the task I had gleefully abandoned when Jim invited me out to after-work drinks. Normally I’d be irritated to spend more of my waking life thinking about this stuff, but after what I witnessed at the bar I welcome <em>any</em> distraction at all.</p><p>“Okay. So, usually we have a string. This is one of many values inside a mapping type, within a list of similar mappings.” I’m narrating to myself silently, imagining little bits of JSON syntax stamped on rectangles that are kind of stacked on top of each other like playing cards. “But ever since the schema change in V3, sometimes the value is another mapping type that wraps the string we want…” I’m visualizing another square to the right of the existing one. This one is yellow, distinct from the light blue of all the others, and it never occurs to me to question why that is.</p><p>“But because this is actually YAML, and the value comes from a template call, both the string form and the mapping form need to be escaped and indented in a way that works in both cases.” I’m chewing on the problem in pretty much the same mindset I had during work, only now I’m walking across midtown instead of staring at a computer screen. “We could just revert that change, keep the value as JSON like it used to be and insert it verbatim… but DevEx owns that part and I wouldn’t want to have to fight to get that PR approved.”</p><p>“Piece of shit.” I speak that bit out loud without really intending to. I snap back into awareness of my surroundings and look around. Nobody was near enough to hear it. They probably wouldn’t have cared if they were.</p><p>It occurs to me that, whenever anybody asks me what I do for a living and I wave my hand and say “Computers,” this is what I’m trying to avoid needing to have to explain. None of these words are being used in a way that would mean anything to most people. If one were to take the time to carefully define them all and how they fit together semantically, they describe concepts so abstract and detached from any kind of tangible shared experience that you’d hit a second wall trying to explain <em>that</em>.</p><p>“Oh, but wait, we have the <code>nindent</code> function. I could just count up the indentation level of the outer list and… Ah, hell, I forgot this template is transcluded into pod <em>and</em> deployment specs and the nesting levels would be different between the two.” I briefly try to think of which chucklefuck I could blame this design on, but truth be told I rubber-stamped enough questionable pull requests in my time here that a fair amount of this situation is a mess of my own damn making.</p><p>Huh. I really do wonder what I would sound like trying to explain this to somebody who had no experience in the industry. I suppose if I was very excited about it, I might come across like an energetic kid going on and on about all the different Pokémon they know about and all the special attacks and vulnerabilities. But without that spark of passion, and in its place a jaded voice tinged with frustration and contempt, I would probably just sound like a raving lunatic. These words don’t mean anything. I’m not describing something that actually exists. I’m playing the part of an observer in a universe of little floating boxes, becoming physically agitated about a superficial difference within the yellow one, and <em>none of it is real.</em></p><p>I’m definitely not feeling the passion on this one. This code runs deep inside a build-deploy pipeline that I have no hope of ever running directly on the computer I’m using. So I write the code, push it to CI, wait for a bunch of stuff I’m not interested in to finish running, then get to watch my change fail to work for either the stupidest typo that I never should’ve made in the first place, or due to some error that is so novel that even the search engines assume I must really be having some other <em>much more popular</em> error instead of the one I provided. It feels like I am performing surgery using a scalpel held by a boardwalk arcade claw machine, complete with the constant squawking and shitting of project management seagulls.</p><p>And even if I could concisely explain all of that to my hypothetical interlocutor, there’s the even higher-level question: <em>Why?</em> Why did we even make this change? What was so irredeemably wrong with the last two versions of this thing that we’re now doing it all again a third time? What exactly is the goal we’re trying to achieve here? I can’t really say. It’s a question I never asked, partly because I learned a long time ago that asking questions just causes friction. Just nod and shut up. Put a +1 on a sketchy PR and get it out of here. Don’t hold up the pipeline. Recover enough stamina to face down the next eldritch nightmare that slithers its way to the top of my Jira swimlane. “Sounds great, thanks.” Thumbs-up. Grit my teeth through to the next direct deposit, convince myself it’s not so bad. Do it over and over until some ill-defined end condition is met. I’ll know it when I see it. I hope.</p><p>I catch myself at the tail end of a sigh. I fake like I’m yawning to stretch my upper body for a second. Approximately every muscle in my back now aches.</p><p>There’s this very real sense that I don’t… I don’t want to solve this problem. There is no intellectual reward at the end of this journey. It’s not interesting to me. This isn’t something that needs to be fixed, because it’s not a situation that ever should’ve been permitted to happen in the first place. This is just a bunch of contrived nonsense that I <em>must</em> work through because the broader situation dictates it. It doesn’t matter if the solution is good or elegant. It doesn’t matter if it barely works. It doesn’t matter if it causes another problem that I stub my toe on in three weeks. It’s just… what I have to do.</p><p>I stop in my tracks.</p><p>These kinds of problems are <em>my cat turds.</em></p><p>Unlike Jim, though, I can’t just cram a bunch of breath mints into my face to make this go away.</p><hr><p>The “down” escalator into the train station is out of service, and it has been this way all summer. A pair of orange plastic barricades block the landings at both ends. I walk down two flights of stairs alongside a half-dozen other commuters. Having concluded that the template problem simply isn’t worth thinking any further about, I’m back on the cat turds. I understand what Jim was talking about now. This has been happening for almost my entire life, even going back to my days in elementary school.</p><p>All of the homework assignments that were blindly graded against answer keys from the back of a Teacher Edition of the textbook: Cat turds. College admission essays where I profused a longing desire to attend the distinguished universities that my parents and guidance counselor told me I should set my ambitions toward: Cat turds. Probably hundreds of cover letters submitted alongside job applications throughout the years, skimmed by perhaps tens of internal recruiters and hiring managers: Cat turds.</p><p>The notion that it was a good idea to manipulate highly whitespace-sensitive YAML data with the Go <code>text/template</code> package. CI workflows that take 75 minutes to reach the one step in the entire process that fails. Tools and interfaces that force-update and introduce breaking changes for seemingly no justifiable reason, removing or kneecapping features that were being relied on, with issue trackers guarded by thickheaded bots that dismissively auto-close feature requests that kindly ask for consideration for those use cases. Massively over-complicated software that tries to be everything to everybody, but in reality ends up being a gigantic lumbering pile of failure and frustration. <em>Cat turds.</em></p><p>I used to love this stuff. I still do. Except… I don’t. Not lately, anyway. A long time ago, this was unquestionably what I wanted to do with my life. I would stay up late, pushing back my bedtime for a few more minutes with these glorious machines, hacking away on some little project. Then I’d get up early the following morning, excited to jump back into the project before my day out in the world began. I don’t even clearly remember what I was building toward, but I know it had basically zero utility or market potential. The point of doing the project was simply to <em>do the project</em>—to press through problems, to learn new things, and to end the day with more skills and experience than I started with.</p><p>At one point, I had the 7-bit ASCII table memorized. Just the decimal codes; I didn’t really understand the usefulness of the hexadecimal representations, and it never occurred to me that the hex values would work much better in mnemonics. I don’t know why I took the time to learn that. I never really used that knowledge in any real day-to-day work, and it began to fade from my mind as soon as I found some other pointless esoterica to wallpaper over it.</p><p>Look at me now, having to Google how to read a text file line-by-line in Python despite having done it a hundred times at this point. The knowledge is up there somewhere, I’m sure of it. I just can’t always think of the idiom in the heat of the moment. Just a little hint to jog the old brain, that’s all I need.</p><p>I often wonder what my Younger Self would think of me now, failing to remember a two-line snippet of code that you’d find in the first ten pages of any beginner’s guide to the language. He’d probably sneer and say I need to devote more time to studying. But I’m an adult with things to do; I can’t spend all my time just memorizing things just in case I might need the information someday. Oh, and by the way: Younger Self, if you were such a friggin’ hotshot, why did it take you <em>fifteen years</em> to finally wrap your head around regular expressions? What’s that? Because they were <em>hard?</em> So you spent all your time memorizing easy and pointless trivia rather than tackling anything that was genuinely challenging? And then building up a whole air of superiority based on the number of discrete facts you could rattle off, rather than their practical utility? What, were you trying to become a contestant on <em>Computer Jeopardy!</em> or something?</p><p>No wonder Younger Self grew up to be kind of an asshole.</p><p>I mean, I didn’t <em>try</em> to be an asshole. It’s just that I tended to gauge my own self-worth relative to others based on the only social currency we could accurately compare: the amount of “stuff” we knew. Some people memorize car engine displacements, others carry in their noggins enough digits of pi to resolve the observable universe down to the width of a hydrogen atom. I had a litany of command-line switches that I never used for anything, HTML character entity names for writing systems I couldn’t comprehend, and tales of tweaking settings deep inside the Windows 98 Device Manager just so I could brag about having been in there in the first place. I also at one time sincerely believed that maybe if I taught myself to—I’m picking one example out of many—decode Code 39 barcodes in my head, it would somehow make me cool and desirable during otherwise awkward social functions. (I did get reasonably good at it. All it takes is memorizing a couple of three-digit sequences. Having a teenager’s near-field visual acuity certainly helped.)</p><p>Everybody else who didn’t know those little pieces of nothing? They were the lessers. They didn’t put in the time to grind for this knowledge. They had never scaled the peaks of Mount AltaVista, nor had they knelt in the temple of the <em>MSDN Library for Visual Studio</em> on a banged-up pair of CD-Rs. I knew things they did not, therefore I felt I was higher-and-mightier than they were. I and I alone <em>suffered</em> for this knowledge. This attitude manifested itself in one of two ways: In the first case, I would barge my way into situations where my involvement wasn’t needed or appreciated, thinking I could “save” others from the pain I once had to contend with. More often than not, though, I would simply mock people for not knowing things—usually inside my own head, but sometimes outwardly on mailing lists and message boards. There were times when I judged a person to have failed to put in the necessary amount of work, so therefore they did not deserve to rise anywhere near where I considered my own level to be. It didn’t matter if the subject was deeply technical or a disagreement on the precise phrasing of a <em>Simpsons</em> quote. Somebody got something wrong, and it was my job to rectify that.</p><p>I feel bad for the people who worked on teams where Younger Self was the senior engineer. I was full of ideals and convictions back then. “No, we’re not doing that. We’re going to Do It Right instead.” I was full of piss and vinegar. “Here, give me that; I’ll just do it myself.” I was full of shit.</p><p>I now realize that everything I lorded over other people—all the things I gatekept without consciously understanding that this was what I was doing—I didn’t need to do that. It really didn’t help anything. For some number of people who interacted with me, <em>I</em> was the problem. I could’ve been more tolerant or forgiving, I could’ve said “let’s find out together,” I could’ve let other people have the fun once in a while. I could have minded my own damn business and saved everybody the hassle.</p><p>There were people out there who must’ve felt that <em>I was their cat turds.</em></p><p>I’ll never be able to track down and apologize to every person I treated that way. And why did I even build that fiefdom and protect it so jealously? Why was I so insecure? Why did I have to always be right and have a ready justification for why everybody else was wrong?</p><p>It was just me, alone in my tiny sandbox, safe and secure behind my towering fortress of cat turds.</p><hr><p>My usual train, the one packed so full that some riders have to stand in the aisles until after the first or second stop, usually leaves at 5:50. Now about three hours later, one can sometimes get an entire car to themselves. I settle down in a window seat looking out at the desolate platform. Evidently there aren’t all that many people interested in traveling across the river at this hour on a Wednesday evening. It feels nice to sit, despite the fact that I’ve probably sat for a cumulative ten hours—at least—over the course of this day.</p><p>As sometimes happens, another rider boards the train and enters what had up to this point been my personal rail car. He selects the aisle seat in the row directly in front of me. At least 110 other seats in this car, every single one of them empty, and his choice is to sit right here. <em>Sigh.</em> I could get up and move to another seat but I’m… exhausted. I’m here, I’m settled in, and above all I’m just completely out of ambition. I guess it’s fine as long as he doesn’t start playing music or TikTok videos without headphones.</p><p>A long blow from the locomotive horn, and the train begins to creep forward. Right on schedule. We’re in a tunnel deep below the city’s west side, and the view out the window is pitch black aside from the occasional glow from a mercury-vapor emergency light. On the wall beneath each of these lights, patches of graffiti framed by concrete pillars. I wouldn’t say I’ve memorized them all by heart; I can’t even read the tags on the majority of them. But they are at least familiar, and I’ve found some of them serve as convenient signposts along this portion of the trip. I’m not really paying attention to any of them tonight, instead I’m staring blankly at a little patch of window glass as the scene rolls past.</p><p>I refocus my eyes a bit and realize I’m looking at the reflection of a screen, or at least the top corner of one. I turn away from the window and find the source of the light. The man in front of me has opened his laptop—a chunky Dell Latitude or something very close to it—and perched it on a small lap desk fashioned from his leather bag. He opens a web browser and logs into a Microsoft account, one key at a time, hunt-and-peck style. It prompts him for his second factor and he shifts awkwardly in the seat to retrieve his phone. The login process succeeds and, after a few clicks and a fair bit of both of our finite lifetimes spent staring at loading spinners, opens what appears to be a Word document. I can’t read anything on his screen, which is more a testament to how wrecked my eyes have become than anything else, but I can see that there’s about four, perhaps five lines of unformatted text up there already. He strokes his chin while giving it a good read-through, then his hands take their position on the trackpad. Right index finger moves the cursor, left index finger does the clicking. The screen flips to another browser tab, his left hand gratuitously double-clicks on the website suggested by the first tile on the screen, and the page loads.</p><p>I never learned to tell any of these sites apart from each other. I see lots of people using the one with the spirograph logo. The one that looks like a cartoon butthole is also quite popular among some departments at my job. This guy is using the one that’s represented by a symmetrical color blob. Not that one, the other color blob one. Yeah.</p><p>He has opened a chat session that has evidently been going for some time. The text entry box at the bottom of the window waits patiently for fresh input. Letter by agonizing letter, the keys needed to express his thoughts are pressed. The most-pressed key, however, is Backspace. This man is, using the most generous language possible, not a particularly fast or accurate typist. In total, he enters about ten words before pressing Enter. A short moment later, the machine responds. Entire sentences appear in the time it took him to type a single word. Multiple paragraphs with subheadings and bulleted lists scroll into view. The screen fills completely with this fresh text. He looks at this for a moment, moves his hands back to the trackpad, and selects a complete paragraph. His finger presses down with immense force as he drags the selection area ever wider, as if his catch is in danger of wriggling through his fingers if he doesn’t hold the button down hard enough. He flips back to his Word document and pastes the paragraph. Then back to the chat window. He begins typing again. Slowly. Excruciatingly.</p><p>This cycle repeats several times, incrementally building his document up to four or five double-spaced pages in length. It’s not exactly a fast process, but certainly faster than if he had thought up and typed out all that content the old-fashioned way. It’s certainly plausible that he at least read everything that went into the document, but I wouldn’t be able to prove it.</p><p>He selects another piece of text, this one substantially smaller than the other specimens that he’d been handling up until this point. This one is pasted into a discussion thread on Teams. He waits a moment for responses, closes the lid, and the laptop goes back into his bag. The man stands up, wraps the strap over his shoulder, and walks to the front of the car as the train brakes to a full stop. This is where our paths diverge, it would seem. The doors open and he steps out into the night.</p><p>Alone in the train car again, with nothing interesting to eavesdrop on, my mind begins to wander again. I wonder what the purpose of that document was. Why was it being prepared? Who dictated that a half-dozen input phrases needed to be inflated into a thousand-word wall of text? Who was going to sit and read all of that, anyway? And for what purpose?</p><p>I really don’t know. But I do know one thing: It’s cat turds.</p><p>This guy obviously didn’t want to do that task. Whether that was due to lack of passion and interest, or lack of skill and ability, he had a cat turd to eat and he found a little pack of Altoids that he could use to get through it with minimal suffering. The people who have to read it? There’s a good chance they’ll be dealing with a cat turd too. Maybe they can choose to employ a chatbot to summarize it back down to his original inputs. Maybe it’ll even do a passable job preserving the essence of the guy’s prompts.</p><p>It makes sense why a person or group of people would flock to anything that makes life’s demands a little less difficult for themselves. You’d have to be pretty dumb to want to do a task like that manually.</p><p>There’s still the question, though. Why are we all eating cat turds? When did we all collectively agree that we were all a-okay with the idea that we had to subject ourselves to this constant grind of doing shit that doesn’t really need to be done to satisfy requirements that were put in place simply “because” and that seemingly only create more pointless work for other people (or ourselves!) to have to do later?</p><p>One of the defining characteristics of humanity is its ability to build and wield tools that make difficult tasks easier. One would presume there would also be a certain wisdom in knowing which of the difficult tasks were worth doing in the first place but… Well. When you presume, you make a pres out of u and me.</p><hr><p>If I had known ahead of time that I’d be out this late, I would’ve brought a jacket. The early autumn air is calm but crisp, and my borough’s train platform offers very little protection from the chill. The crickets are still chirping, but their song has slowed substantially compared to how they sounded a few weeks back. I stopped parking at the station a long time ago—the monthly pass costs well over $150 now, and most days the parking lot is completely full before six o’clock in the morning anyway. It’s only a mile to the house, and this twenty-minute walk is pretty much the only exercise I get nowadays.</p><p>Once I cross the main boulevard at the four-way stop, it’s all suburban residential side streets. There is basically no traffic at this time of night in my sleepy little bedroom community. All the dogs have been walked, the kids have been put to bed, and the adults… Well, I’m sure there are at least a couple people around here drinking or smoking the memory of their cat turds away.</p><p>I’m no closer to anything resembling inner peace. I find I’ve grown to despise large swaths of the only thing I’ve ever been able to earn reliable income from. I tire of walking a path that has seemingly shifted beneath my feet to point toward a destination I no longer recognize. I’m embarrassed by the jerk my Younger Self used to be, and simultaneously ashamed of the energy I lost as I matured. I don’t really want to do most of what I have to do, while feeling a deep unsated need to achieve something that I have neither the stamina nor the freedom to pursue. At some point I’m going to reach down deep into the well of ambition to discover there ain’t nothing there to pull out anymore. And then?</p><p><em>Something</em> percent of success is simply showing up. That’s roughly how the quote goes, right? I’ve heard seventy percent, ninety percent, hell, let’s call it seventy-eight. It doesn’t matter because it isn’t a real thing that can be measured in any objective way. The idea is to inspire people to at least try. Put your butt in the chair, log into Teams, trick yourself into thinking, well, I made it all the way here, might as well prune my stale Git branches or something so I can feel like I’m doing real work. Push aside distractions, shake off procrastination, kindle that tiny spark into enough momentum to break through whatever barrier is standing in the way of getting something done. If only that worked with any degree of predictability.</p><p>There’s a metaphor that talks about painting the backs of cabinets. The idea is that, when you’re putting paint, stain, varnish, <em>whatever</em> on some cabinets, there’s no need to paint the surfaces that face toward the wall. From the day the units are mounted, to a day forty years from now when they are ripped down and thrown into a construction dumpster during a subsequent kitchen renovation, nobody will see the backs of any of those cabinets. Painting them would be a waste of time and materials. Nobody would know if it was done or not.</p><p>“Yes, but <em>I</em> would know.” That’s something my Dad would often say. His tendency has always been to be overly thorough, exacting and precise in any craft he partakes in. Everything—from the doors in the house to the stripes cut into the front lawn—was always level, plumb, square, centered, polished, dust-free, squeak-free, <em>fingerprint</em>-free… He even demonstrated meticulous care in breaking down cardboard and filling up the waste bins at the curb. I still have no idea how he was able to raise two kids in that house without exploding from the chaos we brought.</p><p>Maybe it was genetic, or maybe I voluntarily developed it so my dad would be proud of me just like he was proud of the other things he made. Either way, I definitely started to take after him in those ways and I now recognize this same kind of care in myself all the time. Not just in the way I prefer all my clocks to read the exact correct time or my knack for always noticing the way the receptacle face isn’t exactly flush with the wall plate… but in a fundamental inability to <em>not care</em> about quality or craft. Even when the task doesn’t matter. Even if it results in an entire afternoon spent painting a piece of carpentry that nobody will ever see. I can’t not care.</p><p>All that stuff Younger Self struggled with—the self-superiority, the sense that I had to be the one who did it if it needed to be done correctly, the derision and borderline abuse I gave others—that was all just a big dogmatic ball of caring a whole lot about quality and craft, being rolled around by a kid who didn’t understand what to do with it. I had to work so hard to care so much, and these other people didn’t, and everything worked out for them anyway, and <em>that wasn’t fair.</em> Decades later, I still feel that way sometimes.</p><p>My parents still live in that house, surrounded by all the things my dad cared so much about. Aside from a whole bunch of trees that died and needed to be cut down to stumps, everything is still pretty much pristine. But if you start to look around, really scrutinize, you’ll start to notice some things have slipped. There’s a film of dust on the higher wall decorations. Some of the brass knobs are becoming tarnished. A few of the light bulbs in the hallway fixtures don’t match. My dad seemed tired the last time we talked, and more than once he expressed the sentiment that “everything he owns is falling apart.” Is it simply the onset of physical old age that has limited his ability to stay on top of these things, or is he beginning to leave behind his era of caring?</p><p>Now that I think about it, I don’t think we’ve ever really talked about how care factored into his career philosophy. I had always implicitly assumed that it was the same as it currently is with me: Work or play, it’s always there. Can’t turn it off even if I wanted to. But what if he could? What if all the care he demonstrated in projects around the house was compensation for all the things he deliberately avoided caring about at work? It would certainly explain how he was able to consistently sustain those standards. But then, that would mean that I modeled my own principles and tastes on a distorted view of my dad, untempered by whatever he didn’t let me see about his workplace persona.</p><p>How would I begin to—well, I don’t want to say “not care,” that sounds too extreme. But maybe… <em>selectively</em> care? To care about the things that matter, the things that spark passion and joy and remind me why I spent so much time practicing this godforsaken occupation. While at the same time recognizing the things that don’t matter, the problems for which the optimal solution is to stop insisting on having that problem in the first place. The kinds of tasks for which the 78% showing-up baseline score is plenty good enough. Tasks on which care would be utterly wasted, the cases where the cabinets are so irredeemably fucked up that the lack of paint on the back is the last thing anybody’s going to worry about. Those are the tasks that hurt the most, because I find it basically impossible to make myself care about them. It offends my soul to try to force it, and it drains me of all ambition to move onto the next potentially heartening opportunity. It’s a real problem, and I find it always has been: If I can’t care about it, I have an extremely hard time bringing myself to do it at all.</p><p>Well, I suppose that’s when I open a chatbot session of my own. “Hey there Chat. Uh, we’ve never spoken before but, uh… Well, my entire system of self-motivation just completely broke down but I still need to keep moving forward. Can you help me out of this bind?” There’s a whole discipline—they call it Prompt Engineering—that’s just a fancy form of throwing your hands up and pressing the Care About It For Me button. That’s pretty much how it works. Provide it with any cat turd under the sun, it doesn’t matter. Chat will gobble them all up for you like a coprophagic dog.</p><p>I’d be lying if I said the idea didn’t make my skin crawl a little. Every fiber of my being says that this is a weight to be borne by me and me alone. This is <em>my</em> cat turd to eat; they gave it to <em>me</em>. When it’s done, I can open my grinning maw and say without equivocation that I was the one who got through it. I painted the back of this cabinet. I worked way too hard and poured far too much of my blood, sweat and tears into this thing. And my reward for a job well done is… debilitating exhaustion, most of the time. Getting a fresh cat turd to eat tomorrow. And the day after.</p><p>Of course, Chat can’t really care. It does a passable job <em>pretending</em> like it cares, saying the words that convey the illusion of care to any reader not paying very close attention. Where do I draw the line between fostering real care, versus passing off a degraded third-generation photocopy of some tokenization of what may have at one point been somebody else’s care? Is the line simply the boundary between the tasks I’m excited to do and the ones I put off until I’ve depleted enough mental reserves to <em>sorta</em> care?</p><p>It really does feel like the average person has made a choice to abandon a great deal of care, at least in their professional capacity. Take a look around at all these people with their fake shit-eating grins, passing off a machine’s effort as their own and experiencing no consequences. Sometimes they’re rewarded for doing so. There are organizations that are beginning to mandate it now. These people aren’t eating their cat turds anymore, why am I still sitting here eating mine?</p><p>I round the final curve leading to the corner of my block. As I pass under the streetlight, I cast a shadow on the asphalt ahead. With each step it grows longer and more distorted. There’s a rustle from the shrubs bordering my neighbor’s driveway, and a small dark form emerges. It crosses the street halfway then abruptly stops. I stop as well. A pair of glowing yellow eyes look back at me. I stare at it, it stares at me. A possum, perhaps? Somebody’s outdoor cat? It’s just watching me, seemingly peering straight into my very soul. Can it see what I’m grappling with here? Is it passing judgement on me for thinking these thoughts? It sizes me up for a moment longer, turns its head, and becomes a black apparition once more. I struggle to track it as it continues across the street, and I lose sight of it entirely.</p><p>I arrive at home and shut the door behind me. Sunset was over two hours ago and it’s nearly pitch black in the hallway. I fumble around for the light switch, kick my shoes off next to the doorway, and hang my bag on its hook in the coat closet. Something grabs my attention, just above eye level, slightly overhanging the edge of the top shelf. I slide it out of its resting place and carry it into the kitchen. I sit down at the table and inspect it.</p><p>This object is a round metal cookie tin about twelve inches in diameter. Beneath a thin coat of dust, it is a deep red with a repeating pattern of snowmen and white snowflakes, and quite obviously once held winter holiday–themed cookies. I repurposed it many years ago to hold the only vice I currently permit myself to indulge in: a meticulously curated collection of all different types of chocolate candies. I remove the lid and set it aside. I survey the contents, a sea of differently-shaped naked chocolate morsels. I don’t remember why I chose to remove all the foil and paper wrapping before putting these in here. From my vantage point, everything looks vaguely the same—I can’t readily spot any differences between milk chocolate and dark, or those filled with caramel versus crème.</p><p>One particular piece near the edge catches my eye, and I carefully select it for inspection. It’s not a very pleasing color or shape—oddly asymmetrical. I roll it around between my fingers. There’s a hair on it. I hold it up to my nose and take a whiff, hoping to detect the aroma of the cacao. Try as I might, I can’t pick up any trace of its scent.</p><p>Come to think of it, I can’t remember the last time I smelled anything.</p><a href="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/" title="Articles">«&nbsp;Back to Articles</a></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about
some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.</p>

<p dir="auto">Back when I was a student, I got access to the <a href="https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Imagine</a>, and as a result, I got
access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called <a href="https://github.com/avestura/EyesGuard">EyesGuard</a>
and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.</p>
<p dir="auto">I came to the realization that Microsoft deleted my app, my developer account, and all those comments on my app supporting me and suggesting
ideas on how to improve the program. I tried to contact the support and email whoever I could, but I was ghosted.
Nobody ever explained to me why, but I assume it's because of the sanctions.</p>

<p dir="auto">Notion is a great product, and it was the primary tool I used to manage my personal notes. Not until they suddenly decided to
wipe out every data related to the users residing in Iran. Hopefully, they actually responded to my support message:</p>

<p dir="auto">I read hackernews on a daily basis and I visit lots of different websites regularly. I am almost always on my VPN as I am internally firewalled by
the government and externally shooed because of the sanctions, so I am probably missing some of these heart-warming messages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">My VPN turned off, and opening <a href="https://www.grepular.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.grepular.com</a> showed me this message. I actually do not blame the people who do this. I think there is
a fundamental misconception that people think because "Islamic Republic" has the word "Republic" in it, it must be a government of people in charge. That's not the case. I have yet to see anyone who actually supports Russian aggression in my real life in Iran.
Funny enough, Iran's history is full of backstabs by the Russian government.</p>
<p dir="auto">I tried contacting the author by sending this email:</p>
<pre><code>Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well.

While browsing HackerNews, I came across your website but was greeted with this message:

&gt; Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.

I wanted to clarify that the decision to support Russia does not represent the Iranian people. That "your decision" refers to the regime, a theocratic minority that rules Iran without democratic legitimacy. The people of Iran have long protested and revolted against this regime, but unfortunately, they face brutal suppression while unarmed.

In my experience, most Iranians around me, including myself, stand firmly with Ukraine and against Russian aggression.

I’m not asking you to reconsider the IP restriction, you have your reasons and I respect that. I simply wanted to share this perspective and express my solidarity with Ukraine.

Slava Ukraini!

Best regards,
Avestura

<p dir="auto">I woke up to the news that GitHub has removed the access of Iranians to their private repositories. Well, that was not good. I tried to launch my own self-hosted instance of Gitea to reduce the damage. However, later, GitHub announced that <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/" rel="nofollow">github is now available in Iran</a> by securing a license from the US government, and we're now good. You see? The weather is good, the birds are singing, GitHub is free again. Fantastic!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">GitLab freaked me out</h2><a id="user-content-gitlab-freaked-me-out" aria-label="Permalink: GitLab freaked me out" href="#gitlab-freaked-me-out"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Similarly, GitLab banned every account that once accessed from an Iranian IP, however, to this day, they never lifted the
ban, even on public repositories. I guess they couldn't secure a license from the US government, or they simply never cared.
Good luck to them in either case, though. GitLab is an amazing software. One can always self-host it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">List goes on</h2><a id="user-content-list-goes-on" aria-label="Permalink: List goes on" href="#list-goes-on"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The list goes on, and almost all of the services you probabelly heard of is banned here: Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...),
Educational platforms (coursera, udemy, etc), Payment software (stripe, paypal, ...).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Lessons Learned for me</h2><a id="user-content-lessons-learned-for-me" aria-label="Permalink: Lessons Learned for me" href="#lessons-learned-for-me"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I don't think any of these companies have bad intentions towards any group of people. They are a business after all. They don't hate their customers; they are just playing the game, and the game has such rules.
But if someday some law or government forces me to prevent my services from a group, I'll think twice before writing those <code>if</code> statements. I'll try to have more empathy. People behind those screens are more important than just some rows in my tables.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Footnote</h2><a id="user-content-footnote" aria-label="Permalink: Footnote" href="#footnote"></a></p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p><p dir="auto">In this text, I am NOT asking for the removal of
the sanctions targeted at the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am merely remembering some moments on top of my head.
For the record, I do not support
the actions of the Islamic Republic, and on the contrary, I am in favor of the movements that release the people from such
a mafia-like cult ruling a country with thousands of years of history.
The actions of the group in charge of Iran are not defensible, and as a matter of fact,
the people of Iran are the first layer of victims. Some examples are listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
I especially feel it differently, as regime thugs put a gun to the throat of a dear person to me, and threatened to kill him if he showed up in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests" rel="nofollow">protests</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">By the way, did you know you could return <code>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons</code> instead of <code>403 Forbidden</code> when you're going to ban me next time?</p>

<p>Pocket Casts, people are not upset you are trying to find revenue sources. People are upset you are reneging on your promise.</p>
<p>You were a pay-once app. Released in 2011, pay once each for Android, iOS, and Web and keep for life.</p>
<p>In 2018 NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/607823388/pocket-cast-acquired?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">acquired you</a>.  Then in 2019 you moved to a subscription for all users, including the paid ones. People were upset so you backtracked and <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2019/09/18/major-new-update/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">grandfathered them into</a> a lifetime plus membership. Sadly, in 2020 NPR lost <a href="https://current.org/2021/01/public-media-owners-agree-to-sell-pocket-casts-podcast-platform/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">$800k from running you</a> so you were <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/07/16/popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts-joins-automattic/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">sold to Automattic</a>.</p>
<p>In 2024, you renamed all "Pocket Casts Lifetime Members" to <a href="https://support.pocketcasts.com/knowledge-base/lifetime-access-to-pocket-casts-plus/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">"Pocket Casts Champions"</a> and we knew shenanigans were afoot.</p>
<p>This week you flipped the switch to turn on ads in the app:<br>
<img src="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/content/images/2025/09/1000002462.png" alt="1000002462.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>However, in 2022 you <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2022/10/19/pocket-casts-mobile-apps-are-now-open-source/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">made your mobile apps open source</a>, so there is something that can be done: I <a href="https://github.com/ciferkey/pocket-casts-android?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">forked</a> the repo.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="exorcising-the-ads">Exorcising the ads</h3>
<p>In the app you may be able to see the new nag that says: "Unlock folders, bookmarks, transcripts and more with Pocket Casts Plus" just above the artwork in the player screen. I don't see that exact string in the <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/podcasts-you-altered-the-deal-so-i-will-alter-your-app/github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android">GitHub repo</a>, I think that's because of internationalization.</p>
<p>However, I found where the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/features/player/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/player/view/PlayerHeaderFragment.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L99">artwork view fragment is</a> and that it contains <code>AdAndArtworkHorizontal</code>. Looking at the changelog I can see that this was added in <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/pull/4086?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Display ads in the player #4086</a> which created the flag <code>Feature.BANNER_ADS</code>.</p>
<p>In the project, a feature flag has the following details:</p>
<pre><code>enum class Feature(  
    val key: String,  
    val title: String,  
    val defaultValue: Boolean,  
    val tier: FeatureTier,  
    val hasFirebaseRemoteFlag: Boolean,  
    val hasDevToggle: Boolean,  
)
</code></pre>
<p>With some further updates to the project, the flag is now <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/services/utils/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/utils/featureflag/Feature.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L125-L140">broken in two</a>:</p>
<pre><code>BANNER_ADS_PLAYER(  
    key = "banner_ad_player",  
    title = "Banner Ads Player",  
    defaultValue = true,  
    tier = FeatureTier.Free,  
    hasFirebaseRemoteFlag = true,  
    hasDevToggle = true,  
),  
BANNER_ADS_PODCASTS(  
    key = "banner_ad_podcasts",  
    title = "Banner Ads Podcasts",  
    defaultValue = true,  
    tier = FeatureTier.Free,  
    hasFirebaseRemoteFlag = true,  
    hasDevToggle = true,  
),
</code></pre>
<p>The flags are ultimately used by <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/services/model/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/models/type/BlazeAdLocation.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L11">BlazeAdLocation</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways we could slice out the ads. For testing, I went with the simplest approach to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flip <code>defaultValue</code> to false.</li>
<li>Flip <code>hasFirebaseRemoteFlag</code> to false so the flag will not be remotely overridden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, based on the readme I just needed to<code>./gradlew :app:assembleDebugProd</code> and <code>./gradlew :app:installDebugProd</code>. This will install a different debug version of the app:<br>
<img src="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/content/images/2025/09/1000002460.png" alt="1000002460.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Voila, ads gone. Though in the future this process may be tougher because of Google's <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">impending crackdown on loading APKs</a>.</p>
<p>Now, after doing all that work, guess what I realized? <code>hasDevToggle</code> field in the Features class? Well the debug build has a feature toggles section:<br>
<img src="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/content/images/2025/09/1000002458.png" alt="1000002458.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>So for now you do not need to modify the project's code. You can get by with just using the debug build and toggling the feature off. Feature flags only exist for testing features though. Eventually the flag will go away and I'll have to disable the ads more directly.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-we-end-up-here">Why did we end up here?</h3>
<p>Pocket Casts, your current approach to monetization seems extreme. Are you in a similar situation to 2020? Back then the NPR <a href="https://media.npr.org/documents/about/statements/fy2020/National%20Public%20Radio%20-%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">financial report</a> only had a single line item of $812,129 for "Minus: Share of Podcast Media’s net loss". Why does a podcast service cost so much to run? If you give us more transparency, maybe we will better understand why you need to make changes.</p>
<p>Maybe more of the work can be moved on-device. You open-sourced your app. Maybe the community can help you out and contribute those changes? We're not too scary. You extended an olive branch by open-sourcing the project, so let's work together. Hopefully Automattic doesn't pull back on contributions like they <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">did with WordPress this year</a>.</p>

<h3 id="an-entirely-different-option">An entirely different option</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my post about <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/the-apps-that-i-kept-on-grapheneos-2/#the-media-apps">the apps I kept when switching to GrapheneOS</a>,  self-hosting PinePods and using AntennaPod on your phone is a great option! That way you can still have web and desktop sync. I also said in that post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I wasn't grandfathered into the free premium tier I would be more tempted to jump ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The time to jump ship seems to be getting closer. I think Pocket Casts will join a future version of my <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/the-apps-that-i-got-rid-of-when-trying-out-grapheneos/">apps that I got rid of when switching to GrapheneOS</a> post.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone is looking for new podcasts to listen to, <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/what-podcasts-am-i-listening-to-2025/">I have recommendations</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="more-info-4">
          <p>If you've ever traveled in search of fall foliage before, you likely know how tricky it can be to be in the right place at the right time. The timing of peak color varies signficantly season-to-season, meaning what worked one year might not work the next! The best fall trips take careful planning, a lot of patience, and a reliable fall foliage map.</p>
          <p>It's helpful to establish a baseline for when leaves <i>normally</i> change. Maps, like the one in the above section, can help you identify roughly when in the season you should be planning your trip. From there, you should consult a real-time fall foliage map like ours to see if fall foliage is on-time or running early/late due to ongoing weather conditions.</p>
          <p>If at all possible, don't solidify your plans until you're two weeks out from peak fall foliage. This allows you to be flexible should extreme weather rear its head and disrupt the normal progression of fall foliage. Should that not be an option for you, do your planning in early September when fall foliage experts can give you an idea of whether or not fall color is on-time this year.</p>
          <p>You'll want to make the most of your time in fall's splendor, so be sure to pick out a few beautiful hikes or drives on which you can truly be emersed in autumnal glory. If you're looking to beat the crowds, consider going to popular locations very early in the morning, before the majority of people arrive. Sunrise bathes fall foliage in golden hues, making early morning one of the best times to venture out!</p>

<p><span>Section</span> <span>1</span>. &nbsp;<span>Antifa as a Terrorist Threat</span>.&nbsp; Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law.&nbsp; It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals.&nbsp; This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists. &nbsp;Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members.&nbsp; Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech.&nbsp; This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism.</p>



<p><span>Sec</span>. <span>2</span>. &nbsp;<span>Designation as a Domestic Terrorist Organization</span>.&nbsp; Because of the aforementioned pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law, I hereby designate Antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization.”&nbsp; All relevant executive departments and agencies shall utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>Sec</span>. <span>3</span>. &nbsp;<span>General Provisions</span>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

                                        <p>People who are incarcerated are paid notoriously low wages for kitchen, laundry work and maintenance.</p><p>But the expanded use of laptops is creating other opportunities.</p>
<p><i>This is part two in a two-part series about remote work in Maine prisons. </i><a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/maine/2025-08-28/cracking-the-code-how-technology-and-education-are-changing-life-in-prison" target="_blank"><i>To read part one, click here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Preston Thorpe is only 32, but he says he's already landed his dream job as a senior software engineer and bought a modest house with his six-figure salary. It was all accomplished by putting in long days from his cell at the Mountain View Correctional Center in Charleston.</p><p>"It's not normal to have 15-17 hours a day to really focus on something and learn something, like deeply," Thorpe says. "And fortunately tech is one of the few areas where they're not concerned with your college degree. They're really only concerned with your ability to write code."</p>
<p>A self-described "computer geek," Thorpe says he built his first computer at age 13. In high school he always expected he'd have a career in tech. But he also had a rebellious side. He got into trouble with drugs, using them and selling them. He says his parents kicked him out of the house and he ended up in prison for the first time at age 20.</p><p>"You know, I was worried and pretty hopeless that I had messed my life up so bad that it was no longer possible to have like a normal life and normal career," he says.</p><p>When you have nothing to lose, Thorpe says it's pretty easy to behave that way. And when you're out of prison with a criminal record, no money and an identity as a convict, he says the likelihood you're going to improve your life in any way is zero.</p><p>His own circumstances changed in 2019 when he got transferred from the New Hampshire prison system to Maine, where he discovered laptops with limited internet access were available for education. That's when he says he had an epiphany that he could change himself by pursuing his passion. And about two years ago, he became one of the first incarcerated people in the country to get hired for a remote job.</p><p>"Now I feel like my life has purpose," Thorpe says.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Glauber Costa says he first became aware of Thorpe through his contributions to an online public software project. Costa is the CEO of Turso, an international database company. He was impressed by Thorpe's work and had no idea he was incarcerated.</p><p>Once he found out, he thought it would be impossible to talk to Thorpe, let alone hire him.</p><p>"But then," Costa says, "it turns out that he can take video calls. And then by talking to him, it became very, very clear to me that if this is not a reformed person I don't know what is."</p><p>Costa says he was also surprised to learn that Thorpe was eligible for remote work while he was in prison. He hired him in June. He figured Thorpe might have trouble clearing the company's background check and he says he prepared himself for that. But since it only searches back seven years and since Thorpe has been in prison for more than a decade, "He is actually our cleanest background check," Costa says.</p><p>"He doesn't have a parking ticket."</p><p>Several dozen other prisoners are also working remote jobs. At the Maine Correctional Center in Windham, Darlene George is a certified recovery coach, a scholar and a teaching assistant who's serving a 40-year sentence for the murder of her husband.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>"I became incarcerated in 2009 and I've been here 16 years," George says.</p><p>Unlike most women in prison, George had a college degree before she was incarcerated. She says she still tries to make the most of every opportunity she can. For the past two years, she's held a full-time remote job, first as a grant writer and now as a program coordinator, for a Maine-based health care company.</p><p>"The work, it just, it really makes you feel good," she says. "When I — when I put my head down at night I can say I'm giving something back."</p><p>George relishes her role as a decision maker and an advocate for clients' health care. She makes a competitive salary. And she says her boss and her co-workers are extremely supportive of her situation, and so are the other women at the Maine Correctional Center.</p><p>"Literally, I work from my room. There's a sign that I put out that lets people know I'm Zooming or in meetings," she says. "They try not to be noisy on the floor ... because they're like, 'Well, we want a job, too.'"</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Mara Sanchez, the program director for the Alliance for Higher Education in Prison, says Maine's Department of Corrections was the first to have a remote work policy.</p><p>"Their implementation, willingness to try remote work for incarcerated students has really kind of set the bar for other states and been very inspiring to other states," she says.</p><p>Maine Corrections Commissioner Randall Liberty says remote work is an outgrowth of expanded educational opportunities in prison. There are 800 residents who now have access to the internet.</p><p>"We have technicians that are watching where they're going and what they're doing and we've had very few problems," Liberty says. "If it provides meaningful employment for them ... it also allows for a transition back into the community."</p><p>For example, Liberty says one resident worked as a paralegal for a law firm and continued with the job after he got out. Wages are garnished for child support, victim restitution and other fees. And for those who earn above a certain amount, 10% goes to the Department of Corrections for room and board. But residents can also save money or send it home. And Liberty says between educational programs and remote work, the prison environment is better for everyone.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>"It's important that the officers work with residents that have hope and have meaning in their life," he says. "We had 87 assaults on staff in 2017. Last year, we had seven assaults on staff. So all of this work isn't just about the residents.

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that a nearly complete offshore wind project halted by the administration can resume, dealing President Donald Trump a setback in his ongoing effort to restrict the fledgling industry.</p><p>Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/offshore-revolution-wind-project-stopped-trump-33214b9efb8f3f7a98c58299581bff9f">has been paused since Aug. 22</a></span> when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order for what it said were national security concerns. The Interior Department agency did not specify those concerns at the time. Both the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-renewable-energy-offshore-wind-revolution-wind-356d6be1f0967302cd8414b2fb881308">developer and the two states sued</a></span> in federal courts.</p><p>Danish energy company Orsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables sought a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court that would allow them to move forward with the project.</p><p>At a hearing Monday, Judge Royce Lamberth said he considered how Revolution Wind has relied on its federal approval, the delays are costing $2.3 million a day and if the project can’t meet deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse. After December, the specialized ship needed to complete the project won’t be available until at least 2028, he said. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, which is 80% complete.</p>
    
<p>“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,” Lamberth said, as he granted the motion for the preliminary injunction. In his written ruling, he said Revolution Wind had “demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits” of its claim, adding that granting the injunction is in the public interest.</p>



<p>Interior Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Peace said the ruling means Revolution Wind “will be able to resume construction” while the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management “continues its investigation into possible impacts by the project to national security and prevention of other uses on the Outer Continental Shelf.”</p>
    
    
    
<p>The administration said in a court filing this month that while BOEM approved the wind farm, it stipulated that the developer continue to work with the Department of Defense to mitigate national security concerns. It said the Interior Department, to date, has not received any information that these concerns have been addressed.</p>
    
<p>Orsted said Monday that construction will resume as soon as possible, and it will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the administration.</p><p>Nancy Pyne of the Sierra Club said the court ruling “reaffirms that Donald Trump and his administration’s attacks on clean energy are not only reckless and harmful to our communities, but they are also illegal.” Trump is trying to “kneecap” renewable energy “in favor of dirty and expensive fossil fuels,” she said. </p><p>White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was elected with a mandate to “restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country. This will not be the final say on the matter.” </p><p>On the campaign trail, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-energy-4e5b18ecd4799cc4cfd8cd7dc7b326ee">Trump vowed to end the offshore wind industry</a></span> as soon as he returned to the White House. He wants to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which emit greenhouse gases that cause climate change, in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says.</p>
    
<p>His administration has <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/offshore-revolution-wind-project-stopped-trump-33214b9efb8f3f7a98c58299581bff9f">stopped construction on major offshore wind farms</a></span>, revoked wind energy permits and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/wind-energy-offshore-turbines-trump-executive-order-995a744c3c1a2eddb30cacf50b681f13">paused permitting</a></span>, canceled plans to use <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-wind-permitting-offshore-7a05dff77ba92e4a7761604583a6d208">large areas of federal waters</a></span> for new offshore wind development and stopped <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-renewable-energy-transportation-8578da8b985b6d4eef20ec4d85c21b5d">$679 million in federal funding</a></span> for a dozen offshore wind projects. </p><p>Last week, the administration moved to block a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-southcoast-massachusetts-125266070fcc8c784c92ca83d6f14300">separate Massachusetts offshore wind farm</a></span>. That was just days after the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel previous approval to build an offshore wind project in Maryland. </p><p>Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of supplying power to more than 350,000 homes, about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.</p><p>Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who are both Democrats, called the judge’s ruling a major win for workers and families, who need the project to stay on track so it can start to drive down unaffordable energy bills. </p>
    
<p>Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney, a Democrat, said a multibillion-dollar project that is 80% complete and was fully permitted with input by the Pentagon is not a national security problem. The Interior Department “should take the hint and let the thousands of construction workers finish the job,” he said.</p><p>Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.

As population growth surged and people moved to urban areas en masse, American cities began to dump sewage in the same rivers that provided their drinking water. After epidemiologists linked typhoid outbreaks to water cleanliness, cities began building large-scale sand filtration systems in the 1890s, and in 1908, Jersey City pioneered the first continuous chlorination of a public water supply. By the 1920s, typhoid deaths had fallen by two-thirds, and waterborne diseases were in retreat across the country.</p><p>While typhoid and other waterborne diseases triggered vast engineering and regulatory responses, the equivalent airborne threats have not. Tuberculosis alone kills more than a million people every year around the world, yet the air in schools, clinics, and public buildings remains largely unfiltered and unmonitored. Covid-19, which killed over seven million people, demonstrated how rapidly airborne pathogens can spread in poorly ventilated spaces.</p><p>Just as filtration and chlorination made drinking water safe at scale, we now have the tools to do the same for indoor air: ventilation, high-quality filters, and germicidal light. A century ago, germicidal light at 254 nanometers seemed to be a promising way of controlling pathogens by killing them in the air, but it turned out to cause irritation and cancer in the skin, and it was largely dropped when antibiotics became widespread.</p><p>But today there is an update that has none of these drawbacks. We now know that wavelengths under 230 nanometers, especially 222 nanometer light, are harmless to humans, but can still disable microscopic pathogens. We know how to filter out all wavelengths except the ones we want, and how to direct them away from humans, cycling the air through them to clean it without exposing people to it, just in case it carries unknown risks. This far-UVC light, as it is called, may be how we can make the air we breathe as safe as the water we drink.</p><p><span>Until the mid-nineteenth century, most physicians believed that disease spread through </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/miasma-theory" rel="">miasmas</a><span>, poisonous vapors rising from filth and decay. Contemporaries were obsessed with air: moving to the countryside for the air, taking the air at the seaside. Bad air was blamed for sickness. Herbs were burned to purify the air to fight the plague. But because they didn’t understand what made the air dirty, they were not very good at cleaning it. This began to change only when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch provided the first definitive proof that microscopic organisms were responsible for infectious disease.</span></p><p>Cleaning air relies on the same fundamental techniques as cleaning water: replacement, filtration, and disinfection. Pathogens replicate inside people, who then expel them into the air by breathing, talking, or coughing, where they can remain suspended and infect new individuals. The relative contributions of aerosol transmission, droplet transmission, and fomite (surface) transmission vary between diseases. Certain diseases, such as Covid-19, are driven by a small number of highly infectious individuals (‘superspreaders’) that account for a disproportionate number of cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalhealthdelivery.org/files/ghd_dubai/files/history_of_uvg_radiation_reed.pdf" rel="">In 1877</a><span>, British researchers Arthur Downes and Thomas Blunt stumbled upon a discovery that would lay the groundwork for modern disinfection. In </span><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rspl.1877.0068" rel="">a paper</a><span> submitted to the Royal Society of London, they described how over the course of six months they had used sunlight to prevent bacteria from growing in a tube.</span></p><p><span>Follow-up research by Robert Koch demonstrated that sunlight could kill </span><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em><span>, but the early experiments lacked precision. Scientists knew light worked, but not which parts of the spectrum were responsible. The turning point came in 1930, when Frederick L Gates </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19872573/" rel="">published</a><span> the first quantitative analysis of how ultraviolet light affected bacteria, pinpointing peak germicidal effectiveness at 265 nanometers, the same point that nucleic acids – DNA and RNA – absorb light.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png" width="1024" height="564" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:564,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rWCA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b4452e-9dc2-4cd1-83df-8ac0ad7f6388_1024x564.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Understanding the spectrum wasn’t necessary for harnessing it.

Hewitt created a voltage difference across electrodes in a glass tube, with mercury vapor causing electrons to separate from mercury atoms and collide with other atoms, exciting them to higher energy states.

Natural circulation patterns move air to the ceiling, where it is cleaned, before it falls back down. But even reflected beams can cause irritation, meaning that each installation has to be calibrated carefully for the specifics of the room. Even repainting or shifting furniture can change the reflection of the beams, meaning that the UV beams would need to be recalibrated.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png" width="1024" height="716" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:716,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1OsI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40eb0ab-e5ea-4b00-8235-5a6016ba1097_1024x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Shorter-wavelength light </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39828932/" rel="">works</a><span> just as </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-57441-z" rel="">effectively, without many of the downsides. </a><span>Light with a wavelength of 230 nanometers or lower, known as ‘far-UVC’, disables pathogens without hurting humans, but mercury lamps cannot produce it.</span></p><p><span>Unlike longer wavelengths, far-UVC penetrates weakly, meaning it is only absorbed by the uppermost layers of the skin and eye, tissues which slough off frequently and do not divide.

Consumer far-UVC systems are often considerably more expensive – a </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technologies-Krypton-36-222nm-Ceiling-Cleaner/dp/B0CPNJBNNL" rel="">typical example</a><span> costs $2,500 for a lamp covering 1,000 square feet, although a </span><a href="https://aerolamp.net/" rel="">newer model</a><span> has recently come to market at $600, and </span><a href="https://cybernightmarket.com/" rel="">less expensive lamps</a><span> with lower output can be added together to cover a similar floorspace.</span></p><p>The drawbacks of ventilation-based air filtration methods are similar to the drawbacks of ventilation itself. Moving air from place to place and forcing it through a fine filter requires energy, and fresh air from outdoors is often at the wrong temperature, requiring extra heating or cooling. Meanwhile, the constant air movement can also chill the air to the point of discomfort, requiring indoor heating. This has obvious impacts on the costs and environmental footprint of buildings.</p><p><span>Doubling the ventilation rate from the US standard minimum in offices could add </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/11/14709#B10-ijerph-12-14709" rel="">up to $40 per person per year</a><span> to building running costs.

Energy recovery units help equalize the temperatures between intake and exhaust air, and can </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/11/14709" rel="">lower these figures by about 60 percent</a><span> (or even more), depending on local climate and system type. However, in Europe, the hurdle is even higher: most buildings have no mechanical ventilation at all, so adapting existing ventilation systems is out of the question. For example, in the UK, </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1019896/cooling-in-uk.pdf" rel="">an engineering review</a><span> found that only five percent of residential buildings were likely to have air conditioning (a proxy for mechanical ventilation) by 2019. By contrast, in the US, </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/air-conditioning-use-emerges-as-one-of-the-key-drivers-of-global-electricity-demand-growth" rel="">about 90 percent</a><span> of residences have air conditioning.</span></p><p>Ventilation comes with another tradeoff: noise. The more air you filter, the harder your fan has to work, the faster it spins, and the louder it gets. Free-standing filtration units can be powerful, quiet, or affordable – but rarely all three at once. Purpose-built ventilation can be made quieter, but quiet movement of a large volume of air requires wide, leak-free ducting, which can increase installation complexity. Real world studies have shown that the noise and discomfort created by even relatively modest free-standing units mean that they are frequently turned down or switched off.</p><p><span>These drawbacks mean that ventilation-based methods lack the power to effectively block transmission of highly infectious pathogens or prevent pandemics. Without UV light, public buildings will require air handling systems akin to those in hospital isolation rooms to comply with current </span><a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/bookstore/ashrae-standard-241-control-of-infectious-aerosols" rel="">infection control </a><span>guidelines. While circumstances vary from place to place, ventilation-based air quality measures quickly become impractical beyond around five air changes per hour, while upper-room UV light can achieve the equivalent of 35 air changes per hour, and far-UVC has the potential to reach well over 100.</span></p><p><span>Despite this, both ventilation and filtration need to be kept in mind as new buildings replace the old. If nothing else, ventilation design is an important </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021850202001179" rel="">factor</a><span> in determining the effectiveness of UV systems; how well air is mixed and how quickly it moves </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670722003663?casa_token=I1CkXXNQmOMAAAAA:ZM2DxrbHI07-zr9Ssqg2LwdcKWFNxncDpbtKiNw8LNx6I4BSlAbSncOlrGnEc7rxEnwEWlDxAQ" rel="">affects the degree</a><span> to which pathogens are exposed to UV light.

It does not alter pathogens in a way that allows resistance to emerge, a serious problem for antibiotics.

Light at this wavelength is safe for human eyes and skin at doses that efficiently kill germs, but about 10–20 percent of the output consists of longer wavelengths with much lower maximum exposures. To use the lamps in occupied spaces, a filter with multiple layers of quartz and hafnium oxide is used to reflect unwanted wavelengths while allowing 222-nanometer light through.</p><p>Despite its potential, far-UVC has yet to achieve widespread use.</p><p>The very best krypton chloride emitters on the market are reliable, long-lasting, powerful, use little energy, and come with effective optical filters. But the state of the art is not representative. The krypton-chloride lamp industry is plagued by low-quality products with short lifespans that may not even produce any far-UVC light, and could even emit dangerous longer wavelengths. There is no product standard certification for UV lamps.</p><p><span>Top-tier excimer lamps, from reputable manufacturers, are expensive. This is partly due to their inherent complexity but largely from sluggish demand. The key reason is that, notwithstanding their successes in the 1930s, a </span><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/flipping-the-switch-on-far-uvc" rel="">certification vacuum denies buyers an authoritative seal of efficacy</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In part, this is because some of the studies establishing far-UVC’s efficacy aren’t as definitive as they need to be to really move the dial. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MefmQL0fY3o" rel="">One study</a><span> on the impact of germicidal UV installations on tuberculosis transmission in homeless shelters was unsuccessful when the national rate of tuberculosis declined, which meant that the study ended up being too small to detect an effect even in principle.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MefmQL0fY3o" rel="">In another study</a><span>, germicidal UV was installed in hospitals to assess the impact of germicidal UV on flu transmission, but during the course of that study, the hospitals stopped routine flu testing. In a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uadVLEAfjt8" rel="">classroom study</a><span>, not all classrooms had enough electrical sockets to plug in the portable air cleaners required for the study, some teachers turned off the air filters because they were too loud, and some schools didn’t install the germicidal UV devices they were supposed to because there were no legal protections for them for doing so.</span></p><p><span>But there are many other factors as well. Measuring infection control is challenging and seldom undertaken, particularly in public spaces. Epidemiological data is expensive and difficult to gather, and there is currently no way to measure the amount of viable, infectious pathogens in the air in real time. Office attendance can be tracked, but controlling for how users mix outside the office space is immensely difficult, and measuring the real-world effect of small-scale deployments in public areas is almost impossible. Studies aiming to cause deliberate disease transmission in controlled environments have </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32658939/" rel="">failed to work</a><span> in </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.28.25326458v1.full" rel="">practice</a><span> because they have been too small to generate enough infections.</span></p><p>Pathogen-free air and the research that goes into getting it are both, to some extent, public goods: the beneficiaries will mostly be people who haven’t paid for them. Even if a business reduces pathogens in its offices’ air, the biggest upside goes to other people who share spaces with its employees. This could be commuters on the same train, people in shops, or parents whose children attend the same school.</p><p>Despite the lack of clear economic upside, we are already seeing some early adoption among respected institutions: Mount Sinai Hospital, for example, has far-UVC lamps installed in its Cohen Center for Recovery from Complex Chronic Illnesses. Ideally, others would emulate this example, creating a stronger basis for research.</p><p>If one part of the knot were cut, then one of the most promising disease-fighting technologies of our time could finally be employed en masse.</p><p>In the early 1900s, a public health official in Jersey City, John Leal, lost his father to illness likely caused by contaminated drinking water.</p><p>But Leal had an opportunity to prevent such a loss for others: he quietly directed the addition of chlorine to the drinking water supply in Jersey City, hiring engineer George Fuller to design and build a system for dripping a diluted bleach solution into Boonton Reservoir. He believed that this common household bleach agent could kill pathogens without harming people. He was right.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png" width="1024" height="654" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:654,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JsZN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62d245ee-227e-4b5f-a851-75552dafe198_1024x654.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Beyond being a triumph of science, water sanitation led to a fundamental shift in public expectations.

<h2>Station owners can still block Kimmel show</h2>
<p>Apparently buoyed by Disney caving to his demand to "take action" against Kimmel, Carr went on to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-getting-jimmy-kimmel-suspended-fcc-chair-threatens-abcs-the-view/">make threats</a> regarding ABC's <em>The View</em> and NBC late-night hosts Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon. Carr's threats were criticized by Democratic lawmakers en masse, and a couple of prominent Republicans <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/rand-paul-fcc-chair-had-no-business-intervening-in-abc-kimmel-controversy/">sided against him</a>. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that "Brendan Carr has got no business weighing in on this," while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that Carr's threat to ABC was "right outta <em>Goodfellas</em>."</p>
<p>Disney reinstating Kimmel doesn't necessarily mean his show will immediately appear on all ABC-affiliated networks. Conservative broadcaster Sinclair <a href="https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/">said last week</a> that "regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform."</p>
<p>Station owner Nexstar helped pressure Disney into suspending Kimmel's show last week when it <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">announced</a> its ABC-affiliated stations would not air the show "for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p>Part of Carr's strategy was to urge station owners to demand that Kimmel be taken off the air. "The individual licensed stations that are taking their content, it's time for them to step up and say this garbage isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities," Carr said.</p>
<p>The pressure from broadcasters came at a time when both <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/broadcaster-fcc-abolish-national-tv-ownership-rule-1236496159/">Nexstar</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/doj-probes-disney-fubo-deal-over-competition-concerns">Disney</a> are seeking Trump administration approval for mergers. Anna Gomez, the one Democrat on the Republican-majority FCC, said that companies seeking merger approvals are "vulnerable to pressure to bend to the government's ideological demands."</p>
