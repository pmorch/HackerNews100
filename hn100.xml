            <p>During AMD's Computex 2024 kick-off keynote, AMD's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, officially unveiled and announced the company's next generation of Ryzen processors. Today marks the first unveiling of AMD's highly anticipated Zen 5 microarchitecture via the Ryzen 9000 series, which is set to bring several advancements over Zen 4 and the Ryzen 7000 series for desktop PCs, which will launch sometime in July 2024.</p>

<p>AMD has unveiled four new chip SKUs using its Zen 5 microarchitecture. The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor will be the new consumer flagship part, featuring 16 CPU cores and a speedy 5.7 GHz maximum boost frequency. The other SKUs include, 6, 8, and 12 core parts, giving users a varied combination of core and thread counts. All four of these initial chips will be X-series chips, meaning they will have an unlocked multipliers and higher TDPs/clockspeeds.</p>

<p>In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips' turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips.</p>

<p>The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD's Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD's commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations.</p>

<h2>AMD Ryzen 9000: Bringing Up to 16C/32T of Zen 5 to Desktop</h2>

<p>Zen 5 is AMD's latest advancement in Ryzen microarchitecture. While AMD hasn't disclosed many technical details, we know some of the brand-new features that Zen 5 will offer.</p>

<p>Looking at architectural differences between the last couple of generations (Zen 4 and Zen 3) and Zen 5, we know that AMD uses a new manufacturing process for its Ryzen 9000 desktop chips. While many have touted and speculated that Zen 5 for desktops will be built on one of TSMC's N3 (3 nm) nodes, some of our sources are saying that the Zen 5 CCD will be fabbed on TSMC N4 – though we are awaiting official confirmation about this (Update: And TSMC 4nm is now confirmed for the consumer Ryzen CCD). Furthermore, AMD's mobile counterpart offering, the Ryzen AI 300 series (Strix Point) has been confirmed for 4nm, and we've yet to see an AMD desktop CPU die produced on a more advanced node than its mobile counterpart.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2810%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2810%29.png"></a></p>

<p>While AMD is not offering a deep dive into the Zen 5 architecture at Computex, the company did touch upon a few of the major architectural improvements over Zen 4 that will be coming with the new CPU architecture. These start with an improved branch predictor, which is designed to offer better accuracy, efficiency, and reduced overall latency of instruction cycles. The Zen 5 architecture also boasts higher throughput with wider pipelines and SIMDs, allowing for faster data processing and equating to better overall performance in benchmarks such as CineBench and Blender and workloads leveraging the AVX-512 instruction set.</p>

<p>Additionally, Zen 5 introduces a deeper out-of-order instruction window size across its design, enabling more parallelism and better handling of multiple instructions within the pipeline simultaneously.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2811%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2811%29.png"></a></p>

<p>There are also a couple of points within the Zen 5 architecture where AMD has doubled up on resources or performance. L2 to L1 memory bandwidth is one such example, giving the cache hierarchy a big bandwidth boost that should allow for faster data transfers within the individual CPU cores. AMD also claims better AI performance in inferencing and AVX-512 workloads. Notably, AMD's AVX-512 support on Zen 4 was executed using a 256-bit SIMD over 2 cycles, so this may be a sign that AMD has expanded their AVX-512 SIMDs to a full 512-bits wide in the Zen 5 architecture. (Update: This has since been confirmed by AMD. Zen 5 now has a full 512-bit wide SIMD for processing AVX-512 instructions)</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2812%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2812%29.png"></a></p>

<p>These enhancements collectively aim to deliver significant performance gains over the previous Zen 4 microarchitecture, with AMD touting an average (geomean) 16% IPC uplift over Zen 4 in desktop workloads. It should be noted, however, that the top result in this benchmark collection is in the GeekBench 5.3 AES XTS benchmark, which leverages the VAES512 and VAES256 extensions of the AVX-512 instruction set. So AMD's AVX-512 SIMD changes greatly impact that benchmark in particular (though not exclusively).</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/Ryzen-9000-Delidded_2.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/Ryzen-9000-Delidded_2_575px.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Above is a render of a Ryzen 9000 series chip with two core complex dies (CCDs), which depicts the silicon's composition and layout. As with previous generations of Ryzen processors, there's a large central I/O die (IOD), through which all I/O and memory operations are routed. As for the CCDs, each die once again contains 8 CPU cores, with AMD equipping Ryzen chips with either 1 or 2 CCDs depending on the SKU. The new Zen 5 CCDs are being fabbed on one of TSMC's 4nm processes (AMD hasn't confirmed which flavor), which is a modest shrink from the N5 process used for Zen 4 CCDs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although AMD hasn't confirmed that they're reusing the Ryzen 7000 series IOD here, all signs currently point to the Ryzen 9000 IOD being similar or identical to it. In particular, it is fabbed on the same TSMC N6 process, with the same 2 RDNA graphics CUs, and it offers the exact same off-chip I/O capabilities (though the latter is admittedly also dictated by the AM5 socket).</p>

<p>AMD's Ryzen 9000 chips will also feature similar memory support as their predecessors, with AMD sticking to DDR5. However, AMD does note that the incoming X870E and X870 motherboard chipsets will allow for faster EXPO memory profiles than seen on Zen 4. <s>As it stands, AMD hasn't disclosed the JEDEC memory specification of the four Ryzen 9000 SKUs that it announced today. However, we expect to find out more before the July 2024 launch of the Ryzen 9000 family.</s> And according to AMD's product pages posted since the keynote, the Ryzen 9000 family will top out at JEDEC DDR5-5600 speeds for in-warranty configurations.</p>

<p>The announcement of Zen 5 for desktop by AMD and the impending Ryzen 9000 offers four X-series SKUs at launch, allowing for overclocking and coming with unlocked CPU multipliers. The flagship SKU, the Ryzen 9 9950X, features 16 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.7 GHz, 80 MB of cache split between 64 MB for the L3 and 16 MB for the L2 (1 MB per core of L2) and a 170 W TDP. The Ryzen 9 9900X offers 12 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.6 GHz, 64 MB of L3 cache, and a 120 W TDP.</p>

<p>Moving down the Ryzen 9000 stack is the Ryzen 7 9700X, which comes with 8 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.5 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65W TDP. Finally, the entry-level SKU, the Ryzen 5 9600X, has just 6 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.4 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65 W TDP.</p>

<p>The next slide denotes the flagship Zen 5 chip. The Ryzen 9 9950X is up against Intel's current 14th Gen Core i9-14900K. In productivity and content creation tasks, the Ryzen 9 9950X shows a 7% improvement in Procyon Office, a 10% increase in Puget Photoshop, and a 21% uplift in Cinebench R24 nT. More notably, it exhibits a 55% performance boost in Handbrake and a 56% increase in Blender.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2814%29.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21415/AMD%20COMPUTEX%20CLIENT%20PRESS%20DECK-01-01%20%2814%29.png"></a></p>

<p>Interestingly, the gaming data shows marginal gains in some titles, although it highlights more significant uplifts in others. AMD's in-house testing shows that the Ryzen 9 9950X outperforms the Intel Core i9-14900K by 4% in Borderlands 3, 6% in Hitman 3, and 13% in Cyberpunk 2077. Further, it achieves a 16% improvement in F1 2023, a 17% gain in DOTA 2, and a 23% increase in Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>

<p>As we've mentioned, AMD is committed to extending its AM5 socket for longevity, at least much more than other vendors offer with their CPU launches and updates. As such, AMD's Ryzen 9000 series operates on the current AM5 platform. And while Ryzen 9000 is fully backwards compatible with existing 600 series boards, AMD has also readied two new 800 series motherboard chipsets for the launch of Zen 5 on desktops. The X870E (extreme) and X870 chipsets will be featured on numerous new motherboards at launch, and a big part of Computex this week will be the motherboard vendors (most of whom are local Taiwanese firms) showing off their new wares.</p>

<p>AMD has offered just a handful of details about their X870E and X870 chipsets. Of particular note, USB 4.0 support is going to be standard on all X870(E) motherboards, whereas it was optional on X670(E) series boards. X870(E) boards will also feature Wi-Fi 7 support (up from 6E on the 600 series), and at least one PCIe 5.0 NVMe slot continues to be mandatory. AMD also notes that motherboards based on both platforms "feature 44 total PCIe lanes," which would break down as 24 lanes from the CPU, and another 20 lanes coming from the chipset.</p>

<p>For the moment, different AMD resources are in conflict with each other about PCIe 5.0 – or, at least, aren't being very clear about it. According to <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/chipsets/am5.html#specs">AMD's AM5 chipset page</a>, both X870 and X870E feature PCie 5.0 for both the CPU NVMe lanes and CPU PEG lanes. However AMD's Compute press release states that X870E is "differentiated with 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes, with 16 lanes dedicated to graphics," implying that the vanilla X870 won't mandate PCIe 5.0 support. We're poking around AMD and the motherboard vendors to find out more.</p>

<p>Looking under the hood, AMD has confirmed that the new chipsets aren't based on new silicon. Instead, the company is using the same ASMedia-produced design as in the X670/B650 chipsets: the Promontory 21 controller. Given that the feature sets of the newer X870E/X870 motherboards are fundamentally similar to those of the X670E/X670 motherboards, aside from using newer external controllers such as Wi-Fi 7, there's apparently little need to change the chipset itself. Though given the lack of significant changes, it does raise the question of why AMD has skipped a generation in its nomenclature (700-series anyone?) and went straight to the 800-series chipset.</p>

<p>The AMD Ryzen 9000 series, including the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X (16C/32T), the Ryzen 9 9900X (12C/24T), the Ryzen 7 9700X (8C/16T), and the entry-level Ryzen 5 9600X (6C/12T) is expected to hit retail channels sometime in July 2024. At the time of writing, AMD is not providing pricing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><div><p><em>“Our minds are hurt more often by overeating than by hunger.” </em></p><p><em>— Petrarch</em></p></div><p>We evolved to crave sugar because it was a scarce source of energy. But when we learned to produce it on an industrial scale, suddenly our love for sweet things became a liability. The same is now true of data. In an age of information overabundance, our curiosity, which once focused us, now distracts us. And it’s led to an epidemic of intellectual obesity that’s clogging our minds with malignant junk.</p><p><span>The analogy of information as sugar is not just rhetoric. A 2019 </span><a href="https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/how-information-is-like-snacks-money-and-drugs-to-your-brain/" rel="">study</a><span> by researchers at Berkeley found that information acts on the brain’s dopamine-producing reward system in the same way as food. Put simply, the brain treats information as a reward in itself; it doesn't matter whether the info is accurate or useful, the brain will still crave it and feel satisfied after consuming it (at least until it starts craving more).</span></p><p>For hundreds of millennia, this wasn't a problem, because on the plains of the savanna, information was as scarce and precious as sugar. But this all changed with the rise of industrial society and the web.</p><p>We now live in an attention economy, where people are trying to draw our interest by any means possible. Since low-quality information is just as effective at satisfying our information-cravings as high-quality information, the most efficient way to get attention in the digital age is by mass-producing low-quality “junk info”— a kind of fast food for thought. Like fast food, junk info is cheap to produce and satisfying to consume, but high in additives and low in nutrition. It's also potentially addictive and, if consumed excessively, highly dangerous.</p><p>Junk info is often false info, but it isn't junk because it's false. It's junk because it has no practical use; it doesn't make your life better, and it doesn't improve your understanding. Even lies can be nourishing; the works of Dostoevsky are fiction, yet can teach you more about humans than any psychology textbook. Meanwhile, most verified facts do nothing to improve your life or understanding, and are, to paraphrase Nietzsche, as useful as knowledge of the chemical composition of water to someone who is drowning.</p><p><span>Common types of junk info include gossip, trivia, clickbait, hackery, marketing, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churnalism" rel="">churnalism</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/the-opinion-pageant?s=w" rel="">babble</a><span>. But in fact, any information that you can't use is junk info. A typical example on social media would be a photo of a freshly cooked burger, captioned with “Look what I just made!” but posted without a recipe so you can't even recreate it. Such an image might make you briefly salivate, and possibly spur you to make a burger of your own, but it provides no discernible value to your life.</span></p><p>Most people don't think very hard about what they post on social media, and such people are naturally able to post at a faster rate than more careful minds, so trivialities (e.g. “feeling tired, might go to sleep, lol”) quickly saturate these platforms. But the junk info that spreads furthest of all is that which evokes strong emotions, and this hasn't gone unnoticed by those, such as journalists and commentators, who are most desperate for your attention.</p><p><span>The easiest strong emotion to evoke is outrage; it requires nothing more sophisticated than a simple story of oppression, tailored to the appropriate political tribe. And yet outrage, for all its cheapness, is highly addictive and highly contagious, making it the weapon of choice for anyone who wants to be noticed in the online cacophony. Even once-respected outlets like the </span><em>New York Times</em><span> now resort to “ragebait,” sensationalist stories calculated to infuriate both the newspaper's readers and its political opponents, ensuring maximum attention.</span></p><p><span>Market forces and social pressures have caused junk info to dominate the web because it's cheap, easy to produce, and good at stealing your attention. Its ubiquity means it's always within easy reach of netizens, and as a result, millions of people are now hooked on it. It's why they endlessly scroll their Twitter timelines or check their Instagram notifications, or repeatedly click refresh on the YouTube homepages, or keep renewing their subscriptions to the </span><em>Times</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The vast majority of the online content you consume today won't improve your understanding of the world. In fact, it may just do the opposite; recent </span><a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/content/68947" rel="">research</a><span> suggests that people browsing social media tend to experience “normative dissociation” in which they become less aware and less able to process information, to such an extent that they often can’t recall what they just read.</span></p><p>But despite being “empty calories,” junk info still tastes delicious. Since your dopamine pathways can't distinguish between useful and useless info, consuming junk info gives you the satisfaction of feeling like you're learning—it offers you the sensation of mental nourishment—even though all you're really doing is shoving virtual popcorn into your skull.</p><p><span>Eventually, the addiction to useless info leads to what I call “intellectual obesity.” Just as gorging on junk food bloats your body, so gorging on junk info bloats your mind, filling it with a cacophony of half-remembered gibberish that sidetracks your attention and confuses your senses. Unable to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant, you become concerned by trivialities and outraged by falsehoods. These concerns and outrages push you to consume even more, and all the time that you're consuming, you're prevented from doing anything else: learning, focusing, even </span><em>thinking</em><span>. The result is that your stream of consciousness becomes clogged; you develop atherosclerosis of the mind.</span></p><p>We now live in a state of constant distraction caused by an addiction to useless information, and this distraction is so overpowering it even distracts us from the fact we're being distracted. You'll probably read this article, briefly consider the damage junk info has done to you, and then return to aimlessly scrolling Twitter.</p><p>But before you do that, let's try to work out some kind of solution.</p><p>The most straightforward way to improve your information diet is to develop a habit for meta-awareness; to pay attention to what you're paying attention to. When you find yourself reaching unprompted for your phone, or hovering over the Twitter icon, invoke the “10-10-10 rule:” ask yourself, if I consume this info, how will I feel about it in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years? Doing this may help you realize that the brief sugar-rush offered by junk info is so transient and insignificant in the grand scheme of your life that it's simply not worth your time.</p><p>And if your cravings can't be beaten by mere reasoning, then consider rearranging your lifestyle so junk info is simply not an option. The way I beat intellectual obesity was by trying to become the best writer I can be. Writing requires you to filter out bad information because you have a duty to your readers to not be full of shit. Writing also forces you to periodically shut out information altogether so you can be alone with your thoughts. This regular confrontation with yourself helps you keep your bearings in a world constantly trying to lure you away from your brain.</p><p><span>Ultimately you'll have to determine the info-diet that works for you. But if you insist on endlessly consuming whatever the web serves you, know that this banquet culminates in a bitter dessert: at the end of your life, when you're weighing your regrets, you probably won’t say “Man, I wish I’d spent more time browsing the web.” On the contrary, you'll have no recollection of that tweet by a stranger telling you they prefer pasta to pizza, or that gif that amused you for five seconds, or that </span><em>Times</em><span> piece that made you mad for a whole minute. And when you notice the myriad holes that all this junk has left in your memory, then it’ll finally be clear that you weren’t consuming it as much as it was consuming you.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell published one of the most important papers ever produced. The paper was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and was called: “A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field.” The paper might have been the most significant occurrence in the history of physical sciences, as it described the evolution of the electromagnetic field.</p><p>Why was such a description so important? Well, for one, we live in an electromagnetic world. Virtually every force we experience in everyday life (with the exception of gravity) is electromagnetic in origin. It was from Maxwell's equations that electromagnetic waves were predicted to exist. From this mathematical formulation, Maxwell determined that the speed of propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves was the same as the speed of light, and thus showed that EM waves and visible light were really the same thing. Using the equations, we could mathematically construct and deduce the behavior of light and other electromagnetic radiation!</p><p>The importance of Maxwell’s work wasn’t obvious immediately though. For more than 20 years, his work was largely ignored by the scientific community. Why?</p><p>Well … physicists and mathematicians had a hard time understanding it. The equations in their original format amounted to 20 equations, not the 4 elegant ones we have familiarity with today. Not only that, but they were incredibly complicated and difficult to grasp. Most physicists at the time were not equipped to deal with algebraic complexity of that extent. On the other hand, mathematicians also could not grasp what they meant; Maxwell used physical language to explain them, so it was not accessible to the mathematical community at large.</p><p>These weren’t the only reasons that the theory didn’t catch on. The predominant world view at the time relied on mechanics and the universe was seen as being moved by ‘wheels and gears’ beneath the fields which Maxwell’s theory relied on.</p><p>What exactly are fields?</p><p>Well, fields can be thought of as a function acting throughout space and time. The predominant thinking at the time tried to account for such fields through mechanical structures composed of ‘wheels’ and ‘vortices’ which carried the mechanical stresses that the these fields propagated. Of course, such thinking made it difficult to grasp the beauty and meaning of the equations. Maxwell’s theory only becomes simple and elegant once we start to think of the fields (mathematical functions) as being primary and the electromagnetic stresses and mechanical forces as being a consequence of such fields, and not vice-versa.</p><p>The idea that such fields were the primary constituents of the universe did not come easily to Maxwell’s contemporaries. Fields were an abstract concept: mathematical objects which had no physical analogue. His equations were partial differential equations which weren’t accessible to simple interpretation. It wasn’t until the arrival of Oliver Heaviside, who reformulated and simplified the equations, as well as the next generation of physicists (Hertz, Lorentz, and Einstein) that the revelation came through: the universe was not built using the laws of mechanics. It was built through the laws of mathematics and the field equations.</p><p>The goal of this guide is to give an intuitive concept of what Maxwell’s equations represent, as well as capture the beauty of the physical concepts they embody.</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><em>To see the beauty of the Maxwell theory it is necessary to move away from mechanical models and into the abstract world of fields. To see the beauty of quantum mechanics it is necessary to move away from verbal descriptions and into the abstract world of geometry. Mathematics is the language that nature speaks. The language of mathematics makes the world of Maxwell fields and the world of quantum processes equally transparent.” </em></p><p><em>- </em><span>Freeman Dyson</span></p></blockquote><p>A field can be thought of as a function working across space / time.</p><p>It’s important to note that the concept of a field cannot be broken down into something which has a material or mechanical analogy. Sometimes, physicists think of a field as the aggregate effect of exchange or virtual particles which are governed by a quantum field theory, or the effect of the curvature of space time, but it’s important to note that these exchange particles and geometries themselves can also be thought of as mathematical abstractions. We can try to think of a field as some sort of substance, but in reality, there is no substance and there’s no everyday intuition we can use to grasp them other than the basic intuition of having a mathematical function spread out throughout space and time. In other words: the mathematics are the interface, and they define exactly what we can expect from a field. How this interface is implemented is not defined and it’s not something that human beings have been able to figure out.</p><p>It’s easy to get hung up on the notion or question of asking ‘is a field real or not?’ We humans grow up in a world with objects. Our brains are used to breaking down the world into divisible parts and constructing it based on the notion of having ‘things’ which can be inspected by the senses and which are denoted by nouns. These ‘things’ furthermore have mass and volume, and they have discrete boundaries.</p><p>The Greeks were the originators of this conception. They imagined that ‘things’ were built out of smaller things, like atoms and molecules. When the atomic theory came about, they expected the atoms themselves to have some sort of mass, shape and size, and to be a microcosm of more things. Let’s take sand as an example. To the careless eye, sand seems like a fluid, since quantities of it appear to freely merge and split, but on closer inspection, it’s just a bunch of tiny objects which can be described as individual ‘things’ interacting with each other.</p><p>The world of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory introduce a different conception of what things are though. It turns out that elementary particles can’t be thought of as individual ‘things’ which have a volume. In fact, if particles did have a volume, physics wouldn’t work! We would end up with "surfaces" of electrons behaving in an impossible manner and spinning faster than the speed of light.</p><p>Well then, you say, what if particles aren’t objects with a volume, but points in space?</p><p>It turns out that this notion isn’t easily prone to interpretation either! No one actually knows or understands what a ‘point mass’ is! It also has a bizarre implication: if indeed we did have volume-less point masses, we obtain something with an infinite density! In theory, the entire universe could be squeezed to a single point!</p><p>So how can we deal with this? Well, it turns out that all the properties that you associate with ‘stuff’ are actually explainable in terms of electromagnetic fields and masses (which general relativity describes as a component of a tensor field). It turns out that the ‘object oriented’ definition of the universe can be better understood in terms of continuous fields governed by mathematics rather than individual objects or atoms with individual properties.</p><p>There are 2 primary types of fields which we’ll discuss: scalar fields and vector fields. The reality is that we could also encounter other types of fields (such as tensor or spinor fields), but we’ll leave these out of the discussion for now to focus on the ones we’ll need to understand in order to get familiar with Maxwell’s equations.</p><p>So, what is a scalar/vector field?</p><p>Well, a scalar field takes a point in space as input and outputs a single numeric value, while a vector field outputs a vector with a magnitude and direction.</p><p>Below, we’ll show a few examples of fields and illustrate what they mean.</p><p>Let’s imagine that we’re climbing a mountain. As you climb, you notice that the higher you climb, the colder the air gets. We also notice the general heuristic property: the air gets colder at a typical rate of about 3 or 4 degrees Celsius for every kilometer that we climb.</p><p>Now, let’s pretend that we’re observing a large terrain map and we want to ask: what’s the temperature of air at point (x, y, z)?</p><p><span>We can do something very difficult and attempt to create a table which maps every point in space (over the terrain) to a definite temperature, or, we can do the simple thing: we define a function which transforms each point (input) to a definite scalar output which gives us a temperature according to our heuristic rules. We’ll denote this function as T(x,y,z), and we say that our function takes an input from a 3-dimensional real space R</span><sup>3</sup><span> (the x, y, and z coordinates) and outputs values in a 1-dimensional R space (the temperature).</span></p><p><span>That’s it! We described a very simple </span><strong>scalar field</strong><span>!</span></p><p>To get a better grasp of scalar fields, or the functions which describe them, we now describe the heat equation which actually models heat flow (a vector field) using a partial differential equation, but we won’t focus on the actual flow of heat here. Instead, we’ll focus on the changing temperature field to keep things simple.</p><p>Now, going back to partial differential equations: what are they? Well, they play a vital role in physics, especially when attempting to model problems which have an extraordinary amount of complexity. In mathematical terms: we call changing entities variables, and the rate of change of one variable with respect to another is called a derivative. Equations which express relationships between variables and their derivatives are called differential equations. Solving them involves showing how the variables within the equation are related without needing the derivatives themselves. These equations can have many solutions, and the solution of interest may often be determined by its boundary conditions, which can usually be found through the data and conditions which describe our system.</p><p>We don’t have time to discuss how to obtain the solutions to differential equations at this moment. Lots of great books and resources are already available online! Here, we simply want to gain an intuitive picture of how to read them, so that we’re familiar with how they can be used to model fields.</p><p>Let’s assume that we have a metal plate, and that we know how the temperature is distributed along every point on this 2-D plate:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png" width="1456" height="789" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:789,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:726223,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd115738-c63e-4190-890b-746375a6365c_2537x1374.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In the example above, we can see that for each positional coordinate (x, y) on our metal sheet, we have a simple mapping to a temperature.

This is essentially what the heat equation does!</span></p><p>The heat equation is provided below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png" width="725" height="487.4828296703297" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:979,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:725,&quot;bytes&quot;:359358,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa044a70-f3e0-4a60-a076-be2bc2827c16_2051x1379.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Once again: we note that instead of ascribing how our system evolves at each position (x, y) and at each point in time (t), we introduce a partial differential equation to model our system ‘heuristically.’ Instead of using a table which provides the mapping for each point in space-time (x, y, t), we simplify this by introducing a field equation which models the system in terms of </span><strong>how it changes</strong><span> from one moment to the next.

function (or field) changes, we call them partial derivatives and we thus end up with a partial differential equation for our scalar temperature field!</span></p><p>Note also: we simplified our example to ignore the temperature field values present in our y dimension! Here, we’re showing a simplification of what would happen if we isolated our system and metal strip from the rest of our sheet. We did this so that we could get a good visual intuition of how to model a very simple field. If we wanted to get a more accurate real world picture, we would need to model the real heat equation which describes our scalar field evolution in terms 4-dimensional space defined as T (x, y, z, t)! In regards to our 2-dimensional metal sheet example, we would only need to define it in terms of T (x, y, t) – but you get the point! We simplified our case to show the principle in action. A real field equation may not be so simple!</p><p>Not all fields are scalar. Let’s assume that we decide that we want to model a velocity field created by a fluid. We can’t model the motion of a fluid using single numerical values. Instead of outputting a scalar, we create a function which outputs a vector with a direction and magnitude!</p><p>That is, for each point coordinate point in 3-space (x, y, z), our function outputs the direction and magnitude of the fluid displacement at that point, and we thus get a simple vector field modeling the fluid flow:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png" width="543" height="410.0715935334873" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:981,&quot;width&quot;:1299,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:543,&quot;bytes&quot;:261631,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa1af5490-9220-4319-9b1c-55a19a128b59_1299x981.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>A vector field doesn’t have to represent fluid flow though!

It may have ‘sources’ or ‘sinks’ where more fluid flows out than what flows in, and vice versa. Using the example of electric charges, we can imagine our electric charge ‘points’ as being sources or sinks of an electromagnetic fluid, and the arrows representing how this field flows between them:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png" width="795" height="376" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:376,&quot;width&quot;:795,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:59861,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb10ec232-71a3-4071-97d0-a97d07fc222b_795x376.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>To get an accurate conception of the source and sink idea though, we need to get familiar with the concept of divergence, which we illustrate in the next section.</p><p>Specifying the divergence of the vector field at a point is equivalent to telling how much "denser" the fluid is getting near it. So, if we know that the arrows seem to be directed toward this point, the fluid particles tend to aggregate around it, and we say that the fluid converges there, or that it has negative divergence. Instead, if the arrows seem to be pointing away from the point, then the fluid is "thinning out", the fluid particles tend to escape from it and we say that the fluid diverges from there and has positive divergence. If the fluid seems to do neither, then we say that the divergence there is approximately zero or zero.</p><p>We can phrase this in simpler terms: let’s draw a small circle centered at the point whose divergence we want to measure. If there are more arrows going out of the circle, then we have a source point and a positive divergence. If there are more arrows pointing inwards and into the circle, then we have a sink point and a negative divergence.</p><p>In the below example, we can see one point which acts like a 'source' (fluid flows out) and thus we can see that it has a positive divergence:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

In the example below, we can see that the vectors at point x = 4.25 and y = 1.25 are ‘flowing out’ of our point, so we quantify the divergence as being positive (+0.65):</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png" width="876" height="406" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:406,&quot;width&quot;:876,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:182069,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82a08b1d-1c4f-4226-8017-3f646e6638b9_876x406.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>You can think of the divergence as being similar to a derivative function. The output of the function is just a single number which measures how much that point acts as a source or a sink. If it is a source, then we have a point with a positive divergence. If it’s a sink, the divergence is negative.</p><p>You can think of the curl of a vector field being similar to the divergence, except that instead of measuring whether the point is a source or a sink, the curl tells us how much the fluid is ‘rotating’ around it. To be exact: the curl measures the rotation of the field in the counterclockwise direction.</p><p>If you draw a small circle centered at a point, and the arrows around the circle are telling the ‘fluid’ or field to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, then the vector field has a positive curl. On the other hand, if the arrows point in a clockwise direction, then the curl is negative. If the fluid or field has no rotation along our circle or point, we have a curl which is either zero or close to zero.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

bottom. If we were to place an imaginary paddle wheel near it, the force generated would cause it to spin in the clockwise direction, so in the above instance, we say that the region has a negative curl.</p><p>Although it may seem that the curl function is scalar, the reality is that in 3-dimensional space, when we take the curl, we get an output vector which characterizes the rotation around that point according to a certain right hand rule. As we mentioned previously, a great analogy which we can use comes in terms of an imaginary paddle wheel. Imagine if we were to place this wheel at the point at which we want to measure the curl. If our field around this point causes the paddle wheel to turn in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, then we obviously get our curl term: the faster the paddle wheel twists or moves at the point, then the stronger the magnitude of the curl.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png" width="378" height="305.0787401574803" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:410,&quot;width&quot;:508,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:378,&quot;bytes&quot;:21715,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5caeb86a-82b0-4ba2-9116-bb3168e1b7b1_508x410.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In the above example, we can see a demonstration of an imaginary paddle wheel at a point which has a positive curl and is surrounded by a field which pushes our wheel in a counterclockwise direction.</p><p>Now, if we were to extend this from 2-dimensions into 3, our curl function would simply output a vector which would show us in which direction to place our wheel such that we can maximize the work done by our field. We won’t go into too many details in illustrating the 3-dimensional concept though. For now, we’re going to focus on our simplified 2-dimensional case, which associates numbers and scalars rather than vectors. This is sufficient for what we need in order to finally get a clear conception on what we came here to understand: the meaning of Maxwell’s equations!</p><p>As we already discussed, vector fields that represent fluid flow that have an immediate physical interpretation: the vector at every point in space represents a direction of motion of a fluid element, and we can construct snapshots of the motion of this fluid by drawing vector images over certain regions of space, just like we did in the previous section.</p><p>Now, for a more general vector field, such as the electromagnetic field discussed below, we do not have that immediate physical interpretation of a flow field. There is no “flow” or fluid that’s really present along the direction of those fields! However, even though the vectors in electromagnetism do not represent fluid flow, we carry over many of the terms we use to describe fluid flow. For example, we will speak of the flux of the electric field through a surface. If we were talking about fluid flow, “flux” would have a well-defined physical meaning, in that the flux would be the amount of fluid flowing across a given surface per unit time.</p><p><span>Noting this, let’s finally dive into the equations and try to interpret exactly what they mean.

our fluid flow. The idea is exactly the same, except that instead of using vectors and vector magnitudes spread through every point in space, we use flux lines flowing from a source to a destination.</p><p>Let’s show an example by drawing flux lines and showing how they relate to our earlier examples. Faraday called these field lines “lines of force” and believed that they had an existence of their own, describing them as stretching across a vacuum.</p><p>To draw a flux line, start out at any point in space and move your pen/pencil a very short distance in the direction of the local vector field. After that short distance, stop and find the new direction of the local vector field at that point. Now, begin moving again in that new direction (the direction of the arrow at the point that is). Continue this process indefinitely. By following this methodology, you can construct a line in space that is tangent to the local vector field. If we do this for different starting points, we can draw a set of field lines that give a great representation of the properties of the vector field, as illustrated below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png" width="391" height="403.14285714285717" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:483,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:391,&quot;bytes&quot;:48123,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d59678a-3d8b-4d1b-9da7-ff222ff8752f_483x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>So how do we use the flux lines to determine the strength of the field?

Let’s take an arbitrary area located at an arbitrary distance d from our center. We can see that when our radius r = 3d, the area which our flux lines pass through is 9 times larger than the area that it passes through when r = d. When r = 4d, our flux density expands into an area which is 16 times larger (r</span><sup>2</sup><span> = 4</span><sup>2</sup><span> = 16), so our field strength is reduced by a factor of 16! We should be able to easily see what the field strength diminishes by a factor of 1 / r</span><sup>2</sup><span> (inverse square) as we travel away from an arbitrary point of charge.</span></p><p><span>Why are we spending this much time discussing Gauss’s law in terms of flux? We already have a good intuition of what it states when it comes to divergence: electric fields produced by electric charges diverge from those positive charges and converge to the negative charges.

surrounding the field and passing through any closed surface is equal to the total charge contained within the surface. The total charge always equals to the number of point charge (or charges) which the surface envelops. We also notice the inverse square law in action once again: since our surface integral is always going to equal to the enclosed charge, as we travel away from our enveloping spherical shell, our charge / flux density will get weaker by a factor of 1 / r</span><sup>2</sup><span>. We can see that in the spherical example in the image above that the total charge passing through the surface area is going to equal to q</span><sub>enc</sub><span> / the electric permittivity of free space (ε</span><sub>0</sub><span>), which is equivalent to what we have in our equation in differential form.</span></p><p><span>But what is the electric permittivity of free space (ε</span><sub>0</sub><span>) though? We haven’t had a chance to discuss this term yet! To put things simply: the electric permittivity is a constant which allows us to describe how easily (or how difficult) it is for electric fields to pass through a medium (such as air, or water, or anything else for that matter). It’s called permittivity because of how much a given substance “permits” electric field lines to pass through them. So for certain substances, our electric field lines will pass through them easily, and for other ones, they won’t. This term encapsulates this permittivity. But what does this value for </span><strong>free space </strong><span>represent? The permittivity of free space has a special value and represents a the ability of a vacuum to let electric field lines to pass through. Its value is normally expressed as 1A</span><sup>2</sup><span>s</span><sup>4</sup><span>kg</span><sup>−1</sup><span>b</span><sup>−3</sup><span>.</span></p><p>Once again, we can say that our integral form is the same exact equivalent to our differential form. Whereas our differential form expresses the concept of having a charge modeled in terms of fluid flow and convergence and divergence (and that an electric field produces a charge which diverges from positive charges and converges towards negative charges), our integral form expresses the same idea, but in terms of capturing the field flow over an enclosed surface using integration. Here, we integrate the total surface area of a closed surface by summing small surface area elements (da) and adding them together to get the total charge / flux over that area, and we note that the total electric field encapsulated by this surface area will always equal to the total charges enclosed within that area.</p><p><span>And, that’s it! We’re now equipped and ready to tackle Gauss’s law for </span><strong>magnetic</strong><span> fields!</span></p><p>Gauss’s law for magnetic fields is very simple, and simply states that the divergence of a magnetic field is always 0:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

will always be zero! This is often interpreted as “there are no magnetic analogues to charges” (called magnetic monopoles). You may then ask: so how do we get magnetic fields? How do we get permanent magnets for example, and what is their ‘source’ if these fields never really have a ‘net’ divergence?</p><p><span>Well, in order to produce the magnetic field, we don’t need sources or sinks! We can produce one through variation, or the concept we touched upon earlier: the </span><strong>curl.</strong><span> We can model our magnetic field functions in space such that when we sum all of our enclosed surface areas, we always get 0, but the net curl or ‘rotation’ generated by the field results in an asymmetry in the distribution of the vectors and thus as having ‘circulating’ field lines of force which are capable of doing work. This ‘circular’ field throughout space is what produces magnets and the magnetic field, and we think of the magnetic field as being a by-product of a moving electric field or moving electric charges.</span></p><p>We can once again go back to our original question then and ask: so what are magnets? For the most part, in most materials, the electron ‘spins’ (a term we use to describe a set of properties, one of them being its magnetic field orientation) are oriented relatively evenly / randomly, which results in a net magnetic charge which is close to 0. On the other hand, in magnets, the electrons are oriented in such a way that a large majority are aligned in one ‘direction.’ Because of this asymmetry and alignment in the orientation, or as we mentioned earlier, the atomic spins within our material, we get a resulting net magnetic field and the equivalent of a circuit. This circuit in turn produces our magnetic field and results in a magnet!!</p><p>Let’s try to visualize the magnetic field, which is drawn and demoed below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png" width="787" height="309" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:309,&quot;width&quot;:787,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:111821,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F21470981-fd65-4704-8078-31d9e72b891a_787x309.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Gauss’s law for magnetic fields essentially states that the magnetic field has a divergence of 0, and that the total resultant ‘magnetic charge’ of any magnetic field will always equal to 0.

We can think of magnetic flux going through a surface as always being a two-way street: any outward flux going out of the surface will always be balanced by an inward flux going into it! The equal amounts of outward (positive) flux and inward (negative) flux will always cancel, and we’ll always end up with a net amount of magnetic flux which equals zero.</p><p><span>As a note, although we always use the example of having an enclosed spherical surface, the above principle applies to any closed surface which we may place within a field! It could be a cube, sphere, torus: any surface which magnetic flux lines penetrate will always be balanced and will always equate to zero!! The same principle and concept applies to electric fields, except that whichever enclosed surface we choose to use, we’ll always get a net electric flux which equates to the net amount of charge present </span><strong>within</strong><span> the surface!</span></p><p>Noting the above, we’re now ready to show the meaning of our last 2 equations, which describe the complementary nature of our two fields! The equations tell us that a time-varying magnetic field produces a spatially varying electric field, and vice versa.</p><p>Faraday’s law tells us that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png" width="547" height="351.59538274605103" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:823,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:547,&quot;bytes&quot;:48623,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37171b95-8e47-4a61-9cfa-28a7e9e193a1_823x529.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The above equation reads: "A circulating electric field is produced by a magnetic field</span><br><span>that changes with time.

We thus have a counter-balancing electric field which is generated any time we have a change in magnetic flux!</p><p>We must note once again that although the electric field induced through Faraday’s law has the same properties as our regular electric field, the resulting structure of this circulating field definitely differs from what we’re usually used to seeing when it comes to electric fields! We noted earlier that we could always think of the electric fields as originating from a source points (which we call positive charges) and as terminating at sink points (which we call negative charges). These charge-based fields always seem to have a source and sink (and thus, a non-zero divergence at those points)! In other words, in these instances, we could think of point charges as being the originators of the electric field. Now, with our new law, it seems that we have an induced field which doesn’t have an origin!</p><p>With Faraday’s law, we have induced electric fields which have field lines that loop back on themselves, with no points of origination or termination. Our induced field therefore has a divergence of zero! So, once again, we note that the resulting electric field is simply a circulating field which loops in around itself (thus, resulting in a net curl which opposes a magnetic field)! We can picture a simple 2-dimensional circulating electric field using the diagram below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png" width="363" height="304.2439024390244" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:378,&quot;width&quot;:451,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:363,&quot;bytes&quot;:91631,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd868742f-52f3-453f-b716-e70a7076750b_451x378.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We note that since these changing magnetic fields are capable of inducing electric fields with closed loops, they’re also capable of driving charged particles around continuous circuits.

The magnetic field, unlike the electric field, doesn’t have any ‘sources’ or ‘sinks,’ and there are no magnetic charges which can be used to produce them. All magnetic fields are therefore circulating fields: they always loop back upon themselves. We’ve already encountered circulating loops in our Faraday’s equation, which expressed a similar concept in relation to induced electric fields and which used a curl function to express this relationship. Here, we simply use the curl as an expression for the circulating magnetic field, and the equation states that this field is induced through one of </span><strong>two</strong><span> conditions:</span></p><p><span>1. </span><strong>An electric current</strong><span>: this is the first term expressed to the right of our equation, which we denoted as </span><strong>J</strong><span> and which denotes the electric current density</span><strong>.</strong></p><p>Prior to defining density though, we need to establish what an electric current is: an electric current is simply the rate of flow of electrical charge across some defined cross-sectional area. The “rate of flow” of charge represents the charge over time (charge/time). This calculation gives you the number of coulombs that go past a point in a second within an electrical circuit.</p><p>A lot of people like to associate currents with a flow of electrons present within a wire, but we must note that this view isn’t as simple as it seems: a current isn’t just a movement of charged particles, like electrons in a wire! "Electric charge" is not a "thing". It is a property of other things, like electrons and protons. In fact, we don’t need moving charges to produce an electrical current! We could have things which act like electric currents with no physical movement involved! We don’t have time to discuss the full extent of this. For now, we simply note that a current doesn’t necessarily equate to moving electrons!</p><p>Now, imagine that we have a current flowing into the page.

How is this possible? Well, we can actually model the magnetic field as being a product of relativity and relativistic effects produced from a changing electric field!</p><p>That’s right: with the proper choice of frames, a magnetic field can always be explained as a type of electrostatic attraction or repulsion made by relativistic effects of the electric field!</p><p>Let’s suppose that we have a current flowing through a wire. We place an electron next to the wire, and pretend that it’s moving in the same direction and velocity as the electrons within our wire. Using the right hand rule, we can find the direction of the wire’s magnetic field. That is, the rule will show us that the wire will attract our moving electron.</p><p>Let’s say that we were standing still and observing this.

We can picture the electromagnetic field as pointing directly away from the charge, with no effects of contractions taking place on our charge. On the other hand, if we take a look on the right, we imagine a moving particle. Here, our reference frame shows the particle moving to the right. The effect of this movement shows that its length is contracted in the direction of movement. The effect that this has on our moving field is such that the vertical component is stronger! Taking a look at our arrow (representing the electric field), we can easily see that this effect combines to make the field lines / arrows point directly away from the current location of our charge!</p><p>Let’s show another image which shows the relativistic transformation of our field as it moves to the right of our page:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png" width="217" height="311.3478260869565" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:363,&quot;width&quot;:253,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:217,&quot;bytes&quot;:11813,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb87f927b-7480-4a18-8c2f-782667a8235b_253x363.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Once again, we should be able to see that the vertical component of our field is compressed and thus stronger due to length contraction!</p><p>Let’s once again go back to our original example. From the electron’s reference frame, we can see that although we have no length contraction in terms of our negative charges, we do have length contraction in terms of our positive charges which are flowing to the left of our reference frame. Since this has an effect of compressing the length of our positive ions, the electrons within the wire can no longer fully cancel out the positive ion fields, leaving the wire with a net positive charge!

In Feynman’s own words:</p><blockquote><p><em>In Table 18–1 we have all that was known of fundamental classical physics, that is, the physics that was known by 1905. Here it all is, in one table. With these equations we can understand the complete realm of classical physics.</em></p><p><em>First we have the Maxwell equations—written in both the expanded form and the short mathematical form. Then there is the conservation of charge, which is even written in parentheses, because the moment we have the complete Maxwell equations, we can deduce from them the conservation of charge. So the table is even a little redundant. Next, we have written the force law, because having all the electric and magnetic fields doesn’t tell us anything until we know what they do to charges. Knowing E and B, however, we can find the force on an object with the charge q moving with velocity v. Finally, having the force doesn’t tell us anything until we know what happens when a force pushes on something; we need the law of motion, which is that the force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum. (Remember? We had that in Volume I.) We even include relativity effects by writing the momentum as:</em></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png" width="181" height="34" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:34,&quot;width&quot;:181,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2345,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F02b94ae4-9d61-47d0-a3a0-cd5fe430e381_181x34.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>If we really want to be complete, we should add one more law—Newton’s law of gravitation—so we put that at the end.</em></p><p><em>Therefore in one small table we have all the fundamental laws of classical physics—even with room to write them out in words and with some redundancy.

This is the tale of how I upgraded my Chumby 8 to run a modern Linux kernel.</p>



<p>I only had some minor things on my list to figure out before I could call my kernel upgrade good enough to be finished. The most important remaining thing was the real-time clock, or RTC. I noticed that whenever I rebooted the Chumby, it always started out with the date set to the Unix epoch in 1970:</p>



<pre># date<br>Thu Jan  1 00:00:12 UTC 1970</pre>



<p>I had observed earlier that the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/marvell/pxa168.dtsi?h=v6.8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">default pxa168.dtsi file in the kernel</a> had an RTC already added, but it was disabled:</p>



<pre>rtc: rtc@d4010000 {<br>	compatible = "mrvl,mmp-rtc";<br>	reg = &lt;0xd4010000 0x1000&gt;;<br>	interrupts = &lt;5&gt;, &lt;6&gt;;<br>	interrupt-names = "rtc 1Hz", "rtc alarm";<br>	clocks = &lt;&amp;soc_clocks PXA168_CLK_RTC&gt;;<br>	resets = &lt;&amp;soc_clocks PXA168_CLK_RTC&gt;;<br>	status = "disabled";<br>};</pre>



<p>Would it really be this simple? Did I just need to enable the RTC in my device tree file, make sure the kernel driver was enabled, and then be done with it? I had already experienced similar success with other PXA168 peripherals. So I tried it out.</p>



<pre>&amp;rtc {<br>	status = "okay";<br>};</pre>



<p>I also had to set CONFIG_RTC_DRV_SA1100=y. Why that driver? I don’t see SA1100 mentioned anywhere in the blurb above. Well, it’s because that’s the driver that <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c#n333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contains the device tree compatible string for mrvl,mmp-rtc</a>:</p>


<div><pre title="">#ifdef CONFIG_OF
static const struct of_device_id sa1100_rtc_dt_ids[] = {
        { .compatible = "mrvl,sa1100-rtc", },
        { .compatible = "mrvl,mmp-rtc", },
        {}
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, sa1100_rtc_dt_ids);
#endif
</pre></div>


<p>The <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/rtc/Kconfig#n1458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kconfig file mentions a few PXAxxx variants</a> in conjunction with this driver. It doesn’t specifically mention the PXA168, but it’s the exact same peripheral.</p>



<p>Anyway, with these changes made, I made sure a good battery was installed, and then powered my Chumby up using the new kernel. During the boot process, an RTC was detected which also seemed to have its date set to the Unix epoch, and it set the system clock:</p>



<pre>sa1100-rtc d4010000.rtc: registered as rtc0<br>sa1100-rtc d4010000.rtc: setting system clock to 1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC (0)</pre>



<p>This was fairly promising, right? I already had a good amount of experience dealing with RTCs in Linux, so I understood what would be involved in testing them. First of all, the message “setting system clock to…” above meant it was reading that 1970-01-01 date from the RTC. That’s because I had CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS=y. If you have your kernel configured that way, it’ll automatically attempt to set the system date and time from the RTC date and time at startup. Clearly the RTC didn’t have a good date written in it, which makes sense because I had just put in a good battery.</p>



<p>I wrote a random date into the RTC for testing. First I set the date on my RTC, and then I used hwclock to write it:</p>



<pre># date -s '2022-09-22'<br># hwclock -w</pre>



<p>Then I read back the RTC to see if all was good:</p>



<pre># hwclock<br>Thu Sep 22 00:00:41 2022  0.000000 seconds</pre>



<p>Hooray! The RTC driver definitely seemed to be working. It was writing a date into the RTC, and then after writing it, it was able to read it back out. It was even advancing properly — I had read back the date 41 seconds after writing it in.</p>



<p>“That was easy,” I confidently said to myself as I rebooted once more to see if the changes stuck. I brushed off my shoulders, proud of a job well done. I already knew it was going to work perfectly. Testing it was just going to be a formality. The following text popped up on the screen as the kernel came back up:</p>



<pre>sa1100-rtc d4010000.rtc: registered as rtc0<br>sa1100-rtc d4010000.rtc: setting system clock to 1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC (0)</pre>



<p>What the heck? I had successfully written to the RTC, but it was right back to thinking it was 1970. Not that I had any reason to doubt the console text I saw above, but using hwclock I confirmed that the date in the RTC had definitely reset:</p>



<pre># hwclock<br>Thu Jan  1 00:00:55 1970  0.000000 seconds</pre>



<p>I double- and triple-checked that the battery I had inserted was good. Basically the RTC was working fine when the system was powered, but even the act of rebooting was enough to make it forget the date. I would expect that an RTC should also remember the date/time when the system is powered off. Obviously that wasn’t going to work if a reboot didn’t even preserve the date. So much for testing just being a formality. That’s what I get for being overconfident! Back to the schematics I went.</p>



<p>When I looked at the schematics, I realized I should have started there. I should have followed my own advice that I had followed on other parts of this series like the audio support. I had made a terrible assumption. My assumption had been that the Chumby 8 actually used the PXA168’s internal RTC. That turned out to be very incorrect.</p>



<p>I can’t thank Chumby enough for making the <a href="https://files.chumby.com/hdwedocs/silvermoon_OEM_ref_v3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schematics for the Chumby 8</a> available to the public. It really saved my bacon on this project. I’m sure I could have figured out a lot of this stuff without it, but having the schematics readily available really saved me a lot of time.</p>



<p>It turns out that the coin cell battery on the Chumby 8 doesn’t go to the main processor at all. In fact, further reading about the PXA16x’s built-in RTC seems to reveal that it’s basically useless. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428154454/http://www.marvell.com/application-processors/armada-100/assets/armada_16x_software_manual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Armada 16x software manual</a> points out that in hibernate mode, it stops counting (page 220). If that’s the case, I would also expect it to stop counting when it’s powered off. I don’t see any pins labeled VRTC or VBAT in Marvell’s pinout, which I would expect to see for hooking up a battery. I did see a note in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927154817/http://www.marvell.com/application-processors/armada-100/assets/Armada-16x-HW-Manual-RevA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware manual</a>‘s version history (page 16) saying “Added note that the RTC has no external hardware connection” though. That’s a funny way of saying “the RTC built into this SoC is useless.”</p>



<p>What Chumby did instead was use the battery to power the STM32F101 “cryptoprocessor” that I’ve mentioned in the past:</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="285" height="254" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>This was the circuit I had expected to see going to the PXA168. But thinking about it further, it makes a ton of sense. This solution is so much more flexible than a conventional RTC. The STM32 always being on would have allowed Chumby to implement all kinds of other fun stuff like automatic scheduled powerups. I guess a lot of normal RTCs have alarms that can do stuff like that too, but it seems like you end up with ultimate flexibility by going this route. Either way, it appears Chumby had no choice anyway, since the PXA168’s RTC doesn’t have a battery power input. If I’m wrong about this, I’d love to be corrected!</p>



<p>I had slowly gained more familiarity with the Chumby’s boot process during this project, so I started looking into the original boot scripts to see if I could find something about setting the date. I knew that the original Chumby firmware would remember the date between power cycles, so I just had to figure out where it was handled. I didn’t see anything related to the RTC in the actual kernel source, so I suspected it was handled in userspace.</p>



<p>I went back to a backup of my original SD card containing Chumby’s stock firmware. There are two rootfs partitions and then a third partition which ends up being mounted as /mnt/storage. I looked through the boot scripts in /etc/init.d. rcS.background in particular contained a lot of interesting info, including this relevant chunk:</p>


<div><pre title=""># Attempt to restore time based on the crypto processor's uptime counter
echo "Attempting to restore time from CP"
message_start "Restore time from CP"
restore_time
echo "Date is $(date)"
message_end "$(date)"
</pre></div>


<p>This comment revealed some interesting info. It confirmed that the STM32 is responsible for remembering the date. It also told me that I would be looking for an uptime counter. So the STM32 wouldn’t be directly tracking the date and time; it would just be keeping track of how long it had been powered on. Remember that the battery keeps it powered even when the Chumby itself is off.</p>



<p>I found restore_time as a perl script in /usr/chumby/scripts. What it does is actually pretty simple. It reads the uptime (in seconds) from the cryptoprocessor using /usr/chumby/scripts/cpi.sh, and also reads a couple of local files: /psp/cp_offset and /psp/cp_time. cp_offset contains the time that the cryptoprocessor booted up as a Unix epoch. cp_time contains the uptime in seconds that the cryptoprocessor reported the last time we checked.</p>



<p>If the cryptoprocessor’s current uptime is less than the content of cp_time, then that means it has lost power since the last time we looked at it, and thus we don’t know what time it is. Otherwise, it adds cp_offset to the newly determined uptime, and that is the actual time it sets the system to using the “date” command.</p>



<p>cpi.sh is simply a wrapper that calls the /usr/bin/cpi utility and retries if it fails for whatever reason. It talks to the STM32 through a UART, using the same communication channel I discussed in <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2023/03/upgrading-my-chumby-8-kernel-part-4-reboot-poweroff/" data-type="post" data-id="2751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part 4</a> when I got poweroff and reboot working. The UART is totally free during normal operation so that a userspace utility like cpi can use it. The reboot and poweroff functions will take over control of the UART only when they are invoked.</p>



<p>I also found a perl script next to restore_time called save_time. It writes out the cp_offset and cp_time files. It’s called by /usr/chumby/scripts/sync_time.sh, which is a script that first syncs up with an NTP server to get the actual date and time, and then runs save_time so it’ll be ready if the Chumby is later powered off or rebooted. This sync_time.sh script is called in a few different places, including when the network comes up.</p>



<p>So that’s how the Chumby manages its “RTC” if you want to call it that. It’s basically just a software RTC emulated by keeping track of the uptime of the STM32. Here’s a block diagram of the setup.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="581" height="202" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png 581w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px"></figure>



<p>I actually like this solution a lot! It doesn’t require any special kernel logic. It’s entirely implemented in userspace. No special kernel drivers are involved whatsoever. This is a concept that I’ve come to appreciate as I’ve gained more Linux experience through the years. If you can solve a problem in userspace, why bother force-fitting it into the kernel? Chumby probably could have figured out a way to make the STM32 show up as an actual /dev/rtc0 device…but what would the advantage have been over the scripts they wrote? None. It would have been needless overcomplication. Overall, I think the userspace solution they settled on is excellent.</p>



<p>How could I make use of this with my modern setup? I knew I could easily make scripts just like the stock Chumby ones assuming I could somehow access the cryptoprocessor’s uptime counter. Luckily, I found that Chumby’s cpi utility that originally ran in Linux 2.6.28 using a much older glibc still worked fine in my newer environment. I even found the <a href="https://github.com/sutajiokousagi/cpi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sutajiokousagi/cpi/tree/master/export/arm-linux-silvermoon/bin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">binaries</a> for it on GitHub, so if the binary hadn’t worked for whatever reason, I likely could have rebuilt it instead. The GitHub cpi binary wasn’t exactly the same as the original cpi binary I had found on my Chumby’s SD card, but out of convenience I opted to use it. It worked just as well. I <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/buildroot/commit/3ad6c9352443754dcf88deb92af7085f7c6c07d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added it as a package in my custom buildroot</a>. Then <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/buildroot/commit/a51cd215fcd3272bd879ce9bae9151439e0a184e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wrote some scripts</a> for saving/restoring the date and time. They were very similar to what I found in my Chumby’s rootfs, but they were written as shell scripts instead of perl.</p>



<p>After I <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/buildroot/commit/6ce5a7e24d42c14f279332e5a6cf1ca5c8c9ef77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enabled NTP</a> to keep the time synced up using time servers on the internet, I <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/buildroot/commit/4e5e53e46547739512129974a85eaa977df14ba3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a simple daemon</a> that automatically restores the date and time at startup, saves it after NTP has successfully synced up, and then re-saves every 24 hours from that point on just to make sure everything is happy.</p>



<p>Originally I was saving these files directly to the rootfs but I eventually opted to <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/buildroot/commit/5bcb56c3e380db9d8afe7e592840d2d4dcd1c285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a separate settings partition on the SD card</a> to use for <a href="https://github.com/dougg3/buildroot/commit/bc2d45a5327fadba91e9901a3676ec912d7b6185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">storing settings like this</a> instead. I like to keep the rootfs read-only if I can.</p>



<p>With the solution I described above fully implemented, now when I boot, I can immediately log in and run the date command, and it looks perfect:</p>



<pre>Welcome to Buildroot<br>buildroot login: root<br># date<br>Sun Jun  2 16:35:01 UTC 2024</pre>



<p>Overall, the whole process of getting the “RTC” working properly went pretty well! When I originally discovered the PXA16x’s built-in peripheral wasn’t going to work, the first thing that popped into my head was “oh no, here we go again” but the solution still ended up being pretty simple. Kudos to the original Chumby developers for coming up with a nice solution for saving the date and time. I didn’t have to jump down into any crazy kernel rabbit holes this time.</p>



<p>This project is definitely starting to wind down now, but there’s still more to come. In the next post, I want to talk a little bit about the SD/CF/MS card reader that’s built into the Chumby and how I got it working as closely as possible to the original firmware’s approach.</p>

Like <a href="http://ho.ax/posts/2012/06/unbricking-a-macbook/">ho.ax</a>, I had been using a Dangerous Prototypes buspirate to read SPI flash boot ROMs, but it was too slow.  So I built a dedicated one with a <a href="https://trmm.net/Category:Teensy">Teensy 2 or 3</a> and a 8-SOIC chip-clip.  It can read/write the entire multi-megabit ROM in a minute. Sources are available from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hudson/spiflash/src">bitbucket.org/hudson/spiflash</a>.</p>
<h2 id="spotting-boot-roms">Spotting boot ROMs</h2>

Many SPI flash chips are 8-SOIC, like this 8 megabyte 25L6406E.  On x86 sytems they are also typically memory mapped at 0xFF800000, but it is also easy to read them with an external reader.</p>
<h2 id="pinout">Pinout</h2>

<p>These pins are large enough that it is easy to attach with a buspirate/logic-probe clips or using a dedicated chip clip that connects to all eight pins at once.  On the bottom of the Teensy 2 there is a pad footprint for a 3.3 volt regulator -- I've cut the trace and soldered one in, as <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/3volt.html">described here</a>. For the Teensy 3, which runs at native 3.3V, no hardware modifications are required.</p>
<p>Most laptops and some servers use 8-pin chips in either SOIC or DIP packages:</p>

<p>For the 16-pin chips typically found on server motherboards, the pinout is:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>      NC ---- 1 o     16 --- CLK
    Vcc (3v)- 2   W   15 --- DI
      NC ---- 3   I   14 --- NC
      NC ---- 4   N   13 --- NC
      NC ---- 5   B   12 --- NC
      NC ---- 6   O   11 --- NC
     /CS ---- 7   N   10 --- GND
      DO ---- 8   D    9 --- NC
</code></pre></div>
<p>Sometimes the SPI flash chip doesn't respond to the <code>i</code> command -- the result comes back as all 0xFF.  If I cycle power to the chip a few times it starts to respond.  I'm not sure what the root cause is of this, but to make it easier I've put a separate jumper on the power pin from the teensy to the SOIC chip.  This allows me to cycle the power until I get a good read of the chip ID.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/osr/19556871015/lightbox"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/265/19556871015_1e28211cff_b.jpg" srcset="https://live.staticflickr.com/265/19556871015_1e28211cff_b.jpg 1024w, https://live.staticflickr.com/265/19556871015_1e28211cff.jpg 400w"></a>
Some MacBooks have debug ports on them that connect to the SPI flash ROM (and maybe other interesting debug signals?).  I've probed the MacBookPro 10,1 and mapped the pinout for almost all of the SPI signals, with the exception of Power and !WP.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The reader should show up as a serial device on your computer.  It has a the following simple commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>i</code>: Read chip ID; if all 0xFF or 0x00, then something is wrong. The format of the ID result is described in the data sheet and JEDEC standard:
<img alt="" src="https://trmm.net/images/RDID_ID.png"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>r7f0000↵</code>: read 16 bytes from 0x7f0000 and hex dump them.</p>
</li>
<li><code>e7f0000↵</code>: erase a sector at address 7f0000. You shouldn't need to do this since the upload command will erase sectors as it crosses them.</li>
<li>
<p><code>u190000 1a0000↵</code>: Upload (and erase) 0x1a0000 bytes to 0x190000. Typically I will then shell out from minicom and run <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml">pv</a>; you could also use <code>cat</code> although it wouldn't give you any feedback on the transfer:</p>
<pre><code>pv new-rom.section.rom &gt; /dev/ttyACM0
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire ROM can be read using xmodem.  Shell out from minicom and run:</p>
<pre><code>rx &lt; /dev/ttyACM0 &gt; /dev/ttyACM0 rom.bin
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>Three years ago, Juan Manuel Corchado boasted of being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220928161336/https://corchado.net/2021/05/25/el-trabajo-en-equipo-sigue-dando-sus-frutos/" target="_blank">the fourth best scientist</a> in Spain and one of the 250 best on the planet in the field of computing, but he achieved this brilliant rise in the rankings <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-03-20/the-aspiring-university-rector-who-wrote-a-four-paragraph-paper-and-cited-himself-100-times.html">by cheating on an industrial scale.</a> The academic official, who has just been appointed rector of the University of <a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/10/26/inenglish/1540554903_326526.html">Salamanca</a> (the equivalent of university president in the U.S.), became one of the most cited scientists in the world because, among other fraudulent practices, he organized what is known as a citation cartel: a group of scientists colluding to cite one another in their papers. EL PAÍS has had access to internal messages from Corchado’s group that reveal their bad practices.</p><p>Their tricks are so crude that anyone who takes a look can easily spot them. In science, references included at the end of papers work like currency. The more other scientists cite you in their work, the greater your prestige, which leads to promotions, salary increases and even million-dollar projects. Corchado is quoted a lot, but only by a few close collaborators. On January 9, 2019, the mathematician Roberto Casado Vara <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99608-0_57" target="_blank">signed a paper</a> on computer security in electrical distribution networks, and 94% of the references (29 out of 31) were citations of Corchado’s work, even if it had nothing to do with the paper’s subject matter: the references included studies on the risk of bladder cancer, CO₂ in the ocean, oil spills, and red tides of microalgae.</p><p>For years, Corchado has been instructing his workers to include in each publication references to himself or to the journal that he edits: <a href="https://revistas.usal.es/cinco/index.php/2255-2863/" target="_blank"><i>Advances in Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence Journal</i></a> (<i>ADCAIJ</i>). In this way he falsified his own scientific impact and that of his journal in the rankings. On June 7, 2017, one of Corchado’s assistants wrote this message to her subordinates: “Collect everything you have (master’s thesis, final projects, dissertations, etc.) and include in them 20 references from among those that I have attached in the Word document as well as 10 articles from <i>ADCAIJ.</i>” The attached file included almost 50 Corchado publications. The aide later insisted: “As I know that we are all working hard now, to make it easier, I am attaching the references to just copy and paste.”</p><p>Similar messages were constant. On July 26, 2017, a different aide wrote to the group: “Hello everyone. Please, Juan Manuel tells me that we should reference these articles of his in the next papers that we send to magazines or conferences. I’ve attached the list here, don’t forget to add some.” Next, she attached a list of Corchado’s works, headed by one about oil spills.</p><p>On January 9, 2019, Roberto Casado Vara published <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99608-0_58" target="_blank">three papers</a> in which between <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99608-0_56" target="_blank">97% and 100%</a> of his references cited Corchado or <i>ADCAIJ</i>. Corchado, born in Salamanca 53 years ago, is one of the most cited scientists in the world according to Stanford University’s annual list. The most surprising thing is that Casado Vara, who is much younger, <a href="https://www.ubu.es/noticias/siete-profesores-de-la-ubu-en-el-ranking-de-la-universidad-de-stanford" target="_blank">also entered</a> that prestigious classification in 2022, just three years after defending his doctoral dissertation with Corchado as <a href="https://investigacion.ubu.es/documentos/5e4e724d2999524eaa950c54" target="_blank">his research supervisor</a>. This newspaper has asked both about these practices, without receiving a response.</p><p>The messages were often multitudinous. On February 1, 2018, the instructions from one of the assistants was: “Corchado has asked me to tell you to cite articles from <i>ADCAIJ</i> when you write your articles, whatever they are (conferences, master’s final projects, magazine articles, etc.). On March 12, 2018, one of the professor’s closest collaborators sent an email message to 40 people with instructions to manipulate publications from recent conferences organized by themselves: “We will tell you this week what acknowledgments, references and final authors you have to upload in the Camera_ready [print-ready] versions.” Corchado was in copy in all these messages. Dozens of the recipients, many of whom felt coerced, ended up leaving the group.</p><figure><span><img alt="The mathematician Roberto Casado Vara authored a publication on computer security in electrical distribution networks, in which 94% of the references (29 out of 31) are citations to works by Corchado, including some on cancer and ocean CO₂." decoding="auto" height="166" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/AKA575FUGBHGRKFHTJVDMFPNMA.jpg?auth=e59886b534228e1e01d012d23a26a5607f6d7d94caec635d33c7fe858777709f&amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/AKA575FUGBHGRKFHTJVDMFPNMA.jpg?auth=e59886b534228e1e01d012d23a26a5607f6d7d94caec635d33c7fe858777709f&amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/AKA575FUGBHGRKFHTJVDMFPNMA.jpg?auth=e59886b534228e1e01d012d23a26a5607f6d7d94caec635d33c7fe858777709f&amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/AKA575FUGBHGRKFHTJVDMFPNMA.jpg?auth=e59886b534228e1e01d012d23a26a5607f6d7d94caec635d33c7fe858777709f&amp;width=1960 1960w" width="414" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/AKA575FUGBHGRKFHTJVDMFPNMA.jpg?auth=e59886b534228e1e01d012d23a26a5607f6d7d94caec635d33c7fe858777709f&amp;width=414" loading="lazy"><svg viewBox="0 0 40 40"><use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"></use></svg></span><figcaption><span>The mathematician Roberto Casado Vara authored a publication on computer security in electrical distribution networks, in which 94% of the references (29 out of 31) are citations to works by Corchado, including some on cancer and ocean CO₂.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The professor used the conference records published by the Springer publishing house as a way to include strings of self-quotes. Informed by this newspaper, Springer Nature’s Research Integrity Director, <a href="https://group.springernature.com/la/group/media/press-releases/springer-nature-announces-chris-graf-research-integrity-director/19745290" target="_blank">Chris Graf</a>, stated that they are going to “very carefully” examine the case of the Salamanca professor. “If appropriate, we will take editorial action once this investigation has concluded,” Graf said. Another publisher, Elsevier, has already <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197618300563" target="_blank">retracted a study</a> published by Corchado and three collaborators in 2019 for plagiarizing a master’s thesis.</p><p>The researcher cheated in different ways to rig various rankings. He published documents full of self-citations in the scientific repository of the University of Salamanca, so that they would be indexed by the Google Scholar search engine, which in turn feeds rankings such as Guide2Research, in which Corchado was close <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220928161336/https://corchado.net/2021/05/25/el-trabajo-en-equipo-sigue-dando-sus-frutos/" target="_blank">to the top position</a> at the national level. “Occupying fourth place in Spain and 247th worldwide fills me with pride, as it represents the good work we are doing as a group,” <a href="https://x.com/corchadojm/status/1397120628818419717?t=Dc0nmN_9TlGCGNTAqMErTA&amp;s=08" target="_blank">he posted</a> on May 25, 2021 on his social media accounts. Corchado once published <a href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/428434752" target="_blank">a single paragraph </a>with 227 self-quotes and another 139 references to his magazine <i>ADCAIJ</i>.</p><p>After EL PAÍS began publishing news stories about his practices in March, the Spanish Research Ethics Committee <a href="https://elpais.com/ciencia/2024-05-17/el-ministerio-de-ciencia-pide-una-investigacion-sobre-el-nuevo-rector-de-la-universidad-de-salamanca.html" target="_blank">opened an investigation</a> into Corchado, as announced on Friday, May 17, by the Ministry of Science. That same day, Corchado used the official channel of the University of Salamanca to issue <a href="https://twitter.com/usal/status/1791564922008068564" target="_blank">an unsigned statement</a>, at 10:22 p.m., in which he defended his “honorability and scientific integrity” and encouraged people to assess the impact of his publications in two of the databases most widely used by the scientific community: Scopus, from the Dutch publisher Elsevier, and Web of Science, from the London multinational Clarivate.</p><p>An analysis of who cites Corchado in Scopus reveals that in only 75 publications, his collaborators mentioned the Salamanca professor almost 1,700 times and referenced his magazine <i>ADCAIJ</i> 520 times. One of these papers is signed by <a href="https://produccioncientifica.usal.es/investigadores/56986/detalle" target="_blank">Pedro Tomás Nevado-Batalla</a>, who teaches law at the University of Salamanca and is a former regional government official of the Spanish region of Extremadura, where he served under a Popular Party (PP) administration. In his study, which dealt with the need to modernize public administration, there were <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99608-0_61" target="_blank">42 citations to Corchado’s work</a> and seven to <i>ADCAIJ</i>, including studies on bladder cancer, oil spills and microalgae tides. Fully 92% of the citations in that paper are to Corchado’s work or else to his magazine. Nevado-Batalla has stated that he was unaware that these references had been added to his work, and said that he is going to request clarification. “There must necessarily be some explanation for something so extravagant as this,” he said.</p><figure><span><img alt="Juan Manuel Corchado" decoding="auto" height="276" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QCWVEKSDORHKRP4OOBVLOOD4PU.jpg?auth=34315188714fa32bc4a0c7d4a128b3c6b20a15328e316cf61168a40f2aec62e9&amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QCWVEKSDORHKRP4OOBVLOOD4PU.jpg?auth=34315188714fa32bc4a0c7d4a128b3c6b20a15328e316cf61168a40f2aec62e9&amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QCWVEKSDORHKRP4OOBVLOOD4PU.jpg?auth=34315188714fa32bc4a0c7d4a128b3c6b20a15328e316cf61168a40f2aec62e9&amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QCWVEKSDORHKRP4OOBVLOOD4PU.jpg?auth=34315188714fa32bc4a0c7d4a128b3c6b20a15328e316cf61168a40f2aec62e9&amp;width=1960 1960w" width="414" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QCWVEKSDORHKRP4OOBVLOOD4PU.jpg?auth=34315188714fa32bc4a0c7d4a128b3c6b20a15328e316cf61168a40f2aec62e9&amp;width=414" loading="lazy"><svg viewBox="0 0 40 40"><use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"></use></svg></span><figcaption><span>Juan Manuel Corchado, wearing glasses, standing next to Salamanca Mayor Carlos García Carbayo (right), at a public event in that city on May 23. </span><span>Raquel J. Santos / USAL</span></figcaption></figure><p>The mathematician <a href="https://www.uvigo.gal/es/universidad/administracion-personal/pdi/domingo-docampo-amoedo" target="_blank">Domingo Docampo</a>, former rector of the University of Vigo and an expert in <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-dark-world-of-citation-cartels" target="_blank">citation cartels</a>, expresses indignation. “It is petty and despicable. “They are insubstantial publications, without any real content, that constitute vehicles for citations in a network that clearly shows the pyramidal nature of a citation farm headed by someone who has influence over those who sign the papers,” he laments. “Corchado should never have run for a position of this category, to represent an institution as prestigious as the University of Salamanca,” he says about an institution that was founded in 1218.</p><p>The solemn inauguration ceremony of the new rector took place on Friday at the university auditorium. Corchado <a href="https://elpais.com/ciencia/2024-05-07/juan-manuel-corchado-gana-las-elecciones-a-rector-de-la-universidad-de-salamanca-con-la-mitad-del-profesorado-en-contra.html" target="_blank">won the elections</a> on May 7, after taking advantage of the strange surprise resignation of the previous rector, and presenting himself as the only candidate. He received the support of 6.5% of the 33,000 university members who were called to vote, with half of the faculty voting blank as a sign of protest. In 2018, the professor created the <a href="https://air-institute.com/" target="_blank">AIR Institute</a>, a private entity that manages projects worth <a href="http://noticias.aytosalamanca.es/noticias/es/hemeroteca/noticia_10496_1711159205064" target="_blank">millions of euros</a> awarded by the regional government of Castilla y León.</p><p>Docampo urges the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, academic authorities and individuals responsible for scientific journals to take action. “We have a serious problem. We must protect the careers of the youngest students, who can be contaminated. <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-11-25/the-list-of-the-worlds-most-cited-scientists-excludes-1000-researchers-over-fraudulent-practices.html">This is happening worldwide</a>,” he warns.</p><p>The epidemiologist <a href="https://www.usc.gal/saudep/personnel/alberto-ruano-ravina/" target="_blank">Alberto Ruano</a>, an expert in scientific misconduct, is adamant: “This is a textbook case of a citation cartel.” Ruano, a professor at the University of Santiago de Compostela, also urges Corchado to resign. “It is likely that he will have to resign, because he is damaging the institution he represents, a damage that affects the credibility of the University of Salamanca and is also affecting all Spanish university professors,” says the epidemiologist, who urges the Ministry and the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE) to take measures to avoid cases like this one.</p><blockquote><p>This is a textbook case of a citation cartel</p><cite>Alberto Ruano, professor at University of Santiago de Compostela</cite></blockquote><p>In addition to adding thousands of self-citations to his own publications and requiring his workers to also cite him, Corchado has benefited from a multitude of false online accounts of non-existent scientists, such as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324477069_Designing_complex_environments_with_artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">Devika Rout</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324210396_Modeling_the_ocean_with_intelligence_real_time_systems_with_a_Case-Based_Reasoning_system" target="_blank">Marcus Ress</a>, dedicated to compulsively mentioning Corchado’s studies in the ResearchGate repository. Since March, Corchado has carried out a massive deletion of these fraudulent profiles, and he has also deleted the publications with obvious tricks that he had uploaded to the Gredos scientific repository of the University of Salamanca.</p><p>Since April 23, Corchado has denied multiple requests from EL PAÍS to explain his practices, but on March 13 he did grant an interview to this newspaper. In that telephone conversation, the professor from Salamanca stated that there were “20 or 30” false online accounts dedicated to citing him and, in just two minutes, he <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-04-26/the-seven-lies-of-the-ai-expert-who-cited-himself-thousands-of-times-on-scientific-papers.html">offered two contradictory explanations</a>: that they had been created by former disgruntled workers to harm him, and that “a young man” had created them to demonstrate that ResearchGate could be rigged. Next, Corchado assured that he had deleted those profiles thanks to his knowledge in cybersecurity. A ResearchGate spokesperson, however, explained that they are not aware of any computer attack and that only the creator of a profile can delete it with their password.</p><p>One of the international leaders in scientific evaluation methods, <a href="https://www.cwts.nl/people/ismael-rafols" target="_blank">Ismael Ràfols</a>, points to the system. “This corruption occurs because there is an evaluation system that values publishing a lot and being cited often. In Europe we have started a reform process and Spain still has a lot of work ahead of it,” says Ràfols, from the University of Leiden (Netherlands).</p><p>The watchdog agency of the Spanish university system is the National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation (ANECA), directed for a year now by a new director, <a href="https://elpais.com/educacion/universidad/2023-02-28/una-catedratica-de-geografia-humana-nueva-directora-de-la-agencia-de-evaluacion-de-las-universidades-aneca.html" target="_blank">Pilar Paneque</a>, who is promoting changes to stop measuring researchers based on production volume. “ANECA is going in the right direction, but it faces resistance from traditional professors who have reached the top, like this man. The Corchado case is like a parody, and it shows that it is necessary to reform the evaluation system that generates the corruption,” says Ràfols.</p><p>Pilar Paneque herself believes that her reforms will discourage bad practices and reduce pressure on researchers, especially the younger ones. “We have a lot of progress to make towards scientific integrity and ethics in research, and everything has to start with the commitment and control of each institution. Every university knows perfectly well what each of its researchers produces and can easily detect any type of anomalous behavior,” says Paneque. In the case of Corchado, Friday was his coronation as rector of the University of Salamanca.</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i><u>our weekly newsletter</u></i></a> <i>to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Lord Kelvin and His Analog Computer"><p>
	In 1870, <a href="https://ethw.org/William_Thomson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>William Thomson</u></a>, mourning the death of his wife and flush with cash from various patents related to the laying of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-first-transatlantic-telegraph-cable-was-a-bold-beautiful-failure" target="_self"><u>first transatlantic telegraph cable</u></a>, decided to buy a yacht. His schooner, the <em><em>Lalla Rookh, </em></em>became Thomson’s summer home and his base for hosting scientific parties. It also gave him firsthand experience with the challenge of accurately predicting tides.
</p><p>
	Mariners have always been mindful of the tides lest they find themselves beached on low-lying shoals. Naval admirals guarded tide charts as <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/podcast/june20/nop36-dday-tides.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>top-secret information</u></a>. Civilizations recognized a relationship between the tides and the moon early on, but it wasn’t until 1687 that <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_tides/tides02_cause.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Isaac Newton explained</u></a> how the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon caused them. Nine decades later, the French astronomer and mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pierre-Simon Laplace</u></a> suggested that the tides could be represented as harmonic oscillations. And a century after that, Thomson used that concept to design the first machine for predicting them.
</p><h2>Lord Kelvin’s Rising Tide</h2><p>
	William Thomson was born on <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/explore/lordkelvin200/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>26 June 1824</u></a>, which means this month marks his 200th birthday and a perfect time to reflect on his all-around genius. Thomson was a mathematician, physicist, engineer, and professor of natural philosophy. Queen Victoria knighted him in 1866 for his work on the transatlantic cable, then elevated him to the rank of baron in 1892 for his contributions to thermodynamics, and so he is often remembered as Lord Kelvin. He determined the correct value of absolute zero, for which he is honored by the SI unit of temperature—<a href="https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kelvin-history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the kelvin</u></a>. He dabbled in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5347" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>atmospheric electricity</u></a>, was a proponent of the <a href="https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~lomonaco/kelvin/kelvin23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vortex theory of the atom</u></a>, and in the absence of any knowledge of radioactivity made a rather poor estimation of the age of the Earth, which he gave as somewhere between <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/kelvin-perry-and-the-age-of-the-earth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>24 million and 400 million years</u></a>.

He believed in the practical application of scientific knowledge and invented a wide array of useful, and beautiful, devices. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Pictorial Press/Alamy</small></p><p>
	Thomson’s <a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co53901/william-thomsons-tide-predicting-machine-1872-tide-predictor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tide-predicting machine</u></a> calculated the tide pattern for a given location based on 10 cyclic constituents associated with the periodic motions of the Earth, sun, and moon. (There are actually hundreds of periodic motions associated with these objects, but <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/about_harmonic_constituents.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modern tidal analysis</u></a> uses only the 37 of them that have the most significant effects.) The most notable one is the lunar semidiurnal, observable in areas that have two high tides and two low tides each day, due to the effects of the moon. The period of a lunar semidiurnal is 12 hours and 25 minutes—half of a lunar day, which lasts 24 hours and 50 minutes.
</p><p>
	As Laplace had suggested in 1775, each tidal constituent can be represented as a repeating cosine curve, but those curves are specific to a location and can be calculated only through the collection of tidal data. Luckily for Thomson, many ports had been logging tides for decades. For places that did not have complete logs, Thomson designed both an improved tide gauge and a tidal harmonic analyzer.
</p><p>
	On Thomson’s tide-predicting machine, each of 10 components was associated with a specific tidal constituent and had its own gearing to set the amplitude. The components were geared together so that their periods were proportional to the periods of the tidal constituents. A single crank turned all of the gears simultaneously, having the effect of summing each of the cosine curves. As the user turned the crank, an ink pen traced the resulting complex curve on a moving roll of paper. The device marked each hour with a small horizontal mark, making a deeper notch each day at noon. Turning the wheel rapidly allowed the user to run a year’s worth of tide readings in about 4 hours.
</p><p>
	Although Thomson is credited with designing the machine, in his paper “The Tide Gauge, Tidal Harmonic Analyser, and Tide Predicter” (published in <em><em>Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers</em></em>), he acknowledges a number of people who helped him solve specific problems. Craftsman Alexander Légé drew up the plan for the screw gearing for the motions of the shafts and constructed the initial prototype machine and subsequent models. Edward Roberts of the Nautical Almanac Office completed the arithmetic to express the ratio of shaft speeds. Thomson’s older brother, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/046129a0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>James</u></a>, a professor of civil engineering at Queen’s College Belfast, designed the disk-globe-and-cylinder integrator that was used for the tidal harmonic analyzer. Thomson’s generous acknowledgments are a reminder that the work of engineers is almost always a team effort.

Fischer [right], relied on 37 constituents. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey/NOAA</small></p><p>
	As with many inventions, the tide predictor was simultaneously and independently developed elsewhere and continued to be improved by others, as did the science of tide prediction. In 1874 in the United States, William Ferrel, a mathematician with the Coast and Geodetic Survey, developed a similar harmonic analysis and prediction <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/predma1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>device </u></a>that used 19 harmonic constituents. <a href="https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/george-howard-darwin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>George Darwin</u></a>, second son of the famous naturalist, modified and improved the harmonic analysis and published several <a href="https://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/pdf/1907_OceanicTides_Vol.1_A1069.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>articles on tides</u></a> throughout the 1880s. Oceanographer Rollin A. Harris wrote several editions of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924004941773/page/n3/mode/2up?view=theater" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Manual of Tides</em></em></u></a><em></em>for the Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1897 to 1907, and in 1910 he developed, with E.G. Fischer, a <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/predma2.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tide-predicting machine</u></a> that used 37 constituents. In the 1920s, <a href="https://ntslf.org/about-tides/doodson-machine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Arthur Doodson</u></a> of the Tidal Institute of the University of Liverpool, in England, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/manualofharmonic00schu/page/n1/mode/2up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Paul Schureman</u></a> of the Coast and Geodetic Survey further refined techniques for harmonic analysis and prediction that served for decades. Because of the complexity of the math involved, many of these old brass machines remained in use into the 1950s, when electronic computers finally took over the work of predicting tides.
</p><h2>What Else Did Lord Kelvin Invent?</h2><p>
	As regular readers of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/collections/past-forward/" target="_self"><u>this column</u></a> know, I always feature a museum object from the history of computer or electrical engineering and then spin out a story. When I started scouring museum collections for a suitable artifact for Thomson, I was almost paralyzed by the plethora of choices.
</p><p>
	I considered Thomson’s <a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co32916/thomson-lord-kelvin-double-curb-transmitter-1858-telegraph-peripheral" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>double-curb transmitter</u></a>, which was designed for use with the 1858 transatlantic cable to speed up telegraph signals. Thomson had sailed on the HMS <em><em>Agamemnon </em></em>in 1857 on its failed mission to lay a transatlantic cable and was instrumental to the team that finally succeeded.
</p><p><img id="478fa" data-rm-shortcode-id="4e23ceb07823cf2d8d560e8856c126a0" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-rectangular-scientific-instrument-made-of-wood-and-brass.jpg?id=52358110&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-of-a-rectangular-scientific-instrument-made-of-wood-and-brass.jpg?id=52358110&amp;width=980" width="2000" height="1250" alt="Photo of a rectangular scientific instrument made of wood and brass. "><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Thomson invented the double-curb transmitter to speed up signals in transatlantic cables.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Science Museum Group</small></p><p>
	I also thought about featuring one of his <a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co54083/kelvin-quadrant-electrometer-1866-electrometer-electrical-measuring-instrument" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quadrant electrometers</u></a>, which measured electrical charge. Indeed, Thomson introduced a number of instruments for measuring electricity, and a good part of his legacy is his work on the precise specifications of electrical units.
</p><p>
	But I chose to highlight Thomson’s tide-predicting machine for a number of reasons: Thomson had a lifelong love of seafaring and made many contributions to marine technology that are sometimes overshadowed by his other work. And the tide-predicting machine is an example of an early analog computer that was much more useful than <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/charles-babbage-difference-engine" target="_self"><u>Babbage’s difference engine</u></a> but not nearly as well known. Also, it is simply a beautiful machine. In fact, Thomson seems to have had a knack for designing stunningly gorgeous devices. (The tide-predicting machine at top and <a href="https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/search?q=william%20thomson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many other Kelvin inventions</u></a> are in the collection of the <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Science Museum</u></a>, in London.)

	The tide-predicting machine was not Thomson’s only contribution to maritime technology. He also patented a <a href="https://www.nms.ac.uk/explore-our-collections/collection-search-results/compass-card/221850" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compass</u></a>, an astronomical clock, a sounding machine, and a <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-7116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>binnacle</u></a> (a pedestal that houses nautical instruments). With respect to maritime science, Thomson thought and wrote much about the nature of waves. He mathematically explained the v-shaped wake patterns that ships and waterfowl make as they move across a body of water, which is aptly named the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_wake_pattern" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kelvin wake pattern</u></a>. He also described what is now known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_wave" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kelvin wave</u></a>, a type of wave that retains its shape as it moves along the shore due to the balancing of the Earth’s spin against a topographic boundary, such as a coastline.
</p><p>
	Considering how much Thomson contributed to all things seafaring, it is amazing that these are some of his <em><em>lesser</em></em> known achievements. I guess if you have an insatiable curiosity, a robust grasp of mathematics and physics, and a strong desire to tinker with machinery and apply your scientific knowledge to solving practical problems that benefit humankind, you too have the means to come to great conclusions about the natural world. It can’t hurt to have a nice yacht to spend your summers on.

<p>Over the past two years, the United States Government has been issuing warnings about memory-unsafe programming languages with increasing urgency. Much of the country's critical infrastructure relies on software written in C and C++, languages which are very memory <em>unsafe</em>, leaving these systems more vulnerable to exploits by adversaries.</p>

</ul>
<p>Security professionals loudly advocate that projects migrate away from C++ and start using memory safe languages. But the scale of the problem is daunting. C++ powers products that have generated trillions of dollars of value. There are a lot of C++ programmers and a lot of C++ code. Given how wide-spread C and C++ code is, what can industry really do to improve software quality and reduce vulnerabilities? What are the options for introducing new memory safe code into existing projects and hardening software that already exists?</p>
<p>There's only one systems-level/non-garbage collected language that provides rigorous memory safety. That's the Rust language.<sup id="fnref:rust-language"><a href="#fn:rust-language">8</a></sup> But while they play in the same space, C++ and Rust are idiomatically very different with limited interop capability, making incremental migration from C++ to Rust a slow, painstaking process.</p>
<p>Rust lacks function overloading, templates and inheritance. C++ lacks traits, relocation and lifetime parameters. These discrepancies are responsible for an impedence mismatch when interfacing the two languages. Most code generators for inter-language bindings do not even attempt to represent the features of one language in terms of the features of another. They typically identify a number of special vocabulary types,<sup id="fnref:vocabulary-types"><a href="#fn:vocabulary-types">9</a></sup> which have first-class ergonomics, and limit functionality of other constructs.</p>
<p>The foreignness of Rust for career C++ developers along with the inadequacies of interop tools makes hardening C++ applications by rewriting critical sections in Rust very difficult. Why is there no in-language solution to memory safety? <em>Why not a Safe C++?</em></p>
<h2 id="extend-c-for-safety">Extend C++ for safety</h2>
<p>My aim is to produce a superset of C++ that has a rigorously safe subset. Start a new project, or take an existing one, and write safe code in C++. Code written in the safety context exhibits the same strong safety guarantees as safe code programmed in Rust. Indeed, lifetime safety is enforced statically with borrow checking, the signature safety technology first introduced in Rust.<sup id="fnref:borrow-checking"><a href="#fn:borrow-checking">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The argument for Rust: it's a clean new language designed from the ground up for safety.</p>
<p>The argument for Safe C++: it provides the same rigorous safety guarantees as Rust, but since it extends C++, it has unbeatable interoperability with your existing code.</p>
<p>The goal is to write robust, sound software. Rust is a proven tool to achieve that. Safe C++ could be another viable tool. What's not viable is to continue adding unsafe, vulnerability-ridden code.</p>
<p>What properties characterize Safe C++?</p>
<ul>
<li>A superset of C++ with a <em>safe subset</em>. Undefined behavior is prohibited from originating in the safe subset.</li>
<li>The safe and unsafe parts of the language are clearly delineated, and users must explicitly leave the safe context to use unsafe operations.</li>
<li>The safe subset must remain <em>useful</em>. If we get rid of a crucial unsafe technology, like unions or pointers, we should supply a safe alternative, like choice types or borrows. A perfectly safe language is not useful if it's so inexpressive you can't get your work done.</li>
<li>The new system can't break existing code. If you point a Safe C++ compiler at existing C++ code, that code must compile normally. Users opt into the new safety mechanisms. Safe C++ is an extension of C++. It's not a new language.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#feature on safety
#include "std2.h"

int main() safe {
  std2::vector&lt;int&gt; vec { 11, 15, 20 };

  for(int x : vec) {
    // Ill-formed. mutate of vec invalidates iterator in ranged-for.
    if(x % 2)
      vec^.push_back(x);

    unsafe printf("%d\n", x);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ circle iter3.cxx 
safety: iter3.cxx:10:10
      vec^.push_back(x); 
         ^
mutable borrow of vec between its shared borrow and its use
loan created at iter3.cxx:7:15
  for(int x : vec) { 
              ^
</code></pre>
<p>Consider this demonstration of Safe C++ that catches iterator invalidation, which would lead to a use-after-free bug. Let's break it down line by line:</p>
<p>Line 1: <code>#feature on safety</code> - Turn on the new safety-related keywords within this file. Other files in your translation unit are unaffected. This is how Safe C++ avoids breaking existing code--everything is opt-in, including the new keywords and syntax. The safety feature changes the object model for function definitions, enabling object relocation, partial and deferred initialization. It lowers function definitions to mid-level intermediate representation (MIR)<sup id="fnref:mir"><a href="#fn:mir">11</a></sup>, on which borrow checking is performed to flag potential use-after-free bugs on checked references.</p>
<p>Line 2: <code>#include "std2.h"</code> - Include the new safe containers and algorithms. Safety hardening is about reducing your exposure to unsafe APIs. The current Standard Library is full of unsafe APIs. The new Standard Library in namespace <code>std2</code> will provide the same basic functionality, but with containers that are lifetime-aware and type safe.</p>
<p>Line 4: <code>int main() safe</code> - The new <em>safe-specifier</em> is part of a function's type, just like <em>noexcept-specifier</em>. To callers, the function is marked as safe, so that it can be called from a safe context. <code>main</code>'s definition starts in a safe context, so unsafe operations like pointer dereferences, and calling unsafe functions, is not allowed. Rust's functions are safe by default. C++'s are unsafe by default. But that's now just a syntax difference. Once you enter a safe context in C++ by using the <em>safe-specifier</em>, you're backed by the same rigorous safety guarantees that Rust provides.</p>
<p>Line 5: <code>std2::vector&lt;int&gt; vec { 11, 15, 20 };</code> - List initialization of a memory-safe vector. This vector is aware of lifetime parameters, so borrow checking would extend to element types that have lifetimes. The vector's constructor doesn't use <code>std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;</code><sup id="fnref:init-list"><a href="#fn:init-list">12</a></sup>. That type is problematic for two reasons: first, users are given pointers into the argument data, and reading from pointers is unsafe; second, the <code>std::initializer_list</code> <em>doesn't own</em> its data, making relocation impossible. For these reasons, Safe C++ introduces a <code>std2::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</code>, which can be used in a safe context and supports our ownership object model.</p>
<p>Line 7: <code>for(int x : vec)</code> - Ranged-for on the vector. The standard mechanism<sup id="fnref:ranged-for"><a href="#fn:ranged-for">13</a></sup> returns a pair of iterators, which are pointers wrapped in classes. C++ iterators are unsafe. They come in begin and end pairs, and don't share common lifetime parameters, making borrow checking them impractical. The Safe C++ version uses slice iterators, which resemble Rust's <code>Iterator</code>.<sup id="fnref:rust-iterator"><a href="#fn:rust-iterator">14</a></sup> These safe types use lifetime parameters making them robust against iterator invalidation.</p>
<p>Line 10: <code>vec^.push_back(x);</code> - Push a value onto the vector. What's the <code>^</code> doing there? That's a <em>postfix-object-operator</em> which indicates a mutable borrow on the object argument of the member function call. When <code>#feature on safety</code> is enabled, <em>all mutations are explicit</em>. Explicit mutation lends precision when choosing between shared borrows and mutable borrows of an object. Rust doesn't feature function overloading, so it will implicitly borrow (mutably or shared) from the member function's object. C++ of course has function overloading, so we'll need to be explicit in order to get the overload we want.</p>
<p>Line 12: <code>unsafe printf("%d\n", x);</code> - Call <code>printf</code>. It's a very unsafe function. Since we're in a safe context, we have to escape with the <code>unsafe</code> keyword. Safe C++ doesn't lock off any parts of the C++ language. You're free to shoot yourself in the foot, provided you sign the waiver in the form of the <code>unsafe</code> keyword. <code>unsafe</code> means that you swear to follow the preconditions of the function, rather than relying on the compiler to ensure those preconditions for you.</p>
<p>If <code>main</code> checks out syntatically, its AST is lowered to MIR, where it is borrow checked. The hidden iterator that powers the ranged-for loop stays initialized during execution of the loop. The <code>push_back</code> <em>invalidates</em> that iterator, by mutating a place (the vector) that the iterator has a constraint on. When the value <code>x</code> is next loaded out of the iterator, the borrow checker raises an error: <code>mutable borrow of vec between its shared borrow and its use</code>. The borrow checker prevents Circle compiling a program that may have exhibited undefined behavior. This is all done at compile time, with no impact on your program's size or speed.</p>
<p>This sample is only a few lines, but I've introduced many new mechanisms and types. Security experts keep reminding us, and it is true, that <strong>C++ is very unsafe</strong>. It takes a systematic effort to supply a superset of the language with a safe subset that has enough flexibility to remain expressive.</p>
<h2 id="the-memory-safety-value-proposition">The memory safety value proposition</h2>
<p>Memory-safe languages are predicated on a basic observation of human nature: people would rather try something, and only then ask for help if it doesn't work. For programming, this means developers try to use a library, and only then read the docs if they can't get it to work. This has proven very dangerous, since appearing to work is not the same as working.</p>
<p>Many C++ functions have preconditions that are only known after careful of their perusal of their documentation. Preconditions can be anything; users don't come with expectations as to what safe usage should look like. Violating preconditions, which is possible with benign-looking usage, causes undefined behavior and opens your software to attack. <strong>Software safety and security should not be predicated on programmers following documentation.</strong> </p>
<p>Here's the value proposition: compiler and library vendors make an extra effort to provide a robust environment so that users <em>don't have to read the docs</em>. No matter how they use the language and library, their actions will not raise undefined behavior and open the software to safety-related exploits. No system can guard against all misuse, and hastily written code may have plenty of logic bugs. But those logic bugs won't lead to memory safety vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Last week I found that my compiler would occassional segfault on some input. I tracked the issue down to a usage of <code>std::isprint</code>.<sup id="fnref:isprint"><a href="#fn:isprint">15</a></sup> This function has an <code>int</code> parameter. I was calling it with UNICODE code points. I didn't consider that I might be violating the preconditions, which require that the function be called only with an argument between -1 and 255:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like all other functions from <code>&lt;cctype&gt;</code>, the behavior of <code>std::isprint</code> is undefined if the argument's value is neither representable as unsigned char nor equal to EOF. To use these functions safely with plain chars (or signed chars), the argument should first be converted to unsigned char.
Similarly, they should not be directly used with standard algorithms when the iterator's value type is char or signed char. Instead, convert the value to unsigned char first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very stupid. While the mistake was mine, the library's design goes against human nature. Do not rely on the programmer to closely read the docs before using your function. The safe context provided by memory safe languages prevents usage or authoring of functions like <code>std::isprint</code> which exhibit undefined behavior. </p>
<p>Some memory safety issues, like the one described above, are easy to fix. Others can't be fixed in a language as unsafe as ISO C++. It's not enough to read documentation, follow C++ Core Guidelines<sup id="fnref:core-guidelines"><a href="#fn:core-guidelines">16</a></sup> or write unit tests. To address lifetime and thread safety issues, new language technologies like borrow checking and fearless concurrency<sup id="fnref:fearless-concurrency"><a href="#fn:fearless-concurrency">17</a></sup> are essential. These are non-local problems and require system-wide solutions.</p>
<h2 id="categories-of-safety">Categories of safety</h2>
<p>I like to break the memory safety problem down into five categories. Each of these is addressed with a different strategy.</p>
<h3 id="1-lifetime-safety">1. <a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/site/lifetime/">Lifetime safety</a></h3>
<p>This is a hard one. How do we eliminate dangling pointer bugs<sup id="fnref:dangling-pointer"><a href="#fn:dangling-pointer">18</a></sup> for objects that are allocated on the stack? Borrow checker technology is a compile-time local analysis that defines a network of constraints against a function's control flow graph. Solving the constraints grows regions, which define the points at which each loan is in scope. Invalidating actions, such as reads or writes to places that overlap in-scope loans raise borrow checker errors. This is a brilliant system. It's compatible with C++'s manual memory management and RAII<sup id="fnref:raii"><a href="#fn:raii">19</a></sup> object model.</p>
<p>Borrow checking a function only has to consider the body of that function. It avoids whole-program analysis by instituting the <em>Law of Exclusivity</em>. Checked references (borrows) come in two flavors: mutable and shared, noted respectively as <code>T^</code> and <code>const T^</code>. There can be one live mutable reference to a place, or any number of shared references to a place, but not both at once. Upholding this principle makes it much easier to reason about your program. If a function is passed a mutable reference and some shared references, you can be certain that the function won't have side effects that, through the mutable reference, cause the invalidation of those shared references. Why not? Because you can't form shared references to an overlapping same place as the mutable reference to even pass to that function.</p>
<p>This principle eliminates much subtlety needed for library work. The downside is a loss of flexibility. There are idioms that are expressible with unsafe that aren't expressible with borrows. Clever engineers have spent a lot of effort developing safe analogs to existing unsafe paradigms.</p>
<p>Is there a learning curve? Is there disruption? Of course. But what alternative do we have? C++'s current safety story is unacceptable. If you're going to keep writing code that runs on devices attached to the network, you're going to have to harden it against vulnerabilities. If you want to use manual memory management and RAII, the borrow is the only viable option.</p>
<h3 id="2-type-safety-null-variety">2. <a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/site/type/">Type safety - null variety</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.</p>
<p>-- <cite>Tony Hoare<sup id="fnref:hoare"><a href="#fn:hoare">20</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "billion-dollar mistake" is a type safety problem. Consider <code>std::unique_ptr</code>. It has two states: engaged and disengaged. The class presents member functions like <code>operator*</code> and <code>operator-&gt;</code> that are valid when the object is in the engaged state and <em>undefined</em> when the object is disengaged. <code>-&gt;</code> is the most important API for smart pointers. Calling it when the pointer is null? That's your billion-dollar mistake.</p>
<p>As Hoare observes, the problem was conflating two different things, a pointer to an object and an empty state, into the same type and giving them the same interface. Smart pointers should only hold valid pointers. If you want to represent an empty state, use some other mechanism that has its own interface. Denying the null state eliminates undefined behavior.</p>
<p><code>std2::unique_ptr</code> has no null state. There's no default constructor. If the object is in scope, you can dereference it without risk of undefined behavior. Why doesn't C++ simply introduce its own fixed <code>unique_ptr</code> without a null state? Blame C++11 move semantics.</p>
<p>How do you move objects around in C++? Use <code>std::move</code> to select the move constructor. That moves data out of the old object, leaving it in a default state. For smart pointers, that's the null state. If <code>unique_ptr</code> didn't have a null state, it couldn't be moved in C++.</p>
<p>Addressing the null type safety problem means entails overhauling the object model. Safe C++ features a new kind of move: <em>relocation</em>, also called <em>destructive move</em>. Unless explicitly initialized, objects start out <em>uninitialized</em>. They can't be used in this state. When you assign to an object, it becomes initialized. When you relocate from an object, it's back to being uninitialized. If you relocate from an object inside control flow, it becomes <em>potentially uninitialized</em>, and its destructor is conditionally executed after reading an automatically-generated drop flag.</p>
<pre><code>int main() {
  // p is uninitialized.
  std2::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt; p;

  // Error: p is uninitialized.
  int x = *p;

  // p is definitely initialized.
  p = std2::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;::make(5);

  // Ok.
  int y = *p;

  // p is moved into q. Now p is uninitialized again.
  auto q = rel p;

  // Error: p is uninitialized.
  int z = *p;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>rel-expression</em> names a local variable object or subobject and relocates that into a new value. The old object becomes uninitialized. Any uses of uninitialized objects generates a compiler error. Using a null <code>unique_ptr</code> was undefined behavior. Using an uninitialized one is a compile-time error.</p>
<p>We have to reimagine our standard library in the presence of relocation. Most kinds of resource handles include null states. These should all be replaced by safe versions to reduce exposure to unsafe APIs.</p>
<h3 id="3-type-safety-union-variety">3. <a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/site/type/">Type safety - union variety</a></h3>
<p>The compiler can only relocate local variables. How do we move objects that live on the heap, or for which we only have a pointer or reference? We need to use optional types.</p>
<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
choice optional {
  default none,
  some(T)
};

struct Data {
  // May be engaged (some) or disengaged (none).
  optional&lt;std2::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;&gt; value;
};
</code></pre>
<p>We use an optional type to represent both aspects of our the smart pointer: disengaged (<code>none</code>) and engaged (<code>some</code>). If you want to move the pointer, detach it from the optional, which changes the state of the optional from <code>some</code> to <code>none</code>. The C++ Standard Library has an optional type,<sup id="fnref:optional"><a href="#fn:optional">21</a></sup> but it's not safe to use. The optional API is full of undefined behaviors.<sup id="fnref:optional-undefined"><a href="#fn:optional-undefined">22</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="std::optional::operator*" src="https://www.circle-lang.org/site/optional-undefined.png"></p>
<p>A similar class, <code>std::expected</code>, which is new to C++23, is also full of undefined behaviors.<sup id="fnref:expected-undefined"><a href="#fn:expected-undefined">23</a></sup></p>
<p>If we were to wrap the safe <code>std2::unique_ptr</code> in an <code>std::optional</code>, it would be just as unsafe as using <code>std::unique_ptr</code>. Using <code>-&gt;</code> with a disengaged value would cause undefined behavior.</p>
<p>The new <code>std2::optional</code> is a <em>choice type</em>, a first-class discriminated union, that can only be accessed with <em>pattern matching</em>. Pattern matching makes the union variety of type safety violations impossible: we can't access the wrong state of the sum type.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

union Value {
  int i32;
  float f32;
  double f64;
  const char* str;
};

void print(Value val) {
  // C++ does not protect us from accessing bits with the wrong type.
  // Catastrophe!
  std::cout&lt;&lt; val.str&lt;&lt; "\n";
}

int main() {
  Value value { };
  value.i32 = 101;
  print(value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>C++'s sum type support is built on top of unions. Unions are extremely unsafe. Naming a union field is like implicitly using <code>reintepret_cast</code> to convert the object's bits into the type of the field. The defects in <code>std::optional</code> and <code>std::expected</code> are of this nature: the libraries don't guard against access using an invalid type. C++ builds abstractions on top of unions, but they're not <em>safe</em> abstractions.</p>
<pre><code>#feature on safety
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

// A discriminated union that's impossible to misuse.
choice Value {
  i32(int),
  f32(float),
  f64(double),
  str(std::string)
};

void print(Value val) {
  match(val) {
    // Type safety bugs are impossible inside the pattern match.
    // The alternatives listed must be exhaustive.
    .i32(i32) =&gt; &amp;std::cout&lt;&lt; i32&lt;&lt; "\n";
    .f32(f32) =&gt; &amp;std::cout&lt;&lt; f32&lt;&lt; "\n";
    .f64(f64) =&gt; &amp;std::cout&lt;&lt; f64&lt;&lt; "\n";
    .str(str) =&gt; &amp;std::cout&lt;&lt; str&lt;&lt; "\n";
  };
}

int main() {
  print(.i32(5));
  print(.f32(101.3f));
  print(.f64(3.15159));
  print(.str("Hello safety"));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Choice types are Circle's type-safe offering. They're just like Rust's enums,<sup id="fnref:rust-enum"><a href="#fn:rust-enum">24</a></sup> one of features most credited for that language's enviable ergonomics. Accessing members of a choice object requires testing for the active type with a <em>match-expression</em>. If the match succeeds, a new declaration is bound to the corresponding payload, and that declaration is visible in the scope following the <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler also performs exhaustiveness testing. Users must name all the alternatives, or use a wildcard <code>_</code> to default the unnamed ones.</p>
<p>Pattern matching and choice types aren't just a qualify-of-life improvement. They're a critical part of the memory safety puzzle and all modern languages provide them.</p>
<h3 id="4-thread-safety">4. <a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/site/thread/">Thread safety</a></h3>
<p>A memory-safe language should be robust against data races to shared mutable state. If one thread is writing to shared state, no other thread should be allowed access to it. Rust provides thread safety using a really novel extension of the type system. </p>
<h3 id="5-runtime-checks">5. <a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/site/safe/#panic-functions">Runtime checks</a></h3>
<h2 id="the-road-not-taken">The road not taken</h2>
<p>There are many efforts at library mitigations<sup id="fnref:miracle-ptr"><a href="#fn:miracle-ptr">25</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:buffer-hardening"><a href="#fn:buffer-hardening">26</a></sup> of undefined behaviors. There is work on sanitizers, which are special build targets that flag undefined behavior at runtime.<sup id="fnref:addresssan"><a href="#fn:addresssan">27</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:pizlonator"><a href="#fn:pizlonator">28</a></sup> These kinds of projects serve as a first defense against vulnerabilities in C++ codes. </p>
<p>But what work has been done to bring memory safety constructs directly to the C++ language? Aside from Circle C++, there is no ongoing effort to extend C++ for the rigorous memory safety guarantees required by security researches in industry and government. There are no attempts at building a safe context into mainline compilers like MSVC, Clang and GCC. Companies that built their fortunes on this language, such as Microsoft, Google, NVIDIA, Intel, Adobe and Bloomberg have not made efforts to stave off its obsolescence. The C++ ISO committee has no insights into this problem and no strategy to address it.</p>
<p>Why have compiler vendors and standardization workers not taken seriously the growing costs of security vulnerabilties in C++? I think it's because the problem seems too challenging for any single effort to make real headway:</p>
<p><strong>The solution has a broad scope.</strong> Memory safety vulnerabilities come in a menagerie of categories, related to lifetime safety, bounds safety, thread safety, and several flavors of type safety. Each needs its own treatment. The surface area for addressing all of these categories makes for a very large extension. One belief is that all these changes in the aggregate represent too much work for either the committee or the vendors to to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>Major upgrades to tooling are required.</strong> Not only does the compiler frontend need an overhaul, but a new middle-end is required to support borrow checking and object relocation. A new standard library has to be written that gradually replaces the legacy one, reducing exposure to unsafe operations. Frontend, backend, library. This is a vertical problem larger than the usual remit of compiler developers.</p>
<p><strong>The new technology is difficult.</strong> The most novel part of Rust's safety model is its NLL borrow checker.<sup id="fnref2:borrow-checking"><a href="#fn:borrow-checking">10</a></sup> This is complicated feature. You can't begin to understand how it works after reading an introductory book about Rust or through casual usage of the language. The sophistication of the feature has scared off everyone from considering integrating the technology into a C++ compiler. It's a beautiful idea, but it feels a bit like mastering alien technology if you're a frontend engineer who doesn't already work extensively with control-flow graphs.</p>
<p><strong>Mainline compilers are too burdensome for experimentation.</strong> C++ is the result of more than 50 years of evolution, from K&amp;R C to C++23. The language is fantastically complex with compilers that are commensurately challenging to write and maintain. It would be very difficult to do this level of experimentation on MSVC, Clang or GCC. The Circle compiler is only about 310,000 lines of code, which is compact compared to other compilers. I wrote every line, and I know how everything fits together, and this gives me a huge agility advantage compared to people working on the mainline toolchains.</p>
<p><strong>C++ users are arrogant.</strong> There's an attitude of "get good" among C and C++ practitioners. They reason that if you make a mess of things, it's your own fault, and the solution is to get better. But software design is a collaborative effort, even for one-man shops like my own. You're always relying on other people's code, and you can't understand how it all works. It's not realistic to expect flawless programming on a large project. A memory-safe language makes mistakes much less costlty: your program won't exhibit undefined behavior, and constructs that can't be checked for soundness by the compiler are flagged as potentially unsafe, giving programmers the opportunity to rethink their design and perhaps express those operations using memory safe APIs.</p>
<p>Institutional users of C++ should be worried. The security community is baying for this language's extinction. The government is on our case about it, and legislation banning C++'s use in certain sectors looks like a possibility. I don't think nitpicking the NSA is a compelling response. </p>
<p><em>We have to do something real.</em> We should solve the underlying safety problem. I want to see industry jolted into action. </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Fast compilation is important when compilation occurs at runtime, such as query compilers in modern database systems and WebAssembly virtual machines in modern browsers. We present copy-and-patch, an extremely fast compilation technique that also produces good quality code. It is capable of lowering both high-level languages and low-level bytecode programs to binary code, by stitching together code from a large library of binary implementation variants. We call these binary implementations stencils because they have holes where missing values must be inserted during code generation. We show how to construct a stencil library and describe the copy-and-patch algorithm that generates optimized binary code.
<br>We demonstrate two use cases of copy-and-patch: a compiler for a high-level C-like language intended for metaprogramming and a compiler for WebAssembly. Our high-level language compiler has negligible compilation cost: it produces code from an AST in less time than it takes to construct the AST. We have implemented an SQL database query compiler on top of this metaprogramming system and show that on TPC-H database benchmarks, copy-and-patch generates code two orders of magnitude faster than LLVM -O0 and three orders of magnitude faster than higher optimization levels. The generated code runs an order of magnitude faster than interpretation and 14% faster than LLVM -O0. Our WebAssembly compiler generates code 4.9X-6.5X faster than Liftoff, the WebAssembly baseline compiler in Google Chrome. The generated code also outperforms Liftoff's by 39%-63% on the Coremark and PolyBenchC WebAssembly benchmarks.

<p>Disclaimer: the content of this post is a reflection of my career journey and not specific to my work at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>
<p>PyCon US 2024 was truly incredible. If you ever have the chance to attend, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>I am thankful for and proud of my friend Mariatta (PyCon US Chair) who oversaw it.</p>
<p>This was my second time attending an in-person PyCon US. My first one was in 2019. I remember being awestruck by the ocean of people. I was glad that I had already attended DjangoCon US and some regional conferences. I recognized some people in the crowd, and it made it feel like a smaller event.</p>
<p>This time, I was better prepared. I knew what to expect and leveraged my time better, all while having a ton of fun.</p>

<p>I arrived on Wednesday, settled in, and immediately took some time to see the <a href="https://www.pittsburghcc.com/">David L. Lawrence Convention Center</a> and the downtown.</p>
<p>This was my first time in Pittsburgh, and I didn’t know what to expect. Downtown Pittsburgh, with its many steel bridges and brick buildings surrounded by riverfront, was a surprisingly gorgeous scene.</p>

<p>I took the day off to sightsee.</p>
<p>As I was walking down the riverfront, I saw a man taking photos. He looked familiar. I was pretty sure we had been following each other on social media for a while. I couldn’t resist approaching him. It was Peter Wang (Anaconda Co-founder). It was really fun to meet him, and I found out that he and my friend Andy Fundinger had been consultants at JPMorgan Chase years ago.</p>

<h3>Noticeable Sightings at the Conference Center<a href="#noticeable-sightings-at-the-conference-center" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>I couldn’t resist stopping at the convention center to see what was going on.</p>
<p>Once inside, I soon saw Guido van Rossum (Python Creator and BDFL) walking nearby. He sat down next to me, and I had the chance to chat with him about life and work. I thanked him for spending the time, and he thanked me. I’ve had the chance to spend time with him at three conferences now, and it’s always fun. The Python community is lucky to have a BDFL who actively engages with us and cares.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to catch up with some of my DjangoCon US friends: Afi Gbagado (DjangoCon US), Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe (Technology Chief of Staff and Open Source Founder), Noah Alorwu (Marygold and Co.), Felipe de Morais (AfroPython), Jeff Triplett (RevSys, DEFNA Board Member), Eric Matthes (Author of <a href="https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition">Python Crash Course</a>), and Trey Hunner (Python Trainer, Python Morsels). I made a new friend Amanda Viera (AfroPython).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/me-and-abigail1.jpg">

<p>As usual, Trey had an interesting gaggle of people around him that included Marie Roald and Yngve Mardal Moe (<a href="https://turtlethread.com/">Turtle Thread</a>) and Rodrigo Girão Serrão (<a href="https://mathspp.com/">Python Math Teacher</a>).</p>
<p>It was good to chat with Mason Eggers (PyTexas Chair), Kevin Horn (Dallas Fortworth Pythoneers Co-founder and PyTexas Organizer), Josh Schneider (PyTexas Organizer), Andy Fundinger (Bloomberg), and Heather Crawford (Bloomberg) again so soon after seeing them at the wonderful PyTexas conference I attended in April. Andy and I first met at PyGotham, another one of my favorite conferences.</p>
<p>Inspired by Andy, Mason and I later talked PyTexas sponsorships.</p>
<p>Although they were hard at work, I also got to see Deb Nicholson (Python Software Foundation Executive Director) for the first time again since DjangoCon US 2023, Ee Durbin (PSF Director of Infrastructure), Christopher Ngeuebauer (PSF Board Member), and Mariatta. :)</p>

<h3>Opening Reception at the Expo Hall<a href="#opening-reception-at-the-expo-hall" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>I gave my first conference talk at the first conference I ever attended. It was DjangoCon US 2017 in Spokane, Washington. I distinctly remember that Roger Masse (United States Senate) and Mark Lavin (Nvidia) attended my talk. At the PyCon US 2024 opening reception, while catching up with Jon Banafato (PyGotham Chair), I saw Mark walking by and couldn’t resist stopping him to introduce myself and thank him years later for going to my first talk. :)</p>
<p>After years of following each other on social media, it was wonderful to meet Anthony Shaw (Microsoft) in person. Along with Iqbal Abdullah (LaLoka Labs, PyCon JP), we talked about the <a href="https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/">CPython Internals</a> book Anthony wrote and my desire to understand CPython better. Anthony later suggested that I submit to the CfP next year, and I have to admit that it’s tempting.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to chat with Simon Willison (Django Co-founder) again briefly before he left to work on his keynote. I knew he would nail it.</p>
<p>I got to hang out with Meagan Voss (Wagtail) and Nic James (DjangoCon US 2019 Chair) and talk about our work.</p>
<p>It was so good to see my friend Jess Garson (Elastic, formerly Twitter) at the Elastic booth and meet Philip Krenn (Elastic). Jess and I first met at PyGotham 2019, and she introduced me to many aspects of the Twitter Developer Program. :)</p>
<p>The night finished with a bear hug from Carol Willing (CPython Core Developer, Python Steering Committee) who told me I am awesome. :)</p>

<p>In the Expo hall, I did a tour of database companies and other fun tools.</p>
<p>At Datadog booth, Julian Levi Hernandez (Datadog, formerly CockroachDB) gave me a demo of a dashboard using Cockroach audit logs to further drill down into metrics.</p>
<p>At the Edge DB booth, Yury Selivanov (Edge DB Co-founder) told me that Django will be supported in a few months and showed me the impressive performance improvement created by Edge DB. Looking forward to learning more!</p>
<p>At the Oracle booth, Gary Brenner (Oracle Senior Cloud Engineer) told me about Oracle Cloud and self-managing Oracle databases.</p>
<p>At MongoDB booth, I caught up with my friend Mark Smith (MongoDB) and obtained some <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/developer/events/pycon-us-2024/">learning resources</a> from Rita Rodrigues (Director of Developer Relations at MongoDB).</p>
<p>At Snowflake booth, I learned about <a href="https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/">Snowflake Quickstarts</a> and using Snowflake tasks for orchestration.</p>
<p>At the Crunch Data booth, I met Elizabeth Garrett Christensen. I know of Elizabeth through the talks she has given at DjangoCon US: “<a href="https://2022.djangocon.us/talks/how-to-be-a-postgres-dba-in-a-pinch/">How to Be a Postgres DBA in a Pinch</a>” and “<a href="https://2023.djangocon.us/talks/postgres-performance-from-slow-to-pro/">Postgres Performance: From Slow to Pro</a>”. Crunch Data provides Enterprise PostgreSQL support, including fully managed Postgres as a Service.</p>
<p>As a fellow Lawrence native, Elizabeth seems to be hoping for a Lawrence Django conference as much as I am. :) I missed the <a href="https://lawrencetechconference.splashthat.com/">Lawrence Technology Conference</a> this year, but hope to make it next year at least, if there is one.</p>
<p>At the PostgreSQL community booth, I obtained some learning resources, including a paper version of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/press/faq/">PostgreSQL FAQs</a>.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.coiled.io/">Coiled</a> booth, I learned about using Dask for parallel computing. Dask was a projects cited in the Measuring the performance of CPython.</p>

<h3>K. Jay Miller Keynote<a href="#k-jay-miller-keynote" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Jay knows two staff developer advocates who are Black and he is one of them. When he sees another Black developer on stage, it’s not just another Pythonista.</p>
<p>Jay talked about beautiful moments from DjangoCon US 2023 in Durham, North Carolina: Black leaders, from all around the world, getting on stage, getting in front of their booths. They showed up and showed out for who they were.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/black-python-devs-durham.png">
Black Python Devs at DjangoCon US 2023</p>
<p>Jay was happy to not be the first Black person keynoting PyCon US. But, at PyCon US 2022, Jay counted only 12 Black people among thousands. He talked to them. They had to have a reason to be there. He thought of the keynoters who came before him. They came, they spoke, they left. He wondered if “the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze.”</p>
<p>Many people go to conferences to hang out with their friends. If you don’t have that kind of experience, there’s no reason to attend.</p>
<p>Jay asked, how do we get more black people to experience the PyCon community, build friendship, and become repeat attendees?</p>
<p>Jay decided to create something that would serve as a Wakanda for Black Python devs. Something that would be worth staying for. It’s called <a href="https://blackpythondevs.com/">Black Python Devs</a>.</p>
<p>Jay listened to people in the community who had experience running non-profits, starting communities, running conferences: Marlene, Dawn, Kojo. He needed to make the community safe, equitable, accessible. This goes beyond a code of conduct to issues that Black people think about everyday like physical safety in public. He also wants to prevent burnout.</p>
<p>Jay started working behind the scenes to get as many Black people as possible to PyCon US 2023. There were 3x more than in 2022. They were able to be in the same room together and talk about the experiences they have as Black Python devs that others can’t comprehend, not about how to increase diversity.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/black-python-devs-31.png">
3x attendance at PyCon US 2022</p>
<p>Five members launched a discord. There are 427 members now. Their only plan was to be there for each other.</p>
<p>They are now officially a non-profit powered by the GNOME Foundation.</p>
<p>The leadership model is “diversity by inclusion.” Global leaders are represented at the table: from many countries, speaking different languages, 50/50 gender parity. It’s members are people who are already around you in PSF, DFS, Djangonauts, Pylades, DjangoGirls. Because the community came from Africa, its leaders do too.</p>
<p>“Your reach may extend beyond your grasp.” Kojo Idressa</p>
<p>The Python community can extend the reach further and Black Python Devs can help change perceptions in communities.</p>
<p>A few examples of solidarity</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Facilitating four leaders traveling to their first PyCon US</p></li>
<li><p>Converting community sponsorship into tickets for first time attendees who are Black Python Devs members</p></li>
<li><p>Providing 75 student tickets to Python Nigeria</p></li>
<li><p>Convening leaders from across the globe at conference lunchtime to help understand the situation happening in Africa and what could be done to assist</p></li>
<li><p>Helped Vice Chair Velda Kiara on stage when her laptop didn’t work</p></li>
<li><p>Supporting a Django Girls event that gave not just Black women devs, but Black girls a wonderful first interaction with the Python community</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Say it loud.” Everything they do is out in the open, proudly showing up for each other, saying, we’ve got this, and celebrating.</p>
<p>Black Python devs had a goal of sponsoring seven local conferences in Black communities and hoped to raise $5,000 at PyCon US. They raised over $15,300 from 282 donations.</p>
<p>Things you can do to help</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Donate money</p></li>
<li><p>Donate time, mentor</p></li>
<li><p>Connect with Black Python Devs</p></li>
<li><p>Open doors, have conversations, make connections</p></li>

<h3>Hallway Track and Expo Hall<a href="#hallway-track-and-expo-hall" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>At PyCon US 2019, Pablo Galindo Salgado (CPython Release Manager, Bloomberg) was one of the first people I met as a wide-eyed newcomer. It was the Thursday night before the conference talks began, and I was at the conference hall for the swag stuffing, which is a great place to meet people. Scientists had recently photographed a black hole for the first time. Pablo, a physicist, invited me to a table nearby where he demoed some Python astronomy software for me. I later met Barry Warsaw (Python Steering Committee, Nvidia) at the sprints and talked to him about my career. At the time, I was a part-time open source maintainer of Pinax.</p>
<p>I saw Pablo and Barry together at the PyCon US 2024 Opening Reception. It was wonderful to be able to share with them five years later how my career has taken off.</p>
<p>It was great to see Andrew Godwin (Django Async Architecture) and Dave Forgac (PyOhio) again.</p>
<p>I had the chance to say hello to Sarah Kuchinsky (PyCon US Organizer) for the first time since PyCon US 2019. She was recently the technical reviewer for Al Sweigart’s great book about recursion called “<a href="https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/">The Recursive Book of Recursion</a>”. I really enjoyed it!</p>
<p>I found out that Julia Ferraioli (AWS Open Source) was at the conference. I was ecstatic and hurried over to meet her. I had hoped to meet Julia in person for years. In March of 2021, I reached the final round of a Twitter Open Source Program Manager interview process. I was disappointed when I was not offered the job, but later found out that I had been considered alongside Julie and was honored. In a twist of fate, in August of 2022, Julia kindly met with me via Zoom and gave me excellent career advice.</p>
<p>It was also a pleasure to meet Brianne Wilhelmi (Springboard) and Aaron Clark (Hamilton Beach) at lunch, and see Ashia Zawaduk (Muck Rack) again after PyCascades 2020.</p>

<h3>Simon Willison Keynote<a href="#simon-willison-keynote" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Simon talked about Large Language Models such as Chat GPT, Google Gemini, Claude, and Llama.</p>
<p>He does not think of them as Artificial Intelligence. He thinks of them as Imitation Intelligence. They predict the next word in a sentence. When they get good at that, it’s spooky what they can do. He acknowledged that they are flawed, but just because a tool is flawed, doesn’t mean it’s not useful.</p>
<p>When evaluating a new technology, Simon asks, what can I build with this that I couldn’t have built with it before? LLMs open up new options unlike anything he has ever seen.</p>
<p>How can we tell which of these models works best? Vibes. Simon recommends using <a href="https://arena.lmsys.org/">LMSYS Org Chatbot Arena</a>. You vote on which model gave the best response to a prompt, then they are scored using Elo rating system. Simon is relieved, because “openly” licensed models are beginning to rank.</p>
<p>LLMs can be run on smartphones now, even with no internet connection. An app called MLC Chat will give you access to Mistral, one of the best openly licensed models.</p>
<p>Simon has deep respect for what is known as prompt engineering. It’s not easy to get LLMs to do what you want them to do. Building something simple is easy. Building something production ready can take months and is much harder than people expect.</p>
<p>A few tricks</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chat prompting</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieval Augmented Generate (RAG)</p></li>
<li><p>Function calling (“tools”) in a loop</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Simon coined the term “Prompt Injection” after SQL Injection. He believes that we are not seeing digital assistants, because no one knows how to build them securely. 99% effective isn’t good enough. Never mix untrusted text with access to tools.</p>
<p>Simon showed how he gave the LLM a GeoJSON file with different line segments and prompted it to turn it into a single polygon. This “side project” took 3 1/2 minutes to complete</p>
<p>Simon showed how he had created a counter that incremented each time he said AI or artificial intelligence. It took 6 minutes to get to prototype and 20 minutes to get it polished.</p>
<p>Simon walked through how he passed structured data from the PSF Board Resolutions page into an LLM to parse it into a structured data table that could be filtered. He used a plugin he had been developing called llm.datasette.io.</p>
<p>Simon has been able to use LLM to more quickly build things that he couldn’t justify spending the time to build by hand.</p>
<p>Tips</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask it to give options (it’s more likely to give a better answer)</p></li>
<li><p>It will rarely get the answer right. Ask it to “do better.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>LLMs make mistakes. It’s up to you to verify. The tool gets you 90% of the way there.</p>
<p>Rather than Generative AI, Simon likes to think of these tools as Transformative AI.</p>
<p>Personal AI ethics: Simon came across the term “slop” and likes it. Similar to spam, ask yourself, am I creating unwanted junk or am I using these tools in a responsible way?</p>
<p>Simon pondered if using LLMs is cheating. We care if students cheat, because it hurts them and they have an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>LLMs feel different. Simon’s whole career has been about getting things done more quickly, including by using open source code.</p>
<p>A few rules of thumb</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Never commit any code that you couldn’t actively explain to someone else</p></li>
<li><p>LLMs are good at explaining code. Give it code in a language you don’t understand and it will explain it with 90% accuracy</p></li>
<li><p>Then, help people understand how you did it!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>He said software engineers are uniquely positioned to take advantage of LLMs, because LLMs are good at generating code, and you can check the code by running it.</p>
<p>Simon is optimistic. You need to have a CS degree or spend a lot of time learning to do the simplest of computer tasks.</p>
<p>LLMs opens programming up to a much wider community. Simon believes that we have a responsibility to not leave anyone behind.</p>

<h3>Overcoming GIL with subinterpreters and immutability<a href="#overcoming-gil-with-subinterpreters-and-immutability" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yury Selivanov showed a screen with a single Python process running 10 async IO event loops saturating the 10 CPU cores on his laptop, all sharing memory and exchanging values between them from 1 million keys and values and done fairly efficiently. Yury said it is possible to build fast things with Python.</p>
<p>Yury kind of likes the GIL. When he tries to do free-threading or multi-thread programming, bad things happen.</p>
<p>Free-threading will take a couple of years to be stable. Python subinterpreters are relatively new. You can run these subinterpreters in the same process, side-by-side, isolated from each other, each with its own GIL and occupying one CPU core, sharing the same memory space.</p>
<p>One of the subinterpreters will be the main one and will spawn workers and perhaps can have queues between workers and spawn tasks.</p>
<p>What if we could safety share state between the subinterpreters with the potential for lots of it and without using pickle, because it’s slow?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/yury-shared-state-no-pickle.png">
Safe shared state… no pickle</p>
<p>Yury has created a minimal library called <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/memhive">memhive</a> that enables efficient data sharing between isolated subinterpreters.</p>
<p>He showed a code snippet.</p>
<p>Architecture</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Level 1: simple protocol that enables you to send Python data across subinterpreter boundary</p></li>
<li><p>Level 2: higher level API (queues and sychronization primitives)</p></li>
<li><p>Level 3: async IO bridge</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Create memhive and define the async workers that will be running in each separate subinterpreter, each with its own async IO loop. They can access shared state, listen to messages, send messages, spawn worker subinterpreters. The main interpreter will initialize the shared state, broadcast signals to all subinterpreters, push work so that one starts working on a task, listen to messages.</p>
<p>Rather than how it works, Yury felt it was more important to talk about how it’s implemented.</p>
<p>3 things to talk about</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immutability</p></li>
<li><p>Efficient immutability</p></li>
<li><p>How we can benefit from it</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Immutability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Python has immutable types: str, int, floates, bytes, tuples</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot change an existing object. You have to create a new object out of the existing object.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no immutable dictionary or mapping in CPython, which Yury says is a shame.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Efficient immutability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creating a new tuple out of an existing one is efficient (O(n)), but you are not usually dealing with a lot of records.</p></li>
<li><p>The same inefficiency would be very bad for a dictionary, because we are potentially putting millions of items in them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dictionaries can be used as caches, but rebuilding it every time would be unacceptably slow.</p></li>
<li><p>Fortunately smart people created a nice algorithm that can implement this with O(log n)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The trick Yury would show used trees behind the scenes.</p>
<p>As keys and values are added to an empty root node of the tree, when a key conflict happens, another node on the second level is created and the key is added to it instead. The tree will get bigger and bigger as items are added.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/yury-efficient-immutability.png">
Linking a second level node by reference</p>
<p>Imagine that we want to mutate this tree. We run the algorithm to figure out where to put the key, then need to copy the root node (it’s immutable, so we can’t mutate it).</p>
<p>This is where the magic happens.</p>
<p>We don’t have to copy the second level of the tree. We can re-use it. We just need the reference.</p>
<p>In a mapping with billions of keys, perhaps five nodes out of 10,000 change.</p>
<p>This is called structured sharing. The algorithm is called HAMT (Hash Array Mapped Trie). Yury implemented it in the Python Standard Library. It can be found in contextvars module. The <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/13a5fdc72f701c053b96abea48cd8f2775e9418e/Python/hamt.c">hamt.c file</a> has a 200 line comment explaining in detail how this data structure works.</p>
<p>How we can benefit from it</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All subinterpreters run in the same OS process so they share the same memory space</p></li>
<li><p>If we want to access this tree from the main subinterpreter, we just look into the memory directly. It is immutable and will not change.</p></li>
<li><p>If we want to add a key, we don’t have to copy the entire tree, we just create the missing new branches and reference others</p></li>
<li><p>If we have a tree with billions of keys, we just create a couple of tree nodes in a worker subinterpreter, the rest can be re-used.</p></li>
<li><p>Key: using immutable things, we can access the underlying memory safely without locks, as long as we can guarantee that the data would not be garbage collected.</p></li>
<li><p>memcopy is used and is really fast.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/yury-node-copy.png">
Create tree nodes in the worker subintrepreter and re-use the rest</p>
<p>Yury performed a benchmark. Structured sharing is significantly faster than using pickle, potentially 6x to 150,000x faster.</p>
<p>Yury talked about some of the implementation details icluding incref and decref. incref keeps Python objects alive when the ref count goes to zero. The data sharing mechanism has to guarantee safety.</p>
<p>The hard part of this is implemented in memhive, but some bugs need to be fixed. Do not use it in production.</p>
<p>Yury is building this for Edge DB to optimize cloud deployments.</p>

<h3>Building a JIT compiler for CPython<a href="#building-a-jit-compiler-for-cpython" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Brandt Bucher (Microsoft CPython Performance Engineering Team)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/jit-compiler-background.png">
Updates that provided the foundation for a copy and patch JIT Compiler.</p>
<p>In Python 3.13, a <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0744/">JIT Compiler</a> was implemented. This was only possible, because of the work done in Python 3.11 and 3.12.</p>
<p>In Python 3.11, a <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/">Specializing Adaptive Interpreter</a> was implemented that brought a 25% performance improvement on average. At PyCon US 2023, Brandt gave a talk about it “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQtrn1v7sQ">Inside CPython 3.11’s new specializing, adaptive interpreter</a>”.</p>
<p>In Python 3.12, infrastructure was implemented to automatically generate an interpreter from a DSL spec. This allowed for some repetitive, tedious, error-prone boilerplate to be removed from the main interpreter loop and different bytecode instructions to be analyzed.</p>
<p>In Python 3.13, a second <a href="https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/580">“micro-op” interpreter</a> was implemented. It’s an entirely separate execution pipeline that detects hot code paths and lowers them to a new bytecode format called “micro-ops.” They are optimized and executed in another dedicated interpreter.</p>
<p>Brandt showed how the pipeline works using a Fibonacci function as an example. He showed the code, the code’s bytecode, and the stack.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/jit-compiler-fibonacci.png">
Fibonacci code</p>
<p>This is where specialized bytecode comes in. If the operation is generalized to accommodate many use cases, but the code’s actual use case is simple, the bytecode can be “specialized” to fit that simpler use case. The resulting bytecode instructions are more specific to the the actual values, types of the code.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/jit-compiler-specialized-bytecode.png">
Implementing specialized bytecode</p>
<p>These instructions will now be broken down into smaller, more easily optimized parts called “micro-op traces.” Instructions that are necessary in some cases, but not this case, can be removed. The result will be the essential instructions to execute the code.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/jit-compiler-micro-op-traces.png">
“micro-op traces”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this new instruction format is more complex than basic bytecode instruction. Although each instruction is doing less work, there are more instructions. This is 20% slower than if we’d done nothing. Decoding each individual instruction in the micro-op interpreter is a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>That is where JIT compilation comes in.</p>
<p>Rather than decoding individual instructions in the interpreter, we can compile these optimized traces directly into machine code.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/jit-just-in-time-compilation.png">
Just-in-time compilation</p>
<p>Python frame objects live out in heap memory. Instead, the stack can be moved to the register where it is immediately available and there is no latency. Rather than having a generic interpreter that needs to handle every possible micro-op, the hot code path can be transformed in a straight line sequence of the exact code needed.</p>
<p>Although we want to make the faster, we need to trade peak performance for implementation simplicity that can enable Python to run in many places with few runtime dependencies and be easily maintained, improved, and extended upon by volunteers.</p>
<p>While JIT compilers are historically complex, copy and patch compilation meets these requirements satisfying way.</p>
<p>The technique is explained in a 30 page paper “<a href="https://sillycross.github.io/assets/copy-and-patch.pdf">Copy and Patch Compilation</a>” and a blog post “<a href="https://sillycross.github.io/2023/05/12/2023-05-12/">Building a baseline JIT for Lua</a>” by the same author.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it’s a way of automatically turning a C interpreter into a fast template JIT compiler</p>
<p>Copy and patch can enable us to take a sequence of bytecode instructions and translate it into fast machine code as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>At runtime, walk over a sequence of bytecode instructions. For each, we can do something we have long been able to do when linking or reloading a relocatable object file</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Copy some static, pre-compiled machine code into executable memory</p></li>
<li><p>Patch up instructions that need to have runtime data encoded into them (things like relocation records for extern symbols)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Brandt walked through an example of how to go from micro op instruction to code we JIT at runtime.</p>
<p>At build time, when we are building the Python interpreter, the body of the instruction is extracted. It is put inside of its own function to be compiled in isolation. It won’t compile yet, because we are accessing objects with no values. These can be dynamically passed into the function as arguments. In terms of the “undefined locals” that will be the same once JIT-ed, and the frame and pointer that needs to be passed on so that we can JIT any additional micro-ops that we are JIT-ing, copy and patch gives an elegant solution for handling these: externs. Externs are similar to Python imports. You trust them to be defined at runtime.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/jit-externs.png">
externs</p>
<p>When compile this in Clang, the ELF file will have the raw bytes of machine code to execute the micro-op instruction and exactly where and how to patch values.</p>
<p>We then have the opportunity to perform some localized optimizations until it is the essential micro-op. This can be parsed out of the ELF file and put directly into code generated in a C header file. We have a function that can be called and it will JIT the instruction for us by copying bytes and patching the load.</p>
<p>This is super fast.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is used, there is a lot of platform support out of the box.</p>
<p>In order to build this yourself, you need to have LLVM 18 installed and follow the instructions in the CPython repo.</p>

<h3>Unlocking the Parallel Universe: Subinterpreters and Free-Threading in Python 3.13<a href="#unlocking-the-parallel-universe-subinterpreters-and-free-threading-in-python-3-13" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Anthony Shaw created a <a href="https://gist.github.com/tonybaloney/24d545ed855a3c90f844209152835f07">gist</a> with the excellent pre-requisites for his talk.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/anthony-parallel-execution-in-python.png">
Parallel execution options in Python; In concurrency, multiple tasks share the same resource, while in parallelism, multiple resources execute multiple tasks.</p>
<p>In Python 3.11, the GIL lived in the interpreter and we had one GIL per Python process. Multi-processing was used to achieve parallel code execution. If a task were split in half, it would take twice as long, because only one process could run at a time.</p>
<p>In Python 3.12, because of a new API, the GIL is per interpreter. We can have multiple interpreters running at the same time with multiple threads. The operating system will figure out which core is available and schedule so they run in parallel.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/anthony-speed-differences.png">
Speed differences</p>
<p>Quick conclusion: a subinterpreter is like “multiprocessing with less overhead and shared memory”</p>
<p>In Python 3.13, we can disable the GIL and have a single interpreter running multiple threads at the same time. A task split in half will run more quickly now, because it will run in parallel.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/_images/anthony-gil-removal-steps.png">
Steps to remove GIL</p>
<p>Free-threading introduces a new ABI that requires special wheels and a special build for CPython, creating compatibility issues. The ABI (application binary interface) is used to load a module that is being compiled in a language like C.</p>
<p>The GIL exists for thread-safety. We need to fix all of the C code that assumed the GIL existed and is not thread safe.</p>
<p>If everything is in pure Python, the Python team has full control over the interpreter. C extension compatibility poses a major challenge. Ironically, we have so many C extensions, because people optimized code, because they couldn’t run it in parallel.</p>
<p>At the moment, disabling the GIL generally makes Python code run slower. There are optimizations that have been disabled when the GIL is turned off, because they need to be made thread-safe before they can be used.</p>
<p>Anthony gave a demo followed by some closing thoughts with Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h3>Sumana Harihareswara Keynote<a href="#sumana-harihareswara-keynote" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>“Untold Stories from Six Years Working on Python Packaging”</p>
<p>I met Sumana (Changeset Consulting, Python packaging, Recurse Center) at PyGotham 2017 and attended the <a href="https://pycon-archive.python.org/2019/hatchery/artofpython/">Art of Python</a> miniature arts festival that she organized at PyCon US 2019. It was wonderful to see her in her element at PyCon US 2024, on stage talking about Python packaging.</p>
<p>From 2017 to 2022, Sumana was a paid packaging project manager. She worked on things we use a lot, like pip.</p>
<p>Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A chance meeting led Sumana to help obtain funding from Mozilla and overhall PyPI to Warehouse, finishing on time and on budget and unblocking more improvements</p></li>
<li><p>The strength of weak ties, cross pollination are possible because of the kind of conversations that happen at places like PyCon US</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure is hard, it’s often invisible. People depend on it, but don’t know that they depend on it. Sumana compared it to being a water user.</p></li>
<li><p>If volunteers try to get the word out about changes and even ask for your feedback, treat them like people. We are all in this together.</p></li>
<li><p>When PSF gets funding, it gets results (see a list in the <a href="https://pypi.org/sponsors/">PyPI sponsors page</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations that rely on this infrastructure (and may have entitled opinions) can do a lot more to help</p></li>
<li><p>What seems like failure can prepare the ground for success: building organization, networks, knowledge, skill can be crucial for future successes you can’t foresee at the time</p></li>
<li><p>Sumana revised a bill to the NY City Council until it passed: The HEART Act to make Automated External Defibrillators more accessible to New Yorkers.</p></li>
<li><p>She wasn’t a Python packaging expert, but also wasn’t a public health expert. She planned and asked the right question until she got an answer.</p></li>
<li><p>You too can be the paddles that revive something that is stuck, in open source, local government</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Homework</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Renew a connection: reply to an old friend or colleague</p></li>
<li><p>Practice <a href="#volunteeramnestyday.net"><span>Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day</span></a>: on June 20th have a 20 minute meeting with yourself to think about your choices</p></li>
<li><p>Consider solidarity</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sumana created a page with all of her excellent <a href="https://harihareswara.net/posts/2024/references-pycon-us-keynote/">keynote references</a>.</p>
<p>I got to say hello after the keynote and also had the chance to meet her husband Leonard Richardson, who authored <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup</a>, another one of my favorite packages. :)</p>
<p>Leonard handed me a mini-zine called “Tool Safety” that he had written. After I got home and started looking through it, I saw that it had a beautiful message. You can see the online version <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/zine/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As a bonus, before the talk began, I met Brian Walker who was sitting in my row. He’s a “Digital Billboard Jedi Master” software engineer working at Watchfire.</p>

<h4>Barry Warsaw: Steering Council Overview<a href="#barry-warsaw-steering-council-overview" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The steering council is a five-person elected governance body responsible for the technical direction of Python: the evolution of the Python language, the CPython interpreter, and standard library. Elections happen annually, roughly aligned with Python releases.</p>
<p>Steering council members serve for one year and can run for re-election with no term limits. They are typically nominated and elected by CPython Core Devs, but you don’t have to be a CPython Core Dev to serve. No more than two members can work for the same company.</p>
<p>The steering council meets almost every week for 90 minutes. They are regularly joined by Deb Nicholson and Łukasz Langa. They discuss many topics which often come to their attention through the public GitHub tracker. A few of their important tasks: determining release cycle, choosing next release manager, pronouncing PEPs. The steering council has the final say on PEPs.</p>
<p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0013/">PEP 13</a> outlines how the Python Steering Council operates.</p>

<h2>Monday<a href="#monday" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>At PyCon US 2019, on my last night in Cleveland, I spontaneously joined Sviatoslav Sydorenko (Ansible Core Developer), Stéphane Wirtel (CPython Core Developer), and a few other conference attendees at Flannery’s Pub for dinner. It was magical.</p>
<p>On the first day of the PyCon US 2024 Sprints, Sviatoslav Sydorenko and I found each other for a catch up. I suddenly made the connection that he is a core developer of <a href="https://github.com/ansible">Ansible</a>, a tool that I use. Mind blown. :) He gave me some insight about being a programmer versus engineer and distributed systems. It was a very enlightening conversation for me.</p>
<p>I also met Seth Michael Larson (PSF Security Developer in Residence) in person in the packaging sprints room. I have been following his security work, which has included <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-9">Visualizing the CPython release process</a>, <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/software-bill-of-materials-now-available-for-cpython.html">making CPython source release Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) available</a>, and <a href="https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/news/2023/08/29/Python-Software-Foundation-Added-as-CNA">getting the PSF set up as a CVE Numbering Authority</a>.
