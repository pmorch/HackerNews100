<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A bit of signal processing swiftly reveals that diffusion models and autoregressive models aren’t all that different: <strong>diffusion models of images perform approximate autoregression in the frequency domain!</strong></p>

<p>
This blog post is also available as a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1siywvhvl1OxI1UmqRrJHiFUK0M5SHlcx">Python notebook in Google Colab <img src="https://sander.ai/images/colab_logo.png"></a>, with the code used to produce all the plots and animations.</p>

<p>Last year, I wrote a blog post describing various different <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/07/20/perspectives.html">perspectives on diffusion</a>. The idea was to highlight a number of connections between diffusion models and other classes of models and concepts. In recent months, I have given a few talks where I discussed some of these perspectives. My talk at the <a href="https://www.eeml.eu/">EEML 2024 summer school</a> in Novi Sad, Serbia, was recorded and is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BHQvQlsVdE">available on YouTube</a>. Based on the response I got from this talk, the link between diffusion models and <strong>autoregressive models</strong> seems to be particularly thought-provoking. That’s why I figured it could be useful to explore this a bit further.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I will unpack the above claim, and try to make it obvious that this is the case, at least for visual data. To make things more tangible, I decided to write this entire blog post in the form of <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1siywvhvl1OxI1UmqRrJHiFUK0M5SHlcx">a Python notebook</a> (using Google Colab). That way, <strong>you can easily reproduce the plots and analyses yourself</strong>, and modify them to observe what happens. I hope this format will also help drive home the point that this connection between diffusion models and autoregressive models is “real”, and not just a theoretical idealisation that doesn’t hold up in practice.</p>

<p>In what follows, I will assume a basic understanding of diffusion models and the core concepts behind them. If you’ve watched the talk I linked above, you should be able to follow along. Alternatively, the <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/07/20/perspectives.html">perspectives on diffusion</a> blog post should also suffice as preparatory reading. Some knowledge of the Fourier transform will also be helpful.</p>

<p>Autoregression and diffusion are currently the two dominant generative modelling paradigms. There are many more ways to build generative models: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_generative_model">flow-based models</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">adversarial models</a> are just two possible alternatives (I discussed a few more in <a href="https://sander.ai/2020/03/24/audio-generation.html#generative-models">an earlier blog post</a>).</p>

<p>Both autoregression and diffusion differ from most of these alternatives, by splitting up the difficult task of generating data from complex distributions into smaller subtasks that are easier to learn. Autoregression does this by casting the data to be modelled into the shape of a sequence, and recursively predicting one sequence element at a time. Diffusion instead works by defining a corruption process that gradually destroys all structure in the data, and training a model to learn to invert this process step by step.</p>

<p>This <strong>iterative refinement</strong> approach to generative modelling is very powerful, because it allows us to construct very deep computational graphs for generation, without having to backpropagate through them during training. Indeed, both autoregressive models and diffusion models learn to perform a single step of refinement at a time – the generative process is not trained end-to-end. It is only when we try to sample from the model that we connect all these steps together, by sequentially performing the subtasks: predicting one sequence element after another in the case of autoregression, or gradually denoising the input step-by-step in the case of diffusion.</p>

<p>Because this underlying iterative approach is common to both paradigms, people have often sought to connect the two. One could frame autoregression as a special case of discrete diffusion, for example, with a corruption process that gradually replaces tokens by “mask tokens” from right to left, eventually ending up with a fully masked sequence. In the next few sections, we will do the opposite, framing diffusion as a special case of autoregression, albeit approximate.</p>

<p>Today, most language models are autoregressive, while most models of images and video are diffusion-based. In many other application domains (e.g. protein design, planning in reinforcement learning, …), diffusion models are also becoming more prevalent. I think this dichotomy, which can be summarised as “autoregression for language, and diffusion for everything else”, is quite interesting. I have <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/01/09/diffusion-language.html">written about it before</a>, and I will have more to say about it in a later section of this post.</p>

<h2 id="-a-spectral-view-of-diffusion"><a name="spectral-view"></a> A spectral view of diffusion</h2>

<h3 id="-image-spectra"><a name="image-spectra"></a> Image spectra</h3>

<p>When diffusion models rose to prominence for image generation, people noticed quite quickly that they tend to produce images in a coarse-to-fine manner. The large-scale structure present in the image seems to be decided in earlier denoising steps, whereas later denoising steps add more and more fine-grained details.</p>

<p>To formalise this observation, we can use signal processing, and more specifically <strong>spectral analysis</strong>. By decomposing an image into its constituent <strong>spatial frequency</strong> components, we can more precisely tease apart its coarse- and fine-grained structure, which correspond to low and high frequencies respectively.</p>

<p>We can use the 2D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> to obtain a frequency representation of an image. This representation is invertible, i.e. it contains the same information as the pixel representation – it is just organised in a different way. Like the pixel representation, it is a 2D grid-structured object, with the same width and height as the original image, but the axes now correspond to horizontal and vertical spatial frequencies, rather than spatial positions.</p>

<p>To see what this looks like, let’s take some images and visualise their spectra.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_spectra.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_spectra.png" alt="Four images from the Imagenette dataset (top), along with their magnitude spectra (middle) and their phase spectra (bottom)."></a>
  <figcaption>Four images from the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/imagenette">Imagenette dataset</a> (top), along with their magnitude spectra (middle) and their phase spectra (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Shown above on the first row are four images from the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/imagenette">Imagenette dataset</a>, a subset of the ImageNet dataset (I picked it because it is relatively fast to load).</p>

<p>The Fourier transform is typically complex-valued, so the next two rows visualise the <em>magnitude</em> and the <em>phase</em> of the spectrum respectively. Because the magnitude varies greatly across different frequencies, its logarithm is shown. The phase is an angle, which varies between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\). Note that we only calculate the spectrum for the green colour channel – we could calculate it for the other two channels as well, but they would look very similar.</p>

<p>The centre of the spectrum corresponds to the lowest spatial frequencies, and the frequencies increase as we move outward to the edges. This allows us to see where most of the energy in the input signal is concentrated. Note that by default, it is the other way around (low frequencies in the corner, high frequencies in the middle), but <code>np.fft.fftshift</code> allows us to swap these, which yields a much nicer looking visualisation that makes the structure of the spectrum more apparent.</p>

<p>A lot of interesting things can be said about the phase structure of natural images, but in what follows, we will primarily focus on the magnitude spectrum. The square of the magnitude is the <em>power</em>, so in practice we often look at the <em>power spectrum</em> instead. Note that the logarithm of the power spectrum is simply that of the magnitude spectrum, multiplied by two.</p>

<p>Looking at the spectra, we now have a more formal way to reason about different feature scales in images, but that still doesn’t explain why diffusion models exhibit this coarse-to-fine behaviour. To see why this happens, we need to examine what a typical image spectrum looks like. To do this, we will <strong>make abstraction of the directional nature of frequencies in 2D space</strong>, simply by slicing the spectrum along a certain angle, rotating that slice all around, and then averaging the slices across all rotations. This yields a one-dimensional curve: <strong>the <em>radially averaged power spectral density</em>, or RAPSD</strong>.</p>

<p>Below is an animation that shows individual directional slices of the 2D spectrum on a log-log plot, which are averaged to obtain the RAPSD.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>Animation that shows individual directional slices of the 2D spectrum of an image on a log-log plot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s see what that looks like for the four images above. We will use the <code>pysteps</code> library, which comes with a handy function to calculate the RAPSD in one go.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_rapsd.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/plot_image_rapsd.png" alt="Four images from the Imagenette dataset (top), along with their radially averaged spectral power densities (RAPSDs, bottom)."></a>
  <figcaption>Four images from the Imagenette dataset (top), along with their radially averaged spectral power densities (RAPSDs, bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The RAPSD is best visualised on a log-log plot, to account for the large variation in scale. We chop off the so-called DC component (with frequency 0) to avoid taking the logarithm of 0.</p>

<p>Another thing this visualisation makes apparent is that the curves are remarkably close to being straight lines. A straight line on a log-log plot implies that there might be a power law lurking behind all of this.</p>

<p>Indeed, this turns out to be the case: <strong>natural image spectra tend to approximately follow a power law</strong>, which means that the power \(P(f)\) of a particular frequency \(f\) is proportional to \(f^{-\alpha}\), where \(\alpha\) is a parameter<sup id="fnref:schaaf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:schaaf" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:torralba" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:torralba" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:hyvarinen" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hyvarinen" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. In practice, \(\alpha\) is often remarkably close to 2 (which corresponds to the spectrum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise">pink noise</a> in two dimensions).</p>

<p>We can get closer to the “typical” RAPSD by taking the average across a bunch of images (in the log-domain).</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd.png" alt="The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain."></a>
  <figcaption>The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As I’m sure you will agree, that is pretty unequivocally a power law!</p>

<p>To estimate the exponent \(\alpha\), we can simply use linear regression in log-log space. Before proceeding however, it is useful to resample our averaged RAPSD so the sample points are linearly spaced in log-log space – otherwise our fit will be dominated by the high frequencies, where we have many more sample points.</p>

<p>We obtain an estimate \(\hat{\alpha} = 2.454\), which is a bit higher than the typical value of 2. As far as I understand, this can be explained by the presence of man-made objects in many of the images we used, because they tend to have smooth surfaces and straight angles, which results in comparatively more low-frequency content and less high-frequency content compared to images of nature. Let’s see what our fit looks like.</p>

<h3 id="-noisy-image-spectra"><a name="noisy-spectra"></a> Noisy image spectra</h3>

<p>A crucial aspect of diffusion models is the corruption process, which involves adding Gaussian noise. Let’s see what this does to the spectrum. The first question to ask is: what does the spectrum of noise look like? We can repeat the previous procedure, but replace the image input with standard Gaussian noise. For contrast, we will visualise the spectrum of the noise alongside that of the images from before.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_noise.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_noise.png" alt="The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line)."></a>
  <figcaption>The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The RAPSD of Gaussian noise is also a straight line on a log-log plot; but a horizontal one, rather than one that slopes down. This reflects the fact that <strong>Gaussian noise contains all frequencies in equal measure</strong>. The Fourier transform of Gaussian noise is itself Gaussian noise, so its power must be equal across all frequencies in expectation.</p>

<p>When we add noise to the images and look at the spectrum of the resulting noisy images, we see a hinge shape:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_sum.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_rapsd_sum.png" alt="The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line) and the average of RAPSDs of their sum (green line)."></a>
  <figcaption>The average of RAPSDs of a set of images in the log-domain (red line), along with the average of RAPSDs of standard Gaussian noise (blue line) and the average of RAPSDs of their sum (green line).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Why does this happen? Recall that the <strong>Fourier transform is linear</strong>: the Fourier transform of the sum of two things, is the sum of the Fourier transforms of those things. Because the power of the different frequencies varies across orders of magnitude, <strong>one of the terms in this sum tends to drown out the other</strong>. This is what happens at low frequencies, where the image spectrum dominates, and hence the green curve overlaps with the red curve. At high frequencies on the other hand, the noise spectrum dominates, and the green curve overlaps with the blue curve. In between, there is a transition zone where the power of both spectra is roughly matched.</p>

<p>If we increase the variance of the noise by scaling the noise term, we increase its power, and as a result, its RAPSD will shift upward (which is also a consequence of the linearity of the Fourier transform). This means a smaller part of the image spectrum now juts out above the waterline: <strong>the increasing power of the noise looks like the rising tide!</strong></p>

</figure>

<p>At this point, I’d like to revisit a diagram from the <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/07/20/perspectives.html#autoregressive">perspectives on diffusion blog post</a>, where I originally drew the connection between diffusion and autoregression in frequency space, which is shown below.</p>

  <figcaption>Magnitude spectra of natural images, Gaussian noise, and noisy images.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These idealised plots of the spectra of images, noise, and their superposition match up pretty well with the real versions. When I originally drew this, I didn’t actually realise just how closely this reflects reality!</p>

<p>What these plots reveal is an approximate equivalence (in expectation) between adding noise to images, and <strong>low-pass filtering</strong> them. The noise will drown out some portion of the high frequencies, and leave the low frequencies untouched. The variance of the noise determines the <strong>cut-off frequency</strong> of the filter. Note that this is the case only because of the characteristic shape of natural image spectra.</p>

<p>The animation below shows how the spectrum changes as we gradually add more noise, until it eventually overpowers all frequency components, and all image content is gone.</p>

<h3 id="-diffusion"><a name="diffuion"></a> Diffusion</h3>

<p>With this in mind, it becomes apparent that the corruption process used in diffusion models is actually gradually filtering out more and more high-frequency information from the input image, and the different time steps of the process correspond to a frequency decomposition: basically an approximate version of the <strong>Fourier transform</strong>!</p>

<p>Since diffusion models themselves are tasked with reversing this corruption process step-by-step, they end up roughly predicting the next higher frequency component at each step of the generative process, given all preceding (lower) frequency components. This is a soft version of <strong>autoregression in frequency space</strong>, or if you want to make it sound fancier, <strong>approximate spectral autoregression</strong>.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397">Rissanen et al. (2022)</a><sup id="fnref:heat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:heat" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> were the first to apply this kind of analysis to diffusion in the context of generative modelling (see §2.2 in the paper). Their work directly inspired this blog post.</p>

<p>In many popular formulations of diffusion, the corruption process does not just involve adding noise, but also rescaling the input to keep the total variance within a reasonable range (or constant, in the case of variance-preserving diffusion). I have largely ignored this so far, because it doesn’t materially change anything about the intuitive interpretation. Scaling the input simply results in the RAPSD shifting up or down a bit.</p>

<h3 id="-which-frequencies-are-modelled-at-which-noise-levels"><a name="quantitative"></a> Which frequencies are modelled at which noise levels?</h3>

<p>There seems to be a monotonic relationship between noise levels and spatial frequencies (and hence feature scales). Can we characterise this quantitatively?</p>

<p>We can try, but it is important to emphasise that this relationship is only really valid in expectation, averaged across many images: <strong>for individual images, the spectrum will not be a perfectly straight line, and it will not typically be monotonically decreasing</strong>.</p>

<p>Even if we ignore all that, the “elbow” of the hinge-shaped spectrum of a noisy image is not very sharp, so it is clear that there is quite a large transition zone where we cannot unequivocally say that a particular frequency is dominated by either signal or noise. So this is, at best, a very smooth approximation to the “hard” autoregression used in e.g. large language models.</p>

<p>Keeping all of that in mind, let us construct a mapping from noise levels to frequencies for a particular diffusion process and a particular image distribution, by choosing a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold, below which we will consider the signal to be undetectable. This choice is quite arbitrary, and we will just have to choose a value and stick with it. We can choose 1 to keep things simple, which means that we consider the signal to be detectable if its power is equal to or greater than the power of the noise.</p>

<p>Consider a Gaussian diffusion process for which \(\mathbf{x}_t = \alpha(t)\mathbf{x}_0 + \sigma(t) \mathbf{\varepsilon}\), with \(\mathbf{x}_0\) an example from the data distribution, and \(\mathbf{\varepsilon}\) standard Gaussian noise.</p>

<p>Let us define \(\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}](f)\) as the RAPSD of an image \(\mathbf{x}\) evaluated at frequency \(f\). We will call the SNR threshold \(\tau\). If we consider a particular time step \(t\), then assuming the RAPSD is monotonically decreasing, we can define the <strong>maximal detectable frequency</strong> \(f_\max\) at this time step in the process as the maximal value of \(f\) for which:</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\alpha(t)\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \tau \cdot \mathcal{R}[\sigma(t)\mathbf{\varepsilon}](f).\]

</p><p>Recall that the Fourier transform is a linear operator, and \(\mathcal{R}\) is a radial average of the square of its magnitude. Therefore, scaling the input to \(\mathcal{R}\) by a real value means the output gets scaled by its square. We can use this to simplify things:</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \tau \cdot \frac{\sigma(t)^2}{\alpha(t)^2} \mathcal{R}[\mathbf{\varepsilon}](f).\]

</p><p>We can further simplify this by noting that \(\forall f: \mathcal{R}[\mathbf{\varepsilon}](f) = 1\):</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \tau \cdot \frac{\sigma(t)^2}{\alpha(t)^2}.\]

</p><p>To construct such a mapping in practice, we first have to choose a diffusion process, which gives us the functional form of \(\sigma(t)\) and \(\alpha(t)\). To keep things simple, we can use the rectified flow<sup id="fnref:rectifiedflow" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rectifiedflow" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> / flow matching<sup id="fnref:flowmatching" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:flowmatching" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> process, as used in Stable Diffusion 3<sup id="fnref:sd3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sd3" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>, for which \(\sigma(t) = t\) and \(\alpha(t) = 1 - t\). Combined with \(\tau = 1\), this yields:</p><p>

\[\mathcal{R}[\mathbf{x}_0](f) &gt; \left(\frac{t}{1 - t}\right)^2.\]

</p><p>With these choices, we can now determine the shape of \(f_\max(t)\) and visualise it.</p>

<p>The frequencies here are relative: if the bandwidth of the signal is 1, then 0.5 corresponds to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>, i.e. the maximal frequency that is representable with the given bandwidth.</p>

<p>Note that all representable frequencies are detectable at time steps near 0. As \(t\) increases, so does the noise level, and hence \(f_\max\) starts dropping, until it eventually reaches 0 (no detectable signal frequencies are left) close to \(t = 1\).</p>

<p>All of the analysis above hinges on the fact that spectra of natural images typically follow a power law. Diffusion models have also been used to generate audio<sup id="fnref:wavegrad" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wavegrad" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:diffwave" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:diffwave" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, which is the other main perceptual modality besides the visual. A very natural question to ask is whether the same interpretation makes sense in the audio domain as well.</p>

<p>To establish that, we will grab a dataset of typical audio recordings that we might want to build a generative model of: speech and music.</p>

</figure>

<p>Along with each audio player, a <em>spectrogram</em> is shown: this is a time-frequency representation of the sound, which is obtained by applying the Fourier transform to short overlapping windows of the waveform and stacking the resulting magnitude vectors together in a 2D matrix.</p>

<p>For the purpose of comparing the spectrum of sound with that of images, we will use the 1-dimensional analogue of the RAPSD, which is simply the squared magnitude of the 1D Fourier transform.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/plot_sound_spectra.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/plot_sound_spectra.png" alt="Magnitude spectra of four audio clips from the GTZAN music/speech dataset."></a>
  <figcaption>Magnitude spectra of four audio clips from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lnicalo/gtzan-musicspeech-collection">GTZAN music/speech dataset</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are a lot noisier than the image spectra, which is not surprising as these are not averaged over directions, like the RAPSD is. But aside from that, they don’t really look like straight lines either – the power law shape is nowhere to be seen!</p>

<p>I won’t speculate about why images exhibit this behaviour and sound seemingly doesn’t, but it is certainly interesting (feel free to speculate away in the comments!). To get a cleaner view, we can again average the spectra of many clips in the log domain, as we did with the RAPSDs of images.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_spec.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/mean_log_spec.png" alt="The average of magnitude spectra of a set of audio clips the log-domain."></a>
  <figcaption>The average of magnitude spectra of a set of audio clips the log-domain.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Definitely not a power law. More importantly, it is not monotonic, so adding progressively more Gaussian noise to this does not obfuscate frequencies in descending order: <strong>the “diffusion is just spectral autoregression” meme does not apply to audio waveforms!</strong></p>

<p>The average spectrum of our dataset exhibits a peak around 300-400 Hz. This is not too far off the typical spectrum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise#Green_noise">green noise</a>, which has more energy in the region of 500 Hz. Green noise is supposed to sound like “the background noise of the world”.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/rising_tide_sound.gif"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/rising_tide_sound.gif" alt="Animation that shows the changing averaged magnitude spectrum as more and more noise is added to a set of audio clips."></a>
  <figcaption>Animation that shows the changing averaged magnitude spectrum as more and more noise is added to a set of audio clips.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the animation above shows, the different frequencies present in audio signals still get filtered out gradually from least powerful to most powerful, because the spectrum of Gaussian noise is still flat, just like in the image domain. But as the audio spectrum does not monotonically decay with increasing frequency, the order is not monotonic in terms of the frequencies themselves.</p>

<p>What does this mean for diffusion in the waveform domain? That’s not entirely clear to me. It certainly makes the link with autoregressive models weaker, but I’m not sure if there are any negative implications for generative modelling performance.</p>

<p>One observation that does perhaps indicate that this is the case, is that a lot of diffusion models of audio described in the literature <strong>do not operate directly in the waveform domain</strong>. It is quite common to first extract some form of spectrogram (as we did earlier), and perform diffusion in that space, essentially treating it like an image<sup id="fnref:hawthorne" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hawthorne" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:riffusion" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:riffusion" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:edmsound" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:edmsound" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>. Note that spectrograms are a somewhat lossy representation of sound, because <a href="https://sander.ai/2020/03/24/audio-generation.html#why-waveforms">phase information is typically discarded</a>.</p>

<p>To understand the implications of this for diffusion models, we will extract <strong>log-scaled mel-spectrograms</strong> from the sound clips we have used before. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale">mel scale</a> is a nonlinear frequency scale which is intended to be perceptually uniform, and which is very commonly used in spectral analysis of sound.</p>

<p>Next, we will interpret these spectrograms as images and look at their spectra. Taking the spectrum of a spectrum might seem odd – some of you might even suggest that it is pointless, because the Fourier transform is its own inverse! But note that there are a few nonlinear operations happening in between: taking the magnitude (discarding the phase information), mel-binning and log-scaling. As a result, this second Fourier transform doesn’t just undo the first one.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/plot_sound_melspec_rapsd.png"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/plot_sound_melspec_rapsd.png" alt="RAPSDs of mel-spectrograms of four audio clips from the GTZAN music/speech dataset."></a>

<p>It seems like the power law has resurfaced! We can look at the average in the log-domain again to get a smoother curve.</p>

</figure>

<p>I found this pretty surprising. I actually used to object quite strongly to the idea of treating spectrograms as images, as in this tweet in response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riffusion">Riffusion</a>, a variant of Stable Diffusion finetuned on spectrograms:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Me: "NOOO, you can't just treat spectrograms as images, the frequency and time axes have completely different semantics, there is no locality in frequency and ..."</p><p>These guys: "Stable diffusion go brrr" <a href="https://t.co/Akv8aZl8Rv">https://t.co/Akv8aZl8Rv</a></p></div>— Sander Dieleman (@sedielem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sedielem/status/1603412454427574279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2022</a></blockquote>


<p>… but I have always had to concede that it seems to work pretty well in practice, and perhaps the fact that spectrograms exhibit power-law spectra is one reason why.</p>

<p>There is also an interesting link with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum">mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)</a>, a popular feature representation for speech and music processing which predates the advent of deep learning. These features are constructed by taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">discrete cosine transform (DCT)</a> of a mel-spectrogram. The resulting spectrum-of-a-spectrum is often referred to as the <strong>cepstrum</strong>.</p>

<p>So with this approach, perhaps the meme applies to sound after all, albeit with a slight adjustment: <strong>diffusion on spectrograms is just cepstral autoregression</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="-unstable-equilibrium"><a name="unstable-equilibrium"></a> Unstable equilibrium</h2>

<figure>
  <a href="https://sander.ai/images/spinningtop.jpg"><img src="https://sander.ai/images/spinningtop.jpg"></a>
</figure>

<p>So far, we have talked about a spectral perspective on diffusion, but we have not really discussed how it can be used to explain why diffusion works so well for images. The fact that this interpretation is possible for images, but not for some other domains, does not automatically imply that the method should also work better.</p>

<p>However, it does mean that the diffusion loss, which is a weighted average across all noise levels, is also implicitly a weighted average over all spatial frequencies in the image domain. Being able to individually weight these frequencies in the loss according to their relative importance is key, because the sensitivity of the human visual system to particular frequencies varies greatly. <strong>This effectively makes the diffusion training objective a kind of perceptual loss</strong>, and I believe it largely explains the success of diffusion models in the visual domain (together with <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/08/28/geometry.html">classifier-free guidance</a>).</p>

<p>Going beyond images, one could use the same line of reasoning to try and understand why diffusion models <em>haven’t</em> really caught on in the domain of language modelling so far (I wrote more about this <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/01/09/diffusion-language.html">last year</a>). The interpretation in terms of a frequency decomposition is not really applicable there, and hence being able to change the relative weighting of noise levels in the loss doesn’t quite have the same impact on the quality of generated outputs.</p>

<p>For language modelling, autoregression is currently the dominant modelling paradigm, and while diffusion-based approaches have been making inroads recently<sup id="fnref:ratios" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ratios" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:sahoo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sahoo" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:shi" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:shi" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>, a full-on takeover does not look like it is in the cards in the short term.</p>

<p>This results in the following status quo: <strong>we use autoregression for language, and we use diffusion for pretty much everything else</strong>. Of course, I realise that I have just been arguing that these two approaches are not all that different in spirit. But in practice, their implementations can look quite different, and a lot of knowledge and experience that practitioners have built up is specific to each paradigm.</p>

<p>To me, this feels like an <strong>unstable equilibrium, because the future is multimodal</strong>. We will ultimately want models that natively understand language, images, sound and other modalities mixed together. Grafting these two different modelling paradigms together to construct multimodal models is effective to some extent, and certainly interesting from a research perspective, but it brings with it an increased level of complexity (i.e. having to master two different modelling paradigms) which I don’t believe practitioners will tolerate in the long run.</p>

<p>So in the longer term, it seems plausible that we could go back to using autoregression across all modalities, perhaps borrowing some ideas from diffusion in the process<sup id="fnref:var" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:var" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:arnovq" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:arnovq" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>. Alternatively, we might figure out how to build multimodal diffusion models for all modalities, including language. I don’t know which it is going to be, but both of those outcomes ultimately seem more likely than the current situation persisting.</p>

<p>One might ask, if diffusion is really just approximate autoregression in frequency space, why not just do exact autoregression in frequency space instead, and maybe that will work just as well? That would mean we can use autoregression across all modalities, and resolve the “instability” in one go. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03841">Nash et al. (2021)</a><sup id="fnref:dctransformer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dctransformer" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02905">Tian et al. (2024)</a><sup id="fnref:var:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:var" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19997">Mattar et al. (2024)</a><sup id="fnref:wavelets" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wavelets" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> explore this direction.</p>

<p>There is a good reason not to take this shortcut, however: the diffusion sampling procedure is exceptionally flexible, in ways that autoregressive sampling is not. For example, the number of sampling steps can be chosen at test time (this isn’t impossible for autoregressive models, but it is much less straightforward to achieve). This flexibility also enables <a href="https://sander.ai/2024/02/28/paradox.html">various distillation methods</a> to reduce the number of steps required, and <a href="https://sander.ai/2023/08/28/geometry.html">classifier-free guidance</a> to improve sample quality. Before we do anything rash and ditch diffusion altogether, we will probably want to figure out a way to avoid having to give up some of these benefits.</p>

<p>When I first had a closer look at the spectra of real images myself, I realised that the link between diffusion models and autoregressive models is even stronger than I had originally thought – in the image domain, at least. This is ultimately why I decided to write this blog post in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1siywvhvl1OxI1UmqRrJHiFUK0M5SHlcx">a notebook</a>, to make it easier for others to see this for themselves as well. More broadly speaking, I find that learning by “doing” has a much more lasting effect than learning by reading, and hopefully making this post interactive can help with that.</p>

<p>There are of course many other ways to connect the two modelling paradigms of diffusion and autoregression, which I won’t go into here, but it is becoming a rather popular topic of inquiry<sup id="fnref:rolling" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rolling" rel="footnote">20</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fifo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fifo" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:forcing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:forcing" rel="footnote">22</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this post, I strongly recommend also reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397">Rissanen et al. (2022)</a>’s paper on generative modelling with inverse heat dissipation<sup id="fnref:heat:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:heat" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, which inspired it.</p>

<p>This blog-post-in-a-notebook was an experiment, so any feedback on the format is very welcome! It’s a bit more work, but hopefully some readers will derive some benefit from it. If there are enough of you, perhaps I will do more of these in the future. <strong>Please share your thoughts in the comments!</strong></p>

<p>I am making steady progress towards moving the <em>Computers Are Bad</em> enterprise
cloud to its new home, here in New Mexico. One of the steps in this process is,
of course, purchasing a new server... the current Big Iron is getting rather
old (probably about a decade!)  and here in town I'll have the rack space for
more machines anyway.</p>
<p>In our modern, cloud-centric industry, it is rare that I find myself comparing
the specifications of a Dell PowerEdge against an HP ProLiant. Because the
non-hyperscale server market has increasingly consolidated around Intel
specifications and reference designs, it is even rarer that there is much of a
difference between the major options.</p>
<p>This brings back to mind one of those ancient questions that comes up among
computer novices and becomes a writing prompt for technology bloggers. What
<em>is</em> a server? Is it just, like, a big computer? Or is it actually special?</p>
<p>There's a lot of industrial history wrapped up in that question, and the answer
is often very context-specific. But there are some generalizations we can make
about the history of the server: client-server computing originated mostly as
an evolution of time-sharing computing using multiple terminals connected to a
single computer. There was no expectation that terminals had a similar
architecture to computers (and indeed they were usually vastly simpler
machines), and that attitude carried over to client-server systems. The PC
revolution instilled a WinTel monoculture in much of client-side computing by
the mid-'90s, but it remained common into the '00s for servers to run entirely
different operating systems and architectures.</p>
<p>The SPARC and Solaris combination was very common for servers, as were IBM's
minicomputer architectures and their numerous operating systems. Indeed, one of
the key commercial contributions of Java was the way it allowed enterprise
applications to be written for a Solaris/SPARC backend while enabling code
reuse for clients that ran on either stalwarts like Unix/RISC or "modern"
business computing environments like Windows/x86. This model was sometimes
referred to as client-server computing with "thick clients." It preserved the
differentiation between "server" and "client" as classes of machines, and the
universal adherance of serious business software to this model lead to an
association between server platforms and "enterprise computing."</p>
<p>Over time, things have changed, as they always do. Architectures that had been
relegated to servers became increasingly niche and struggled to compete with
the PC architecture on cost and performance. The general architecture of server
software shifted away from vertical scaling and high-uptime systems to
horizontal scaling with relaxed reliability requirements, taking away much of
the advantage of enterprise-class computers. For the most part, today, a server
is just a big computer. There are some distinguishing features: servers are far
more likely to be SMP or NUMA, with multiple processor sockets. While the days
of SAS and hardware RAID are increasingly behind us, servers continue to have
more complex storage controllers and topologies than clients. And servers,
almost by definition, offer some sort of out of band management.</p>
<p>Out-of-band management, sometimes also called lights-out management, identifies
a capability that is almost unheard of in clients. A separate, smaller
management computer allows for remote access to a server even when it is, say,
powered off. The terms out-of-band and in-band in this context emerge from
their customery uses in networking and telecom, meaning that out of band
management is performed without the use of the standard (we might say "data
plane") network connection to a machine. But in practice they have drifted in
meaning, and it is probably better to think of out-of-band management as
meaning that the <em>operating system and general-purpose components are not
required.</em> This might be made clearer by comparison: a very standard example of
in-band management would be SSH, a service provided by the software on a
computer that allows you to interact with it. Out-of-band management, by
contrast, is provided by a dedicated hardware and software stack and does not
require the operating system or, traditionally, even the CPU to cooperate.</p>
<p>You can imagine that this is a useful capability. Today, out-of-band management
is probably best exemplified by the remote console that most servers offer.
It's basically an embedded IP KVM, allowing you to interact with the machine as
if you were at a locally connected monitor and keyboard. A lot of OOB
management products also offer "virtual media," where you can upload an ISO
file to the management interface and then have it appear to the computer proper
as if it were a physical device. This is extremely useful for installing
operating systems.</p>
<p>OOB management is an interesting little corner of computer history. It's not a
new idea at all; in fact, similar capabilities can be found through pretty much
the entire history of business computing. If anything, it's gotten simpler and
more boring over time. A few evenings ago I was watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1NxcgasTIU">clabretro
video</a> about an IBM p5 he's gotten
working. As is the case in most of his videos about servers, he has to give a
brief explanation of the multiple layers of lower-level management systems
present in the p5 and their various textmode and web interfaces.</p>
<p>If we constrain our discussion of "servers" to relatively modern machines,
starting say in the late '80s or early '90s, there are some common features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some sort of local operator interface (this term itself being a very old
one), like an LCD matrix display or grid of LED indicators, providing low-level
information on hardware health.</li>
<li>A serial console with access to the early bootloader and a persistent
low-level management system.</li>
<li>A higher-level management system, with a variable position in the stack
depending on architecture, for remote management of the machine workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this stuff still hangs around today. Most servers can tell you on the
front panel if a redundant component like a fan or power supply has failed,
although the number of components that are redundant and can be replaced online
has dwindled with time from "everything up to and including CPUs" on '90s
prestige architectures to sometimes little more than fans. Serial management is
still pretty common, mostly as a holdover of being a popular way to do OS
installation and maintenance on headless machines [1].</p>
<p>But for the most part, OOB management has consolidated in the exact same way as
processor architecture: onto Intel IPMI.</p>
<p>IPMI is confusing to some people for a couple of reasons. First, IPMI is a
specification, not an implementation. Most major vendors have their own
implementation of IPMI, often with features above and beyond the core IPMI
spec, and they call them weird acronyms like HP iLO and Dell DRAC. These
vendor-specific implementations often predate IPMI, too, so it's never quite
right to say they are "just IPMI." They're independent systems with IPMI
characteristics. On the other hand, more upstart manufacturers are more likely
to just call it IPMI, in which case it may just be the standard offering from
their firmware vendor.</p>
<p>Further confusing matters is a fair amount of terminological overlap. The IPMI
software runs on a processor conventionally called the baseboard management
controller or BMC, and the terms IPMI and BMC are sometimes used
interchangeably. Lights-out management or LOM is mostly an obsolete term but
sticks around because HP(E) is a fan of it and continues to call their IPMI
implementation Integrated Lights-Out. The BMC should not be confused with the
System Management Controller or SMC, which is one of a few terms used for a
component present in client computers to handle tasks like fan speed control.
These have an interrelated history and, indeed, the BMC handles those functions
in most servers.</p>
<p>IPMI also specifies two interfaces: an out-of-band interface available over the
network or a serial connection, and an in-band interface available to the
operating system via a driver (and, in practice, I believe communication
between the CPU and the baseboard management controller via the low-pin-count
or LPC bus, which is a weird little holdover of ISA present in most modern
computers). The result is that you can interact with the IPMI from a tool
running in the operating system, like ipmitool on Linux. That makes it a little
confusing what exactly is going on, if you don't understand that the IPMI is a
completely independent system that has a local interface to the running
operating system for convenience.</p>
<p>What does the IPMI actually <em>do?</em> Well, like most things, it's mostly become a
webapp. Web interfaces are just too convenient to turn down, so while a lot of
IPMI products do have dedicated client software, they're porting all the
features into an embedded web application. The quality of these web interfaces
varies widely but is mostly not very good. That raises a question, of course,
of how you <em>get</em> to the IPMI web interface.</p>
<p>Most servers on the market have a dedicated ethernet interface for the IPMI,
often labelled "IPMI" or "management" or something like that. Most people would
agree that the best way to use IPMI is to put the management network interface
onto a dedicated physical network, for reasons of both security and reliability
(IPMI should remain accessible even in case of performance or reliability
problems with your main network). A dedicated physical network costs time,
space, and money, though, so there are compromises. For one, your "management
network" is very likely to be a VLAN on your normal network equipment. That's
sort of like what AT&amp;T calls a common-carrier switching arrangement, meaning
that it behaves like an independent, private network but shares all of the
actual equipment with everything else, the isolation being implemented in
software. That was a weird comparison to make and I probably just need to write
a whole article on CCSAs like I've been meaning to.</p>
<p>Even that approach requires extra cabling, though, so IPMI offers "sideband"
networking. With sideband management, the BMC communicates directly with the
same NIC that the operating system uses. The implementation is a little bit
weird: the NIC will pretend to be two different interfaces, mixing IPMI traffic
into the same packet stream as host traffic but using a <em>different MAC
address.</em> This way, it appears to other network equipment as if there are two
different network interfaces in use, as usual. I will leave judgment as to how
good of an idea this is to you, but there are obvious security considerations
around reducing the segregation between IPMI and application traffic.</p>
<p>And yes, it should be said, a lot of IPMI implementations have proven to be
security nightmares. They should never be accessible to any untrusted person.</p>
<p>Details of network features vary between IPMI implementations, but there is a
standard interface on UDP 623 that can be used for discovery and basic
commands. There's often SSH and a web interface, and VNC is pretty common for
remote console.</p>
<p>There are some neat basic functions you can perform with the IPMI, either over
the network or locally using an in-band IPMI client. A useful one, if you are
forgetful and keep poor records like I do, is listing the hardware modules
making up the machine at an FRU or vendor part number level. You can also
interact with basic hardware functions like sensors, power state, fans, etc.
IPMI offers a standard watchdog timer, which can be combined with software
running on the operating system to ensure that the server will be reset if
the application gets into an unhealthy state. You should set a long enough
timeout to allow the system to boot and for you to connect and disable the
watchdog timer, ask me how I know.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I thought to write about IPMI is its strange relationship to
the world of everyday client computers. IPMI is very common in enterprise
servers but very rare elsewhere, much to the consternation of people like me
that don't have the space or noise tolerance for a 1U pizzabox in their homes.
If you are trying to stick to compact or low-power computers, you'll pretty
much have to go without.</p>
<p>But then, there's kind of a weird exception. What about Intel ME and AMD ST?
These are essentially OOB management controllers that are present in virtually
all Intel and AMD processors. This is kind of an odd story. Intel ME, the
Management Engine, is an enabling component of Intel Active Management
Technology (Intel AMT). AMT was pretty much an attempt at popularizing OOB
management for client machines, and offers most of the same capabilities as
IPMI. It has been considerably less successful. Most of that is probably due to
pricing, Intel has limited almost all AMT features to use with their very
costly enterprise management platforms. Perhaps there is some industry in which
these sell well, but I am apparently not in it. There are open-source AMT
clients, but the next problem you will run into is finding a machine where AMT
is actually usable.</p>
<p>The fact that Intel AMT has sideband management capability, and that therefore
the Intel ME component on which AMT runs has sideband management capability,
was the topic of quite some consternation in the security community. Here is a
mitigating factor: sideband management is only possible if the processor,
motherboard chipset, and NIC are all AMT-capable. Options for all three devices
are limited to Intel products with the vPro badge. The unpopularity of Intel
NICs in consumer devices alone means that sideband access is rarely possible.
vPro is also limited to relatively high-end processors and chipsets. The bad
news is that you will have a hard time using AMT in your homelab, although some
people certainly do. The upside is that the widely-reported "fact" that Intel
ME is accessible via sideband networking on consumer devices is typically
untrue, and for reasons beyond Intel software licensing.</p>
<p>That leaves an odd question around Intel ME itself, though, which is certainly
OOB management-like but doesn't really have any OOB management features without
AMT. So why do nearly all processors have it? Well, this is somewhat
speculative, but the impression I get is that Intel ME exists mostly as a
convenient way to host and manage trusted execution components that are used
for things like Secure Boot and DRM. These features all run on the same
processor as ME and share some common technology stack. The "management"
portion of Intel ME is thus largely vestigial, and it's part of the secure
computing infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is not to make excuses for Intel ME, which is entirely unauditable by
third parties and has harbored significant security vulnerabilities in the
past. But, remember, we all use one processor architecture from one of two
vendors, so Intel doesn't have a whole lot of motivation to do better. Lest
you respond that ARM is the way, remember that modern ARM SOCs used in
consumer devices have pretty much identical capabilities.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>[1] The definition of "headless" is sticky and we have to not get stuck on it
too much. People tend to say "headless" to mean no monitor and keyboard
attached, but keep in mind that slide-out rack consoles and IP KVMs have been
common for a long time and so in non-hyperscale environments truly headless
machines are rarer than you would think. Part of this is because using a serial
console is a monumental pain in the ass, so your typical computer operator will
do a lot to avoid dealing with it. Before LCD displays, this meant a CRT and
keyboard on an Anthro cart with wheels, but now that we are an enlightened
society, you can cram a whole monitor and keyboard into 1U and get a KVM
switching fabric that can cover the whole rack. Or swap cables. Mostly swap
cables.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 02:47:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/">https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41430772">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>When I‘m working on maintaining an unfamiliar codebase, I will spend a lot of
time grepping the code base for strings. Even in projects exclusively written
by myself, I have to search a lot: function names, error messages,
class names, that kind of thing. If I can‘t find what I‘m looking for, it‘ll
be frustrating in the best case, or in the worst case lead to dangerous
situations where I‘ll assume a thing is not needed anymore, since I can‘t find
any references to it in the code base. From these situations, I‘ve derived some
rules you can apply to keep your code base greppable:</p>
<h2 id="dont-split-up-identifiers">Don‘t split up identifiers</h2>
<p>It turns out that splitting up, or dynamically constructing identifiers is a
bad idea.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two database tables <code>shipping_addresses</code>, <code>billing_addresses</code>,
it might seem like a perfectly good solution to construct the table name
dynamically from the order type.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getTableName</span><span> =</span><span> (addressType</span><span>:</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span> |</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> `${</span><span>addressType</span><span>}_addresses`</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Though it looks nice and DRY, it‘s not great for maintainenance: someone will
inevitably search the code base for the table name <code>shipping_addresses</code> and
miss this occurence.</p>
<p>Refactored for greppability:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getTableName</span><span> =</span><span> (addressType</span><span>:</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span> |</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>addressType</span><span> ===</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>        return</span><span> 'shipping_addresses'</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>addressType</span><span> ===</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>        return</span><span> 'billing_addresses'</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    throw</span><span> new</span><span> TypeError</span><span>(</span><span>'addressType must be billing or shipping'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The same goes for column names, object fields, and, god forbid, method/function
names (it‘s easily possible to dynamically construct method names with javascript).</p>
<h2 id="use-the-same-names-for-things-across-the-stack">Use the same names for things across the stack</h2>
<p>Don‘t rename fields at application boundaries to match naming schemes. An obvious
example is then importing postgres-style snake_case identifiers into
javascript, then converting them to camelCase. This makes it harder to
find—you now have to grep for two strings instead of one in order to find all
occurences!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getAddress</span><span> =</span><span> async</span><span> (id</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    const</span><span> address</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> getAddressById</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>        streetName: </span><span>address</span><span>.</span><span>street_name</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        zipCode: </span><span>address</span><span>.</span><span>zip_code</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You‘re better off biting the bullet and returning the object directly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getAddress</span><span> =</span><span> async</span><span> (id</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> await</span><span> getAddressById</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="flat-is-better-than-nested">Flat is better than nested</h2>
<p>Taking inspiration from the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>,
when dealing with namespaces, flattening your folders/object structures is mostly better
than nesting.</p>
<p>For example if you have two choices to set up your translation files:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>        "login"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>            "title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        },</span></span>
<span><span>        "register"</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>            "title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Register"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        }</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>take the second option! You will be able to easily find your keys now, which
you are probably referring to as something like <code>t('auth.login.title')</code>.</p>
<p>Or consider React component structure: a component stucture like</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>./components/AttributeFilterCombobox.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterDialog.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterRating.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterSelect.tsx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>is preferable to</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Combobox.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Dialog.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Rating.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Select.tsx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>from a greppability perspective, since you‘ll be able to grep for the
whole namespaced component <code>AttributeFilterCombobox</code> just from the usage, as
opposed to just <code>Dialog</code>, which you might have multiple of accross your
application.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>A decade ago, federal officials drafted a plan to discourage Medicare Advantage health insurers from overcharging the government by billions of dollars — only to abruptly back off amid an “uproar” from the industry, newly released court filings show.</p>



<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services published the draft regulation in January 2014. The rule would have required health plans, when examining patient’s medical records, to identify overpayments by CMS and refund them to the government.</p>



<p>But in May 2014, CMS dropped the idea without any public explanation. Newly released court depositions show that agency officials repeatedly cited concern about pressure from the industry.</p>



<p>The 2014 decision by CMS, and events related to it, are at the center of a multibillion-dollar Justice Department civil fraud case against UnitedHealth Group pending in federal court in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>The Justice Department alleges the giant health insurer cheated Medicare out of more than $2 billion by reviewing patients’ records to find additional diagnoses, adding revenue while ignoring overcharges that might reduce bills. The company “buried its head in the sand and did nothing but keep the money,” DOJ said in a court filing.</p>



<p>Medicare pays health plans higher rates for sicker patients but requires that the plans bill only for conditions that are properly documented in a patient’s medical records.</p>



<p>In a court filing, UnitedHealth Group denies wrongdoing and argues it shouldn’t be penalized for “failing to follow a rule that CMS considered a decade ago but declined to adopt.”</p>



<p>This month, the parties in the court case made public thousands of pages of depositions and other records that offer a rare glimpse inside the Medicare agency’s long-running struggle to keep the private health plans from taking taxpayers for a multibillion-dollar ride.</p>



<p>“It’s easy to dump on Medicare Advantage plans, but CMS made a complete boondoggle out of this,” said Richard Lieberman, a Colorado health data analytics expert.</p>



<p>Spokespeople for the Justice Department and CMS declined to comment for this article. In an email, UnitedHealth Group spokesperson Heather Soule said the company’s “business practices have always been transparent, lawful and compliant with CMS regulations.”</p>

<p><strong>Missed Diagnoses</strong></p>



<p>Medicare Advantage insurance plans have grown explosively in recent years and now <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2024-enrollment-update-and-key-trends/">enroll about 33 million members</a>, more than half of people eligible for Medicare. Along the way, the industry has been the target of dozens of whistleblower lawsuits, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/audits-hidden-until-now-reveal-millions-in-medicare-advantage-overcharges/">government audits</a>, and other investigations alleging the health plans often exaggerate how sick patients are to rake in undeserved Medicare payments — including by doing what are called chart reviews, intended to find allegedly missed diagnosis codes.</p>



<p>By 2013, CMS officials knew some Medicare health plans were hiring medical coding and analytics consultants to aggressively mine patient files — but they doubted the agency’s authority to demand that health plans also look for and delete unsupported diagnoses.</p>



<p>The proposed January 2014 regulation mandated that chart reviews “cannot be designed only to identify diagnoses that would trigger additional payments” to health plans.</p>



<p>CMS officials backed down in May 2014 because of “stakeholder concern and pushback,” Cheri Rice, then director of the CMS Medicare plan payment group, testified in a 2022 deposition made public this month. A second CMS official, Anne Hornsby, described the industry’s reaction as an “uproar.”</p>



<p>Exactly who made the call to withdraw the chart review proposal isn’t clear from court filings so far.</p>



<p>“The direction that we received was that the rule, the final rule, needed to include only those provisions that had wide, you know, widespread stakeholder support,” Rice testified.</p>



<p>“So we did not move forward then,” she said. “Not because we didn’t think it was the right thing to do or the right policy, but because it had mixed reactions from stakeholders.”</p>



<p>The CMS press office declined to make Rice available for an interview. Hornsby, who has since left the agency, declined to comment.</p>



<p>But Erin Fuse Brown, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, said the decision reflects a pattern of timid CMS oversight of the popular health plans for seniors.</p>



<p>“CMS saving money for taxpayers isn’t enough of a reason to face the wrath of very powerful health plans,” Fuse Brown said.</p>



<p>“That is extremely alarming.”</p>



<p><strong>Invalid Codes</strong></p>



<p>The fraud case against UnitedHealth Group, which runs the nation’s largest Medicare Advantage plan, was filed in 2011 by a former company employee. The DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-intervenes-false-claims-act-lawsuit-against-unitedhealth-group-inc-mischarging">took over</a> the whistleblower suit in 2017.</p>



<p>DOJ alleges Medicare paid the insurer more than $7.2 billion from 2009 through 2016 solely based on chart reviews; the company would have received $2.1 billion less if it had deleted unsupported billing codes, the government says.</p>



<p>The government argues that UnitedHealth Group knew that many conditions it had billed for were not supported by medical records but chose to pocket the overpayments. For instance, the insurer billed Medicare nearly $28,000 in 2011 to treat a patient for cancer, congestive heart failure, and other serious health problems that weren’t recorded in the person’s medical record, DOJ alleged in a 2017 filing.</p>



<p>In all, DOJ contends that UnitedHealth Group should have deleted more than 2 million invalid codes.</p>



<p>Instead, company executives signed annual statements attesting that the billing data submitted to CMS was “accurate, complete, and truthful.” Those actions violated the False Claims Act, a federal law that makes it illegal to submit bogus bills to the government, DOJ alleges.</p>



<p>The complex case has featured years of legal jockeying, even pitting the recollections of key CMS staff members — including several who have since departed government for jobs in the industry — against those of UnitedHealthcare executives.</p>



<p><strong>‘Red Herring’</strong></p>



<p>Court filings describe a 45-minute video conference arranged by then-CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner on April 29, 2014. Tavenner testified she set up the meeting between UnitedHealth and CMS staff at the request of Larry Renfro, a senior UnitedHealth Group executive, to discuss implications of the draft rule. Neither Tavenner nor Renfro attended.</p>



<p>Two UnitedHealth Group executives on the call said in depositions that CMS staffers told them the company had no obligation at the time to uncover erroneous codes. One of the executives, Steve Nelson, called it a “very clear answer” to the question. Nelson has since left the company.</p>



<p>For their part, four of the five CMS staffers on the call said in depositions that they didn’t remember what was said. Unlike the company’s team, none of the government officials took detailed notes.</p>



<p>“All I can tell you is I remember feeling very uncomfortable in the meeting,” Rice said in her 2022 deposition.</p>



<p>Yet Rice and one other CMS staffer said they did recall reminding the executives that even without the chart review rule, the company was obligated to make a good-faith effort to bill only for verified codes — or face possible penalties under the False Claims Act. And CMS officials reinforced that view in follow-up emails, according to court filings.</p>



<p>DOJ called the flap over the ill-fated regulation a “red herring” in a court filing and alleges that when UnitedHealth asked for the April 2014 meeting, it knew its chart reviews had been under investigation for two years. In addition, the company was “grappling with a projected $500 million budget deficit,” according to DOJ.</p>



<p><strong>Data Miners</strong></p>



<p>Medicare Advantage plans defend chart reviews against criticism that they do little but artificially inflate the government’s costs.</p>



<p>“Chart reviews are one of many tools Medicare Advantage plans use to support patients, identify chronic conditions, and prevent those conditions from becoming more serious,” said Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, a health insurance trade group.</p>



<p>Whistleblowers have argued that the <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/health/home-is-where-the-money-is-for-medicare-advantage-plans/">cottage industry</a> of analytics firms and coders that sprang up to conduct these reviews pitched their services as a huge moneymaking exercise for health plans — and little else.</p>



<p>“It was never legitimate,” said William Hanagami, a California attorney who represented whistleblower James Swoben in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities">2009 case</a> that alleged chart reviews improperly inflated Medicare payments. In a <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/08/10/13-56746.pdf">2016 decision</a>, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that health plans must exercise “due diligence” to ensure they submit accurate data.</p>



<p>Since then, other insurers have settled DOJ allegations that they billed Medicare for unconfirmed diagnoses stemming from chart reviews. In July 2023, Martin’s Point Health Plan, a Portland, Maine, insurer, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/martins-point-health-care-inc-pay-22485000-resolve-false-claims-act-allegations">paid $22,485,000</a> to settle whistleblower allegations that it improperly billed for conditions ranging from diabetes with complications to morbid obesity. The plan denied any liability.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-17-00470.pdf">December 2019 report</a> by the Health and Human Services Inspector General found that 99% of chart reviews added new medical diagnoses at a cost to Medicare of an estimated $6.7 billion for 2017 alone.</p>

   <p>An Iranian writer and activist has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after replying with a single dot, or period, in response to a post on the social platform X by Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>   <p>Hossein Shanbehzadeh, a longtime critic of Iran’s leadership, was active on social media, supporting political prisoners and the removal of mandatory headscarves for women. He was sent to prison in 2019 for his online comments insulting Khamenei. He later wrote about the experience, including <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-judiciary-alleges-activist-has-ties-to-israeli-spy-agency/7648312.html">being flogged</a>, according to Voice of America.</p>   <p>In early June, 35-year-old Shanbehadeh was arrested in Ardabil, northwestern Iran. According to <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-blogger-detained-period-ayatollah/32980810.html">Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</a>, he told his family he wasn’t sure why he was arrested, but it came shortly after he posted the response to Khamenei’s tweet, which showed the Iranian leader with the country’s national volleyball team.</p>   
   <div id="res1798200454083473901" aria-label="Tweet">

   <p>Shanbehzadeh is just the latest activist to be caught up in the hard-line government’s crackdown on critics. Iran watchers say the leadership has felt insecure about the high level of dissent in the country for a while. Artists, playwrights, directors and others are also being swept up and given long prison sentences. In late April, Iranian rapper <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248245576/iranian-rapper-receives-death-sentence-for-songs-criticizing-the-establishment" target="1248245576">Toomaj Salehi</a> was handed the death sentence for his antigovernment videos.</p>   <p>Shanbehzadeh was sentenced to five years for alleged pro-Israel propaganda activity, four years for insulting Islamic sanctities, two years for spreading lies online and an additional year for anti-regime propaganda.</p>   <p>His lawyer, Amir Raisian, told Shargh Network, a reformist newspaper in Iran, that he would appeal the verdict, especially the accusation of pro-Israel activity. The prosecutor’s office in Ardabil alleged that Shanbehzadeh had been in contact with Israeli intelligence officers and was arrested when trying to leave the country, according to Voice of America.</p>

Past research has explored control loss through experimental manipulations, but questions remain about the ecological validity of these findings. This study, led by Wiktor Soral and colleagues, aimed to address these concerns by investigating the real-world implications of prolonged unemployment—a situation that severely threatens personal control.</p><p>Unemployment is a significant stressor with far-reaching impacts on mental health. It strips individuals of both the explicit benefits of employment, such as income, and the implicit ones, like structured time and social connections. Building on this understanding, Soral and colleagues focused on how prolonged unemployment might alter psychological functioning and social adaptation. Specifically, they explored whether these changes manifest as disengagement and helplessness, or if there are attempts to regain lost control.</p><p>The study involved a sample of 1,055 Polish participants, with 748 unemployed individuals and 307 employed individuals serving as a control group. The unemployed participants were categorized based on the length of their unemployment: short-term (0-3 months), medium-term (4-12 months), and long-term (over 12 months).</p><p>The survey collected demographic information, including age, gender, education level, and place of residence. Participants completed a variety of measures to assess well-being, self-esteem, perceived control (personal, political, and fatalistic), emotions, stress coping strategies, and social attitudes. The study also examined variables that could indicate control regaining efforts, such as active coping and collective action, as well as those suggesting disengagement, like withdrawal and anti-democratic beliefs. Data collection occurred in two parts, with participants completing the second part of the survey within two weeks of the first. Only participants who completed both parts were included in the final analysis, resulting in a total of 854 participants.</p><p>Soral and colleagues found that prolonged unemployment is strongly associated with a decline in well-being and self-esteem, alongside an increased perception of personal and fatalistic control loss. As unemployment duration lengthened, participants reported more negative emotions, particularly those related to low-approach and avoidance, such as feeling depressed or frightened.</p><p>They also exhibited fewer positive emotions, especially those linked to active engagement like enthusiasm. This emotional disengagement was accompanied by a significant reduction in active stress coping strategies and a decrease in the pursuit of personal projects and future-oriented goals. The findings suggest that long-term unemployment fosters a sense of learned helplessness, where individuals become increasingly demotivated and pessimistic about their ability to regain control over their lives.</p><p>Socially, the study revealed that long-term unemployed individuals are more likely to disengage from social and political activities. They reported lower levels of national identification and a reduced likelihood of participating in collective actions, such as protests. Additionally, these individuals exhibited higher levels of psychological defensiveness, including increased individual and collective narcissism, and a greater tendency to blame external entities, like governments or corporations, for their unemployment.</p><p>Interestingly, the study did not find evidence that these individuals turned to external sources of control, such as belief in an intervening God or system justification, suggesting that while they become more defensive and disengaged, they do not necessarily seek comfort or control through external systems.</p><p>One limitation noted by the authors is the cross-sectional nature of the study, which prevents establishing causality.</p><p>The study, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12967">Prolonged unemployment is associated with control loss and personal as well as social disengagement</a>”, was authored by Wiktor Soral, Marcin Bukowski, Michał Bilewicz, Aleksandra Cichocka, Karol Lewczuk, Marta Marchlewska, Aleksandra Rabinovitch, Anna Rędzio, Magdalena Skrodzka, and Mirosław Kofta.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article"> <p>It’s a quiet Saturday afternoon. I’ve carved out a few precious hours for coding, armed with a steaming cup of coffee and the familiar urge to dive into a project. As I settle into my chair and open my terminal, I’m confronted with a challenge that’s become all too familiar: deciding which of my many unfinished projects to tackle.</p>
<p>I navigate to my project directory, greeted by a graveyard of half-implemented ideas and stalled works-in-progress. Each one represents a different problem I’ve tried to solve, a different technology I’ve attempted to master. They’re all interesting, each with its own purpose and potential. But as I scan through them, I can already feel my enthusiasm waning. I know that whichever one I choose, I’ll be facing not just the original problem, but a hydra of new challenges that have sprouted since I last looked at the code.</p>
<p>After some deliberation, I make my choice and fire up my IDE. As I pull the latest changes and begin the archaeological dig through my commit history, I brace myself for what I know I’ll find. Sure enough, there it is: an unfinished frontend task, more wireframe than polished UI. Or perhaps it’s a library integration that’s hitting limitations I hadn’t anticipated. Or, in classic over-engineering fashion, I’ve built a complex architecture for a problem that could have been solved with a simple script.</p>
<p>I roll up my sleeves and dive in, determined to make progress. The next couple of hours fly by in a flurry of activity—refactoring code, debugging integration issues, or wrestling with CSS to get that one component to align just right. Before I know it, my allocated time is up.</p>
<p>As I prepare to step away from my desk, I can’t shake a feeling of frustration. I started the session full of optimism, ready to make significant headway. Now, I’m left with a nagging sense of inadequacy. Despite my efforts, it feels like I’ve barely moved the needle. The codebase is still a maze of TODO comments and half-implemented features. The Hydra of software development has grown two new heads for every one I managed to address.</p>
<p>This cycle of enthusiasm, struggle, and disappointment has become all too familiar. It’s the Hydra Project Effect: no matter how much progress I make, new challenges always seem to sprout in their place. But while this pattern may seem unbreakable, I’m determined to find a way to tame this beast. In this post, I’ll explore strategies for breaking out of this cycle of endless beginnings and unsatisfying middles. It’s time to learn the art of finishing, to slay this Hydra once and for all, and to finally experience the satisfaction of a completed project.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bytedrum.com/_astro/project-hydra.DXkDZcWk_1DYUan.svg" alt="My Hydra looks amazing, I am fantastic at drawing" width="662" height="896" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="the-allure-of-the-endless-project">The Allure of the Endless Project</h2>
<p>There’s a certain comfort in the realm of infinite possibility. When a project is ongoing, it can be anything. It’s Schrödinger’s<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-schrodinger" id="user-content-fnref-schrodinger" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> project—simultaneously perfect and flawed until you actually finish it and put it out into the world. The moment you declare a project “done,” you open it up to criticism, both external and internal. What if it’s not good enough? What if I missed something crucial?</p>
<p>This fear of finality, combined with the excitement of new ideas, creates an ideal environment for project procrastination. It’s always easier to start something new than to push through the final, often tedious stages of completion of a project. But there’s more to it than just fear.</p>
<p>An unfinished project is full of intoxicating <em>potential</em>. It could be the next big thing, a revolutionary idea, or your magnum opus. This potential often feels more exciting than the reality of a finished product. There’s also comfort in the familiar territory of an ongoing project. You know the codebase, you understand the problems, and you’re in your element. Starting something new means facing the unknown, which can be daunting.</p>
<p>The illusion of productivity plays a significant role too. As long as you’re working on something, you feel productive. Jumping from project to project gives you a constant stream of “new project energy,” which can feel more invigorating than the grind of finishing a single project. It’s a way of avoiding difficult decisions that come with completion. Do you cut that feature you spent weeks on but isn’t quite right? Do you release now or spend another month polishing? By keeping projects ongoing, you can sidestep these challenging choices.</p>
<p>The absence of deadlines in personal projects adds another layer to this complexity<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-parkinson-law" id="user-content-fnref-parkinson-law" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. Without the external pressure of a due date, it’s all too easy to fall into the trap of perfectionism. We find ourselves endlessly tweaking and refining, always chasing that elusive “perfect” solution. The irony is that this pursuit of perfection often leads to imperfect results—or no results at all. In our professional lives, deadlines force us to prioritize and make pragmatic decisions. But in personal projects, the luxury of unlimited time can become a curse, allowing us to justify spending hours, days, or even weeks on minor details that, in reality, make little difference to the project’s overall success or usefulness. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, “good enough” truly is perfect, especially when the alternative is never finishing at all.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, sometimes we fear success as much as failure. A successful project might lead to increased expectations, more responsibility, or a change in identity that we’re not quite ready for. The unfinished project becomes a safety net, protecting us from the unknown consequences of success.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bytedrum.com/_astro/project-timeline.DMCtX1xG_ZKINeB.svg" alt="My typical project timeline graph" width="1017" height="1379" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-never-finishing">The Cost of Never Finishing</h2>
<p>But this cycle of endless beginnings comes at a steep price. There’s a unique satisfaction in seeing a project through to completion that no amount of starting can match. Moreover, unfinished projects carry a mental weight. They linger in the back of your mind, quietly draining your mental energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, we learn different lessons from finishing projects than we do from starting them. Starting teaches us about ideation and initial implementation. Finishing, on the other hand, teaches us about perseverance, attention to detail, and the art of knowing when to let go. These are invaluable skills that can only be honed through the act of completion.</p>
<p>The costs of never finishing extend far beyond just missed opportunities. While starting projects might expose you to new technologies or concepts, it’s in the act of finishing—of solving those last, trickiest problems—where real <em>skill growth</em> often occurs. Each unfinished project can chip away at your confidence. Over time, you might start to doubt your ability to complete anything substantial, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of incompletion.</p>
<p>The end stages of a project often involve optimization, refactoring, and really understanding the intricacies of your code. By not finishing, you miss out on these valuable learning experiences. In professional settings, being known as someone who starts things but doesn’t finish them can be detrimental to your career. Employers and clients value those who can deliver completed projects, making the ability to finish a crucial professional skill.</p>
<p>Every unfinished project takes up mental space. It’s like having dozens of browser tabs open—each one uses a little bit of your mental RAM, leaving you with less capacity for new ideas and focused work. This mental clutter can be a significant drain on your creativity and productivity.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, you deny yourself the incomparable feeling of satisfaction when you release a finished project into the world. There’s a <em>joy in shipping</em> that can’t be replicated by starting something new. Finished projects also invite feedback, and without shipping, you miss out on valuable insights from users or peers that could significantly improve your skills and future projects.</p>
<p>Understanding both the allure of endless projects and the cost of never finishing is crucial. It’s not about dismissing the excitement of new beginnings, but rather about finding a balance—learning to channel that initial enthusiasm into the equally important (if sometimes less glamorous) work of seeing things through to completion. By recognizing these patterns in ourselves, we can start to develop strategies to overcome them and finally slay the Project Hydra.</p>
<h2 id="strategies-for-taming-the-project-hydra">Strategies for Taming the Project Hydra</h2>
<p>So, how do I break this cycle? How do I learn to finish what I start? Here are some strategies I’m implementing to tame my own Project Hydra:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Define “Done” from the Start</strong>: Before diving into a project, I’ll clearly define what “finished” looks like. What are the core features that constitute a complete project? I’ll write them down and resist the urge to expand this list as I go. This clarity helps prevent scope creep and gives me a clear target to aim for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🚀 <strong>Embrace MVP</strong>: Instead of aiming for perfection, I’ll aim for “good enough.” I’ll get a basic version working and out into the world. I can always iterate and improve later. This approach helps maintain momentum and provides early feedback opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>⏳ <strong>Time-Box My Projects</strong>: I’ll give myself a deadline. It doesn’t have to be short, but it should be finite. Having an end date creates urgency and helps me prevent endless feature creep. I find that breaking larger projects into smaller, time-boxed phases helps maintain a sense of progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🧩 <strong>Practice Finishing Small Things</strong>: I’ll build my “finishing muscle” by completing small projects or tasks regularly. I recognize that the skill of finishing is like any other—it improves with practice. This could be as simple as finishing a blog post or completing a small coding challenge each week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>💡 <strong>Separate Ideation from Implementation</strong>: I’ll keep a separate idea log. When new features or project ideas pop up during implementation, I’ll jot them down for future consideration instead of immediately acting on them. This helps maintain focus on the current project while still capturing potentially valuable ideas.</p>

<p>🎉 <strong>Celebrate Completions</strong>: I’ll make finishing a big deal. I’ll celebrate when I complete a project, no matter how small. This positive reinforcement can help shift my mindset towards completion. Whether it’s treating myself to a nice dinner or simply sharing my accomplishment with friends, acknowledging these wins boosts motivation for future projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👥 <strong>Embrace Accountability</strong>: I’ll find ways to make myself accountable for finishing projects. This could involve finding an accountability partner, making public commitments about project milestones, or joining a group of fellow developers. External accountability adds motivation and support to the often solitary journey of personal projects.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-accountability-study" id="user-content-fnref-accountability-study" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These strategies provide my personal roadmap for overcoming the challenges of the Project Hydra. By implementing them consistently, I hope to develop better habits and increase my chances of seeing projects through to completion. It’s about creating a supportive structure around my work, balancing internal motivation with external accountability, and gradually building the skill of finishing.</p>
<p>Of course, strategies are just the beginning. The real challenge lies in consistently applying these approaches to my work. It’s a process of trial and error, of learning what works best for my personal style and the specific demands of each project. But with each small win, with each project pushed a little closer to completion, I’m building the habits and mindset needed to finally tame the Project Hydra.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward">The Path Forward</h2>
<p>The path ahead will be challenging. I know that changing ingrained habits and thought patterns will take time and consistent effort. There will likely be setbacks along the way – moments when the allure of a new project tempts me away from finishing the current one, or when the fear of imperfection makes me hesitate to declare something “done”. But I’m committed to pushing through these obstacles and building my “finishing muscle”.</p>
<p>This journey isn’t just about completing code; it’s about growing as a developer and creator. Each finished project, no matter how small, is a step towards becoming someone who not only starts with enthusiasm but finishes with satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Project Hydra has loomed over my work for too long. Armed with new strategies and determination, I’m ready to face this beast head-on. It’s time to stop planning and start doing.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a project to finish – and this time, I intend to see it through.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-final-note" id="user-content-fnref-final-note" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>

    </div><p>An Aston University researcher has used light to develop the first step towards a quicker, cheaper and less painful technique to detect cancer.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>Professor Igor Meglinski from the University's Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies led the team that has developed a new method of analyzing the crystals in dehydrated blood. Their paper "Insights into polycrystalline microstructure of blood films with 3D Mueller matrix imaging approach" has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63816-z" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</p>
<p>Professor Meglinski used a new polarization-based image reconstruction technique to analyze polycrystalline structures in dried blood samples. The proteins in blood change their shape and how they fit together during the early stages of diseases like cancer. Professor Meglinski and his team used changes in the proteins' tertiary structure or unique 3D shape together with its quaternary structure—which is how multiple proteins join together—to detect and classify cells.</p>
<p>This technique enabled the researchers to conduct a detailed layer-by-layer analysis of dry blood smears, which is crucial for identifying significant differences between healthy and cancerous samples.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed 108 blood film samples from three equal size groups: healthy volunteers, those who had <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prostate+cancer/" rel="tag">prostate cancer</a> and a third group who had the illness and had cells that were more likely to aggressively spread.</p>
<p>Professor Meglinski said, "Our study introduces a pioneering technique to the liquid biopsy domain, aligning with the ongoing quest for non-invasive, reliable and efficient diagnostic methods. A key advancement in our study is the characterization of the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of distributions with the cells which is crucial for identifying significant differences between healthy and cancerous samples.</p>

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>"This breakthrough opens new avenues for cancer diagnosis and monitoring, representing a substantial leap forward in personalized medicine and oncology."</p>
<p>The study's findings had a 90% accuracy rate of both <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+diagnosis/" rel="tag">early diagnosis</a> and classification of cancer which is much higher than existing screening methods. Also, as the technique relies on <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag">blood samples</a> instead of tissue biopsies, it is less traumatic and risky for patients.</p>
<p>Professor Meglinski added, "This high level of precision, combined with the non-invasive nature of the technique, marks a significant advancement in liquid biopsy technology. It holds immense potential for revolutionizing <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+diagnosis/" rel="tag">cancer diagnosis</a>, early detection, patient stratification and monitoring, thereby greatly enhancing <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patient+care/" rel="tag">patient care</a> and treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>"This study also presents a testament to the resilience and support of our Ukrainian colleagues involved in the research, especially in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine."</p>

<!-- <p>28 Aug 2024 - </p> -->

<p>tl;dr; show me the <a href="#conclusions-and-demo">demo and source code!</a></p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/app.png" alt="app"></p>

<p>I’m pretty excited about the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">structured outputs</a>
feature in OpenAI’s API so I took it for a spin and developed an AI-assisted web scraper. This post summarizes my learnings.</p>

<h2 id="asking-gpt-4o-to-scrape-data">Asking GPT-4o to scrape data</h2>

<p>The first experiment was to straight ask GPT-4o to extract the data from an HTML
string, so I used the new structured outputs feature with the following <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">Pydantic</a> models:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Dict</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ParsedColumn</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>values</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ParsedTable</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>columns</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>ParsedColumn</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The system prompt is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re an expert web scraper. You’re given the HTML contents of a table and you have to extract structured data from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some interesting things I found when parsing different tables.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I also tried GPT-4o mini but yielded significantly worse results so I just continued my experiments with GPT-4o.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-complex-tables">Parsing complex tables</h2>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>After experimenting with some simple tables, I wanted to see how the model would do with a more complex ones, so I passed a 10-day <a href="https://weather.com/">weather</a> forecast from Weather.com. The table
contains a big row for at the top and smaller rows for the other 9
days. Interestingly, GPT-4o was able to parse this correctly:</p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-1.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>For the 9 remaining days, the table shows a day and a night forecast (see screenshot above). The model correctly parsed such data and added a <code>Day/Night</code> column. Here’s how it looks like in the browser (note that to display this, we need to click on the button to the right of each row):</p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-2.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>At first, I thought that the parsed <code>Condition</code> column was a hallucination since I did not see that in the website, however, upon inspecting the source code, I realized that those tags exist but are invisible in the table.</p>

<h2 id="combined-rows-break-the-model">Combined rows break the model</h2>

<p>When thinking where to find <em>easy tables</em>, my first thought was <em>Wikipedia</em>. Turns out, a <em>simple</em> table from Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index">Human development index</a>) breaks the model because rows with repeated values are merged:</p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-3.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>And while the model is able to retrieve individual columns (as instructed by the system prompt), they don’t have the same size, hence, I’m unable to represent the data as a table.</p>

<p>I tried modifying the system prompt with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tables might collapse rows into a single row. If that’s the case, extract the collapsed row as multiple JSON values to ensure all columns contain the same number of rows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it didn’t work. I have yet to try modifying the system prompt
to tell the model to extract rows instead of columns.</p>

<h2 id="asking-gpt-4o-to-return-xpaths">Asking GPT-4o to return XPaths</h2>

<p>Running an OpenAI API call every time can become very expensive, so I figured I’d ask the model to return <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath">XPaths</a> instead of
the parsed data. This would allow me to scrape the same page (e.g., to fetch updated data) without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>After some tweaks, I came up with this prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re an expert web scraper.</p>

  <p>The user will provide the HTML content and the column name.
Your job is to come up with an XPath that will return all elements of that column.</p>

  <p>The XPath should be a string that can be evaluated by Selenium’s
<code>driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, xpath)</code> method.</p>

  <p>Return the full matching element, not just the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, this didn’t work well. Sometimes, the model would return invalid XPaths (although
this was alleviated with the sentence that mentions Selenium) or XPaths that would
return incorrect data or no data at all.</p>

<h2 id="combining-the-two-approaches">Combining the two approaches</h2>

<p>My next attempt was to combine both approaches: once the model extracted the data,
we could use it as a reference to ask the model for the XPath. <em>This worked much better than straight asking for XPaths!</em></p>

<p>I noticed that sometimes the generated XPath would return no data at all so I added
some dumb retry logic: if the XPath returns no results, try again. This did the trick for
the tables I tested.</p>

<p>However, I noticed a new issue: sometimes the first step (extract data) converted images into text (e.g. an arrow pointing upwards might appear in the
extracted data as “arrow-upwards”), this caused the second step to fail since it’d look for data that wasn’t there. I did not attempt to fix this problem.</p>

<h2 id="gpt-4o-is-very-expensive">GPT-4o is very expensive</h2>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-4.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>Scraping with GPT-4o can become very expensive since even small HTML tables can contain lots of characters. I’ve been experimenting for two days and I’ve already spent $24!</p>

<p>To reduce the cost, I added some clean up logic to remove unnecessary data from the HTML string before passing it to the model. A simple function that removes all properties except <code>class</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>data-testid</code> (which are the ones I noticed the generated XPaths were using) trimmed the number of characters in the table by half.</p>

<p>I didn’t see any performance degradations and my suspicion is that the results would actually improve extraction quality.</p>

<p>Currently, the second step (generate XPaths) makes one model call per column in
the table, another improvement could be to generate more than one XPath, I have yet
to try this approach and evaluate performance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions-and-demo">Conclusions and demo</h2>

<p>I was surprised by the extraction quality of GPT-4o (but then sadly surprised when I looked at how much I’d have to pay OpenAI!). Nonetheless, this was a fun experiment and I definitely see potential for AI-assisted web scraping tools.</p>

<p>I did a quick demo using Streamlit, you can check it out here: <a href="https://orange-resonance-9766.ploomberapp.io/">https://orange-resonance-9766.ploomberapp.io</a>, the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/edublancas/posts/tree/main/ai-web-scraping">GitHub</a> (Spoiler: don’t expect anything polished).</p>

<p>Some stuff I’d like to try if I had more time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Capture browser events: the current demo is a one-off process: users enter the URL and an initial XPath. This isn’t great UX as it’d be better to ask the user to click on the table they want to extract, and to provide some sample rows so the model can understand the structure a bit better.</li>
  <li>In complex tables, a single XPath might not be enough to extract a full column, I’d like to see if asking the LLM to return a program (e.g. Python) would work.</li>
  <li>More experimenting with the HTML clean up is needed. It’s very expensive to use GPT-4o and I feel like I’m passing a lot of unnecessary data to the model</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Afrim is an input method for African languages. It is designed to protect the native language of various local dialects of Africa and is a universal phonetic-based input method platform.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">History</h2><a id="user-content-history" aria-label="Permalink: History" href="#history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">AFRIM is the abbreviation of <em>AFRICA IME</em> or <em>Africa Input Method Engine</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the beginning, AFRIM was written as a remake of <a href="https://github.com/H-Theking/clafrica">Clafrica IME</a>, and named <em>clafrica</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, we created an input method library with some improvements inspired from <a href="https://github.com/rime">RIME</a>. We renamed it to <em>Afrim Input Method Engine</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Later, it supports Amharic and Geez and other african phonetic input method, and we want support all african phonetic Input Method.</p>
<p dir="auto">Inspired from <a href="https://github.com/rime/librime">librime</a>, we want AFRIM aka <em>Afrim Input Method Engine</em> to be the top IME for african languages.</p>

              <p>I’ve been thinking about the lessons distributed systems engineers learn on
the job. A great deal of our instruction is through scars made by mistakes
made in production traffic. These scars are useful reminders, sure, but it’d
be better to have more engineers with the full count of their fingers.</p>
<p>New systems engineers will find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing">Fallacies of Distributed
Computing</a> and the <a href="http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/">CAP theorem</a> as part of their
self-education. But these are abstract pieces without the direct, actionable
advice the inexperienced engineer needs to start moving<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It’s surprising
how little context new engineers are given when they start out.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some lessons I’ve learned as a distributed systems engineer
that are worth being told to a new engineer. Some are subtle, and some are
surprising, but none are controversial. This list is for the new distributed
systems engineer to guide their thinking about the field they are taking
on. It’s not comprehensive, but it’s a good beginning.</p>
<p>The worst characteristic of this list is that it focuses on technical problems
with little discussion of social problems an engineer may run into. Since
distributed systems require more machines and more capital, their engineers
tend to work with more teams and larger organizations. The social stuff is
usually the hardest part of any software developer’s job, and, perhaps,
especially so with distributed systems development.</p>
<p>Our background, education, and experience bias us towards a technical solution
even when a social solution would be more efficient, and more pleasing. Let’s
try to correct for that. People are less finicky than computers, even if their
interface is a little less standardized.</p>
<p>Alright, here we go.</p>
<p><a name="fail" href="#fail">#</a> <strong>Distributed systems are different because they fail often.</strong> When asked what
separates distributed systems from other fields of software engineering, the
new engineer often cites latency, believing that’s what makes distributed
computation hard.</p>
<p>But they’re wrong. What sets distributed systems engineering apart is the
probability of failure and, worse, the probability of partial failure. If a
well-formed mutex unlock fails with an error, we can assume the process is
unstable and crash it. But the failure of a distributed mutex’s unlock must be
built into the lock protocol.</p>
<p>Systems engineers that haven’t worked in distributed computation will come up
with ideas like “well, it’ll just send the write to both machines” or “it’ll
just keep retrying the write until it succeeds”. These engineers haven’t
completely accepted (though they usually intellectually recognize) that
networked systems fail more than systems that exist on only a single machine
and that failures tend to be partial instead of total. One of the writes may
succeed while the other fails, and so now how do we get a consistent view of
the data? These partial failures are much harder to reason about.</p>
<p>Switches go down, garbage collection pauses make leaders “disappear”,
socket writes seem to succeed but have actually failed on the other machine, a
slow disk drive on one machine causes a communication protocol in the whole
cluster to crawl, and so on. Reading from local memory is simply more stable
than reading across a few switches.</p>
<p>Design for failure. <a href="#fail">#</a></p>
<p><a name="robustdist" href="#robustdist">#</a> <strong>Writing robust distributed systems costs more than writing robust
single-machine systems.</strong> Creating a robust distributed solution requires more
money than a single-machine solution because there are failures that only
occur with many machines. Virtual machine and cloud technology make
distributed systems engineering cheaper but not as cheap as being able to
design, implement, and test on a computer you already own. And there are
failure conditions that are difficult to replicate on a single
machine. Whether it’s because they only occur on dataset sizes much larger
than can be fit on a shared machine, or in the network conditions found in
datacenters, distributed systems tend to need actual, not simulated,
distribution to flush out their bugs. Simulation is, of course, very useful. <a href="#robustdist">#</a></p>
<p><a name="robustoss" href="#robustoss">#</a> <strong>Robust, open source distributed systems are much less common than robust,
single-machine systems.</strong> The cost of running many machines for long periods
of time is a burden on open source communities. Hobbyists and dilettantes are
the engines of open source software and they do not have the financial
resources available to explore or fix many of the problems a distributed
system will have. Hobbyists write open source code for fun in their free time
and with machines they already own. It’s much harder to find open source
developers who are willing to spin up, maintain, and pay for a bunch of
machines.</p>
<p>Some of this slack has been taken up by engineers working for corporate
entities. However, the priorities of their organization may not be in line
with the priorities of your organization.</p>
<p>While some in the open source community are aware of this problem, it’s not
yet solved. This is hard. <a href="#robustoss">#</a></p>
<p><a name="coord" href="#coord">#</a> <strong>Coordination is very hard.</strong> Avoid coordinating machines wherever
possible. This is often described as “horizontal scalability”. The real trick
of horizontal scalability is independence – being able to get data to
machines such that communication and consensus between those machines is kept
to a minimum. Every time two machines have to agree on something, the service
becomes harder to implement. Information has an upper limit to the speed it can
travel, and networked communication is flakier than you think, and your idea
of what constitutes consensus is probably wrong. Learning about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem">Two
Generals</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Generals%27_Problem">Byzantine Generals</a> problems is useful
here. (Oh, and Paxos really is <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub33002.html">very hard to implement</a>; that’s not
grumpy old engineers thinking they know better than you.) <a href="#coord">#</a></p>
<p><a name="memory" href="#memory">#</a> <strong>If you can fit your problem in memory, it’s probably trivial.</strong> To a
distributed systems engineer, problems that are local to one machine are
easy. Figuring out how to process data quickly is harder when the data is a
few switches away instead of a few pointer dereferences away. In a distributed
system, the well-worn efficiency tricks documented since the beginning of
computer science no longer apply. Plenty of literature and implementations are
available for algorithms that run on a single machine because the majority of
computation has been done on singular, uncoordinated machines. Significantly
fewer exist for distributed systems. <a href="#memory">#</a></p>
<p><a name="slow" href="#slow">#</a> <strong>“It’s slow” is the hardest problem you’ll ever debug.</strong> “It’s slow” might
mean one or more of the number of systems involved in performing a user
request is slow. It might mean one or more of the parts of a pipeline of
transformations across many machines is slow. “It’s slow” is hard, in part,
because the problem statement doesn’t provide many clues to the location of the
flaw. Partial failures, ones that don’t show up on the graphs you usually look
up, are lurking in a dark corner. And, until the degradation becomes very
obvious, you won’t receive as many resources (time, money, and tooling) to
solve it. <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html">Dapper</a> and <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/06/distributed-systems-tracing-with-zipkin.html">Zipkin</a> were built for a reason. <a href="#slow">#</a></p>
<p><a name="backpressure" href="#backpressure">#</a> <strong>Implement backpressure throughout your system.</strong> Backpressure is the
signaling of failure from a serving system to the requesting system and how
the requesting system handles those failures to prevent overloading itself and
the serving system. Designing for backpressure means bounding resource
use during times of overload and times of system failure. This is one
of the basic building blocks of creating a robust distributed system.</p>
<p>Implementations of backpressure usually involve either dropping new
messages on the floor, or shipping errors back to users (and incrementing
a metric in both cases) when a resource becomes limited or failures
occur. Timeouts and exponential back-offs on connections and requests to other
systems are also essential.</p>
<p>Without backpressure mechanisms in place, cascading failure or unintentional
message loss become likely. When a system is not able to handle the failures
of another, it tends to emit failures to another system that depends on it. <a href="#backpressure">#</a></p>
<p><a name="partial" href="#partial">#</a> <strong>Find ways to be partially available.</strong> Partial availability is being able to
return some results even when parts of your system is failing.</p>
<p>Search is an ideal case to explore here. Search systems trade-off between how
good their results are and how long they will keep a user waiting. A typical
search system sets a time limit on how long it will search its documents, and,
if that time limit expires before all of its documents are searched, it will
return whatever results it has gathered. This makes search easier to scale in
the face of intermittent slowdowns, and errors because those failures are
treated the same as not being able to search all of their documents. The
system allows for partial results to be returned to the user and its
resilience is increased.</p>
<p>And consider a private messaging feature in a web application. At some point, no
matter what you do, enough storage machines for private messaging will be down
at the same time that your users will notice. So what kind of partial failure do
we want in this system?</p>
<p>This takes some thought. People are generally more okay with private messaging
being down for them (and maybe some other users) than they are with all users
having some of their messages go missing. If the service is overloaded or one of
its machines are down, failing out just a small fraction of the userbase is
preferable to missing data for a larger fraction. And, on top of that choice, we
probably don’t want an unrelated feature, like public image upload, to be
affected just because private messaging is having a problem. How much work are
we willing to do to keep those failure domains separate?</p>
<p>Being able to recognize these kinds of trade-offs in partial availability is
good to have in your toolbox. <a href="#partial">#</a></p>
<p><a name="metrics" href="#metrics">#</a> <strong>Metrics are the only way to get your job done.</strong> Exposing metrics (such as
latency percentiles, increasing counters on certain actions, rates of change)
is the only way to cross the gap from what you believe your system does in
production and what it actually is doing. Knowing how the system’s behavior on
day 20 is different from its behavior on day 15 is the difference between
successful engineering and failed shamanism. Of course, metrics are necessary
to understand problems and behavior, but they are not sufficient to know what
to do next.</p>
<p>A diversion into logging. Log files are good to have, but they tend to
lie. For example, it’s very common for the logging of a few error classes to
take up a large proportion of a space in a log file but, in actuality, occur
in a very low proportion of requests. Because logging successes is redundant
in most cases (and would blow out the disk in most cases) and because
engineers often guess wrong on which kinds of error classes are useful to see,
log files get filled up with all sorts of odd bits and bobs. Prefer logging as
if someone who has not seen the code will be reading the logs.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a good number of outages extended by another engineer (or myself)
over-emphasizing something odd we saw in the log without first checking it
against the metrics. I’ve also seen another engineer (or myself)
Sherlock-Holmes’ing an entire set of failed behaviors from a handful of log
lines. But note: a) we remember those successes because they are so very rare
and b) you’re not Sherlock unless the metrics or the experiments back up the
story. <a href="#metrics">#</a></p>
<p><a name="percentiles" href="#percentiles">#</a> <strong>Use percentiles, not averages.</strong> Percentiles (50th, 99th, 99.9th, 99.99th)
are more accurate and informative than averages in the vast majority of
distributed systems. Using a mean assumes that the metric under evaluation
follows a bell curve but, in practice, this describes very few metrics an
engineer cares about. “Average latency” is a commonly reported metric, but
I’ve never once seen a distributed system whose latency followed a bell
curve. If the metric doesn’t follow a bell curve, the average is meaningless
and leads to incorrect decisions and understanding. Avoid the trap by talking
in percentiles. Default to percentiles, and you’ll better understand how users
really see your system. <a href="#percentiles">#</a></p>
<p><a name="capacity" href="#capacity">#</a> <strong>Learn to estimate your capacity.</strong> You’ll learn how many seconds are in a
day because of this. Knowing how many machines you need to perform a task is
the difference between a long-lasting system, and one that needs to be
replaced 3 months into its job. Or, worse, needs to be replaced before you
finish productionizing it.</p>
<p>Consider tweets. How many tweet ids can you fit in memory on a common machine?
Well, a typical machine at the end of 2012 has 24 GB of memory, you’ll need an
overhead of 4-5 GB for the OS, another couple, at least, to handle requests,
and a tweet id is 8 bytes. This is the kind of back of the envelope
calculation you’ll find yourself doing. Jeff Dean’s <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/talks/dean-keynote-ladis2009.pdf">Numbers Everyone Should
Know</a> slide is a good expectation-setter. <a href="#capacity">#</a></p>
<p><a name="flags" href="#flags">#</a> <strong>Feature flags are how infrastructure is rolled out.</strong> “Feature flags” are a
common way product engineers roll out new features in a system. Feature flags
are typically associated with frontend A/B testing where they are used to show
a new design or feature to only some of the userbase. But they are a powerful
way of replacing infrastructure as well.</p>
<p>Too many projects have failed because they went for the “big cutover” or a
series of “big cutovers” that were then forced into rollbacks by bugs found too
late. By using feature flags instead, you’ll gain confidence in your project and
mitigate the costs of failure.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re going from a single database to a service that hides the details
of a new storage solution. Using a feature flag, you can slowly ramp up writes
to the new service in parallel to the writes to the old database to make sure
its write path is correct and fast enough. After the write path is at 100% and
backfilling into the service’s datastore is complete, you can use a separate
feature flag to start reading from the service, without using the data in user
responses, to check for performance problems. Another feature flag can be used
to perform comparison checks on read of the data from the old system and the new
one. And one final flag can be used to slowly ramp up the “real” reads from the
new system.</p>
<p>By breaking up the deployment into multiple steps and affording yourself quick
and partial reactions with feature flags, you make it easier to find bugs and
performance problems as they occur during ramp up instead of at a “big bang”
release time. If an issue occurs, you can just tamp the feature flag setting
back down to a lower (perhaps, zero) setting immediately. Adjusting the rates
lets you debug and experiment at different amounts of traffic knowing that any
problem you hit isn’t a total disaster. With feature flags, you can also choose
other migration strategies, like moving requests over on a per-user basis, that
provide better insight into the new system. And when your new service is still
being prototyped, you can use flags at a low setting to have your new system
consume fewer resources.</p>
<p>Now, feature flags sound like a terrible mess of conditionals to a classically
trained developer or a new engineer with well-intentioned training. And the use
of feature flags means accepting that having multiple versions of infrastructure
and data is a norm, not an rarity. This is a deep lesson. What works well for
single-machine systems sometimes falters in the face of distributed problems.</p>
<p>Feature flags are best understood as a trade-off, trading local complexity (in
the code, in one system) for global simplicity and resilience. <a href="#flags">#</a></p>
<p><a name="idspace" href="#idspace">#</a> <strong>Choose id spaces wisely.</strong> The space of ids you choose for your system will
shape your system.</p>
<p>The more ids required to get to a piece of data, the more options you have in
partitioning the data. The fewer ids required to get a piece of data, the
easier it is to consume your system’s output.</p>
<p>Consider version 1 of the Twitter API. All operations to get, create, and
delete tweets were done with respect to a single numeric id for each
tweet. The tweet id is a simple 64-bit number that is not connected to any
other piece of data. As the number of tweets goes up, it becomes clear that
creating user tweet timelines and the timeline of other user’s subscriptions
may be efficiently constructed if all of the tweets by the same user were
stored on the same machine.</p>
<p>But the public API requires every tweet be addressable by just the tweet
id. To partition tweets by user, a lookup service would have to be
constructed. One that knows what user owns which tweet id. Doable, if
necessary, but with a non-trivial cost.</p>
<p>An alternative API could have required the user id in any tweet look up and,
initially, simply used the tweet id for storage until user-partitioned storage
came online. Another alternative would have included the user id in the tweet
id itself at the cost of tweet ids no longer being k-sortable and numeric.</p>
<p>Watch out for what kind of information you encode in your ids, explicitly and
implicitly. Clients may use the structure of your ids to de-anonymize private
data, crawl your system in unexpected ways (auto-incrementing ids are a
typical sore point), or perform a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References">host of other attacks</a>. <a href="#idspace">#</a></p>
<p><a name="dataloc" href="#dataloc">#</a> <strong>Exploit data-locality.</strong> The closer the processing and caching of your data
is kept to its persistent storage, the more efficient your processing, and the
easier it will be to keep your caching consistent and fast. Networks have more
failures and more latency than pointer dereferences and <code>fread(3)</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, data-locality means being nearby in space, but it also means nearby
in time.  If multiple users are making the same expensive request at nearly the
same time, perhaps their requests can be joined into one. If multiple instances
of requests for the same kind of data are made near to one another, they could
be joined into one larger request. Doing so often affords lower communication
overheard and easier fault management. <a href="#dataloc">#</a></p>
<p><a name="cached" href="#cached">#</a> <strong>Writing cached data back to persistent storage is bad.</strong> This happens in
more systems than you’d think. Especially ones originally designed by people
less experienced in distributed systems. Many systems you’ll inherit will have
this flaw. If the implementers talk about “Russian-doll caching”, you have a
large chance of hitting highly visible bugs. This entry could have been left
out of the list, but I have a special hate in my heart for it. A common
presentation of this flaw is user information (e.g. screennames, emails, and
hashed passwords) mysteriously reverting to a previous value. <a href="#cached">#</a></p>
<p><a name="domore" href="#domore">#</a> <strong>Computers can do more than you think they can.</strong> In the field today, there’s
plenty of misinformation about what a machine is capable of from practitioners
that do not have a great deal of experience.</p>
<p>At the end of 2012, a light web server had 6 or more processors, 24 GB of
memory and more disk space than you can use. A relatively complex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
application in a modern language runtime on a single machine is trivially
capable of doing thousands of requests per second within a few hundred
milliseconds. And that’s a deep lower bound. In terms of operational ability,
hundreds of requests per second per machine is not something to brag about in
most cases.</p>
<p>Greater performance is not hard to come by, especially if you are willing to
profile your application and introduce efficiencies based on your
measurements. <a href="#domore">#</a></p>
<p><a name="cap" href="#cap">#</a> <strong>Use the CAP theorem to critique systems.</strong> The CAP theorem isn’t something
you can build a system out of. It’s not a theorem you can take as a first
principle and derive a working system from. It’s much too general in its
purview, and the space of possible solutions too broad.</p>
<p>However, it is well-suited for critiquing a distributed system design, and
understanding what trade-offs need to be made. Taking a system design and
iterating through the constraints CAP puts on its subsystems will leave you
with a better design at the end. For homework, apply the CAP theorem’s
constraints to a real world implementation of Russian-doll caching.</p>
<p>One last note: Out of C, A, and P, you <a href="http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/">can’t choose CA</a>. <a href="#cap">#</a></p>
<p><a name="services" href="#services">#</a> <strong>Extract services.</strong> “Service” here means “a distributed system that
incorporates higher-level logic than a storage system and typically has a
request-response style API”. Be on the lookout for code changes that would be
easier to do if the code existed in a separate service instead of in your
system.</p>
<p>An extracted service provides the benefits of encapsulation typically
associated with creating libraries. However, extracting out a service improves
on creating libraries by allowing for changes to be deployed faster and easier
than upgrading the libraries in its client systems. (Of course, if the
extracted service is hard to deploy, the client systems are the ones that
become easier to deploy.) This ease is owed to the fewer code and operational
dependencies in the smaller, extracted service and the strict boundary it
creates makes it harder to “take shortcuts” that a library allows for. These
shortcuts almost always make it harder to migrate the internals or the client
systems to new versions.</p>
<p>The coordination costs of using a service is also much lower than a shared
library when there are multiple client systems. Upgrading a library, even with
no API changes needed, requires coordinating deploys of each client
system. This gets harder when data corruption is possible if the deploys are
performed out of order (and it’s harder to predict that it will
happen). Upgrading a library also has a higher social coordination cost than
deploying a service if the client systems have different maintainers. Getting
others aware of and willing to upgrade is surprisingly difficult because their
priorities may not align with yours.</p>
<p>The canonical service use case is to hide a storage layer that will be
undergoing changes. The extracted service has an API that is more convenient,
and reduced in surface area compared to the storage layer it fronts. By
extracting a service, the client systems don’t have to know about the
complexities of the slow migration to a new storage system or format and only
the new service has to be evaluated for bugs that will certainly be found with
the new storage layout.</p>
<p>There are a great deal of operational and social issues to consider when doing
this. I cannot do them justice here. Another article will have to be written. <a href="#services">#</a></p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! We're Will, John, and David from Fortress (<a href="https://fortress.build/">https://fortress.build</a>). We're building a Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) backend as a service for multi-tenant SaaS apps, simplifying tenant data isolation across both shared and dedicated database instances.</p><p>There’s a demo here: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/761cac3090ba4db8b2ce9d713873333a?sid=d76b31bb-100c-483e-ba26-60915d98e61a" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/761cac3090ba4db8b2ce9d713873333a?...</a>, as well as a walkthrough of our Python SDK: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/c4b3f95235e24d99a7ea571c4564602b" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/c4b3f95235e24d99a7ea571c4564602b</a></p><p>YC initially funded us for AI web-scraping, but early in the batch we realized we wanted to pivot to something in data privacy - in some ways the opposite of web-scraping…</p><p>From talking with SaaS developers, we learned tenant isolation (making sure one customer’s data is not shown to another) is often considered in development but rarely a core competency. Many developers struggled setting up Row-Level-Security (RLS) correctly on Postgres, some are enforcing application level access controls with none at the database-level at all, and many didn’t know which multi-tenant db architecture to start with and just decided to deal with it later. However, with increasing data sensitivity and compliance requirements, they’ve seen growing customer demand for stricter data requirements, including more demands for dedicated database instances or even databases deployed on the customer’s private cloud.</p><p>We also learned that SaaS developers prefer to have databases on their own cloud, and many who start on a 3rd party DBaaS eventually move infrastructure to their own cloud later. Having things on your own cloud makes it easier for SaaS to offer on-prem/full-siloed deployments and meet compliance requirements for larger customers. So we pivoted into being a BYOC platform and made Fortress integratable with cloud-native databases.</p><p>Our goal with Fortress is to give SaaS developers the ease of use of a managed DBaaS, native isolation for tenants, and the ability to programmatically provision and access database instances on any cloud.</p><p>Fortress provides SaaS developers an abstraction at the tenant level, allowing them to enforce tenant isolation through a function without having to set up RLS themselves or use WHERE statements in every query. Currently, on the Fortress platform, this is simple as every tenant in a shared database is given a logical db in a Postgres Cluster and we handle routing (We are currently working on a solution that provides native tenant isolation for tenants stored in shared tables).</p><p>Through our SDKs, developers only need to handle one connection to the Fortress client and we'll route requests and handle connection caching to ensure minimal latency to the right tenant’s data. We are working on creating more SDKs and simplifying existing ones. We currently support Postgres via AWS Aurora with plans to support other cloud-native databases and open-sourced databases via Kubernetes.</p><p>If you want to try it out, we’ve opened up self-serve to spin up new databases on your AWS cloud. You will need to create an account with Fortress (<a href="https://fortress.build/auth/sign-up">https://fortress.build/auth/sign-up</a>) to connect it to your own AWS account - that’s what BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) means! But if you are uncomfortable with granting us IAM permissions, we are offering a free db on the managed Fortress cloud for you to test out our SDKs (just cancel out of the Integrations page, create a database on the Database page, and select managed as the option, you will have a limit of 1). Note: AWS takes a while to spin up new clusters, adding tenants to existing clusters should be fairly instantaneous.</p><p>To provide you something basic to play with, we created a simple python flask application where you can easily test out our python SDK (<a href="https://github.com/fortress-build/python-example">https://github.com/fortress-build/python-example</a>). We created a video of us walking through the example with Fortress (<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/0245bec78d9d4dbeba8836c4112aa5da?sid=fd79eea1-d71a-4cb9-8a3d-a870dfb6f5d3" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/0245bec78d9d4dbeba8836c4112aa5da?...</a>)</p><p>We hope you’ll test it out! We wanted to launch on HN to hear honest criticism, ideas, and pain points in this space. We are a super early stage database product and recognize that we have a ton of room for improvements. Looking forward to your input!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Three men in the United Kingdom have pleaded guilty to operating <strong>otp[.]agency</strong>, a once popular online service that helped attackers intercept the one-time passcodes (OTPs) that many websites require as a second authentication factor in addition to passwords.</p>
<p>Launched in November 2019, OTP Agency was a service for intercepting one-time passcodes needed to log in to various websites. Scammers who had already stolen someone’s bank account credentials could enter the target’s phone number and name, and the service would initiate an automated phone call to the target that warned them about unauthorized activity on their account.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/45GsKWyF63U?si=WcCChUe4gFLTpnxO" width="750" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The call would prompt the target to enter a one-time passcode that was sent to the user via SMS when the thieves attempted to log in. Any codes shared by the target were then relayed to the scammer’s user panel at the OTP Agency website.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/website-operators-promised-fraudsters-profit-within-minutes-if-they-subscribed-to-illegal-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> published Aug. 30 by the U.K.’s <strong>National Crime Agency</strong> (NCA) said three men pleaded guilty to running OTP Agency: <strong>Callum Picari</strong>, 22, from Hornchurch, Essex; <strong>Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan</strong>, 21, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire; and <strong>Aza Siddeeque</strong>, 19, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity profiled OTP Agency in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/u-k-arrest-in-sms-bandits-phishing-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a February 2021 story</a> about arrests tied to another phishing-related service based in the U.K. Someone claiming to represent OTP Agency then posted several comments on the piece, wherein <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/otp-support.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they claimed</a> the story was libelous and that they were a legitimate anti-fraud service. However, the service’s Telegram channel clearly showed its proprietors had built OTP Agency with one purpose in mind: To help their customers take over online accounts.</p>
<p>Within hours of that publication, OTP Agency shuttered its website and announced it was closing up shop and purging its user database. The NCA said the February 2021 story prompted a panicked message exchange between Picari and Vijayanathan:</p>
<blockquote><p>Picari said: bro we are in big trouble… U will get me bagged… Bro delete the chat</p>
<p>Vijayanathan: Are you sure</p>
<p>Picari: So much evidence in there</p>
<p>Vijayanathan: Are you 100% sure</p>
<p>Picari: It’s so incriminating…Take a look and search ‘fraud’…Just think of all the evidence…that we cba to find…in the OTP chat…they will find</p>
<p>Vijayanathan: Exactly so if we just shut EVERYTHING down</p>
<p>Picari: They went to our first ever msg…We look incriminating…if we shut down…I say delete the chat…Our chat is Fraud 100%</p>
<p>Vijayanathan : Everyone with a brain will tell you stop it here and move on</p>
<p>Picari: Just because we close it doesn’t mean we didn’t do it…But deleting our chat…Will f*^k their investigations…There’s nothing fraudulent on the site</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite deleting its Telegram channel, OTP Agency evidently found it difficult to walk away from its customers (and/or the money). Instead of shutting down as Vijayanathan wisely advised, just a few days later OTP Agency was communicating with customers <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/otp-support.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a new Telegram channel</a>, offering a new login page and assuring existing customers that their usernames, passwords and balances would remain the same.</p>
<div id="attachment_68562"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68562" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/optagency-reborn.png" alt="" width="775" height="632" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/optagency-reborn.png 775w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/optagency-reborn-768x626.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68562">OTP Agency, immediately after their initial shutdown, telling customers their existing logins will still work.</p></div>
<p><span id="more-68557"></span>But that revival would be short-lived. The NCA said the site was taken offline less than a month later when the trio were arrested. NCA investigators said more than 12,500 people were targeted by OTP Agency users during the 18 month the service was active.</p>
<p>Picari was the owner, developer and main beneficiary of the service, and his personal information and ownership of OTP Agency was revealed in February 2020 in a “dox” posted to the now-defunct English-language cybercrime forum <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/raidforums-get-raided-alleged-admin-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raidforums</a>. The NCA said it began investigating the service in June 2020.</p>
<div id="attachment_68565"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68565" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/otpa-mugshots.png" alt="" width="748" height="440" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/otpa-mugshots.png 775w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/otpa-mugshots-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68565">The OTP Agency operators who pleaded guilty to running the service; Aza Siddeeque, Callum Picari, and Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan.</p></div>
<p>OTP Agency might be gone, but several other similar OTP interception services are still in operation and accepting new customers, including a long-running service <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/the-rise-of-one-time-password-interception-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KrebsOnSecurity profiled in September 2021</a> called <strong>SMSRanger</strong>. More on SMSRanger in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>Text messages, emails and phone calls warning recipients about potential fraud are some of the most common scam lures. If someone (or something) calls saying they’re from your bank, or asks you to provide any personal or financial information, <em>do not respond</em>.&nbsp; Just hang up, full stop.</p>
<p>If the call has you worried about the security and integrity of your account, check the account status online, or call your financial institution — ideally using a phone number that came from the bank’s Web site or from the back of your payment card.</p>

MobileOps is a bootstrapped and profitable software company that sells SaaS ("MobileOps") to companies that own fleets of workboats or heavy construction assets. We have a vertically integrated app that serves as a one-stop shop for companies when it comes to asset maintenance, safety/compliance, crewing, dispatching, logistics, inventory, and much more.</p><p>We've just begun to release new sets of features that focus on logistics for workboat companies that tow barges in the inland rivers of the USA (imagine 100k+ barges being pushed by towboats in rivers that carve through the American heartland, and all the major complexities that comes with tracking barges w/ cargo, optimizing schedules and tows, and generating invoices based off many movements and types of events).</p><p>In addition, we've started to attract attention outside the maritime world, and we're excited about new opportunities to bring MobileOps to similar industries.</p><p>[ Role ] 
We're looking for a highly motivated individual with 5+ years of professional software engineering experience—one who takes ownership of projects, has an eye for great UI/UX, and gets quality work completed on time (understanding, at a deep level, perfection v.s. shipping). The role will require collaboration with colleagues and customers to ensure we're building the right features and providing value. If you're an individual that doesn't want to be siloed and desires to engage with customers on Zoom calls (and even occasional onsite visits with other team members) this might be a good role for you.</p><p>MobileOps is a remote-first company with team members currently located in Washington and California. Work hours are in the Pacific time zone. Full time = 40 hours a week. We offer benefits (health, vision, dental) and 401(k) matching.</p><p>[ Stack ]
MobileOps' BE is Ruby on Rails and the FE is almost 100% React components. While the frameworks are fairly standard, the problems we need to solve are quite out of the ordinary due to the nature of industry we serve, and there's a lot of challenging and unique problems to be solved outside of basic CRUD interfaces.</p><p>If you’re interested you can email: jobs@ company domain. Please paste your CV (no attachments) and provide some information about yourself and work experience. Feel free to ask questions as well.</p></div></td></tr>

Building software that positively contributes to society is a passion of mine, and I'm always happy to meet new people too. Even if it isn't related to work, feel free to reach out!</p></div></td></tr>

My academic background is in computer science (currently writing my minor thesis in computational modelling &amp; simulation; set to graduate in November) and I currently work for a Big 4 consulting &amp; financial services company (~1.5 years of experience). As an intern, I helped save my team ~4 weeks of manual work because I insisted on creating a parser for messy log files generated by a client's old COBOL scripts. When I returned as a full-time employee, I spotted an opportunity to automate the analysis of credit risk impacts, and used the software to help a large telecommunications company with 5M+ customers. I love puzzles, and my specialty is using statistical and computational techniques to solve them. As I approach the end of my postgrad degree, I'm in search of technical opportunities to work on interesting problems alongside inquisitive folks, preferably in Melbourne/Australia.

Hi, Jordan here. I've been doing Platform Engineering before it was a term people used. I've been the leader on big ambitious projects, and really difficult migrations/cleanup. I've worked at startups that were acquired, and run my own. I've done everything from infrastructure (including bare metal) all the way up to front end design.  My biggest strength is helping organizations "grow up", and put friction in the right place to increase speed of delivery.</p></div></td></tr>

i'm a reverse engineer, software developer, and embedded systems expert with about 15 years of experience. my secret to avoiding burnout is to work on and learn as many new things as possible in full immersion style and i'm currently in the throes of a raging ML obsession -- i would love to do more work related to it.</p><p>as far as hardware goes, i'm experienced with robotics (remote control, sensors, motors, actuators, etc), motion simulators, microcontrollers, embedded x86, audio amplifiers, express racks (for the ISS) and a bit of RF and analog electronics. on the software side, i'm intimately familiar with c, c++ and python, but i can read most code and understand it, including assembly (there were a lot of misspent hours in IDA pro during my youth). while i know javascript, html, and css i am not interested in writing web apps again.</p><p>when it comes to ML, i'm proficient with pytorch debugging and i can full finetune extremely large models (120B+) with sft or offline RL (dpo/kto). i've had to do my own data wrangling, so i'm familiar with most of the chat templates/prompt formats of LLMs and converting to and from the various dataset formats that training software uses. i am familiar with most LLM architecture internals and i follow mechanistic interp papers and research, so i train a lot of steering/control vectors on gemma and peek at them with the gemmascope sparse autoencoders. i've trained new output heads for pretrained models, permanently imbued models with control vectors and run abliteration/orthogonalize activation steering, and i can fix your axolotl container when it inevitably breaks under the weight of the hf/torch ecosystem.</p><p>i'm a seasoned hacker but my position has turned into project management, which i hate.
tech lead or bust. liberate me and i'll be your friend forever.</p><p>Do: contact me if you're looking for a professional who wants to get things done.
Don't: contact me if you want me to sit in meetings all day. i am not built for that.</p></div></td></tr>

From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users.

My name is Benaiah Mischenko, and I am a senior/staff level full-stack developer with 13 years of experience as, at different times, an individual contributor, full-time open-source-maintainer, and team lead. I like to work on interesting and difficult data + UI problems that cross the backend/frontend divide. Both team lead and individual contributor opportunities interest me currently, but I do not wish to move into management.</p><p>In the past five years I've worked as a full-time maintainer of Netlify CMS, an open-source project with using React and TypeScript; then worked on the backend of the Netlify build service that runs all of the builds on that service using Go, Docker, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, and Kubernetes; and since then led an engineering team to an on-time and well-received delivery of a new open-source website for a major department of the state of Louisiana using TypeScript, Svelte + SvelteKit, GraphQL, Contentful, and Vercel.</p><p>I'm passionate about project automation, thorough documentation, relieving pain points for other developers and finding ways to accelerate my team as a whole, and being able to contribute across a large stack of technologies to solve problems that involve a full vertical slice of an application. I strive to always grow as a developer and help those around me do the same, whether that be in a formal role as a team lead or as a peer and collaborator.</p><p>I'm happy to field any further questions over email, and am available to start immediately.</p></div></td></tr>

15+ years hands-on engineering experience and CTO / Head of Engineering leadership experience. Highly empathetic individual, concerned with UX and DX alike.</p><p>At this stage of my career I'm more interested in interesting problems rather than role / title. Big on social impact w/ my most recent roles being in EdTech. Am interested in technically challenging work too, but I do a bit of reverse engineering and open source development in my free time, so slight preference towards providing social value.</p><p>Github gives a good idea of my breadth with projects I built ranging from reverse engineered firmware flashing software for Samsung phones to IDEs that bolt static type checking onto Lua. There's more typical stuff like React libraries, tooling and contributions to React, auth libraries (Supabase) etc. If there's a bug blocking my team anywhere in our stack, I'll contribute a fix myself. Plenty of experience building engineering teams/departments, hiring, defining and implementing process and setting up green field projects (CI/CD, tooling etc.)</p></div></td></tr>

This is more for the others than myself but I'll start with myself - they're my friends so I'm not looking for a finder's fee or anything for them.</p><p>I myself work on a large company's Android app which has heavy usage and yearly revenues in the hundreds of millions. Have programmed Android for some years.  I have some past experience in a lot of IT/tech type things.  To make things easy for you, I am not looking to leave for less than $200k (somewhat liquid) total compensation, although if it is an ML/AI-focused company I might be willing to take tens of thousands less.  I am willing to relocate, and am willing to work in-person, hybrid or remote.  As I'm not actively looking, my interview skills for system design are probably abysmal in an interview sense, and Leetcode is probably middling (I just started practicing Leetcode).</p><p>I just worked with an Android programmer who has 30 years experience as a programmer, and over 6 years experience as an Android programmer.  He knows Android on a technical level better than I do.  If you are looking for a programmer to quickly shovel out features in a crummy way, he is not the person for you.  If you need someone to thoroughly architect for features and the entire app, consider all obvious (and non-obvious) edge and corner cases, make suggestions, including for better interaction with the backend, he is someone you want to talk to.  He is very averse to companies that want to do a Leetcode interview and he probably does not have that two pointer, sliding window, binary search, BFS/DFS stuff top of mind as some people do.  For what he does he is pretty good.  He would want to work remote, but I am sure would be willing to fly in a few times a year.</p><p>I used to work with a junior/associate level programmer at my big company, he went back to school to learn CS and is graduating soon.  He knows Android at a junior/associate level, and has been studying other things in his CS classes.  If you need an intern, or a junior/associate level programmer for Android (or other things), he is good.  He is not senior though.</p><p>As I'm an Android programmer, I tend to know a number of Android programmers, although we three are somewhat available, but I know many others as well.  So if you need an Android programmer let me know (if it is for one doing a lot of React Native, I know some who do that but less).</p></div></td></tr>

  <p>Humans and other animals encounter and remember countless experiences each day; when we sleep, groups of cells in the brain known as neuronal ensembles replay these experiences to consolidate them into memories and “preplay” futures ones, which enables faster encoding of new experiences into memories later on.</p>
<p>Better understanding how these neuronal ensembles represent, or depict, these experiences would offer important insights into how memory and the mind function. But most studies to date have focused solely on animals undergoing just one or a small handful of sequential experiences — and it remains unclear how exactly the brain is able to process numerous experiences simultaneously during sleep.</p>
<p>In a new study, Yale scientists revealed a generative coding capacity in the brain’s hippocampus — an area responsible for memory and learning — which enables the brain to bundle together the representations of some 15 unrelated experiences that occurred across one full day within single sub-second events, known as frames, during sleep.</p>
<p>This computer-like capacity for parallel processing of different chains of information helps explain why humans and other animals are able to process a cascade of experiences and either keep separate or combine their meanings.</p>
<p>The findings were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01703-6">published in the journal Nature Neuroscience</a>.</p>
<p><span>“</span>The brain mechanisms we uncovered are relevant for how we form and express internally generated representations about the world, like memories, imagining, and insight,” said <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/george-dragoi/">George Dragoi</a>, an associate professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience at Yale School of Medicine and corresponding author of the study.</p>
<p>An increasing amount of neuroscience research is exploring how neuronal ensembles represent experiences in the brain, a complex process that has implications for learning and memory, cognitive mapping, and spatial navigation. The fact that most studies involve animals undergoing a single experience, however, has prevented researchers from assembling a more complete picture.</p>
<p><span>“</span>In real life we are continuously experiencing new contexts and events that all need to be encoded distinctly and remembered later without a major interference between them,” Dragoi said. “The way the brain solves this problem is not known and experiments attempting to address this topic are essentially missing.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Computational models have proposed that exposure to multiple experiences would lead to a ‘catastrophic interference’ between the brain representations of new and older experiences, causing the individual to forget the latter,” Dragoi said. “That, of course, is not how daily life works.”</p>
<p>For the new study, the researchers recorded the activity of hippocampal neurons in rats that were allowed to move freely through 15 different spatial contexts over 19 ½ hours, a time span that included periods of extended sleep, during a single day. (The periods of sleep were used to investigate “offline” activity in the animals’ brains, in terms of preplay and replay of experiences.)</p>
<p>Using innovative data analysis, they identified several coding schemes in the hippocampus that boost its network capacity and efficiency during sleep and allow the brain to process representations of several experiences without interference.</p>
<p>Specifically, they found that the brain is able to “flicker” between time-compressed representations from two or more distinct experiences within the same sleep preplay and replay events, a feature that greatly increases network capacity for parallel information processing without interference during sleep. In addition, independent experiences can be bound together into longer preplay/replay episodes representing sequential aspects of day-long experiences in the order in which they occurred compressed into replay episodes less than a second in duration.</p>
<p>The researchers also identified a kind of serial position effect in this process, whereby the first and most recent experiences had the strongest representations during the animals’ sleep, a phenomenon similar to the effect observed in human memory in which people tend to recall the first and last events in a series of events or items.</p>
<p>Other authors of the paper are Kefei Liu and Jeremie Sibille, a former associate research scientist and postdoctoral associate, respectively, in Dragoi’s lab at Yale School of Medicine.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure></figure><p>I read “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Middlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot/dp/0141439548" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Middlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot/dp/0141439548&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Middlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot/dp/0141439548" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Middlemarch</a>” for the first time during my sophomore year of college. I didn’t get it. Why would Dorothea, a young and intelligent woman, marry that annoying old man? How could she be so stupid? No one else in the class seemed to get it, either, and this pushed our professor over the edge. “Of course you don’t understand,” he roared, swilling a Diet Coke. “Trust me, you’ll read this book again when you’re forty, after your first divorce, and you’ll say, ‘Oh, I see!’ ”</p><p>Arguably, it’s one of the tragedies of humanities education that so much of it occurs between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two. We don’t teach people to drive at twelve, when they’re carless; why should we make them read novels about life’s regrets when they have none? Yet there’s a theory behind the assignment of “Middlemarch” to sophomores: it’s that knowledge acquired too early gets stored away. Patterns of thinking established now will be retraced later; ideas encountered first in art will prime us for the rest of life. This sounds chancy and vague, until you reflect on the fact that knowledge almost never arrives at the moment of its application. You take a class in law school today only to argue a complicated case years later; you learn C.P.R. years before saving a drowning man; you read online about how to deter a charging bear, because you never know. In the mid-twentieth century, Toyota pioneered a methodology called just-in-time manufacturing, according to which car parts were constructed and delivered as close as possible to the hour of assembly. This was maximally efficient because it reduced waste and the cost of storage. But the human mind doesn’t work that way. Knowledge must often molder in our mental warehouses for decades until we figure out what to do with it.</p><p>Leslie Valiant, an eminent computer scientist who teaches at Harvard, sees this as a strength. He calls our ability to learn over the long term “educability,” and in his new book, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Importance-Being-Educable-Theory-Uniqueness/dp/0691230560" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Importance-Being-Educable-Theory-Uniqueness/dp/0691230560&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Importance-Being-Educable-Theory-Uniqueness/dp/0691230560" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Importance of Being Educable</a>,” he argues that it’s key to our success. When we think about what makes our minds special, we tend to focus on intelligence. But if we want to grasp reality in all its complexity, Valiant writes, then “cleverness is not enough.” We need to build capacious and flexible theories about the world—theories that will serve us in new, unanticipated, and strange circumstances—and we do that by gathering diverse kinds of knowledge, often in a slow, additive, serendipitous way, and knitting them together. Through this process, we acquire systems of beliefs that are broader and richer than the ones we can create through direct personal experience. This is how, after our first divorce, we find that we can draw on wisdom borrowed from English literature.</p><p>Valiant won the 2010 Turing Award, his discipline’s version of the Nobel Prize, for developing ideas that underpin artificial intelligence and distributed computation, in which many computers work together to solve problems. In his book, he contrasts A.I.’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/how-will-ai-learn-next">way of learning</a> with ours. An A.I. can be astonishingly smart, and even think intuitively, kind of like a person. But A.I. systems, Valiant argues, are not as flexible as human minds because they are not yet educable. Even the most state-of-the-art A.I.s learn through a rigid process, in which they are trained, at great expense, and don’t really get any smarter after that, no matter how much new information they ingest. It’s as though their minds freeze on graduation day. Yet human beings constantly improve their own minds through an unfolding, open-ended process that connects newly acquired facts and ideas to ones collected long ago. We “combine pieces of knowledge gained years apart” into “theories of considerable complexity that have many and disparate parts.”</p><p>Valiant says that he tries not to use the word “intelligent” to describe people (in fact, he is “sometimes taken aback” when he hears others use it); instead, he is drawn to “valuable abilities that somehow involve learning and are not well captured by conventional notions of IQ.” An educable mind, he writes, can learn from books, lectures, conversations, experiences, and Zen koans—from anything, really—and notice when relevant aspects of almost forgotten knowledge reveal themselves. We admire aspects of someone’s educability when we say that they are a quick study, or identify them as “coachable,” but what really makes them educable is that they apply insights “for purposes not foreseen at the time of the study or the coaching”; educability is something like “street smarts”—a term which connotes the “uncanny ability to negotiate the practicalities of life”—and is closely related to having common sense. When people strike us as particularly “well-educated,” this might mean that they’ve had lots of school, Valiant writes, but it could also mean that they’re exceptionally educable, with the ability to “take good advantage of whatever educational opportunities arise, whether formal or informal.”</p><p>We’d probably like it if our political leaders were more educable: they “often need to make judgments on matters well beyond the knowledge and experience they had when elected.” Valiant suggests that we value educability in doctors, too. Imagine that you feel a pain in your side. Is it appendicitis? It would be unwise, he writes, to rely on what you know about the disease, based on what a few people who’ve had it have told you; you’d want to talk to a physician who’s seen a thousand cases. A medical A.I. could also train by looking at thousands of cases; in fact, “if it has seen a million cases, a situation well beyond individual human experience, then it may make predictions that are stunningly better than our intuitions can even comprehend.” And yet “the reason we go to doctors is not just that they have seen a thousand cases of a disease,” Valiant argues. “It is that we believe doctors deliver further results.” The basis of that extra value is educability.</p><p>Valiant doesn’t get into details, but we can imagine for ourselves the value that a hypothetical doctor’s educability might provide. Such a doctor might draw on a range of ideas and connections spanning years of learning. She learned about appendicitis in medical school, of course—and quickly concludes that you don’t have it. But maybe her brother happens to be an avid cyclist, and she notices you drinking from a water bottle emblazoned with a logo she recognizes from his bike. Wasn’t there an article online about how dangerous the city’s bike lanes have become? More generally, she’s also developed a new theory: she ought to ask more questions about the particulars of her patients’ lives. She asks if you’re a cyclist, discovers that you are, and eventually pinpoints the real issue—a bruised rib acquired in a fall, which you’ve not allowed to heal properly. Being educable, the doctor actually regards your case as an opportunity to learn, and is a better physician for it.</p><p>That’s a rather schematic, explicit example of educability; sometimes, Valiant seems to be describing something more diffuse, and perhaps more powerful. To a degree, the connections, recombinations, and new applications of knowledge involved in being educable are useful precisely because they aren’t obvious. Every so often, I learn a lesson in one part of life that seems to apply to another: when I swim down the beach, for example, I tend to look at the umbrellas on the sand and think that I’m making very little progress, and yet, later, when I switch from the front crawl to the backstroke, I’m often surprised by the distance that I’ve travelled between my glances at the shore. The discovery that incremental progress feels faster when you let it accrue before judging it has been useful to me in my writing (and also in motivating me to clean out the garage). A civil-engineering class I took in college, which focussed on the structural forces shouldered by bridges and skyscrapers, comes back to me with great regularity when I think about all sorts of things. Wind exerts its force along the length of a skyscraper, causing it to bend. Similarly, a new source of stress in your life can’t be compartmentalized; it increases the pressure everywhere. It’s interesting to see one’s mind through the lens of educability. It makes you wonder what other cross-pollinations have occurred.</p><p>Valiant thinks it might be useful to promote educability as an ideal. We could try to figure out how to measure and teach it in schools, or to encourage it in adults; at a time when accelerating technological change means there’s always more to learn, we might seek to create a more educable society in general. (That change will further accelerate if Valiant’s proposals for A.I. capable of “artificial educability” prove workable.) After reading his book, I thought, on a less exalted scale, about how I might improve my own educability. I concluded that I would seek to learn about a wider range of subjects, and simply try more things, trusting that my mind would someday knit it all together. I also figured that it couldn’t hurt to remind myself of what I’d already learned. Down in the basement, a few big bookshelves hold my reading from college and graduate school. “Middlemarch” is there, along with many other books that I didn’t understand then but have come to value with the passage of time. Reading widely about things that don’t seem immediately or practically useful, in the hope that what you learn now may prove meaningful later—that’s pretty much the definition of a liberal-arts education. Who knew that one of its best defenders would turn out to be a computer scientist? ♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">




<h2 id="they-dont-make-em-like-that-any-more-the-3.5mm-headphone-jack-socket">They
don’t make ’em like that any more: the 3.5mm headphone jack socket</h2>
<p><img src="https://kevinboone.me/img/plug.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It it ain’t broke, replace it with something that is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About five years ago I was suddenly, unexpectedly taken ill.&nbsp;Not just
‘that’s a bit nasty’ ill, but ‘prepare for the worst’ ill.&nbsp;One thing
that kept my spirits up in hospital, in the long watches of the night,
was listening to comedy shows and audiobooks. I used my smartphone for
this, since I had it with me, and a pair of old, wired headphones that I
just had time to grab on my way to the ambulance.</p>
<p>I survived, of course, as evidenced by my continued ramblings on this
site. But it was an unpleasant experience, made just a little better by
a simple piece of technology: the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I do own wireless headphones and earbuds – I think
almost everybody does. I also own several of those irritating USB
dongles, that provide a 3.5mm port for devices that don’t have one. But
here’s the problem: I can’t use my Bluetooth earbuds while they’re
charging. And I can’t easily charge my phone whilst it’s connected to
the USB dongle. In a critical-care facility, it’s hard enough to find
one free mains socket to connect a charger to, let alone two.</p>
<p>In the debate about the benefits of wired and wireless headphones, I
doubt anybody is thinking “What if I get sick?” It certainly wasn’t
something I was thinking, either, until I actually did. Still, that
experience made me think about all the advantages of having a headphone
jack, some of which I’d thought about before, and some I hadn’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound quality is better. Maybe that won’t always be the case, but it
is now. All decent headphones have an analog jack.</li>
<li>Almost any headphone or earphone will work with almost anything with
a standard jack socket. That isn’t the case for USB dongles. Maybe that
won’t always be the case, but it is now.</li>
<li>I can use the headphone jack to connect my phone or tablet to an
amplifier, should the need arise. For certain headphones, that need
<em>does</em> arise.</li>
<li>I can charge my phone whilst listening to music, which I do all
day.</li>
<li>I don’t have to carry around a stupid dongle, which I will
invariably lose.</li>
<li>Ordinary wired earbuds can be small enough to wear whilst sleeping.
I’ve never seen Bluetooth earbuds that are.</li>
</ul>
<p>The headphone jack is a “just works” kind of technology: there’s
nothing complicated about it, and its not encumbered by patents, so
anybody can make compatible equipment.</p>
<p>So, although “What if I get sick?” probably isn’t at the top of the
list of questions that will guide your buying decision, we have to
wonder what other things we lose, by replacing a well-established,
robust technology with a complicated, flaky one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <em>advantages</em> of doing away with the
headphone jack are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your cellphone is about ten pence cheaper.</li>
<li>Er… that’s it.</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes the loss of the headphone jack so hard to bear is that
<em>it wasn’t done for the consumer’s benefit</em>. To be sure,
manufacturers made certain claims about the alleged benefits of losing
the jack, but few of them stand up to much logical scrutiny.</p>
<p>The first manufacturer to make a point of dropping the headphone jack
(I believe) was not Apple – as is commonly believed – but Oppo, and back
in 2014. Their reason for doing so was at least a credible technical
one: they said it made their phones about half a millimetre thinner.
Maybe that was a selling point, maybe it wasn’t. But Apple couldn’t fall
back even on this claim, because people found ways to fit a 3.5mm jack
socket into the iPhones that lacked one, and even posted videos on
Youtube showing how they did it. It wasn’t easy, but it was clearly
<em>possible</em>. If Apple genuinely thought that omitting the jack
would leave more room for other features, they didn’t actually provide
any.</p>
<p>It’s notable that a number of companies mocked Apple’s decision to
drop the headphone jack, before quietly doing the same themselves:
Samsung and Google in particular. Samsung even cynically tried to
withdraw all the advertising in which they had mocked Apple. Of course,
nothing is ever really gone on the Internet, so we can continue to
marvel at Samsung’s barefaced duplicity.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claimed that the presence of the headphone jack
made it difficult to keep their phones waterproof; but there’s a whole
range of good-quality phones from around 2019-2020 that are waterproof
to a reasonable degree, without sacrificing the jack.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;All of these weak excuses are simply distractions from the
<em>real</em> reason Apple, Samsung, and Google dropped the headphone
jack: they all have a substantial investment in the manufacture of
wireless headphones.</p>
<p>Apple owns Beats – this was a multi-billion dollar investment, in a
company that manufactures Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>Samsung owns Harmon, which is know for the Harmon-Kardon and JBL
audio brands. Again, these were multi-billion dollar acquisitions for
Samsung, in companies with a strong interest in wireless audio.</p>
<p>Google owns Synaptics, Dysonics, RevX, and Tempow, all of which are
active in the development of wireless audio. Google also hired Peter Liu
from Bose, who was one of the original developers of the Bluetooth Low
Energy specification.</p>
<p>It is very much in the interest of companies like Apple, Samsung, and
Google to encourage their customers to buy into wireless Bluetooth
headphones. Or, better yet, to force them to do so, by taking away the
means to do anything else. After all, their executives have to justify
the billions of dollars they’ve spent, acquiring suppliers and
developers of wireless audio equipment.</p>
<p>The 3.5mm headphone jack has almost nothing to recommend it,
technically speaking. It was criticized by hi-fi enthusiasts almost from
its inception. The only things it has going for it are its simplicity,
and the fact that everybody uses it. Well, everybody outside the world
of mobile gadgets, anyway. This simplicity and ubiquity is a great
benefit to consumers, which is why Apple, et al., don’t want to provide
it – they have nothing to gain if consumers spend less money on their
products.</p>
<p>The loss of the headphone jack would have hurt even if there were
good technical reasons for it. As it turns out, there are none – it’s
just another cynical way for big businesses to gouge consumers. A side
effect of their strategy is that wired headphones themselves are
becoming less available, as cellphone users were until recently major
purchasers of these devices. It’s not difficult to get top-quality
headphones with a jack – they all have one; but there are fewer and
fewer mid-priced wired earbuds on the market.</p>
<p>The way to discourage companies behaving this way is for us all to
take our business elsewhere. It’s still possible to get decent
cellphones from Motorola, Asus, and Sony that retain the 3.5mm jack. I
don’t believe that anything recent from Apple, Samsung, or Google has
one, for reasons I explained earlier. Still, there are older cellphone
models from these suppliers that do have a jack, and which are still
good phones. I own the Samsung S10+, S10e, and Note 9, for example.
They’re a few years old, but they still do everything I want and
more.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the 3.5mm jack, it’s time to vote with your
wallet.</p>

            The National Institutes of Health said Friday that it is stopping its research of what’s commonly known as Havana syndrome, a mysterious illness experienced by a number of spies, soldiers and diplomats who have reported sudden debilitating symptoms of unknown origin.

            The NIH said it would end the work “out of an abundance of caution” after an internal investigation found that people had been coerced into to being part of the research.

            The coercion, the agency specified, was not on its own part, but the NIH did not elaborate as to who may have forced the participation. However, it noted that voluntary consent is a fundamental pillar of the ethical conduct of research.

            Some of the people who reported being sick previously claimed that the CIA made them join the research as a prerequisite for getting health care.

            In an editorial published in JAMA along with the studies, Dr. David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford who worked on earlier investigations of this patient population, argued that although the study involving brain scans appeared to show that “nothing, or nothing serious” happened with these cases, coming to this conclusion&nbsp;“would be ill-advised.”

            Other research has found evidence of abnormalities in the brain, he said, and the same is true for the study involving the tests.&nbsp;Because the condition can look different in each person, he said, doctors don’t have specific tests that can fully determine what’s wrong.

            “Clearly, new, sensitive, standardized, non-invasive tests of nervous system function, especially involving the vestibular system, are needed, such as more specific blood markers of different forms of cellular injury,” Relman wrote.

            The illness was dubbed Havana syndrome because it emerged in late 2016 in the Cuban capital. Some American diplomats reported symptoms that were consistent with head trauma, including dizziness and extreme headaches.

            There was longstanding speculation about a new kind of weapon as the cause of these illnesses, but the US intelligence community said last year that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/politics/us-intel-community-havana-syndrome/index.html">it cannot link any cases</a>&nbsp;to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US.

<p dir="auto">Processing is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) / playground built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It also has a p5js compatibility mode where some of the functions of <a href="https://p5js.org/" rel="nofollow">p5js</a> are available and scripts can have a similar structure to Processing sketches.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can type in a script with the builtin or your favorite text editor and then run it on a DOS command prompt.</p>

<p dir="auto">DOjS has a very simple integrated package manager (DPM). It can be started with <code>DPM.BAT</code>.
A working packet driver is needed to connect to the package index and download packages using HTTPS.
Packages (and the package index) are fetched from the <a href="https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjSHPackages">DOjS/jSH package repository</a>.
Downloaded packages are put into <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code> in the <code>PACKAGE/</code> directory.
Feel free to submit any packages you want to include in that repository using a pull request.
DPM commands:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>installed - list installed packages.</li>
<li>remove    - remove package.</li>
<li>fetch     - fetch package index from server.</li>
<li>install   - install a package (and its dependencies) from package index.</li>
<li>list      - list available packages in index.</li>
<li>setindex  - set index URL (HTTP or HTTPS).</li>
<li>help      - this help.;</li>
<li>quit      - exit dpm.</li>

<p dir="auto">DOjS supports most of the Glide3 API that was used with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx_Interactive" rel="nofollow">3dfx</a> accelerator cards. The following hardware is supported:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Voodoo 1 [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo 2 [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo 3 [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo 4 [tested by <a href="https://twitter.com/tunguska82" rel="nofollow">tunguska</a>]</li>
<li>Voodoo 5 [tested by <a href="https://twitter.com/tunguska82" rel="nofollow">tunguska</a>]</li>
<li>Voodoo Rush (all versions) [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo Banshee (PCI and AGP) [tested]</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Additionally you can use <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases">DOSBox-X</a> which emulates a Voodoo 1 card. Glide functions can be found in the 3dfx-module in the documentation, Javascript support functions have a "FX" prefix, all native functions are prefixed with "fx". Detailed Glide3-API documentation can be found on the internet, e.g. on <a href="http://falconfly.3dfx.pl/reference.htm" rel="nofollow">FalconFly Central</a>. <strong>Make sure you grab the Glide3 SDK and not Glide2!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the included DOS version of <code>TEXUS.EXE</code> to convert bitmaps to <code>3df</code> texture files that can be loaded as textures.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>!!! Attention !!!</strong>
3dfx/Glide3 support ONLY works in plain DOS, NOT in the DOS/command window of Windows 9x! Be sure to always boot into a pure DOS prompt before trying to use any of the fx-functions!
Before using 3dfx/Glide3 support you need to copy the appropriate <code>GLIDE3X.DXE</code> into the same directory as <code>DOJS.EXE</code>. You can do so by using the <code>V_XXX.BAT</code> scripts in the distribution ZIP archive.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scripts and resources</h2><a id="user-content-scripts-and-resources" aria-label="Permalink: Scripts and resources" href="#scripts-and-resources"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Scripts, as well as resources can either be stored in the file system or in ZIP files. To load data from a zip file the format is <code>&lt;ZIP filename&gt;=&lt;ZIP entry name&gt;</code> (e.g. <code>data.zip=mypic.bmp</code>). DOjS can be started with a script, a script in a ZIP file or no parameters. If the script was loaded from a ZIP file the running script can obtain resources from the same ZIP file by using <code>ZipPrefix()</code> to obtain paths refering to that ZIP. If the script was not started from a ZIP <code>ZipPrefix()</code> just passes through the file name (thus loading the file from HDD). If no arameters are supplied DOjS will first try to load <code>&lt;name of the EXE&gt;.ZIP=MAIN.JS</code> and then <code>JSBOOT.ZIP=MAIN.JS</code>.
Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DOJS.EXE -r script.js</code> will start <code>script.js</code> from the HDD, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>DOJS.EXE -r data.zip=script.js</code> will start <code>script.js</code> from the ZIP file <code>data.zip</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>data.zip=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>HURTZ.EXE</code> DOjS was renamed to <code>HURTZ.EXE</code>. It will start <code>MAIN.JS</code> from the ZIP file <code>HURTZ.ZIP</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>HURTZ.ZIP=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>DOJS.EXE</code> The script was added to <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code>. DOjS will start <code>MAIN.JS</code> from the ZIP file <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>JSBOOT.ZIP=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API documentation</h2><a id="user-content-api-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: API documentation" href="#api-documentation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can find the full API doc in the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjS/blob/master/doc/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">doc/html/</a> directory.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Script format</h2><a id="user-content-script-format" aria-label="Permalink: Script format" href="#script-format"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Scripts need to provide three functions: <code>Setup()</code>, <code>Loop()</code> and <code>Input()</code>. Scripts are loaded and executed top-own. After that <code>Setup()</code> is called once and then <code>Loop()</code> repeatedly. <code>Input()</code> is called whenever mouse of keyboard input happens.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup()</h3><a id="user-content-setup" aria-label="Permalink: Setup()" href="#setup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This function is called once at startup. It can initialize variables, setup hardware, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Loop()</h3><a id="user-content-loop" aria-label="Permalink: Loop()" href="#loop"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This function is called after setup repeatedly until <code>Stop()</code> is called. After calling <code>Stop()</code> the program ends when <code>Loop()</code> exits.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Input(event)</h3><a id="user-content-inputevent" aria-label="Permalink: Input(event)" href="#inputevent"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This function is called whenever mouse/keyboard input happens.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">IPX networking</h2><a id="user-content-ipx-networking" aria-label="Permalink: IPX networking" href="#ipx-networking"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DOjS supports IPX networking. Node addresses are arrays of 6 numbers between 0-255. Default socket number and broadcast address definitions can be found in <code>jsboot/ipx.js</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Drawing functions</h2><a id="user-content-drawing-functions" aria-label="Permalink: Drawing functions" href="#drawing-functions"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Add <code>Include('p5');</code> as first line to your script. After that you have (limited) <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/" rel="nofollow">p5.js</a> compatibility.
Things that don't work:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Anything 3D (objects, lights camera, etc)</li>
<li>Key release events work different for Allegro and are simulated for p5js.</li>
<li>Only simple vertices are supported.</li>
<li>no DOM</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Logfile</h2><a id="user-content-logfile" aria-label="Permalink: Logfile" href="#logfile"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All output via <code>Print()</code> and <code>Println()</code> is sent to the file <code>JSLOG.TXT</code>. You can use <code>Debug()</code> instead and output is only generated when you set the global variable <code>DEBUG=true</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Remote logging/debugging</h2><a id="user-content-remote-loggingdebugging" aria-label="Permalink: Remote logging/debugging" href="#remote-loggingdebugging"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This feature allows you to debug a running script via IPX networking and a second machine. To use remote logging do the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Put both machines on the same network.</li>
<li>Run <code>DOJS.EXE -r JSBOOT\LOGVIEW.JS</code> on one machine.</li>
<li>Enable debugging by setting <code>DEBUG=true</code> and enable remote debugging by <code>REMOTE_DEBUG=true</code>. You can either modify <code>JSBOOT\FUNC.JS</code> or change the variables at the very beginning of your script.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This works fine with two instances of DOSBox as well.
Please note that if the log messages are transmitted to fast the receiving instance of DOJS might skip some of these when displaying.</p>
