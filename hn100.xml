<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div containerclass="" data-astro-cid-zgyzv6ok=""><!----><p><span>IKEA is launching 21 new smart home products focusing on lighting, sensors, and control — all built to work with Matter, the universal smart home standard. The launch marks a significant step in making smart home technology easier to use, more affordable, and better adapted to real-life needs in the home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With this launch, IKEA is rebuilding its smart home system and product range from the ground up. The new launch reflects years of development and testing in real homes, and a growing understanding of how people want smart products to work in their daily life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The launch includes both new products and updates to existing categories – now built to work with Matter. This means IKEA smart products can connect with a wider range of devices and platforms, making it easier for customers to build a smart home across different brands.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Until now, smart home technology hasn’t been easy enough to use for most people — or affordable enough for many to consider. This launch brings us closer to helping everyone feel ready and confident to get started,” says David Granath, Range Manager at IKEA of Sweden.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The updated range focuses on three key segments*, that provide the building blocks of a smart home that’s flexible, intuitive, and easy to expand over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Lighting</strong> – The new smart bulb range from IKEA. Comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, lumen levels and styles, including colour and white spectrum options, and dimmable features.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><strong>Sensors</strong> – motion, air quality, humidity and water leakage sensors designed to support wellbeing and prevent damage&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><strong>Control </strong>– Remotes that make it easy to control devices from a distance, and a smart plug that can turn any product into a smart product.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><em><span>*</span></em><span>Full product list further down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This launch is about making the smart home experience better and broader. We're upgrading our most-appreciated products while also adding new ones to solve even more everyday challenges. Our focus has been on keeping things simple from setup to daily use, so it’s easy for people to start, use and grow a smart home,” says Stjepan Begic, Product Developer at IKEA of Sweden.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>All Matter-enabled products need a smart home hub to work — like IKEA’s DIRIGERA hub, or one from another brand. As a </span><a data-track-category="Text link" href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/sustainability/ikea-announces-new-chapter-in-designing-technology-for-the-home-250709/"><span>certified Matter controller</span></a><span>, DIRIGERA can also manage and control smart products from other manufacturers and brands. As a </span><a data-track-category="Text link" href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/innovation/ikea-dirigera-matter-bridge-240911/"><span>Matter Bridge</span></a><span>, it ensures that existing IKEA non-Matter smart products will also be compatible with platforms using the Matter standard.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This launch is the first step in a broader update of the IKEA Home smart range. Looking ahead, IKEA will continue expanding into new product categories. The strategy is to launch products that are easier to use and more affordable than existing ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Our goal is still the same as when we started exploring the smart home in 2012: to make it easy to use, easy to understand, and within reach for the many. We start with understanding life at home, where we continuously watch, listen and learn what makes a difference in everyday life. We believe technology should serve a purpose, not exist for its own sake. With more than 900 million store visits each year, I think we’re in a good place to help more people discover the benefits of a smarter home,” says David Granath.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sales start and local pricing may vary between markets.

    <blockquote>
<p>Disclosure: Certain sections of this content were grammatically refined/updated using AI assistance, as English is not my first language. Quite ironic, I know, given the subject being discussed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have spent the better part of a decade in the bug bounty industry, and my perspective on this industry is shaped by this experience. The first five years were spent as a bug hunter and vulnerability researcher, where I developed an intimate understanding of what it takes to find, verify, and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities. The last five years have been spent at <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> (Nov, 2020 - Present), starting as a vulnerability triager where I personally reviewed tens of thousands of submissions, and now as a Team Lead overseeing technical services with a focus on triage operations.</p>
<p>This combination of experience, having worked both sides of the vulnerability reporting ecosystem, from the researcher's perspective to the bug bounty platform's operations, gives me a particular vantage point on how the industry is fracturing under the weight of AI-generated noise. I've reviewed the borderline cases where it's genuinely unclear whether a report is a hallucination or a real finding. I've felt the frustration of maintainers whose inboxes are drowning. I've also seen the pressure that platforms face trying to maintain quality while scaling to handle the deluge.</p>
<p>However, I want to be explicit: these are my personal views and observations, informed by my professional experience but not representative of my employer in any way. HackerOne, as an organization, has its own perspectives, strategies, and positions on these issues. My analysis here reflects my own thinking about the systemic problems I see and potential solutions, not company doctrine or strategy.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-the-problem">The Anatomy of the Problem</h3><p>There are fundamental issues with how AI has infiltrated vulnerability reporting, and they mirror the social dynamics that plague any feedback system.</p>
<p>First, the typical AI-powered reporter, especially one just pasting GPT output into a submission form, neither knows enough about the actual codebase being examined nor understands the security implications well enough to provide insight that projects need. The AI doesn't read code; it pattern-matches. It sees functions that look similar to vulnerable patterns and invents scenarios where they might be exploited, regardless of whether those scenarios are even possible in the actual implementation.</p>
<p>Second, some actors with misaligned incentives interpret high submission volume as achievement. By flooding bug bounty programs with AI-generated reports, they feel productive and entrepreneurial. Some genuinely believe the AI has found something real. Others know it's questionable but figure they'll let the maintainers sort it out. The incentive is to submit as many reports as possible and see what sticks, because even a 5% hit rate on a hundred submissions is better than the effort of manually verifying five findings.</p>
<p>The result? <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/">Daniel Stenberg, who maintains curl</a>, now sees about 20% of all security submissions as AI-generated slop, while the rate of genuine vulnerabilities has dropped to approximately 5%. Think about that ratio. For every real vulnerability, there are now four fake ones. And every fake one consumes hours of expert time to disprove.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-human-cost-nobody-talks-about">The Human Cost Nobody Talks About</h3><p>A security report lands in your inbox. It claims there's a buffer overflow in a specific function. The report is well-formatted, includes CVE-style nomenclature, and uses appropriate technical language. As a responsible maintainer, you can't just dismiss it. You alert your security team, volunteers, by the way, who have day jobs and families and maybe three hours a week for this work.</p>
<p>Three people read the report. One person tries to reproduce the issue using the steps provided. They can't, because the steps reference test cases that don't exist. Another person examines the source code. The function mentioned in the report doesn't exist in that form. A third person checks whether there's any similar functionality that might be vulnerable in the way described. There isn't.</p>
<p>After an hour and a half of combined effort across three people, that's 4.5 person-hours—you've confirmed what you suspected: this report is garbage. Probably AI-generated garbage, based on the telltale signs of hallucinated function names and impossible attack vectors.</p>
<p>You close the report. You don't get those hours back. And tomorrow, two more reports just like it will arrive.</p>
<p><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/">The curl project has seven people on its security team</a>. They collaborate on every submission, with three to four members typically engaging with each report. In early July 2025, they were receiving approximately two security reports per week. The math is brutal. If you have three hours per week to contribute to an open source project you love, and a single false report consumes all of it, you've contributed nothing that week except proving someone's AI hallucinated a vulnerability.</p>
<p>The emotional toll compounds exponentially. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/">Stenberg describes it as "mind-numbing stupidities"</a> that the team must process. It's not just frustration, it's the specific demoralization that comes from having your expertise and goodwill systematically exploited by people who couldn't be bothered to verify their submissions before wasting your time.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-broader-burnout-crisis">The Broader Burnout Crisis</h3><p>According to <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/community/maintainer-burnout-a-problem-what-are-we-to-do.html">Intel's annual open source community survey</a>, 45% of respondents identified maintainer burnout as their top challenge. <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/maintainer-burnout-is-real/">The Tidelift State of the Open Source Maintainer Survey</a> is even more stark: 58% of maintainers have either quit their projects entirely (22%) or seriously considered quitting (36%).</p>
<p>Why are they quitting? The top reason, cited by 54% of maintainers, is that other things in their life and work took priority over open source contributions. Over half (51%) reported losing interest in the work. And 44% explicitly identified experiencing burnout.</p>
<p>But here's the gut punch: <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/maintainer-burnout-is-real/">the percentage of maintainers who said they weren't getting paid enough to make maintenance work worthwhile rose from 32% to 38%</a> between survey periods. These are people maintaining infrastructure that powers billions of dollars of commercial activity, and they're getting nothing. Or maybe they get $500 a year from GitHub Sponsors while companies make millions off their work.</p>
<p>The maintenance work itself is rarely rewarding. You're not building exciting new features. You're addressing technical debt, responding to user demands, managing security issues, and now—increasingly—sorting through AI-generated garbage to find the occasional legitimate report. It's like being a security guard who has to investigate every single alarm, knowing that 95% of them are false, but unable to ignore any because that one real threat could be catastrophic.</p>
<p>When you're volunteering out of love in a market society, you're setting yourself up to be exploited.</p>
<p>And the exploitation is getting worse. Toxic communities, hyper-responsibility for critical infrastructure, and now the weaponization of AI to automate the creation of work for maintainers—it all adds up to an unsustainable situation.</p>
<p>One Kubernetes contributor put it simply: <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/community/maintainer-burnout-a-problem-what-are-we-to-do.html">"If your maintainers are burned out, they can't be protecting the code base like they're going to need to be."</a> This transforms maintainer wellbeing from a human resources concern into a security imperative. Burned-out maintainers miss things. They make mistakes. They eventually quit, leaving projects unmaintained or understaffed.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-ai-slop-actually-looks-like">What AI Slop Actually Looks Like</h3><p>A typical AI slop report will reference function names that don't exist in the codebase. The AI has seen similar function names in its training data and invents plausible sounding variations. It will describe memory operations that would indeed be problematic if they existed as described, but which bear no relationship to how the code actually works.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/bagder/07f7581f6e3d78ef37dfbfc81fd1d1cd">One report to curl claimed an HTTP/3 vulnerability and included fake function calls and behaviors that appeared nowhere in the actual codebase.</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/bagder/07f7581f6e3d78ef37dfbfc81fd1d1cd">Stenberg has publicly shared a list of AI-generated security submissions received through HackerOne</a>, and they all follow similar patterns, professional formatting, appropriate jargon, and completely fabricated technical details.</p>
<p>The sophistication varies. Some reports are obviously generated by someone who just pasted a repository URL into ChatGPT and asked it to find vulnerabilities. Others show more effort—the submitter may have fed actual code snippets to the AI and then submitted its analysis without verification. Both are equally useless to maintainers, but the latter takes longer to disprove because the code snippets are real even if the vulnerability analysis is hallucinated.</p>
<p>Here's why language models fail so catastrophically at this task: they're designed to be helpful and provide positive responses. When you prompt an LLM to generate a vulnerability report, it will generate one regardless of whether a vulnerability exists. The model has no concept of truth—only of plausibility. It assembles technical terminology into patterns that resemble security reports it has seen during training, but it cannot verify whether the specific claims it's making are accurate.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental problem: AI can generate the form of security research without the substance.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-cve-system-is-also-collapsing">The CVE System is Also Collapsing</h3><p>While AI slop floods individual project inboxes, <a href="https://autobahn-security.com/blog/cve-database-crisis/">the broader CVE infrastructure faces its own existential crisis</a>. And these crises compound each other in dangerous ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://autobahn-security.com/blog/cve-database-crisis/">In April 2025, MITRE Corporation announced that its contract to maintain the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program would expire.</a> The Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the long-term contract, creating a funding lapse that affects everything: national vulnerability databases, advisories, tool vendors, and incident response operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://autobahn-security.com/blog/cve-database-crisis/">The National Vulnerability Database experienced catastrophic problems throughout 2024.</a> CVE submissions jumped 32% while creating massive processing delays. By March 2025, NVD had analyzed fewer than 300 CVEs, leaving more than 30,000 vulnerabilities backlogged. Approximately 42% of CVEs lack essential metadata like severity scores and product information.</p>
<p>Now layer AI slop onto this already-stressed system. Invalid CVEs are being assigned at scale. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/944209/">A 2023 analysis by former insiders suggested that only around 20% of CVEs were valid, with the remainder being duplicates, invalid, or inflated.</a> The issues include multiple CVEs being assigned for the same bug, CNAs siding with reporters over project developers even when there's no genuine dispute, and reporters receiving CVEs based on test cases rather than actual distinct vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The result is that the vulnerability tracking system everyone relies on is becoming less trustworthy exactly when we need it most. Security teams can't rely on CVE assignments to prioritize their work. Developers don't trust vulnerability scanners because false positive rates are through the roof. The signal-to-noise ratio has deteriorated so badly that the entire system risks becoming useless.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-doesnt-work">What Doesn't Work</h3><p>Banning submitters doesn't work at scale. You can ban an account, but creating new accounts is trivial. HackerOne implements reputation scoring where points are gained or lost based on report validity, but this hasn't stemmed the tide because the cost of creating throwaway accounts is essentially zero.</p>
<p>Asking people to "please verify before submitting" doesn't work. The incentive structure rewards volume, and people either genuinely believe their AI-generated reports are valid or don't care enough to verify. Polite requests assume good faith, but much of the slop comes from actors who have no stake in the community norms.</p>
<p>Trying to educate submitters about how AI works doesn't scale. For every person you educate, ten new ones appear with fresh GPT accounts. The problem isn't knowledge—it's incentives.</p>
<p>Simply closing inboxes or shutting down bug bounty programs "works" in the sense that it stops the slop, but it also stops legitimate security research. Several projects have done this, and now they're less secure because they've lost a channel for responsible disclosure.</p>
<p>None of the easy answers work because this isn't an easy problem.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-might-actually-work">What Might Actually Work</h3><p><strong>Disclosure Requirements</strong> represent the first line of defense. <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/django-joins-curl-in-pushing-back-on-ai-slop-security-reports">Both curl and Django now require submitters to disclose whether AI was used in generating reports.</a> <a href="https://opensourcesecurity.io/2025/2025-05-curl_vs_ai_with_daniel_stenberg/">Curl's approach is particularly direct: disclose AI usage upfront and ensure complete accuracy before submission.</a> If AI usage is disclosed, expect extensive follow-up questions demanding proof that the bug is genuine before the team invests time in verification. This works psychologically. It forces submitters to acknowledge they're using AI, which makes them more conscious of their responsibility to verify. It also gives maintainers grounds to reject slop immediately if AI usage was undisclosed but becomes obvious during review. <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/django-joins-curl-in-pushing-back-on-ai-slop-security-reports">Django goes further with a section titled "Note for AI Tools" that directly addresses language models themselves, reiterating that the project expects no hallucinated content, no fictitious vulnerabilities, and a requirement to independently verify that reports describe reproducible security issues.</a></p>
<p><strong>Proof-of-Concept Requirements</strong> raise the bar significantly. Requiring technical evidence such as screencasts showing reproducibility, integration or unit tests demonstrating the fault, or complete reproduction steps with logs and source code makes it much harder to submit slop. AI can generate a description of a vulnerability, but it cannot generate working exploit code for a vulnerability that doesn't exist. Requiring proof forces the submitter to actually verify their claim. If they can't reproduce it, they can't prove it, and you don't waste time investigating. Projects are choosing to make it harder to submit in order to filter out the garbage, betting that real researchers will clear the bar while slop submitters won't.</p>
<p><strong>Reputation and Trust Systems</strong> offer a social mechanism for filtering. Only users with a history of validated submissions get unrestricted reporting privileges or monetary bounties. New reporters could be required to have established community members vouch for them, creating a web-of-trust model. This mirrors how the world worked before bug bounty platforms commodified security research. You built reputation over time through consistent, high-quality contributions. The downside is that it makes it harder for new researchers to enter the field, and it risks creating an insider club. But the upside is that it filters out low-effort actors who won't invest in building reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Friction</strong> fundamentally alters the incentive structure. Charge a nominal refundable fee—say $50—for each submission from new or unproven users. If the report is valid, they get the fee back plus the bounty. If it's invalid, you keep the fee. This immediately makes mass AI submission uneconomical. If someone's submitting 50 AI-generated reports hoping one sticks, that's now $2,500 at risk. But for a legitimate researcher submitting one carefully verified finding, $50 is a trivial barrier that gets refunded anyway. Some projects are considering dropping monetary rewards entirely. The logic is that if there's no money involved, there's no incentive for speculative submissions. But this risks losing legitimate researchers who rely on bounties as income. It's a scorched earth approach that solves the slop problem by eliminating the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>AI-Assisted Triage</strong> represents fighting fire with fire. Use AI tools trained specifically to identify AI-generated slop and flag it for immediate rejection. <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/beyond-the-noise-hai-triage-insight-agent">HackerOne's Hai Triage system embodies this approach, using AI agents to cut through noise before human analysts validate findings.</a> The risk is obvious: what if your AI filter rejects legitimate reports? What if it's biased against certain communication styles or methodologies? You've just automated discrimination. But the counterargument is that human maintainers are already overwhelmed, and imperfect filtering is better than drowning. The key is transparency and appeals. If an AI filter rejects a report, there should be a clear mechanism for the submitter to contest the decision and get human review.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency and Public Accountability</strong> leverage community norms. <a href="https://gist.github.com/bagder/07f7581f6e3d78ef37dfbfc81fd1d1cd">Curl recently formalized that all submitted security reports will be made public once reviewed and deemed non-sensitive.</a> This means that fabricated or misleading reports won't just be rejected, they'll be exposed to public scrutiny. This works as both deterrent and educational tool. If you know your slop report will be publicly documented with your name attached, you might think twice. And when other researchers see examples of what doesn't constitute a valid report, they learn what standards they need to meet. The downside is that public shaming can be toxic and might discourage good-faith submissions from inexperienced researchers. Projects implementing this approach need to be careful about tone and focus on the technical content rather than attacking submitters personally.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="sustainability-is-hard">Sustainability is Hard</h3><p>Every hour spent evaluating slop reports is an hour not spent on features, documentation, or actual security improvements. And maintainers are already working for free, maintaining infrastructure that generates billions in commercial value. When 38% of maintainers cite not getting paid enough as a reason for quitting, and <a href="https://darktechinsights.com/open-source-hidden-costs-developers/">97% of open source maintainers are unpaid despite massive commercial exploitation of their work</a>, the system is already broken.</p>
<p>AI slop is just the latest exploitation vector. It's the most visible one right now, but it's not the root cause. The root cause is that we've built a global technology infrastructure on the volunteer labor of people who get nothing in return except burnout and harassment.</p>
<p>So what does sustainability actually look like?</p>
<p>First, it looks like money. Real money. Not GitHub Sponsors donations that average $500 a year. Not swag and conference tickets. Actual salaries commensurate with the value being created. Companies that build products on open source infrastructure need to fund the maintainers of that infrastructure. This could happen through direct employment, foundation grants, or the Open Source Pledge model where companies commit percentages of revenue.</p>
<p>Second, it looks like better tooling and automation that genuinely reduces workload rather than creating new forms of work. Automated dependency management, continuous security scanning integrated into development workflows, and sophisticated triage assistance that actually works. The goal is to make maintenance less time-consuming so burnout becomes less likely.</p>
<p>Third, it looks like shared workload and team building. No single volunteer should be a single point of failure. Building teams with checks and balances where members keep each other from taking on too much creates sustainability. Finding additional contributors willing to share the burden rather than expecting heroic individual effort acknowledges that most people have limited time available for unpaid work.</p>
<p>Fourth, it looks like culture change. Fostering empathy in interactions, starting communications with gratitude even when rejecting contributions, and publicly acknowledging the critical work maintainers perform reduces emotional toll. Demonstrating clear processes for handling security issues gives confidence rather than trying to hide problems.</p>
<p>Fifth, it looks like advocacy and policy at organizational and governmental levels. Recognition that <a href="https://tfir.io/kubernetes-maintainer-burnout-open-source-sustainability/">maintainer burnout represents existential threat to technology infrastructure</a>. Development of regulations requiring companies benefiting from open source to contribute resources. Establishment of security standards that account for the realities of volunteer-run projects.</p>
<p>Without addressing these fundamentals, no amount of technical sophistication will prevent collapse.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-arms-race-ahead">The Arms Race Ahead</h3><p>The CVE slop crisis is just the beginning. We're entering an arms race between AI-assisted attackers or abusers and AI-assisted defenders, and nobody knows how it ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/hackerone-report-finds-210-spike-ai-vulnerability-reports-amid-rise-ai-autonomy">HackerOne's research indicates that 70% of security researchers now use AI tools in their workflow.</a> AI-powered testing is becoming the industry standard. <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/hackerone-report-finds-210-spike-ai-vulnerability-reports-amid-rise-ai-autonomy">The emergence of fully autonomous hackbots—AI systems that submitted over 560 valid reports in the first half of 2025—signals both opportunity and threat.</a></p>
<p>The divergence will be between researchers who use AI as a tool to enhance genuinely skilled work versus those who use it to automate low-effort spam. The former represents the promise of democratizing security research and scaling our ability to find vulnerabilities. The latter represents the threat of making the signal-to-noise problem completely unmanageable.</p>
<p>The challenge is developing mechanisms that encourage the first group while defending against the second.</p>
<p>This probably means moving toward more exclusive models. Invite-only programs. Dramatically higher standards for participation. Reputation systems that take years to build. New models for coordinated vulnerability disclosure that assume AI-assisted research as the baseline and require proof beyond "here's what the AI told me."</p>
<p>It might mean the end of open bug bounty programs as we know them. Maybe that's necessary. Maybe the experiment of "anyone can submit anything" was only viable when the cost of submitting was high enough to ensure some minimum quality. Now that AI has reduced that cost to near-zero, the experiment might fail soon if things don't improve.</p>
<p>So, net-net, here's where we are:</p>
<p>When it comes to vulnerability reports, what matters is who submits them and whether they've actually verified their claims. Accepting reports from everyone indiscriminately is backfiring catastrophically because projects are latching onto submissions that sound plausible while ignoring the cumulative evidence that most are noise.</p>
<p>You want to receive reports from someone who has actually verified their claims, understands the architecture of what they're reporting on, and isn't trying to game the bounty system or offload verification work onto maintainers.</p>
<p>Such people exist, but they're becoming harder to find amidst the deluge of AI-generated content. That's why projects have to be selective about which reports they investigate and which submitters they trust.</p>
<p>Remember: not all vulnerability reports are legitimate. Not all feedback is worthwhile. It matters who is doing the reporting and what their incentives are.</p>
<p>The CVE slop crisis shows the fragility of open source security. Volunteer maintainers, already operating at burnout levels, face an explosion of AI-generated false reports that consume their limited time and emotional energy. The systems designed to track and manage vulnerabilities struggle under dual burden of structural underfunding and slop inundation.</p>
<p>The path forward requires holistic solutions combining technical filtering with fundamental changes to how we support and compensate open source labor. AI can be part of the solution through better triage, but it cannot substitute for adequate resources, reasonable workloads, and human judgment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sustainability of open source security depends on recognizing that people who maintain critical infrastructure deserve more than exploitation.</p>
<p>They deserve compensation, support, reasonable expectations, and protection from abuse. Without addressing these fundamentals, no amount of technical sophistication will prevent the slow collapse of the collaborative model that has produced so much of the digital infrastructure modern life depends on.</p>
<p>The CVE slop crisis isn't merely about bad vulnerability reports. It's about whether we'll choose to sustain the human foundation of technological progress, or whether we'll let it burn out under the weight of automated exploitation.</p>
<p>That's the choice we're facing. And right now, we're choosing wrong.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <figure><a href="https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2025/10/unnamed-1.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2025/10/unnamed-1-1024x683.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>Natalie Grabow, 80, of New Jersey, was the oldest finisher and winner of the 80-84 age group in this year’s Ironman World Championship in Kona on Oct. 11, 2025.

<p>When Natalie Grabow grew up in the 1940s and 50s in New Jersey, there were not a lot of opportunities for girls to do sports.</p>



<p>“We were cheerleaders,” Grabow said. “I begged my mother to give me gymnastics lessons, but parents at that time didn’t give you any lessons. We just ran around outside and rode bikes.”</p>



<p>But Grabow always has had a competitive spirit, and that shined through last Saturday when Grabow crossed the finish line on Ali’i Drive. </p>



<p>“You are an Ironman” the announcer said as Grabow, at age 80, became the oldest female ever to finish the Ironman World Championship in Kona. </p>



<p>The previous oldest was Cherie Gruenfeld when she finished the championship race at 78 years old in 2022.</p>



<div><p><span><b>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD</b></span></p></div><div><p><span><b>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD</b></span></p></div><p>“I had a good day and I’m just really pleased with myself,” Grabow said Thursday.</p>



<p>The mother of two and grandmother of four said her goal when she entered the water at Kailua Bay a week ago for the swim leg was to complete the grueling 140.6-mile triathlon before the 17-hour cutoff.</p>



<p>She did, with just under 15 minutes to spare, completing the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and the 26.2-mile run in 16 hours, 45 minutes and 26 seconds. </p>



<p>Of the approximately 1,600 females in the championship race, she was the only person in her 80-84 age group.</p>



<p>It was her 11th Ironman race despite not learning to swim until she was 59 and not starting triathlons until she was 60.</p>



<div id="mn_videoad_midarticle"><p><span><b>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD</b></span></p></div><p>“I’m still not comfortable with swimming,” she said. “If you haven’t grown up swimming, it feels like an awkward endeavor.”</p>



<p>During the first leg of the race, Grabow said Kailua Bay was choppy and congested with swimmers. But her only thought was to be out of the water before the cut-off of 2 hours and 20 minute<strong>s </strong>that would have eliminated her from the race.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Grabow said she is familiar with the conditions on Hawai‘i Island.</p>



<p>“It’s hot, humid and windy,” she said. “You really need to watch your nutrition and salt intake so you don’t cramp up.”</p>



<p>Grabow worked as a software engineer. While raising her daughters, she played tennis and did step aerobics.</p>



<div><p><span><b>ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD</b></span></p></div><p>Grabow’s daughter, Amy Rousseau, said her mom was her track coach from ages 9 to 13.</p>



<p>“It was amazing that she would put her time into it,” Rousseau said. “Maybe because she didn’t have access to that, she wanted to make sure the next generation did.”</p>



<p>After going back to work full time in her early 40s, Grabow started running to stay active. However, she seemed to never be completely healthy and would get regular knee injuries.</p>



<p>A friend turned her on to the triathlon as a way to stay active and mix things up.</p>



<p>“I like to do something every day,” Grabow said. “If something bothers me in the swim, I can get on the bike.”</p>



<p>Grabow said that had she been able to participate in a sport growing up, she speculated it might have been a sprint-distance runner because she loves to move.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2025/10/natalie-before-swim.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="675" height="1024" src="https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2025/10/natalie-before-swim-675x1024.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>Natalie Grabow, 80, of New Jersey, getting ready to start the swim during the Ironman World Championship in Kona on Oct. 11, 2025. (Photo courtesy: Amy Rousseau)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I think girls and young women today don’t realize how lucky they are with the options they have,” Grabow said.</p>



<p>And, participating in triathlons is an “excellent” opportunity, because amateurs like herself can race side-by-side with the pros.</p>



<p>Grabow, who competed in three 70.3 Ironman races this year, said as she’s gotten older, she’s slower, especially as she hit the 80 milestone.</p>



<p>With that in mind, hitting the time cut-off was critical to her. She said she had a slow swim (1:47:41) and bike (7:51:27), but finished strong with a faster run (6:40:11).</p>



<p>“I didn’t have any dark moments,” Grabow said. “I did have some hamstring tightness before the race, but didn’t have time to rest it. I knew I wouldn’t bike as hard, but in the long run, I think it helped. I took more time and took in nutrition and salt.”</p>



<p>Once she started the run, Grabow felt fine. Her coach and daughter, Amy Rousseau, were on the sidelines cheering her on and keeping her on schedule. As she approached the finish line, she tripped.</p>



<p>“That was such a surprise,” Grabow said. “I guess I just didn’t pick up my feet, or the carpet was wrinkled there.”</p>



<p>It didn’t take long for Grabow to pick herself up and cross the finish line, where the announcer declared her an “Ironman.”</p>



<p>“It didn’t bother me, it was just embarrassing,” Grabow said of the fumble.</p>



<p>Rousseau tracked her mother throughout the race, saying she looked strong the entire time. Despite the trip at the end, “she did bounce right back up and kept going and didn’t stay down.”</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2025/10/amy-and-natalie.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="959" src="https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2025/10/amy-and-natalie-1024x959.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>Amy Rousseau with her mother, Natalie Grabow, 80, before the Ironman World Championship race in Kona on Oct. 11, 2025. (Photo courtesy: Amy Rousseau)</figcaption></figure>



<p>“For many 80-year-olds, that (fall) would break a hip or collar bone,” Rousseau said.</p>



<p>But not her mom.</p>



<p>“She showed her spirit throughout that part,” Rousseau said. “I’m so proud of her.”</p>



<p>After the race, Rousseau and Grabow were walking around Ali‘i Drive when her mother declared triathlon racing “was what I was meant to do.”</p>



<p>“It’s a great fit for her,” Rousseau, 50, said. “She loves the training. Triathlon has occupied her mind in a good way.”</p>



<p>Rousseau has been to Kona as her mom’s cheerleader about five times, including the first race in 2006.</p>



<p>This year, Rousseau created a system to follow Grabow throughout the course, watching her finish the bike and start her run: “I rode my bike on the shoulder, keeping an eye on her and making sure she was OK. This was just a race against the clock, and she looked strong the whole time.”</p>



<p>In the past, Rousseau said her mom would jog, then walk through the aid stations, but “she ran the whole thing.”</p>



<p>“I don’t know how she does it,” Rousseau said. “What a great role model and example of what working hard and sticking with something and riding out the highs and lows. You just keep going. You never give up. She’s demonstrated that throughout my life.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We’re living through the weirdest moment in human history.</p>



<p>For the first time since, well, ever, the cost of creating content has dropped to essentially zero. Not “cheaper than before”, but like actually free.</p>



<p>It’s so easy to generate a thousand blog posts or ten thousand “””personalized””” emails and it barely costs you anything (for now).</p>



<p>In theory this sounds great, infinite content. Giving words to those who struggled before.</p>



<p>So many opportunities.</p>



<p>But if you’re trying to sell, <strong>trust is collapsing faster than content is proliferating.</strong></p>



<p>And I don’t mean “trust” in some abstract sense, but the real – who’s real, who’s credible, and what should I be paying attention to?</p>



<p>We’re not moving forward. We’re definitely moving backwards.</p>



<h3>A tale of a B2B SaaS company</h3>



<p>I know someone who runs a B2B SaaS company’s sales – he’s very smart. He spent many many years building his network and being a “relationship builder” type of seller – earning trust the old-fashioned way.</p>



<p>When we spoke last Sunday, he told me “I ignore all email outreach, and I barely even pick up the phone if I don’t know who it is”</p>



<p>“I can’t tell if it’s a real person or someone who’s scraped my details. I used to be able to tell. Now I can’t. So I just… don’t engage. Not worth my time.”</p>



<p>To dumb it down for you if you’re doing this outbound – he’s not asking “do I need this product?” that you’re selling, but he’s asking “why should I trust <em>you</em> specifically to deliver it?” – and you’re not getting through with that.</p>



<h3>Marketing funnel? Nah. Meet the trust funnel</h3>



<p>If being in marketing has taught me something, is that the “rules” and “playbooks” optimize for the wrong question – we craft positioning that explains <em>what</em> we do and <em>why</em> it matters.</p>



<p>In many cases, your prospect already knows they need what you’re selling.</p>



<p>They don’t need <em>another</em> pitch deck explaining why AI coding assistants increase developer productivity or why they can send more e-mails with an AI SDR.</p>



<p>They’ve seen forty of those this month (can we talk about how many AI SDRs there are????)</p>



<p>Honestly, this hurts saying too, but they don’t need proof that outcome-based pricing aligns incentives better than seat licenses. They read one of my 40 articles on the topic already.</p>



<p>What they actually want to know is “why the hell would I buy it from <em>you</em> instead of the other hundred companies spamming my inbox with identical claims?”</p>



<p>And because everything is AI slop now, answering that question became harder for them.</p>

<p>If you haven’t heard already, here are the differences between a marketing funnel and a trust funnel:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Aspect</th><th data-align="left">Marketing funnel</th><th data-align="left">Trust funnel</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Main Focus</td><td data-align="left">Lead generation and conversions</td><td data-align="left">Relationship building and customer loyalty</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">End Point</td><td data-align="left">Purchase or conversion</td><td data-align="left">Ongoing customer advocacy and retention</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Content Strategy</td><td data-align="left">Promotional, sales-focused</td><td data-align="left">Helpful, customer-focused, value-driven</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Success Metrics</td><td data-align="left">Conversion rates, sales numbers</td><td data-align="left">Satisfaction, repeat business, advocacy</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Timeline</td><td data-align="left">Short to medium-term</td><td data-align="left">Long-term, compounding trust</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s clear that you need to be on that trust side!</p>



<h3>With normal marketing funnels, lead generation sucks now</h3>



<p>It’s simply too boring.</p>



<p>When a Claude license is like, $10 a month – content creation costs are effectively zero. Now everyone can afford to <em>look</em> credible. Perfect grammar. Personalized outreach that references your LinkedIn posts (albeit badly).</p>



<p>All of it can be generated in minutes, with no human intervention.</p>



<p>Which means <strong>all of it is now suspect.</strong></p>



<p>I now send all e-mail AND LinkedIn messages to the trash.</p>



<p>Why? Because I can actually tell they didn’t come from humans who care about me or my problem.</p>



<p>They’re all “vaguely” personalized, and they’re all “curious” about how I do something. Why? Because <a href="https://outboundrepublic.com/blog/the-psychology-of-cold-outreach-why-people-reply/">“I’m curious about…” is in a playbook</a> that supposedly gets good responses.</p>







<p>This is the trust collapse for me: <strong>it’s not that I don’t believe your product works. I don’t believe you’re a real human who will still care after you sign the contract.</strong></p>



<h3>Rates are down, I’ll just send more messages</h3>



<p>God, no. Stop.</p>



<p>That’s not the issue.</p>



<p><strong>Old World (…-2024):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Cost to produce credible, personalized outreach: $50/hour (human labor)</li>



<li>Volume of credible outreach a prospect receives: ~10/week</li>



<li>Prospect’s ability to evaluate authenticity: <strong>Pattern recognition works ~80% of time</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New World (2025-…):</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Cost to produce credible, personalized outreach: effectively 0</li>



<li>Volume of credible outreach a prospect receives: ~200/week</li>



<li>Prospect’s ability to evaluate authenticity: <strong>Pattern recognition works ~20% of time</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The signal-to-noise ratio has hit a breaking point where the cost of verification exceeds the expected value of engagement.</p>



<p>So prospects don’t verify. They just assume everything is noise. This is why I (and my friend) ignore all outreach, and I’m far from alone.</p>



<p>The cognitive cost of determining “is this real?” for 200 messages exceeds the expected benefit of the 2-3 that <em>might</em> actually be valuable.</p>



<h3>Back to trust…</h3>



<p>You have to understand – your prospects aren’t asking:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Does your AI coding assistant work?” (They probably assume it does)</li>



<li>“Will it actually improve {some metric}?” (They assume it will)</li>



<li>“Is the pricing competitive?” (They can compare that in a spreadsheet)</li>
</ul>



<p>They’re asking:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Will you still be here in 12 months when I’ve integrated your tool into my workflow?”</li>



<li>“Why are you actually better or different from the 5 others I know of?”</li>



<li>“Are you burning VC cash on unsustainable unit economics?”</li>



<li>“When the music stops, will I be left holding a broken integration?”</li>



<li>“Have you actually figured out how to make money, or are you just another vibe-revenue vibe-coded startup hoping to flip before the math catches up to your credit usage?”</li>
</ul>



<p>And here’s the problem: <strong>they can’t tell if you don’t tell them.</strong></p>



<h3>Not to be cynical, but…</h3>



<p>I’m not writing this to be cynical, but because I want to make sure you play the right game.</p>



<p>Sure, you have to answer “why should I buy this product category?” but also “why should I buy it from <em>you</em>?” and your content and marketing has to match that.</p>



<p>Your opportunity is huge. Here is what we all must do:</p>



<p><strong>Trust is still a human job:</strong>&nbsp;At least for now – AI may help you along the way but at least in 2025 only humans can build genuine emotional connection and credibility. You need that lasting loyalty and advocacy. Don’t rely on the so-called “personalized outbound” alone.</p>



<p><strong>Yes, relevance and customization are critical:</strong>&nbsp;AI should help you segment prospects meticulously and flag when human follow-up is likely to deepen trust, not just automate at scale. Use the outbound engine to be real.​</p>



<p><strong>Again, keep a human involved:</strong>&nbsp;Too much automation can undermine trust. I expect at least some human engagement, especially in complex or high-value sales contexts.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/11/05/the-myth-of-ai-in-outbound-sales-why-humans-still-win-the-hardest-plays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>​​</p>



<h4>Is this actually different now that we have AI?</h4>



<p>Yes. </p>



<p>You’re representing a brand. And your brand must continuously earn that trust, even if you blend of AI-powered relevance. We still want that unmistakable human leadership.</p>

Some of our experiments were already reported on in a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/AlphaEvolve.pdf">previous white paper</a>, but the current paper provides more details, as well as a link to a <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems">repository</a> with various relevant data such as the prompts used and the evolution of the tool outputs.

AlphaEvolve is a variant of more traditional optimization tools that are designed to extremize some given score function over a high-dimensional space of possible inputs. A traditional optimization algorithm might evolve one or more trial inputs over time by various methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, that are intended to locate increasingly good solutions while trying to avoid getting stuck at local extrema. By contrast, AlphaEvolve does not evolve the score function inputs directly, but uses an LLM to evolve computer code (often written in a standard language such as Python) which will in turn be run to generate the inputs that one tests the score function on. This reflects the belief that in many cases, the extremizing inputs will not simply be an arbitrary-looking string of numbers, but will often have some structure that can be efficiently described, or at least approximated, by a relatively short piece of code. The tool then works with a population of relatively successful such pieces of code, with the code from one generation of the population being modified and combined by the LLM based on their performance to produce the next generation. The stochastic nature of the LLM can actually work in one’s favor in such an evolutionary environment: many “hallucinations” will simply end up being pruned out of the pool of solutions being evolved due to poor performance, but a small number of such mutations can add enough diversity to the pool that one can break out of local extrema and discover new classes of viable solutions. The LLM can also accept user-supplied “hints” as part of the context of the prompt; in some cases, even just uploading PDFs of relevant literature has led to improved performance by the tool. Since the initial release of AlphaEvolve, similar tools have been developed by others, including <a href="https://github.com/algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve">OpenEvolve</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SakanaAI/ShinkaEvolve">ShinkaEvolve</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liugangcode/deepevolve">DeepEvolve</a>.
</p><p>
We tested this tool on a large number (67) of different mathematics problems (both solved and unsolved) in analysis, combinatorics, and geometry that we gathered from the literature, and reported our outcomes (both positive and negative) in this paper. In many cases, AlphaEvolve achieves similar results to what an expert user of a traditional optimization software tool might accomplish, for instance in finding more efficient schemes for packing geometric shapes, or locating better candidate functions for some calculus of variations problem, than what was previously known in the literature. But one advantage this tool seems to offer over such custom tools is that of <em>scale</em>, particularly when when studying variants of a problem that we had already tested this tool on, as many of the prompts and verification tools used for one problem could be adapted to also attack similar problems; several examples of this will be discussed below.
</p><p>
Another advantage of AlphaEvolve was <em>robustness</em>: it was relatively easy to set up AlphaEvolve to work on a broad array of problems, without extensive need to call on domain knowledge of the specific task in order to tune hyperparameters. In some cases, we found that making such hyperparameters part of the data that AlphaEvolve was prompted to output was better than trying to work out their value in advance, although a small amount of such initial theoretical analysis was helpful. For instance, in calculus of variation problems, one is often faced with the need to specify various discretization parameters in order to estimate a continuous integral, which cannot be computed exactly, by a discretized sum (such as a Riemann sum), which can be evaluated by computer to some desired precision. We found that simply asking AlphaEvolve to specify its own discretization parameters worked quite well (provided we designed the score function to be conservative with regards to the possible impact of the discretization error); see for instance <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/classical_inequalities/classical_inequalities.ipynb">this experiment</a> in locating the best constant in functional inequalities such as the <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/14.html">Hausdorff-Young inequality</a>.
</p><p>
A third advantage of AlphaEvolve over traditional optimization methods was the <em>interpretability</em> of many of the solutions provided. For instance, in <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/classical_inequalities/classical_inequalities.ipynb">one of our experiments</a> we sought to find an extremum to a functional inequality such as the <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/16.html">Gagliardo–Nirenberg inequality</a> (a variant of the Sobolev inequality). This is a relatively well-behaved optimization problem, and many standard methods can be deployed to obtain near-optimizers that are presented in some numerical format, such as a vector of values on some discretized mesh of the domain. However, when we applied AlphaEvolve to this problem, the tool was able to discover the exact solution (in this case, a Talenti function), and create code that sampled from that function on a discretized mesh to provide the required input for the scoring function we provided (which only accepted discretized inputs, due to the need to compute the score numerically). This code could be inspected by humans to gain more insight as to the nature of the optimizer. (Though in some cases, AlphaEvolve’s code would contain some brute force search, or a call to some existing optimization subroutine in one of the libraries it was given access to, instead of any more elegant description of its output.)
</p><p>
For problems that were sufficiently well-known to be in the training data of the LLM, the LLM component of AlphaEvolve often came up almost immediately with optimal (or near-optimal) solutions. For instance, for variational problems where the gaussian was known to be the extremizer, AlphaEvolve would frequently guess a gaussian candidate during one of the early evolutions, and we would have to obfuscate the problem significantly to try to conceal the connection to the literature in order for AlphaEvolve to experiment with other candidates. AlphaEvolve would also propose similar guesses for other problems for which the extremizer was not known. For instance, we <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/finite_field_kakeya_problem/finite_field_kakeya.ipynb">tested this tool</a> on the sum-difference exponents of relevance to the <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/30.html">arithmetic Kakeya conjecture</a>, which can be formulated as a variational entropy inequality concerning certain two-dimensional discrete random variables. AlphaEvolve initially proposed some candidates for such variables based on discrete gaussians, which actually worked rather well even if they were not the exact extremizer, and already generated some slight improvements to previous lower bounds on such exponents in the literature. Inspired by this, I was later able to rigorously obtain some theoretical results on the asymptotic behavior on such exponents in the regime where the number of slopes was fixed, but the “rational complexity” of the slopes went to infinity; this will be reported on in a separate paper.
</p><p>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, AlphaEvolve was extremely good at locating “exploits” in the verification code we provided, for instance using degenerate solutions or overly forgiving scoring of approximate solutions to come up with proposed inputs that technically achieved a high score under our provided code, but were not in the spirit of the actual problem. For instance, when we asked it (link under construction) to find <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/53.html">configurations to extremal geometry problems such as locating polygons with each vertex having four equidistant other vertices</a>, we initially coded the verifier to accept distances that were equal only up to some high numerical precision, at which point AlphaEvolve promptly placed many of the points in virtually the same location so that the distances they determined were indistinguishable. Because of this, a non-trivial amount of human effort needs to go into designing a non-exploitable verifier, for instance by working with exact arithmetic (or interval arithmetic) instead of floating point arithmetic, and taking conservative worst-case bounds in the presence of uncertanties in measurement to determine the score. For instance, in testing AlphaEvolve against the “moving sofa” problem and its variants, we designed a conservative scoring function that only counted those portions of the sofa that we could definitively prove to stay inside the corridor at all times (not merely the discrete set of times provided by AlphaEvolve to describe the sofa trajectory) to prevent it from exploiting “clipping” type artefacts. Once we did so, it performed quite well, for instance <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/the_2d_moving_sofa/the_2d_moving_sofa.ipynb">rediscovering</a> the optimal “Gerver sofa” for the original sofa problem, and also <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/the_3d_moving_sofa/the_3d_moving_sofa.ipynb">discovering new sofa designs</a> for other problem variants, such as a 3D sofa problem.
</p><p>
For well-known open conjectures (e.g., <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/26.html">Sidorenko’s conjecture</a>, <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/20.html">Sendov’s conjecture</a>, <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/25.html">Crouzeix’s conjecture</a>, <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/19.html">the ovals problem</a>, etc.), AlphaEvolve generally was able to locate the previously known candidates for optimizers (that are conjectured to be optimal), but did not locate any stronger counterexamples: thus, we did not disprove any major open conjecture. Of course, one obvious possible explanation for this is that these conjectures are in fact true; outside of a few situations where there is a matching “dual” optimization problem, AlphaEvolve can only provide one-sided bounds on such problems and so cannot definitively determine if the conjectural optimizers are in fact the true optimizers. Another potential explanation is that AlphaEvolve essentially tried all the “obvious” constructions that previous researchers working on these problems had also privately experimented with, but did not report due to the negative findings. However, I think there is at least value in using these tools to systematically record negative results (roughly speaking, that a search for “obvious” counterexamples to a conjecture did not disprove the claim), which currently only exist as “folklore” results at best. This seems analogous to the role LLM Deep Research tools could play by systematically recording the results (both positive and negative) of automated literature searches, as a supplement to human literature review which usually reports positive results only. Furthermore, when we shifted attention to less well studied variants of famous conjectures, we were able to find some modest new observations. For instance, while AlphaEvolve only found the standard conjectural extremizer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%5En-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%5En-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%5En-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{z^n-1}"> to <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/20.html">Sendov’s conjecture</a>, as well as for variants such as <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/22.html">Borcea’s conjecture</a>, <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/21.html">Schmeisser’s conjecture</a>, or <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/23.html">Smale’s conjecture</a> it did reveal some potential two-parameter extensions to a <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/24.html">conjecture of de Bruin and Sharma</a> that had not previously been stated in the literature. (For this problem, we were not directly optimizing some variational scalar quantity, but rather a two-dimensional range of possible values, which we could adapt the AlphaEvolve framework to treat). In the future, I can imagine such tools being a useful “sanity check” when proposing any new conjecture, in that it will become common practice to run one of these tools against such a conjecture to make sure there are no “obvious” counterexamples (while keeping in mind that this is still far from conclusive evidence in favor of such a conjecture).
</p><p>
AlphaEvolve did not perform equally well across different areas of mathematics. When testing the tool on analytic number theory problems, such as that of <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/27.html">designing sieve weights for elementary approximations to the prime number theorem</a>, it struggled to take advantage of the number theoretic structure in the problem, even when given suitable expert hints (although such hints have proven useful for other problems). This could potentially be a prompting issue on our end, or perhaps the landscape of number-theoretic optimization problems is less amenable to this sort of LLM-based evolutionary approach. On the other hand, AlphaEvolve does seem to do well when the constructions have some algebraic structure, such as with the finite field Kakeya and Nikodym set problems, which we will turn to shortly.
</p><p>
For many of our experiments we worked with fixed-dimensional problems, such as trying to optimally pack <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}"> shapes in a larger shape for a fixed value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}">. However, we found in some cases that if we asked AlphaEvolve to give code that took parameters such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}"> as input, and tested the output of that code for a suitably sampled set of values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{n}"> of various sizes, then it could sometimes generalize the constructions it found for small values of this parameter to larger ones; for instance, in the infamous <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/65.html">sixth problem of this year’s IMO</a>, it could use this technique to discover the optimal arrangement of tiles, which none of the frontier models could do at the time (although AlphaEvolve has no capability to demonstrate that this arrangement was, in fact, optimal). Another productive use case of this technique was for <a href="https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/1.html">finding finite field Kakeya and Nikodym sets</a> of small size in low-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of various sizes. For Kakeya sets in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbf+F%7D_q%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbf+F%7D_q%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbf+F%7D_q%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{{\mathbf F}_q^d}">, <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/finite_field_kakeya_problem/finite_field_kakeya.ipynb">it located</a> the known optimal construction based on quadratic residues in two dimensions, and very slightly beat (by an error term of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{O(q)}">) the best construction in three dimensions; this was an algebraic construction (still involving quadratic residues) discovered empirically that we could then prove to be correct by first using Gemini’s “Deep Think” tool to locate an informal proof, which we could then convert into a formalized Lean proof by using Google Deepmind’s “AlphaProof” tool. At one point we thought it had found a construction in four dimensions which achieved a more noticeable improvement (of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{O(q^3)}">) of what we thought was the best known construction, but we subsequently discovered that essentially the same construction had appeared already in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00074">a paper of Bukh and Chao</a>, although it still led to a more precise calculation of the error term (to accuracy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{O(q^{3/2})}"> rather than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28q%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{O(q^2)}">, where the error term now involves the Lang-Weil inequality and is unlikely to have a closed form). Perhaps AlphaEvolve had somehow absorbed the Bukh-Chao construction within its training data to accomplish this. However, when we <a href="https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/blob/main/experiments/finite_field_nikodym_problem/finite_field_nikodym.ipynb">tested the tool on Nikodym</a> sets (which are expected to have asymptotic density <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="{1}">, although this remains unproven), it did find some genuinely new constructions of such sets in three dimensions, based on removing quadratic varieties from the entire space. After using “Deep Think” again to analyze these constructions, we found that they were inferior to a purely random construction (which in retrospect was an obvious thing to try); however, they did inspire a hybrid construction in which one removed random quadratic varieties and performed some additional cleanup, which ends up outperforming both the purely algebraic and purely random constructions. This result (with completely human-generated proofs) will appear in a subsequent paper.

<p>Emacs has holistically become my daily computing environment.</p>
<p>My efforts have been focused on building emacs into the workflow of essentially everything I do, as long as it doesn’t involve heavy video or media, I try my very best to accomplish it in emacs.
The idea is to achieve deep integration with everything I do on a computer, to the degree my thoughts are immediately able to be acted upon in the buffer.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://hypr.land/">hyprland</a> as my window manager, and while I have heard of other managers/DEs (I was using GNOME for the better part of 6 months), I keep coming back to hyprland just because it works and is easy to configure. Also, for some reason, I seem not to have laggin in emacs on wayland in hyprland, while I had to previously run emacs in X11 mode in GNOME, go figure.</p>

<p>I have seen what people are capable of doing when their tools get out of the way, and they are free to just <em>create</em>.
This is how world class athletes, musicians, artists, writers, and of course programmers take what is in their mind and translate it into reality.
The idea is that if I can learn this “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8&amp;themeRefresh=1">editor of a lifetime</a>” - then the things that I want to create, the programs I want to write, will be achieved in a near frictionless environment, allowing for velocity that is not possible elsewhere.
It is the ultimate sharpening of the axe before chopping the tree.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-exwm">Why not EXWM?<a tab-index="0" aria-hidden="false" aria-label="Link to Why not EXWM?" data-pagefind-ignore="" href="#why-not-exwm">#</a></h2>
<p>I have considered using EXWM as the window manager (quite literally offloading window management to emacs, and “living in emacs” - to more of a degree than I do already), the hesitation I have is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Emacs is single threaded, therefore if anything in the system hangs, the whole system hangs, and</li>
<li>It is only X11 where most of the development and forward movement in the linux space has been in wayland. While I understand this is not a tremendous issue, wayland does seem to be where the puck is going.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what I am aiming to do is replicate functionality as best as I can from EXWM to a wayland environment - not wholly possible, but also not wholly impossible, either.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://github.com/jblais493/nixos-config">my dotfiles</a>, you can see I have a <a href="https://github.com/jblais493/nixos-config/blob/master/dotfiles/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher.go">script written in Go</a> that allows me to call each and every one of my emacs controls anywhere is my system.
I was previously calling each of these emacs commands in bash and with a sleep command so as to make sure I was targeting the emacs instance. No longer. This Go script has sped up my workflow by 10x.</p>

<p><code>bind = $mainMod SHIFT, E, exec, bash -c "emacs"</code></p>
<p>I almost never press this keybind, as emacs is opened from the get-go in my hyprland sessions.  For that rare time I need to re-open it.</p>

<p>This permits me to quickly open a vterm window and enter commands etc. If I need anything that is more graphically intense, I fallback to kitty terminal, but this is less and less these days.</p>

<p>I wanted to replicate a launcher (similar to wofi/rofi) in which I could easily launch apps and switch to them in the environment.</p>
<p>So, my take on this is to replace wofi with this functionality. I was using ssh providers in GNOME, but then brought the functionality into my universal launcher. It has effectively grown to encapsulate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords</li>
<li>SSH</li>
<li>Bookmarking</li>
<li>Commands and program launching</li>
<li>Emojis</li>
<li>TODOS (though org-agenda/calendar also handles this)</li>
<li>File navigation</li>
<li>Web and documentation search</li>
</ul>
<p>While this is a work in progress, I use it every day, hundreds of times a day, and love the flow &amp; speed my launcher allows.</p>

<p><code>bind = CTRL SHIFT, c, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/emacs-launcher '(progn (select-frame-set-input-focus (selected-frame)) (org-capture))'</code></p>
<p>When I am not “in” emacs (I am always in emacs by extension) I can still capture direct to emacs with a quick keybind.</p>
<p>I capture to my org directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>notes</li>
<li>bookmarks</li>
<li>contacts</li>
<li>inbox (todos)</li>
<li>events/deadlines</li>

<p>This is very useful when I am wanting to save a thought, idea, bookmark, quote, what have you, and then integrate it with my <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a> file structure.</p>

<p>I think that because I spend so much time inside emacs, I don’t really get the benefits of everything being a buffer. I only use a browser for projects, not as a window I have always open, and I don’t really need emacs to control buffers or give me the keybinds universally. I will never say never though, perhaps one day it will be my window manager of choice.</p>
<p>How are you integrating emacs in your workflow? I would be super interested to see other setups that allow you to use emacs as your one, true, holistic computing environment. Shoot me an email and tell me how it’s done!</p>
<p>As always, God bless, and until next time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last month the U.S. has carried out several interdiction strikes on narco-trafficking boats in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean. These are usually acknowledged the next day, described vaguely as “in international waters,” with no coordinates. I’ve been experimenting with NASA’s VIIRS thermal anomaly feed (FIRMS) to see if any of these events are visible <em>as they happen</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/xudkavdw0jzf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15582a6952deb90dcf9d014a4173b0c523ebd987">https://preview.redd.it/xudkavdw0jzf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15582a6952deb90dcf9d014a4173b0c523ebd987</a></p>

<p>On Oct 27, a single <strong>daytime</strong> VIIRS hotspot appears at <strong>14.0387° N, 106.4606° W</strong>, which is roughly <strong>415 nautical miles southwest of Acapulco</strong>. It’s the only ocean pixel in that sector for the entire week. Mexico’s subsequent statements referenced <strong>search and rescue ~400 nm SW of Acapulco</strong> after that day’s operations. The geometry lines up almost perfectly.  </p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/z4nk46ox0jzf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95de0ab7a01b5688f687cf439e52af6be6f26f99">https://preview.redd.it/z4nk46ox0jzf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95de0ab7a01b5688f687cf439e52af6be6f26f99</a></p>

<p>Why I think this specific detection is the Oct 27 strike: the public footage released by the U.S. shows a <strong>large explosion with an ongoing flame in daylight</strong>—exactly the type of surface combustion a daytime VIIRS pass can catch. The spot is far from known offshore platforms or refinery flare fields, and I filtered out land fires and industrial sources before scanning. I’m <strong>~90% confident</strong> this pixel is the Oct 27 event.  </p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hnryod1z0jzf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5c97138b50056839cd0689503b9f05920427e54">https://preview.redd.it/hnryod1z0jzf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5c97138b50056839cd0689503b9f05920427e54</a></p>

<p>If you want to replicate: set FIRMS to VIIRS 375 m, date 2025-10-27, pan to the Eastern Pacific off Mexico, and you’ll see the detection with its timestamp and FRP. Measure from Acapulco and you’ll get ~415 nm. It does not recur on adjacent days at that exact location, which argues against a persistent industrial source.</p>

<p>None of this claims intent; it’s simply “thermal anomaly consistent with a fire” in the precise place and time later described by authorities. The interesting part is methodological: with FIRMS alone—no paid feeds—you can narrow vague “international waters” language to a concrete lat/lon box in near-real time. That has obvious implications for open-source monitoring and for how quickly journalists and analysts can geolocate future incidents.  </p>

<p>I’m happy to hear counter-arguments—e.g., alternative explanations for a one-off daytime ocean pixel at those coordinates—but based on the match to the reported location, the unique nature of the detection, and the daylight, high-energy fire profile, I think this one’s a hit.</p>

  <p>Hi, I am a locale leader of SUMO Japanese community. I have contributed to the Support over 20 years, before the beginning of support.mozilla.org.

Today, November 4, we decided to end our SUMO Japanese community.

In October 22, the sumobot was introduced to Japanese KB articles. I cannot accept its behavior and no words.
* It doesn't follow our translation guidelines.

* It approves its direct English MT immediately for All archived KB articles.
* It approves only in 72 hours after its updates, so we lost our work to train new contributors.
* It has been working now without our acceptance, without controls, without communications.
* Over 300 Knowledge Base articles are overridden by sumobot.

They are all happened on the product server, not on staging server. I understand that this is mass destruction of our work and explicit violation to the Mozilla mission, allowed officially.

Therefore, I (marsf) declare:

    <p>Hi marsf, I'm so sorry to read your message. Even though we haven't seen each other for a while, I still have fond memories of you (we last met at All Hands in Orlando... in 2018). 
I completely understand your frustration after the introduction of SumoBot. We Italians, along with the Spanish, were the first to experiment with automatic translation/updates via SumoBot (<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/forums/contributors/717387?last=89505" rel="nofollow">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/forums/contributors/717387?last=89505</a>), and I've already expressed some concerns. I hope that, after talking with Kiki and the staff, you'll change your mind about ceasing your localization contributions.

<p>These are also in my opinion the sore points, especially the fact that SumoBot updates or translates (when there's a new article) immediately, which hinders the training of new contributors because they end up doing "proofreading" since SumoBot immediately takes over...
For me, as a locale leader, it's not easy to help a new contributor understand how the localization process works, the syntax of the Sumo wiki, if they have to view a "diff" that SumoBot has already automatically proposed (Often retranslating parts of the article that aren't subject to changes...).

Speaking at a Wall Street Journal business conference, Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said the company is exploring federal loan guarantees to attract broader funding for its AI computing expansion, describing a potential “ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental” participants.</p><p data-start="499" data-end="898" data-v-4026719d="">Friar said government backing would significantly lower borrowing costs and broaden OpenAI’s access to credit markets, since federal guarantees would protect lenders from losses if the company defaulted. The proposal is highly unusual for a Silicon Valley technology firm, effectively positioning OpenAI alongside sectors such as energy and infrastructure that traditionally rely on state support.</p><p data-start="900" data-end="1250" data-v-4026719d="">The company’s request comes amid a wave of capital-intensive commitments, including a $300 billion deal with Oracle and a $500 billion “Stargate” data center venture with Oracle and SoftBank. Despite projecting revenues in the tens of billions this year, OpenAI’s income remains far below the enormous outlays required to sustain its AI operations.</p><p data-start="1252" data-end="1518" data-v-4026719d="">Friar dismissed speculation that OpenAI might soon go public, saying an IPO “is not on the cards right now.” Instead, she emphasized that the company’s focus remains on scaling its capabilities and securing the financing needed to underpin its long-term ambitions.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><em>In which it becomes clear, the C Preprocessor was designed by <del>a</del> Kafka <del>fan</del></em></p><p>So you have heard rumors whispered between peers, that a rare few people somehow manage to make compile-time recursion work in C? And you want to have some insight into how that might be possible??</p><p>I should warn you, you’re risking your sanity… but I’ll indulge you.</p><p>Wait, did I really just say that? I must be a glutton for punishment, because the macro system is, by far, the thing I like least about C.</p><p>C has many advantages that have led to its longevity (60 years as perhaps the most important language). It has many quirks due to its age, most of which are easy to look past. But despite 30 years writing C, I still bristle at C’s macro system.</p><p>That’s not just because there are many languages (including C++) with more modern takes on compile-time execution. Macros appear simple, but have subtleties that make them poorly suited for anything other than light wrappers.</p><p>Still, being C’s only compile-time execution capability (currently), it is still both critical and important. <em>Critical</em>, in that many venerable critical systems heavily depend on them, and wouldn’t compile without them. <em>Important</em>, in that it’s often the only way to abstract out complexity that would lead to safety or security issues if exposed, such as automatically adding sentinels or static type checks.</p><p>C macros being hard to use does discourage their overuse. It’s easy for too much abstraction to make it too difficult for other people to maintain the code, so in some ways, as painful as they are, I can find some things to appreciate, and do occasionally find reason to use them for something non-trivial.</p><p>But it doesn’t take much for a macro to be non-trivial, because, while C macros can look like functions, they cannot be called recursively (at least, not easily, as we will see).</p><p>I have never been able to find out <em>why</em> recursion is limited in C macros. It could have started off intentional, but compile time execution wasn’t really on people’s minds then; the challenge was abstracting over many platform differences as cheaply as possible.</p><p>I suspect the system evolved as needed in the early days, without really thinking about it as something that perhaps <em>should</em> support recursion. Certainly at some point, the question would get raised; but it’s easy to imagine:</p><ol><li>The organic evolution of the macro system coupled with early success made it brittle, and hard to evolve.</li><li>People were worried about build issues like hanging compile times due to infinite loops, or crashing with no diagnostics, due to infinite recursion.</li></ol><p>Depending on which of these two was more prominent, I could equally imagine the lack of recursion being an accident, or being an intentional choice.</p><p>However it happened, that die was cast in a completely different era—people have definitely woken up to the value of pushing as much into compile time as possible.</p><p>Either way, it all seems archaic and unnecessary now.</p><p>So, let’s roll up our sleeves and learn to cope with the issue!</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>If you have anything interesting you need done with the preprocessor, you probably need to generalize over multiple items.</p><p>Maybe you want to add automatic sanity checks around parameters, or add automatic type checking. You might want to pre-fill arrays, or generate a list of functions based on some data. Generally, we should be able to do such things at compile time, and in cases like type checking, it is often incredibly challenging to defer the work till runtime. So the lack of a good compile time solution for such things is problematic.</p><p>I tend to reach for macros when they can remove the potential for human error; for example, calling an API wrong. That can indeed be adding automatic casts, enforcing that null terminators get added on variable argument arrays, etc.</p><p>In all of those scenarios, we would need something to move macros toward Turing completeness at compile time. But macros do not advertise support for either of the things we’d be looking for there: <em>iteration</em>, and <em>recursion</em>.</p><p>Thankfully, we can get there. But it’s not going to be easy.</p><p>To frame our discussion, let’s pick a simple, but highly valuable goal. We’re going to build a macro that counts the number of variable arguments in a function-like macro that accepts variable arguments.</p><p>Why that problem? Because from there it’s a short jump to dealing with some common issues, where we can remove large sources of human error:</p><ol><li>Variadic functions (aka varargs) are error prone, because the implementation has to figure out where the arguments stop; the language doesn’t give you a way to know. The caller has to remember to follow your convention (like adding a null terminator). And that convention can often back fire, for example, when a null value is a valid argument . Being able to count the number of variadic arguments allows us to provide a <a href="https://h4x0r.org/vargs/">single, general approach to dealing with this,</a> and to not put the burden on the caller to have to count correctly.</li><li>There are plenty of cases where we’d want to apply a transformation to each argument of a variable argument function, like statically checking that parameters are all the same type, or automatically adding a layer of sanity checking to a third party API, so that the people calling your function can remain blissfully unaware. These don’t directly require counting, but once we can count recursively, it’s a small change to give ourselves a more general purpose <code>map</code> construct to make such transformations.</li></ol><p>You might be surprised that the language doesn’t provide a way to count variable arguments in a macro, especially if you noticed the recent addition of a pre-defined macro called <code>__COUNTER__</code> in the draft C2Y standard. The new <code>__COUNTER__</code> macro is intended to make it easier to provide uniqueness for situations where macros need to generate identifiers and labels; it definitely isn’t for counting variadic macro arguments.</p><h2 id="apparently-math-is-hard">Apparently math is hard?</h2><p>If there’s no primitive to count variadic macro arguments, well, we need to create one, right? And if we have to create one, that means it should be pretty easy, one would hope?</p><h2 id="heading">🦗🦗🦗</h2><p>I see you’re skeptical. But an optimist who wanted to delve into compile-time coding in C for the first time might give it a go. But they will quickly find that the obvious approach below, that feels like it should work, absolutely <em><strong>does not work</strong></em>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>// The first macro... counts one argument, then we'd like it to recurse.</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_COUNT_ONE</span>(x, ...) <span>+</span> 1 <span>_COUNT_TOP</span>(__VA_ARGS__)
</span></span><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_COUNT_TOP</span>(...)    __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_ONE(__VA_ARGS__))
</span></span><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>COUNT</span>(...)        (_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) <span>+</span> 0)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Try to call this code, and…</p><h2 id="heading-1">🤮</h2><p>Yup, it’ll barf.</p><p>What this doe-eyed attempt is <em>trying</em> to do, is generate an expression (at compile time) of the form <code>(+ 1 + 1 + … + 0)</code>, by iterating over each argument at a call site (via recursion). It doesn’t care what the arguments are, it just wants to generate a <code>+ 1</code> for each valid argument, and a <code>+ 0</code> at the end, both to make it a valid expression and to handle the case where there are no arguments passed.</p><p>If we’re successful, the addition will all happen at compile time, and will be what C calls an <em>integer constant expression</em>. That means, the compiler will, at compile time, fold this into a single static integer. So, even if it feels inefficient, there is no run-time cost involved.</p><p>Why three macros? That seems a bit excessive, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, C currently doesn’t have an easy way to do the equivalent of an <code>if()</code> statement at compile time. It’s possible to create something with macros, but that’s just extra hackery.</p><p>Instead, we split the primary body into its own macro— <code>_COUNT_ONE()</code>, which adds the <code>1 +</code> and then triggers recursion (we wish, anyway; again, the recursion part won’t work this easily).</p><p>The intent the behind <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code> macro is evaluating an exit condition for our recursion. Specifically, we want to stop when we have no more arguments left in the function. The builtin macro <code>__VA_OPT__()</code> allows us to do exactly that— the text inside the parentheses gets expanded only if there are arguments. And when there are no arguments, the text inside the parentheses is discarded.</p><p>This gives us a lightweight way to separate the one argument case from the two argument case, without need for a kind of <code>if</code> statement; the 0-case won’t generate a recursive call. To combine this with <code>_COUNT_ONE()</code>, we’d need a primitive that allowed us to specify a replacement that only expands when there are <em>no</em> arguments, which doesn’t come out of the box.</p><p>The outer <code>COUNT()</code> macro could be factored out trivially; I leave it because it keeps what’s going on a bit clearer. This macro is the actual entry point, adds the ‘0’ a single time the end, and wraps the whole thing in parentheses, which helps avoid running afoul of operator precedence rules.</p><p>If we directly combine it with <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code> in the obvious way, it would compute the right thing, but it would do it by adding the <code>+ 0</code> after EVERY term, and parenthesizing the expression in a way that would come off as odd if you were looking at the resulting C code. For instance, we’d be aiming for a three argument function to generate:</p><p><code>( + 1 ( + 1 ( + 1 ( + 0 ) + 0 ) + 0 ) + 0 )</code>
If we were to generate this code, it’d be ugly, but most people would declare success and move on. But unfortunately, the above code does not work, and will never work, no matter how many iterations of the standard are released between now and the heat death of the universe— changing the behavior would be too likely to impact plenty of real code.</p><p>For example, let’s attempt to use the above implementation like so:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hey, at least that message is concise. Never mind that it’s <em>totally different</em>, and also <strong>unrelated to the real issue</strong>.</p><h2 id="not-counting-on-it">Not counting on it</h2><p>The C Preprocessor (which I will usually call CPP) is responsible for macro expansion and processing lines with a leading <code>#</code>. As we’ve said, it does not fully support recursion. As you might expect, that’s the core of the actual problem in our first attempt. Yet, the preprocessor happily thinks it did its job. We’ll see in more detail what’s going on, but the crux of this particular problem is <em>how</em> recursion is disallowed, not that it IS disallowed.</p><p>The problem here is that C macros are their own programming language, being used to generate C code. The macro language doesn’t model most of the interesting parts of the language, and it is quite easy to produce code that the preprocessor finds acceptable, that the compiler cannot understand (as we will see).</p><p>In both these cases, the preprocessor feels like it’s done its job, and passes off its work to the C compiler. The C compiler gets the generated code, and has no idea that macros were used. It calls the error as it sees it.</p><p>This disconnect between the preprocessor and the compiler is one of the things that makes macros in C so unfriendly.</p><p>If a macro expansion (basically the same as an ‘evaluation’) is recursive, the CPP decides “they can’t possibly have wanted recursion here, because that might loop forever, so this must be plain old text I have to substitute”. <em>As a result, the emitted code will still contain the unexpanded macro.</em></p><p>How can we confirm this? If we can’t understand the resulting transformations, we’re going to end up stumbling around in the dark.</p><p>Many developers don’t know how to see what the C preprocessor actually produces. If the preprocessor successfully exits, we <em>can</em> see it’s output by stopping the compiler after the preprocessing phase, generally with the <code>-E</code> flag. If we don’t give a file name (via the <code>-o</code> flag), we should see the results on the terminal. And at least in the case of <code>clang</code>, we will even get output up to the point that we did something so wrong that the preprocessor gives us an error.</p><p>For the code above, running <code>cc -E tmp.c</code> works without errors, and dumps the output of CPP to my terminal.</p><p>That consists of a lot of stuff you might not expect to see. The output contains our code after the preprocessor has <em>fully</em> expanded it. But that full expansion includes the results of it preprocessing all of the header files we pulled in, which in our case was <code>stdio.h</code>, and any cascading dependencies it might have.</p><p>However, our code is easy to find in that noise. The last thing output will be our fully translated <code>main()</code> function, ready to be input into the C compiler. For the case where we add <code>+1</code> at the beginning of the macro, we will see:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>int</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>main</span>()

</span></span><span><span>    <span>printf</span>(<span>"COUNT() = %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, (<span>+</span><span>1</span> <span>_COUNT_TOP</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>) <span>+</span> <span>0</span>));
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, the compiler doesn’t have to try to look up the symbol <code>_COUNT_TOP</code>; it knows that it doesn’t make sense to have a function call after a number with no operator in between.</p><p>When we reverse the <code>+</code> and the <code>1</code>, the line of code is valid, as long as there’s a function C can resolve called <code>_COUNT_TOP</code>. Because there isn’t, the compiler bails.</p><p>That explains why we get two different errors, for such a minor change.</p><p>Because CPP and the compiler itself are oblivious to the execution of the other, and because we have to live with the fact that recursive macros aren’t errors to the CPP (silently passing them through unexpanded), it’s quite a bit of work for any compiler to even try to tell you that your problem here is attempting to use recursion in a macro. It could be done, and maybe it <em>should</em> be done, because otherwise, compilers are effectively trying to gaslight you into believing you have a syntax error of some sort.</p><p>Because the preprocessor is much more permissive than the compiler, without the compiler having any awareness of macros even existing is perhaps the most significant reason why writing non-trivial macros is so hard to do.</p><p>Again, we can hack our way around the recursion problem. The semantics are arcane and intricate enough that, even knowing the rules (and doing macro work with a copy of the standard at the ready), macro development is incredibly challenging the second you have any problem at all. Decades later, I often feel like I’m stumbling around in the dark when a macro I write blows up on me.</p><p>If this is all too intimidating, absolutely we can plagiarize our way to success. Though, personally, I really prefer not to cut-and-paste code from Stack Overflow, especially if it’s code I don’t understand. Similarly, while Claude and I are casual acquaintances, I do not trust his code. It’s my unwillingness to <em>using code I don’t understand</em> in production that keeps me learning and growing.
Instead, I avoid non-trivial macros, unless (as I said above), I make an exception when they will be a huge net positive for helping the developer, usually by removing potential failure modes, or with significant clarity improvements.
Meaning, if you can use them to provide an abstraction that makes the code more robust, and is also not going to be hard to maintain if the need arises, then I’d consider it (even if you have to get Claude to write it).
Here, automating size detection statically feels like a good enough use case for my tastes, because macros will not only make variadic functions easier to write, but also make it far easier to call them correctly.</p><p>So, I’d like to help those interested understand how to navigate through the pain, and shine a light on it, in the hopes that this is another area of the language that the modern standards committee can make massively better.</p><h2 id="that-doesnt-count">That doesn’t count</h2><p>If we want to know how to circumvent the recursion restriction, we probably need to understand the detection mechanism we are attempting to evade.</p><p>It sure would be nice if we could debug by having our compiler give us intermediate expansions, up until the point that it breaks. This is not directly built into any compiler as far as I know. And my experience with macro debuggers has been that they have a hard time matching compiler semantics. I dusted one of them off when working on this article, and it was easy to get it to expand macros as valid that CPP barfed on, and vice versa.
Despite the lack of tooling, I’ll walk through the expansion process in detail so we can all understand.</p><p>The rules for C macro evaluation are hard to explain in a way that’s simultaneously precise and clear. But for function-like macros, the main process of evaluating a macro boils down to:</p><ol><li><strong>Replace the macro text.</strong> <em>Stashing aside the arguments used to call the macro</em>, we replace the full macro with the textual body, within the larger token stream we’re processing.</li><li><strong>Add placeholder tokens.</strong> Instances of ‘arguments’ in the body get replaced with placeholder tokens, to prevent them from being evaluated as macros in any nested argument expansion we might have. This includes <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> and <code>__VA_OPT__()</code> invocations.</li><li><strong>Evaluate preprocessor operators</strong> in the body that take operands , particularly <code>#</code> and <code>##</code>. We don’t make good use of these operators in this article, so we won’t cover in too much depth. Note, however, that <code>__VA_OPT__()</code> is also a preprocessor operator that takes arguments. We inhibited expansion within the replacement text, when we were evaluating operators, but at the end of this phase, we put it back; it can get expanded in the next step.</li><li><strong>Rescanning the body</strong>. The body is then scanned for more macros to expand, starting from our cursor in the token stream. The “input” head moves forward a token at a time, until we mind a macro to expand, or reach the end of the macro we’re evaluating. When we find a macro to expand, we recursively apply the algorithm.</li></ol><p>There are some pretty large subtleties here. As long as a macro invocation starts in the scope of a rescan, the scanning head position can move past the end of the original macro. For example, consider this basic scenario:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#define CONCAT(X, Y)  X ## Y
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>int</span> PRINT_INT <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;

</span></span><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, <span>CONCAT</span>(PRINT_, INT));
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>##</code> operator, seen used in the <code>CONCAT</code> macro, appends two tokens together, turning them into a single preprocessor token.</p><p>When the preprocessor evaluates <code>CONCAT()</code>, it will result in the token <code>PRINT_INT</code>. If <code>PRINT_INT</code> were a macro, the preprocessor would do further expansion. But it is not, so the preprocessor outputs <code>PRINT_INT</code>. The C compiler does not complain, because it sees a variable named <code>PRINT_INT</code>.</p><p>So far, depending on your background, the semantics may or may not being intuitive. But either way, what do you think should happen in this slightly more complex scenario?</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#define CONCAT(X, Y)  X ## Y
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#define PRINT_INT(N)  printf("look an integer %d\n", (N));
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>int</span> PRINT_INT <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;
</span></span><span><span>

</span></span><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, <span>CONCAT</span>(PRINT_, INT));
</span></span><span><span>    <span>CONCAT</span>(PRINT_,INT)(<span>100</span>);
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It would be reasonable to think there’s an error here, but this code will compile and run. Why? In both cases, the preprocessor will generate the token <code>PRINT_INT</code>. In the first case, everything will happen the same way it did in our first example, and the compiler will see the variable <code>PRINT_INT</code>.</p><p>But, with the second use of <code>CONCAT</code>, the preprocessor will see that there is a parenthesis immediately following the token <code>PRINT_INT</code>. Since it has a function-like macro with that name, it will prefer the macro interpretation.</p><p>That’s true, even though we didn’t directly write <code>PRINT_INT</code> in the code, there. The effective result of the preprocessor’s expansion would look like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#define CONCAT(X, Y)  X ## Y
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#define PRINT_INT(N)  printf("look an integer %d\n", (N));
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>int</span> PRINT_INT <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;
</span></span><span><span>

</span></span><span><span>    <span>printf</span>(<span>"look an integer %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, <span>100</span>);
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That’s because C’s macros come in two flavors, with slightly different semantics:</p><ol><li><em><strong>Function-like macros</strong></em>, which take arguments, and syntactically LOOK like functions. As we see here, if the preprocessor sees a token with the same name as a function like macro, but it’s not used like a function like macro, it will pass it through, letting the C compiler resolve the token.</li><li><em><strong>Object-like macros</strong></em>, the definitions of which look like variables, and do not take arguments. If the C preprocessor sees a left parenthesis after an object-like macro, that token will just be passed through directly to the compiler.</li></ol><p>That is why the following code does NOT error. In fact, it runs quite happily:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>#define OBJECT_LIKE_MACRO printf</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

</span></span><span><span>  OBJECT_LIKE_MACRO<span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!\n"</span><span>)</span>;
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Meaning, if we we have an object-like macro and it looks like we’re trying to call it, the C preprocessor isn’t going to call it. It’s just going to pass the token through, and let the compiler figure it out.</p><p>As you can see, the preprocessor’s philosophy is to do its job, and nothing else.</p><p>Another preprocessor subtlety that’s easy to miss, yet important to understand is:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>ℹ️️</td><td>Arguments to function-like macros are expanded at the call site. For expansions that trigger inside the body where those arguments are used, the contents of the <i>expanded arguments will not be available to be part of any additional expansion.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The preprocessor’s approach of substituting arguments with placeholder tokens during evaluation is pretty effective at stopping a bunch of accidental recursion that would be non-intuitive. Although, it’s not the problem for the recursion we’re trying to solve. The barrier we’re hitting is a subtlety that we haven’t discussed yet, but we’ll get to it soon enough.</p><p>Before that, let’s solidify our understanding by walking through the relevant steps with our invocation of <code>COUNT(1)</code> .</p><table><caption><h2>Big Mac-ro expansion example</h2></caption><tbody><tr><td><asciinema-marker-player src="/asciinema/macro_expansion.cast"></asciinema-marker-player></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We’ve learned that, when <code>COUNT()</code> has an invocation of <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code>, the replacement text cannot lead to recursion. The expansion endures the rescan, and nothing attempts to expand it.</p><p>The rule that’s preventing the expansion is effectively an explicit anti-recursion rule. Formally, when we replace a macro, that macro is marked as currently being replaced. The mark stays, until that replacement is totally finished, including its rescan.</p><p>And, unfortunately, marked macros are ineligible for replacement. Note the rescan ineligibility is IN THE CALLING ENVIRONMENT. That’s going to cause us some grief in a few minutes.</p><p>For whatever reason, the original C89 standards committee referred to a macro marked as ineligible for expansion as <em>painted blue</em>.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>❓</td><td>Why the term <em>painted blue</em>?

But the work-around is going to be hard fought.</p><p>First, let’s give ourselves a cause to be optimistic: the restriction that’s preventing <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code> from recursively expanding is relaxed when the second <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code> gets replaced. If, instead, the restriction stayed in full force the entire time we’ve evaluating <code>COUNT()</code>, then you would not be able to do the following:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>

Clearly it’s not the case that once a macro is called, a parent of the calling macro can never replace it again.

What we’d like to see, is, can <code>_COUNT_ONE()</code> produce a macro invocation with a different name, that we <em>don’t try to expand</em> until after leaving the context in which it and <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code> are painted, and then somehow replace that macro with <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code>?</p><p>If we can make that happen, then we’ll test to see if we can call the resulting function is callable.

It’s got to be a valid macro, but one that we’re NOT going to end up expanding when rescanning <code>_COUNT_ONE()</code> or <code>_COUNT_TOP()</code>. If we call it <code>_COUNT_INDIRECT</code>, we don’t want <code>_COUNT_INDIRECT(2,3)</code> to evaluate until we pop all the way back up into <code>_COUNT()</code>.</p><p>Sounds like a tall order, but there’s are a couple of facts we’ve already learned, that can help us:</p><ol><li>We know that, if we have a function-like macro named <code>X()</code>, the preprocessor does not consider a bare <code>X</code> with no parenthesis next to it to be an invocation of <code>X</code>.</li><li>Rescans start at the replacement site, they don’t back up tokens.</li></ol><p>So perhaps we can separate the function name and the arguments for a while, and somehow bring them together in a way where we could rescan it inside <code>COUNT()</code>.</p><p>Having the function name separate from an argument list will both keep it from running, and will help us avoid a rescan the first time we get the left parenthesis to plop down in the right place.</p><p>We just need a way to add a spacer of some sort that goes away at rescan, to keep apart the name <code>_COUNT_ONE</code> from its argument list. That is, we’d conceptually like to do:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_COUNT_ONE</span>(x, ...) <span>\</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then we’re going to re-generate <code>_COUNT_ONE</code> on the rescan, which is painted blue.</p><p>So it’s actually <code>_COUNT_INDIRECT</code> where we currently have the dire need to postpone evaluating it.</p><p>Therefore, we need to turn <code>_COUNT_INDIRECT</code> into a function, and keep THAT identifier separated from the parentheses that trigger it, via our to-be-written spacer.

Because hey, we already know there are, we just might not know WHAT they are.</p><p>It’s not hard to create a spacer. We can define a macro named <code>EMPTY</code> like this:</p><p>And use that as our spacer. If you’ve ever peeked into someone’s recursive macros and been dumbfounded with what you saw, there’s a good chance you saw a macro named <code>EMPTY</code> and at the time were thinking, “what the heck could that possibly do?”</p><p>Now you know.

Doing so makes it easy for us to control how long we want to wait before we’re able to evaluate what we’re separating.</p><p>Specifically, let’s say we nest our recursive call several levels down. Every level, we use the same trick recursively, separating <code>EMPTY()</code> apart… using another <code>EMPTY()</code> invocation.</p><p>For instance, if we need to postpone a total of three layers, we could write:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span>_COUNT_INDIRECT EMPTY EMPTY <span>EMPTY</span>() () () () (2, 3)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Honestly, <code>EMPTY()</code> is a confusing name that detracts from what’s happening. we can encapsulate this into a more readable macro… or macros, one for each level we might want to postpone evaluation:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>POSTPONE1</span>(macro_name, args) macro_name <span>EMPTY</span>() args

We’ve even added the args we want to call it with as a second parameter, to make it more clear what we’re doing, instead of having a bunch of consecutive argument lists detached from their identifier, which many engineers find alien and incomprehensible.</p><p>So far, the rest of what we have is:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_COUNT_TOP</span>(...)   __VA_OPT__(_COUNT_ONE(__VA_ARGS__))

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let’s now see if it is getting the right text up to the top, even though we won’t yet try to get it to expand (and thus, we will get a compiler error). If we invoke as <code>COUNT(1, 2)</code> again, CPP will generate the following expansion:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span>(<span>+</span>1 <span>_COUNT_INDIRECT</span> ()(2) <span>+</span> 0)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That… looks exactly like what we were hoping to see. As we wanted, the pieces came together, and <code>_COUNT_INDIRECT()</code> did NOT get evaluated during the rescan process. If we had made a mistake, and the rescan had happened, it would have been replaced with <code>_COUNT_ONE</code>, which we already know we could <em>not</em> trigger for re-evaluation.</p><p>Okay, let’s now see what happens if we try to force the expansion of the above, to finally get an answer to our question as to the true scope of blue paint.</p><p>Let’s wrap the body of <code>COUNT()</code> with a call to a passthrough macro, which we’ll name <code>EVAL()</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>EVAL</span>(...)  __VA_ARGS__

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Based on our rules above, <code>EVAL()</code> will substitute, and then rescan. So this passthrough macro forces the rescan we want.</p><p>The test case for our macro should be:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>

Instead, it will expand to:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span>(<span>+</span>1 <span>+</span>1 <span>_COUNT_INDIRECT</span> ()(3) <span>+</span> 0))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What’s happening should be clear at this point: while we are iterating over arguments, we are stopping after the second iteration.</p><p>Great, that’s easy to fix. We can do so by…</p><p>Passing the output of <code>EVAL()</code> to another call of <code>EVAL()</code>, like so:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>COUNT</span>(...) EVAL(EVAL((_COUNT_TOP(__VA_ARGS__) <span>+</span> 0)))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Before we address the obvious complaint, I’d like to point out that the extra <code>EVAL()</code> doesn’t mess up the results if we change our test invocation to <code>COUNT()</code> or <code>COUNT(1)</code>.</p><p><code>EVAL()</code> will expand, but it doesn’t break anything when there are no macros in the text passed to it that are eligible for expansion. Once the last possible expansion happens, it will just keep copying its arguments to the replacement text, per the algorithm above; the associated rescans have nothing to do.</p><p>Given that, it’s common to say, “Nobody needs more than 10 arguments!” and do something like:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_E</span>(...) __VA_ARGS__
</span></span><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>EVAL</span>(...) _E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(_E(__VA_ARGS__))))))))))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Although, more commonly, you’d probably see people do more expansions, perhaps enough to accommodate 20 or 50 arguments. Even there, I’ve seen some Microsoft APIs that convince me, that’s too low a limit, so I’d suggest at least 100 iterations.</p><p>We can use a much smarter approach that can still fairly compactly get us as many expansions as we think we might ever need.</p><p>I’d guess that, if we saw a function with 1024 arguments, it would be explicitly TRYING to break our macro.

</span></span><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>EVAL</span>(...)   _E1024(__VA_ARGS__)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The last expansion really is gratuitous; we could name <code>_E1024()</code> to<code>EVAL()</code> and stop on the power of two, but what fun is that?</p><p>Before writing this article, I generally stopped at 256 iterations, but I was curious as to whether the compiler’s CPP was smart enough to skip unnecessary evaluations, given it’s a common idiom. I ramped the number of iterations up to 65,636, and built a minimal program that would trigger 100 different calls to eval. On a Macbook Pro using <code>clang</code>, that many expansions took .13 seconds; when setting EVAL to 256 expansions, compiling took .06 seconds. When using <code>gcc</code>, both times were a bit more than twice as expensive.</p><p>So no, we definitely shouldn’t keep going until we get to 2^64; it’s unlikely to work. But, I’ve never noticed compile time impact due to 256 iterations, even in programs using recursive macros extensively, and can recommend it, but it also seems 2^16 expansions is totally acceptable for cases where you might need it (probably when you’re iterating over something other than call arguments).</p><p>NOW we can declare victory.</p><p>Hang on, I’m going to go cry again, but this time tears of joy. 😭😭</p><h3 id="you-can-count-me-out">You can count me out</h3><p>While the <code>EVAL</code>approach works, you may find it feels kludgy. Why ask the preprocessor to do all that additional work? <em>maybe</em> it can recognize the idiom and short-circuit a bunch of work with an <code>EVAL()</code>? Is there really no better way?
There <em>is</em> a technique that facilitates the kind of compile-time recursion we’re trying to do here, without unnecessary layers of expansion.
The basic idea is related to the concept of <em>continuations</em>; every macro passes a bag of state to the ‘next’ function-like macro that should get called, doing it in a way that allows us to BOTH dodge blue paint, AND terminate without oblivious expansions.
However:</p><ol><li>The approach is MUCH more complicated than what we’ve done so far (and I hope anyone reading should agree what we’ve done today is already much too complicated).</li><li>Having used the continuation approach, I find it too brittle (as implementable in CPP), and significantly harder to debug than more traditional recursion work-arounds.</li><li>The extra evals in the approach we’re using tend to be cheap enough, that the massive amount of extra complexity buys you virtually nothing.</li><li>I suspect the continuation technique cannot be done without relying on undefined behavior (specifically, how the compiler chooses to resolve cases where there are multiple possible ambiguous valid expansions).
But, it’s still really cool, and if you’re interested (and really want to risk your head going 🤯), <a href="https://github.com/camel-cdr/bfcpp/">check out this brainf— interpreter</a> written entirely in C macros.</li></ol><p>I should note, there are still other ways we could avoid such deep compile-time recursion, or even all recursion if we aren’t trying to get close to an arbitrary number of arguments. It’s all far uglier (and way more challenging to understand), and what we’re doing is performant, enough so that added ugliness isn’t merited, IMHO.</p><p>Though, one thing I do recommend you do differently from what we’ve done today, is that you should add a common prefix to all your names, to remove the risk of name collisions — many libraries already define things like <code>EVAL()</code> and <code>EMPTY()</code>for themselves, and you never know what might make its way into your system, and cause chaos.</p><p>You can’t be bothered? Okay, I’m a pushover (and feel strongly about the issue). So I’ve provided a complete version for you at the end of this article.</p><h2 id="count-your-blessings">Count your blessings</h2><p>This journey has taken us further down the macro rabbit hole than anyone should ever have to go, yet we didn’t have to sacrifice ALL of our remaining sanity (it helps that I was already tapped out).
As much as C actively worked to thwart us from our goal, we got there; now we have a good tool for better compile-time checking of C code in a number of cases, such as when we want to support variable argument functions.
And, with incredibly minor changes, we can re-use the code to operate on each argument, to support other things we might want to automate to make our code more robust. For instance, we could add automatic casts or calls to runtime type checkers, or so on.
All you really need to do is, take the text we insert (generating the addition that the compiler can easily fold into a count), and replace it with an invocation of a macro that the caller passes in, passing that macro the current argument.
Yes, the C standard committee has good reason to disallow recursion— removing the restriction would undoubtedly break existing code. Yet, the difficulty of the whole exercise hopefully demonstrates the need for some quality-of-life improvements in C2Y, all of which can be done without significant backward compatibility risk.</p><p>Most of all, I’d love to be able to do far more meaningful work at compile time much more sanely, minimizing my use of macros (as I know many others would too). For that, the language should extend <code>constexpr</code> capabilities, giving us good, full-fledged <code>constexpr</code> functions, with as few limitations as possible. That may be a tall order for C2Y, given the complexity of that change.
But even still, I’d want to improve the macro system too:</p><ol><li>Add a builtin macro, <code>__VA_COUNT__</code>. We need it to avoid null truncation problems for varargs, and shouldn’t have to keep reinventing the wheel (or doling out <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> in our code like it’s Halloween candy).</li><li>Add another builtin macro, <code>__VA_EMPTY__(...)</code>, which would be the inverse of <code>__VA_OPT__(...)</code>; its arguments would only get expanded only when the are NO variadic arguments. This would make it even easier to ensure people have good tools to easily terminate the kind of recursion we did today. Assuming <code>constexpr</code> functions take longer to do well, A <code>__VA_EMPTY__</code> macro can also bridge the gap of not having a good compile-time IF available for complex use cases; it would be much easier to cobble together a reasonably robust one one in macros than it is today by pairing it with <code>__VA_OPT__</code>.</li><li>Add a <code>__VA_EVAL__(...)</code>which simply expands its contents, with two semantic changes to the process that other macro goes through:<ol><li>When an expansion fully finishes, the entire macro gets rescanned again, as many times as necessary, until the full expansion reaches a fix-point (meaning, no more expansions are possible). That would allow us to worry about artificial limits on <code>EVAL()</code> macros; they’d just stop when they should stop.</li><li>Every top-level rescan should remove all blue paint generated during one expansion, before starting the next expansion (alternately, it could forego further painting macros in the first place).</li></ol></li><li>A more general purpose <code>__MAP__(body_macro, state, ...)</code>would be useful (though, to be fair, much less of a problem to build robustly if the rest of the above were present).</li><li>While waiting for <code>constexr</code> functions, it would be valuable to have a preprocessor built-in <code>__SHA256__</code> that… replaces the contents passed to it (after expansion) with the SHA256 hash of those contents. I’ve seen more than a few cases where this would be incredibly useful for saving both startup costs, and ongoing costs. No? Why can’t we have nice things??!! Interestingly, doing a compile-time only implementation of <code>SHA-256</code> using only C macros may seem possible, but I’ve built it (for strings one block in length), and it completely overwhelms both GCC and Clang, even with significantly reduced rounds.</li></ol><p>If the committee were to adopt most of the above, it sure would make one of the ugliest legacies the language has needed to carry forward far more tolerable.</p><p>We mere mortals would be able to get the gist of expansion rules more easily, if we could tell ourselves, “macro recursion is disallowed unless you use <code>__EVAL__()</code>”. That removes a huge source of confusion, but still leaves us with the problem of getting termination conditions right, which are a bit tricky.
Adding <code>__VA_EMPTY__()</code> makes it pretty easy for someone to get the exit condition right in the common case where our recursion is being used to iterate over the arguments passed to function-like macros. <code>__EVAL__()</code> would then essentially be able to function as a “do what I mean” operator, for most of the things people bang their head against when trying to write useful, robust macros to hide C’s unnecessary complexity. With just these two things, you would be able to implement <code>__VA_COUNT__(…)</code><em>fairly</em> simply:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>__REST__</span>(x, ...) __VA_ARGS__

</span></span><span><span>    __VA_OPT__(1 <span>+</span> __EVAL__(__VA_COUNT__(__REST__(__VA_ARGS__))))

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The new <code>H4X0R_MAP()</code> call gives us a more general purpose way to apply transformations to a list of individual arguments. This can help us automate static type checking per-argument, for instance, when we’re implementing variable-argument functions and want to statically ensure all items at the call site have the same time (as done in the <a href="https://codeberg.org/h4x0r/vargs">variadic function arguments</a> implementation I <a href="https://h4x0r.org/vargs/">wrote about last week</a>.</p><p>For a use case like that, we need to add the commas back in from the original call site. But we won’t want to add the comma at the end of last argument, because the C compiler will complain. There are plenty of different ways to handle this problem, including:</p><ul><li>If the output is being passed to a C varargs function where the same arguments we’re iterating over will have a correct <code>count</code> parameter before the values, we can simply add a dummy value (probably 0 since that’ll pass through easily in most contexts). This one is trivial when appropriate, but I don’t love it, as it isn’t always appropriate.</li><li>We can rework our map implementation to call a different callback for the last parameter, or to call a separate callback in between parameters. This is definitely more workable, but requires more recursive macro work, overcomplicating things. And then, the extra parameter can easily be forgotten by callers, which would lead to confusing errors (any time you make a mistake calling a macro, but the error isn’t detected until the compilation step, we should expect it to be confusing).</li><li>We can let the caller handle the first argument separately, and then for any subsequent arguments, add the comma at the beginning, separating it from the previous argument that we know must be present.</li></ul><p>I personally think the third option is the best compromise. Let’s look at a simple little example. While I normally would want to add more static type checking, sometimes the need might arise to convert a bunch of items of different types into <code>void *</code> .</p><p>If we only need to do it for integer types and pointers, it’s not too hard to use a union to statically convert one item at a time to <code>void *</code>.</p><p>We will create a temporary union, with two fields, one being our largest standard unsigned int type (<code>unsigned long long</code>, guaranteed to be at least 64 bits), and a <code>void *</code>. We will use a cast to assign to the first field, allowing us to insert any integer or pointer type into the anonymous union:</p><ul><li>Shorter integers will happily promote to a larger size.</li><li>Pointers will convert, since they are never more than 64 bits in size today.</li><li>The first field being unsigned prevents unwanted sign extension, when we insert signed values that are kept in smaller values.</li></ul><p>We then will take the value out of the anonymous union, using the <code>void *</code> . The compiler is smart enough to not generate a real temporary object for this conversion.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE</span>(arg)                  <span>\</span>
</span></span><span><span>    ((union { unsigned <span>long</span> <span>long</span> u; <span>void</span> <span>*</span>v; }){ <span>\</span>
</span></span><span><span>         .<span>u</span> <span>=</span> (unsigned <span>long</span> <span>long</span>)arg,           <span>\</span>
</span></span><span><span>     }).<span>v</span>    
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, let’s build a macro to return the first parameter item in a variable list:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>H4X0R_FIRST</span>(...)     __VA_OPT__(_H4X0R_FIRST(__VA_ARGS__))
</span></span><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_H4X0R_FIRST</span>(x, ...) x
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The reason for two macros here, is that we want to be able to tolerate cases where no arguments are provided.</p><p>We then can do the same thing to get all the rest of the arguments, after carving off the first argument:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>H4X0R_REST</span>(...)     __VA_OPT__(_H4X0R_REST(__VA_ARGS__))
</span></span><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_H4X0R_REST</span>(x, ...) __VA_ARGS__
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When we process the first argument, we’ll be able to call <code>_H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE()</code> directly. For the rest of the arguments, we’re going to want to pass a macro to process the argument, which can reuse <code>_H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE()</code>, but does need to add a comma before the argument. So it’s as simple as:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_H4X0R_CONVERT_LATER_ARG</span>(arg) , _H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE(arg)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We’ll want to pass that macro to our map implementation. Here’s the call to our map function:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>_H4X0R_CONVERT_LIST</span>(...) H4X0R_MAP(_H4X0R_CONVERT_LATER_ARG, __VA_ARGS__)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To stitch this all together, we just need to peal off the first argument from the rest, and concatenate the two resulting pieces. The only caveat is that we need to be careful to avoid adding a spurious comma or semicolons in between the two bits we need. When in doubt, use <code>cc -E</code> to review what’s getting produced.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="java"><span><span><span>#</span>define <span>H4X0R_VA_VOID_STAR_CONVERT</span>(...)          <span>\</span>
</span></span><span><span>    _H4X0R_CONVERT_ONE(H4X0R_FIRST(__VA_ARGS__)) <span>\</span>
</span></span><span><span>    _H4X0R_CONVERT_LIST(H4X0R_REST(__VA_ARGS__))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A dumb test case to show this working:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>int</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>main</span>()
</span></span><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%d items: (%p, %p, %p)</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>,
</span></span><span><span>           <span>H4X0R_VA_COUNT</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>),
</span></span><span><span>           <span>H4X0R_VA_VOID_STAR_CONVERT</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>));
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you may expect, this prints:</p><p>With our knowledge, and our final <code>H4X0R_MAP()</code> and <code>H4X0R_COUNT()</code> implementations, we can now do some significant transformations easily most people find mind boggling.</p><p>I find it astounding, the level of difficulty required to understand enough about C macros to be able to build a primitive as basic as counting arguments statically at a call site.</p><p>There’s such a high level of complexity involved, that it’s even more amazing to me, that once we got the understanding we needed, we could implement both macros in a mere 18 lines of code, exactly half of that being the rote <code>H4X0R_EVAL()</code>implementation.</p><p>And in my view, by choosing comprehensible names, despite all the hurdles we’ve had to overcome, the final result looks almost trivial. Yet, the code alone does not hint at the knowledge you need to write it.</p><p>I’m confident that nearly anyone who lacks a solid understanding of those basics who tries to gain understanding by trying to rebuild this code, but using it has a guide (perhaps to a slightly different use case), will be inflicting gruesome self-torture on themselves. They might have preferred to code their algorithm in the Brainf— implementation mentioned above!</p><p>Why is this stuff so hard after decades of standardization? Is the committee secretly a cabal of Rust zealots, that built time travel and went back to 1989, to maximize their torture of C developers?? Maybe that was the inspiration for the movie <em>12 Monkeys</em> 🤔&nbsp;Sounds plausible. Or did they just beam that into my head?! Where did I leave my tin foil hat?</p><p><strong>Happy hacking</strong> (but hopefully not on C macros)!</p><p>— L33 T. (with a <code>#</code>-ing headache)</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>This post started as an out-of-control sidebar in my post on <a href="https://h4x0r.org/vargs/">variable argument functions in C.</a></p><p>I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Robert Seacord; his early feedback gave me the clarity I needed to (hopefully) help other C programmers over what is probably one of the biggest hurdles in the language… people who become C developers eventually master pointers, but to many senior developers, macro recursion has remained a dark art, requiring a magic incantation borrowed from Stack Overflow, Claude or the like.</p><p>Ivan O’Day also was critical here, BUT is responsible for me taking several extra weeks to get the article out once it was in decent shape… because he helped me see that I really needed the step-by-step example of a macro expansion, which I then had to find time to do!</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Kenya processes more mobile money transactions per capita than any country on Earth.</span></p><p>It worked because it solved a real problem: Kenyans were already sending money through informal networks. M-PESA just made it cheaper and safer.</p><p>Here’s why this matters: M-PESA created a payment rail with near-zero transaction costs.

You’re replacing $3-5/week kerosene spending with a $0.21/day solar subscription (so with $1.5 per week half the price of kerosene) that’s cheaper AND gives you better light, phone charging, radio, and no respiratory disease.</p><p><span>The default rate? </span><strong>90%+ of customers repay on time.</strong></p><p>Why? Because the asset actually works. It delivers value every single day. The alternative is going back to kerosene lamps in the dark. Nobody wants that.</p><p>This is the “innovation” that everyone missed. The hardware got cheap, but PAYG made it accessible.

<p>Last month, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine archived its trillionth webpage, and the nonprofit invited its more than 1,200 library partners and 800,000 daily users to join a celebration of the moment. To honor “three decades of safeguarding the world’s online heritage,” the city of San Francisco declared October 22 to be “Internet Archive Day.” The Archive was also <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2025/07/24/internet-archive-designated-as-a-federal-depository-library/">recently designated</a> a federal depository library by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), who proclaimed the organization a “perfect fit” to expand “access to federal government publications amid an increasingly digital landscape.”</p>
<p>The Internet Archive might sound like a thriving organization, but it only recently emerged from years of bruising copyright battles that threatened to bankrupt the beloved library project. In the end, the fight led to <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/06/14/patrons-speak-out-the-impact-of-losing-access-to-more-than-500000-books/">more than 500,000 books being removed</a> from the Archive’s “Open Library.”</p>
<p>“We survived,” Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle told Ars. “But it wiped out the Library.”</p>
<p>An Internet Archive spokesperson confirmed to Ars that the archive currently faces no major lawsuits and no active threats to its collections. Kahle thinks “the world became stupider” when the Open Library was gutted—but he’s moving forward with new ideas.</p>
<h2>History of the Internet Archive</h2>
<p>Kahle has been striving since 1996 to transform the Internet Archive into a digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>—but “with a better fire protection plan,” joked Kyle Courtney, a copyright lawyer and librarian who leads the nonprofit eBook Study Group, which helps states update laws to protect libraries.</p>
<p>When the Wayback Machine was born in 2001 as a way to take snapshots of the web, Kahle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/29/business/new-economy-library-web-pages-that-warms-cockles-wired-heart-beats-library.html">told The New York Times</a> that building free archives was “worth it.” He was also excited that the Wayback Machine had drawn renewed media attention to libraries.</p>
<p>At the time, law professor Lawrence Lessig predicted that the Internet Archive would face copyright battles, but he also believed that the Wayback Machine would change the way the public understood copyright fights.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>”We finally have a clear and tangible example of what’s at stake,” Lessig told the Times. He insisted that Kahle was “defining the public domain” online, which would allow Internet users to see ”how easy and important” the Wayback Machine “would be in keeping us sane and honest about where we’ve been and where we’re going.”</p>
<p>Kahle suggested that IA’s legal battles weren’t with creators or publishers so much as with large media companies that he thinks aren’t “satisfied with the restriction you get from copyright.”</p>
<p>“They want that and more,” Kahle said, pointing to e-book licenses that expire as proof that libraries increasingly aren’t allowed to own their collections. He also suspects that such companies wanted the Wayback Machine dead—but the Wayback Machine has survived and proved itself to be a unique and useful resource.</p>
<p>The Internet Archive also began archiving—and then lending—e-books. For a decade, the Archive had loaned out individual e-books to one user at a time without triggering any lawsuits. That changed when IA decided to temporarily lift the cap on loans from its Open Library project to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/internet-archive-offers-thousands-of-copyrighted-books-for-free-online/">create a “National Emergency Library”</a> as libraries across the world shut down during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project eventually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/internet-archive-offers-thousands-of-copyrighted-books-for-free-online/">grew to 1.4 million</a> titles.</p>
<p>But lifting the lending restrictions also brought more scrutiny from copyright holders, who eventually sued the Archive. Litigation went on for years. In 2024, IA lost its final appeal in a lawsuit brought by book publishers over the Archive’s Open Library project, which used a novel e-book lending model to bypass publishers’ licensing fees and checkout limitations. Damages <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-loses-hachette-books-case-appeal/">could have topped $400 million</a>, but publishers ultimately <a href="https://publishers.org/news/publishers-and-internet-archive-submit-negotiated-judgment-with-permanent-injunction-to-district-court-in-hachette-book-group-et-al-v-internet-archive/">announced</a> a “confidential agreement on a monetary payment” that did not bankrupt the Archive.</p>
<p>Litigation has continued, though. More recently, the Archive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/internet-archives-big-battle-with-music-publishers-ends-in-settlement/">settled</a> another suit over its Great 78 Project after music publishers sought damages of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/music-labels-will-regret-coming-for-the-internet-archive-sound-historian-says/">up to $700 million</a>. A settlement in that case, reached last month, was similarly confidential. In both cases, IA’s experts challenged publishers’ estimates of their losses as massively inflated.</p>

The Archive can continue—but it can’t run one of its major programs in the same way.</p>

<h2>What the Internet Archive lost</h2>
<p>To Kahle, the suits have been an immense setback to IA’s mission.</p>
<p>Publishers had argued that the Open Library’s lending harmed the e-book market, but IA says its vision for the project was not to frustrate e-book sales (which it denied its library does) but to make it easier for researchers to reference e-books by allowing Wikipedia to link to book scans. Wikipedia has long been one of the most visited websites in the world, and the Archive wanted to deepen its authority as a research tool.</p>
<p>“One of the real purposes of libraries is not just access to information by borrowing a book that you might buy in a bookstore,” Kahle said. “In fact, that’s actually the minority. Usually, you’re comparing and contrasting things. You’re quoting. You’re checking. You’re standing on the shoulders of giants.”</p>
<p>Meredith Rose, senior policy counsel for Public Knowledge, told Ars that the Internet Archive’s Wikipedia enhancements could have served to surface information that’s often buried in books, giving researchers a streamlined path to source accurate information online.</p>
<p>But Kahle said the lawsuits against IA showed that “massive multibillion-dollar media conglomerates” have their own interests in controlling the flow of information. “That’s what they really succeeded at—to make sure that Wikipedia readers don’t get access to books,” Kahle said.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Open Library lawsuit was publishers’ market for e-book licenses, which libraries complain provide only temporary access for a limited number of patrons and cost substantially more than the acquisition of physical books. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/books/libraries-e-books-licensing.html">Some states are crafting laws to restrict e-book licensing</a>, with the aim of preserving library functions.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>“We don’t want libraries to become Hulu or Netflix,” said Courtney of the eBook Study Group, posting warnings to patrons like “last day to check out this book, August 31st, then it goes away forever.”</p>
<p>He, like Kahle, is concerned that libraries will become unable to fulfill their longtime role—preserving culture and providing equal access to knowledge. Remote access, Courtney noted, benefits people who can’t easily get to libraries, like the elderly, people with disabilities, rural communities, and foreign-deployed troops.</p>
<p>Before the Internet Archive cases, libraries had won some important legal fights, according to Brandon Butler, a copyright lawyer and executive director of Re:Create, a coalition of “libraries, civil libertarians, online rights advocates, start-ups, consumers, and technology companies” that is “dedicated to balanced copyright and a free and open Internet.”</p>
<p>But the Internet Archive’s e-book fight didn’t set back libraries, Butler said, because the loss didn’t reverse any prior court wins. Instead, IA had been “exploring another frontier” <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/google-books-ruled-legal-in-massive-win-for-fair-use/">beyond the Google Books ruling,</a> which deemed Google’s searchable book excerpts a transformative fair use, hoping that linking to books from Wikipedia would also be deemed fair use. But IA “hit the edge” of what courts would allow, Butler said.</p>
<p>IA basically asked, “Could fair use go this much farther?” Butler said. “And the courts said, ‘No, this is as far as you go.'”</p>
<p>To Kahle, the cards feel stacked against the Internet Archive, with courts, lawmakers, and lobbyists backing corporations seeking “hyper levels of control.” He said IA has always served as a research library—an online destination where people can cross-reference texts and verify facts, just like perusing books at a local library.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to be a library,” Kahle said. “A library in a traditional sense. And it’s getting hard.”</p>

<h2>Fears of big fines may delay digitization projects</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/">cuts</a> to the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services have put America’s public libraries at risk, and reduced funding will continue to challenge libraries in the coming years, ALA has <a href="https://www.ala.org/news/2025/04/imls-cuts-put-americas-public-libraries-risk">warned</a>. Butler has also suggested that under-resourced libraries may delay digitization efforts for preservation purposes if they worry that publishers may threaten costly litigation.</p>
<p>He told Ars he thinks courts are getting it right on recent fair use rulings. But he noted that libraries have fewer resources for legal fights because copyright law “has this provision that says, well, if you’re a copyright holder, you really don’t have to prove that you suffered any harm at all.”</p>
<p>“You can just elect [to receive] a massive payout based purely on the fact that you hold a copyright and somebody infringed,” Butler said. “And that’s really unique. Almost no other country in the world has that sort of a system.”</p>
<p>So while companies like AI firms may be able to afford legal fights with rights holders, libraries must be careful, even when they launch projects that seem “completely harmless and innocuous,” Butler said. Consider the Internet Archive’s Great 78 Project, which digitized 400,000 old shellac records, known as 78s, that were originally pressed from 1898 to the 1950s.</p>
<p>“The idea that somebody’s going to stream a 78 of an Elvis song instead of firing it up on their $10-a-month Spotify subscription is silly, right?” Butler said. “It doesn’t pass the laugh test, but given the scale of the project—and multiply that by the statutory damages—and that makes this an extremely dangerous project all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>Butler suggested that statutory damages could disrupt the balance that ensures the public has access to knowledge, creators get paid, and human creativity thrives, as AI advances and libraries’ growth potentially stalls.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“It sets the risk so high that it may force deals in situations where it would be better if people relied on fair use. Or it may scare people from trying new things because of the stakes of a copyright lawsuit,” Butler said.</p>
<p>Courtney, who co-wrote a <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/ef052f76-699c-49fb-aa26-e00488cfa318">whitepaper</a> detailing the legal basis for different forms of “controlled digital lending” like the Open Library project uses, suggested that Kahle may be the person who’s best prepared to push the envelope on copyright.</p>
<p>When asked how the Internet Archive managed to avoid financial ruin, Courtney said it survived “only because their leader” is “very smart and capable.” Of all the “flavors” of controlled digital lending (CDL) that his paper outlined, Kahle’s methodology for the Open Library Project was the most “revolutionary,” Courtney said.</p>
<p>Importantly, IA’s loss did not doom other kinds of CDL that other archives use, he noted, nor did it prevent libraries from trying new things.</p>
<p>“Fair use is a case-by-case determination” that will be made as urgent preservation needs arise, Courtney told Ars, and “libraries have a ton of stuff that aren’t going to make the jump to digital unless we digitize them. No one will have access to them.”</p>

<h2>What’s next for the Internet Archive?</h2>
<p>The lawsuits haven’t dampened Kahle’s resolve to expand IA’s digitization efforts, though. Moving forward, the group will be growing a project called Democracy’s Library, which is “a free, open, online compendium of government research and publications from around the world” that will be conveniently linked in Wikipedia articles to help researchers discover them.</p>
<p>The Archive is also collecting as many physical materials as possible to help preserve knowledge, even as “the library system is largely contracting,” Kahle said. He noted that libraries historically tend to grow in societies that prioritize education and decline in societies where power is being concentrated, and he’s worried about where the US is headed. That makes it hard to predict if IA—or any library project—will be supported in the long term.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>With governments globally partnering with the biggest tech companies to try to win the artificial intelligence race, critics have <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/tech-oligarchy-imperils-democratic-information-flows/">warned</a> of threats to US democracy, while the <a href="https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/the-scoop/white-house-attacks-libraries/">White House has escalated its attack on libraries</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-administrations-attack-on-university-research-accelerates/">universities</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/china-aims-to-recruit-top-us-scientists-as-trump-tries-to-kill-the-chips-act/">science</a> over the past year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AI firms face dozens of lawsuits from creators and publishers, which Kahle thinks only the biggest tech companies can likely afford to outlast. The momentum behind AI risks giving corporations even more control over information, Kahle said, and it’s uncertain if archives dedicated to preserving the public memory will survive attacks from multiple fronts.</p>
<p>“Societies that are [growing] are the ones that need to educate people” and therefore promote libraries, Kahle said. But when societies are “going down,” such as in times of war, conflict, and social upheaval, libraries “tend to get destroyed by the powerful. It used to be king and church, and it’s now corporations and governments.” (He recommended <em>The Library: A Fragile History</em> as a must-read to understand the challenges libraries have always faced.)</p>
<p>Kahle told Ars he’s not “black and white” on AI, and he even sees some potential for AI to enhance library services.</p>
<p>He’s more concerned that libraries in the US are losing support and may soon cease to perform classic functions that have always benefited civilizations—like buying books from small publishers and local authors, supporting intellectual endeavors, and partnering with other libraries to expand access to diverse collections.</p>
<p>To prevent these cultural and intellectual losses, he plans to position IA as a refuge for displaced collections, with hopes to digitize as much as possible while defending the early dream that the Internet could equalize access to information and supercharge progress.</p>
<p>“We want everyone [to be] a reader,” Kahle said, and that means “we want lots of publishers, we want lots of vendors, booksellers, lots of libraries.”</p>
<p>But, he asked, “Are we going that way? No.”</p>
<p>To turn things around, Kahle suggested that copyright laws be “re-architected” to ensure “we have a game with many winners”—where authors, publishers, and booksellers get paid, library missions are respected, and progress thrives. Then society can figure out “what do we do with this new set of AI tools” to keep the engine of human creativity humming.</p>

It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings-“catching on,” “making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do […] Intelligence, so defined, can be measured, and intelligence tests measure it well.</p></blockquote><p>Intelligence sounds pretty great. Who doesn’t want to “catch on” and “make sense”? Hell, “figuring out” what to do is pretty much all of life!</p><p>Naturally, people with more of this mental horsepower must live happier lives. When they encounter a problem, they should use their superior problem-solving ability to solve it. Smarter people should do a better job making plans and getting what they want, and they should learn more from their mistakes and subsequently make fewer of them. All of this should add up to a life that makes smart people go “this life rules!”</p><p>So smarter people are happier, right?</p><p><span>Well, this meta-analysis says </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264815376_Does_Intelligence_Boost_Happiness_Smartness_of_All_Pays_More_Than_Being_Smarter_Than_Others" rel="">no</a><span>. Another says </span><a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1998-deneve.pdf" rel="">maybe a teeny tiny bit</a><span>. This large, nationally-representative study from the UK </span><a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/s0033291712002139" rel="">finds</a><span> that people who score the lowest on an intelligence test are a little less happy than everyone else, but that’s pretty much it.</span></p><p><span>I also pulled data from the </span><a href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/home" rel="">General Social Survey</a><span>, which includes (a) a short vocabulary test that </span><a href="https://gss.norc.org/Documents/reports/methodological-reports/MR111%20The%20Psychometric%20Properties%20of%20the%20GSS%20Wordsum%20Vocabulary%20Test.pdf" rel="">seems</a><span> to correlate reasonably well with longer intelligence tests (you can try it </span><a href="https://planspace.org/20220101-try_the_gss_wordsum_questions/" rel="">here</a><span>), and (b) a simple measure of happiness: “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days—would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?” Across 50 years of data and 30,346 people, the folks who scored higher on the vocab test were a tiny bit </span><em>less</em><span> happy (r = -.06, p &lt; .001).</span></p><p><span>Maybe our tests are bad. The psychological study of intelligence has a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#IQ_testing_and_the_eugenics_movement_in_the_United_States" rel="">long, bleak history</a><span> of racism and prejudice against poor people (“</span><a href="https://education.blogs.archives.gov/2017/05/02/buck-v-bell/" rel="">three generations of imbeciles are enough</a><span>”), so we should be skeptical coming in.

Shouldn’t those people end up with happier lives, however unfair that may be?</p><p><span>And the tests likely </span><em>do</em><span> tap something more than just privilege and effort.

At this point, pretty much every paper on intelligence has to start out like </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jelte-Wicherts/publication/289963376_A_dynamical_model_of_general_intelligence_The_positive_manifold_of_intelligence_by_mutualism/links/5710ceaf08aefb6cadac0b21/A-dynamical-model-of-general-intelligence-The-positive-manifold-of-intelligence-by-mutualism.pdf" rel="">this review from 2006</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>In the study of intelligence, one empirical phenomenon is well established: Test scores on cognitive tasks show a positive manifold, that is, they are invariably positively intercorrelated, albeit to varying degrees. This implies that people who score well on one cognitive test are likely to score well on other cognitive tests. The positive manifold is a robust phenomenon.</p></blockquote><p><span>Spearman’s stats were sound, but his interpretation was wrong. He did not, as he claimed, observe a “continued tendency to success throughout all variations of both form and subject-matter,” nor has anybody else. It merely </span><em>looks</em><span> as if we’ve varied all the forms and the subject-matters because we have the wrong theory about what makes them different.</span></p><p>We think tests of math, vocabulary, French, music, etc. are all different because some are about words and others are about numbers and others are about sounds. But psychology, like all sciences, is all about discovering the differences between seemingly similar things, and discovering the similarities between seemingly different things. If psychologists ever had to march into battle, a good candidate for our crests may be the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, the two lines that look like they’re different lengths but aren’t:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png" width="464" height="361" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:361,&quot;width&quot;:464,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7Ye!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9befc0b2-1d37-433f-8f59-1cfc167743bc_464x361.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>It strikes fear into the hearts of the economists!</figcaption></figure></div><p>Just like those lines, I think all of our various tests of intelligence aren’t as different as they seem. They’re all full of problems that have a few important things in common:</p><ul><li><p>There are stable relationships between the variables.</p></li><li><p>There’s no disagreement about whether the problems are problems, or whether they’ve been solved.</p></li><li><p>There have clear boundaries; there is a finite amount of relevant information and possible actions.</p></li><li><p>The problems are repeatable. Although the details may change, the process for solving the problems does not.</p></li></ul><p><span>I think a good name for problems like these is </span><em>well-defined</em><span>. Well-defined problems can be very difficult, but they aren’t mystical. You can write down instructions for solving them. And you can put them on a test. In fact, standardized tests items </span><em>must</em><span> be well-defined problems, because they require indisputable answers. Matching a word to its synonym, finding the area of a trapezoid, putting pictures in the correct order—all common tasks on IQ tests—are well-defined problems.</span></p><p><span>Spearman was right that people differ in their ability to solve well-defined problems. But he was wrong that well-defined problems are the </span><em>only</em><span> kind of problems. “Why can’t I find someone to spend my life with?” “Should I be a dentist or a dancer?” and “How do I get my child to stop crying?” are all important but poorly defined problems. “How can we all get along?” is not a multiple-choice question. Neither is “What do I do when my parents get old?” And getting better at rotating shapes or remembering state capitals is not going to help you solve them.</span></p><p>We all share some blame with Spearman, of course, because everybody talks about smarts as if they’re one thing. Google “smartest people in the world” and most of the results will be physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and chess masters. These are all difficult problems, but they are well-defined, and that makes it easy to rank people. The best chess player in the world is the one who can beat everybody else. The best mathematician is the one who can solve the problems that nobody else could solve. That makes it seem like the best chess players and mathematicians are not just the smartest in their fields, but the smartest in the whole world.</p><p><span>There is, unfortunately no good word for “skill at solving poorly defined problems.” Insight, creativity, agency, self-knowledge—they’re all part of it, but not all of it. </span><em>Wisdom</em><span> comes the closest, but it suggests a certain fustiness and grandeur, and poorly defined problems aren’t just dramatic questions like “how do you live a good life”; they’re also everyday questions like “how do you host a good party” and “how do you figure out what to do today.”</span></p><p><span>One way to spot people who are good at solving poorly defined problems is to look for people who feel good about their lives; “how do I live a life I like” is a humdinger of a poorly defined problem. The rules aren’t stable: what makes </span><em>you</em><span> happy may make </span><em>me</em><span> miserable. The boundaries aren’t clear: literally anything I do could make me more happy or less happy. The problems are not repeatable: what made me happy when I was 21 may not make me happy when I’m 31. Nobody else can be completely sure whether I’m happy or not, and sometimes </span><em>I’m</em><span> not even sure. In fact, some people might claim that I’m not </span><em>really</em><span> happy, no matter what I say, unless I accept Jesus into my heart or reach nirvana or fall in love—if I think I’m happy before all that, I’m simply mistaken about what happiness is!</span></p><p>This is why the people who score well on intelligence tests and win lots of chess games are no happier than the people who flunk the tests and lose at chess: well-defined and poorly defined problems require completely different problem-solving skills. Life ain’t chess! Nobody agrees on the rules, the pieces do whatever they want, and the board covers the whole globe, as well as the inside of your head and possibly several metaphysical planes as well.</p><p>Here’s another way of looking at it.</p><p>Say you want to test people’s math ability. You design a test, administer it to a bunch of people, do all your psychometrics, etc. You’re feeling pretty good about your math test. And then you find that some of the people who ace your test later say things like “two plus two is 19” and “88 is the biggest number.” You’d feel pretty embarrassed about your math test because it’s clearly not measuring mathematical ability, if it’s measuring anything at all.</p><p><span>This is exactly the situation we’re in with tests that claim to measure people’s “reasoning” and “problem-solving ability.” </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan" rel="">Christopher Langan</a><span>, a guy who can score eye-popping numbers on IQ tests, </span><a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/more-smarter-ward" rel="">believes</a><span> that 9/11 was an inside job meant specifically to distract the public from his theories, and he claims that banks won’t give him a loan because he’s white. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Sununu" rel="">John Sununu</a><span> supposedly has IQ of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1988/11/28/is-176-iq-enough-in-white-house/c0535981-650c-4c33-a233-78babc3006e0/" rel="">176</a><span>, but he still had to resign from being George H.W.

These are supposed to be some of the smartest people in the world, endowed with exceptional problem-solving abilities.

I think there’s an important lesson here: if solving a bunch of well-defined problems did not make our predecessors happier, it probably won’t make </span><em>us</em><span> happier, either. The barrier between you and everlasting bliss is probably not the size of your television, nor your ability to solve </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices" rel="">Raven’s Progressive Matrices</a><span>.</span></p><p>(To be clear, I still think it’s good we did all this. Polio sucks and going to the moon is awesome.)</p><p><span>I wish we knew more about how to make that bright green line go up, but we just haven’t yet defined the problem of “living a happy life”. We know that if you’re starving, lonely, or in pain, you’ll probably get happier if you get food, friends, and relief. After that, the returns diminish very quickly. You could read all the positive psychology you want, take the online version of </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being?ranMID=40328&amp;ranEAID=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;ranSiteID=EHFxW6yx8Uo-.uLuPn2MieBhuQZx7IMA2Q&amp;siteID=EHFxW6yx8Uo-.uLuPn2MieBhuQZx7IMA2Q&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=partners&amp;utm_source=linkshare&amp;utm_campaign=EHFxW6yx8Uo" rel="">The Science of Wellbeing</a><span> (”Yale’s Most Popular Course Ever!”), read my post on </span><a href="https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-five-tools-of-hedonic-design" rel="">hacking the hedonic treadmill</a><span>, meditate, exercise, and keep a gratitude journal—and after all that, </span><em>maybe</em><span> you’ll be a </span><em>smidge</em><span> happier. Whatever else you think will put a big, permanent smile on your face, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumbling_on_Happiness" rel="">you’re probably wrong</a><span>.</span></p><p>So if you’re really looking for a transformative change in your happiness, you might be better off reading something ancient. The great thinkers of the distant past seemed obsessed with figuring out how to live good lives: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, Marcus Aurelius, St. Augustine, even up through Thoreau and Vivekananda. But at some point, this kind of stuff apparently fell out of fashion.</p><p><span>And hey, maybe that’s because there’s just no more progress to make on the poorly defined problem of “how do we live.” But most well-defined problems were once defined poorly. For example, “how do we land on the moon” was a hopelessly poorly defined problem for most of human history. It only makes sense if you know that the moon is a big rock you can land on and not, say, </span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ancient-greek-philosopher-was-exiled-claiming-moon-was-rock-not-god-180972447/" rel="">a god floating in the sky</a><span>. We slowly put some definitions around that problem, and then one day we sent an actual dude to the moon and he walked around and was like “I’m on the moon now.” If we can do that, maybe we can also figure out how to live good lives. It certainly seems worth it to keep trying.</span></p><p><span>I’m not the first to propose that “general” intelligence is more than one thing. Pretty much as soon as Spearman started claiming that intelligence is mainly one thing, </span><a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/08957347.2019.1619560" rel="">other people</a><span> started saying that intelligence is actually many things. (That’s science, baby!) Today, the most popular version of this theory claims there’s something like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences" rel="">eight intelligences</a><span>, ranging from “visual-spatial” to “bodily-kinesthetic.” I’m sympathetic to this take because it tries to account for all the different weird and wonderful things that humans can do. But it’s got two big problems.</span></p><p><span>Problem #1: People very rarely </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4104_1?casa_token=l5YMckHnhREAAAAA:_fP7IpehLupiMbJnfllvKjaALBENDDNjWXMZaNXtaY-0xnM9PFenP4NNTrb6y7a5gpdH0k4XCo5fgg" rel="">try</a><span> to find any evidence for it. And when they do, they find that the people who score high on one of the many intelligences </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606000201?casa_token=lTn7yOEg1ksAAAAA:tfFQaX8JhtoqYUhPbeq_Rag-5vkrYLLZdfzCI9m0H1rLSBHXsIsTZ0YI2AV3ZunYlc2X-XVNrqQ" rel="">tend to score high on the others, too</a><span>, just as Spearman would’ve predicted a hundred years ago.</span></p><p>Problem #2: When you label every human activity as its own intelligence, you give up any hope of understanding anything about the structure of problems in the world or how people solve them. We can make up whatever categories we want; they aren’t given by God. The only reason to use some categories and not others is that some categories are useful and others aren’t.</p><p>For instance, we could have created a periodic table that organized the elements alphabetically, or by color, or by how good they taste. Instead we organize them by atomic number, not because it’s their “true” order, but because it’s useful. It helps us realize things like, “Hey, we’ve got a number 62 and a number 64—I wonder if there’s a number 63 out there. We should go looking for it.”</p><p><span>So we should pick the way of categorizing intelligence that gives us the most bang for our buck. “Intelligence is many things” can’t explain why people perform similarly across supposedly different tests, and “intelligence is mostly one thing” can’t answer a basic question like “why smart people aren’t happier?” But we can handle both of those challenges when we split intelligence into skill at solving </span><em>well-defined</em><span> and </span><em>poorly defined</em><span> problems.</span></p><p>And that’s not all we can do.</p><p><span>People think of AI as a big glob of problem-solving ability. If you make the glob bigger, it can solve harder problems. That’s certainly been true so far: gigantic globs of AI can now </span><a href="https://waymo.com/" rel="">drive cars</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" rel="">defeat our greatest chess players</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphafold-reveals-the-structure-of-the-protein-universe" rel="">predict how proteins will fold</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>All this has happened very quickly, which may make it seem like we’re careening toward a “general” artificial intelligence that can do all the things humans can. But if you split problems into </span><em>well-defined</em><span> and </span><em>poorly defined</em><span>, you’ll notice that all of AI’s progress has been on </span><em>defined</em><span> problems. That’s what artificial intelligence </span><em>does</em><span>. In order to get AI to solve a problem, we have to give it data to learn from, and picking that data requires defining the problem.</span></p><p>That doesn’t mean the problems AI has solved so far are stupid or trivial. They’re really important and interesting! They’re just all well-defined problems. And we should expect that pattern to continue: for any well-defined problem, AI will eventually outperform humans. But for poorly defined problems, AI is hopeless. To solve those, we need humans running around doing weird human stuff.</p><p><span>“What about </span><a href="https://openai.com/api/" rel="">GPT-3</a><span>—it can write movie scripts! And what about </span><a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/" rel="">DALLE-2</a><span>—it can paint pictures!” These AIs perform a clever trick: they make it seem like they’re solving poorly defined problems when, under the hood, they’re really solving well-defined problems. GPT-3 doesn’t actually write movie scripts; it predicts what words should come next. DALLE-2 doesn’t actually paint pictures; it matches words to images. These problems aren’t easy to solve—that’s why you need such a big glob of AI. But they obey clear, unchanging rules, they have bright boundaries, and you know precisely when you’ve solved them. They are well-defined problems. (This is also why </span><a href="https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/ai-art-isnt-art" rel="">AI art isn’t art</a><span>).</span></p><p>If you booted up a super-smart AI in ancient Greece, fed it all human knowledge, and asked it how to land on the moon, it would respond “You can’t land on the moon. The moon is a god floating in the sky.” How would you get it to realize the moon is actually a big rock? That’s a great, poorly defined problem, and I don’t expect AI to solve it anytime soon.</p><p>Here’s one last advantage of dividing intelligence into well-defined problem-solving and poorly defined problem-solving: it reminds us to give some respect where respect is due.</p><p><span>We’ve got no problem fawning over people who are good at solving well-defined problems. They get to be called “professor” and “doctor.” We pay them lots of money to teach us stuff. They get to join exclusive clubs like </span><a href="https://www.mensa.org/" rel="">Mensa</a><span> and the </span><a href="http://prometheussociety.org/wp/" rel="">Prometheus Society</a><span>. (By the way, Mensa’s page </span><a href="https://www.mensa.org/iq/what-iq" rel="">explaining IQ</a><span> doesn’t mention anything about the dark history of using intelligence tests to hurt people, and you might expect a bunch of smarty-pantses to, you know, use their brains to discuss things with a bit more nuance. But what do I know, I’m just a big dummy.)</span></p><p>People who are good at solving poorly defined problems don’t get the same kind of kudos. They don’t get any special titles or clubs. There is no test they can take that will spit out a big, honking number that will make everybody respect them.</p><p><span>And that’s a shame. My grandma does not know how to use the “input” button on her TV’s remote control, but she does know how to raise a family full of good people who love each other, how to carry on through a tragedy, and how to make the perfect pumpkin pie. We sometimes condescendingly refer to this kind of wisdom as “folksy” or “homespun,” as if answering multiple-choice questions is </span><em>real</em><span> intelligence, and living a good, full life is just some down-home, gee-whiz, cutesy thing that little old ladies do.</span></p><p>Excluding this kind of intelligence from our definitions doesn’t just hurt our grandmas—it hurts us too. If you don’t value the ability to solve poorly defined problems, you’ll never get more of it. You won’t seek out people who have that ability and try to learn from them, nor will you listen to them when they have something important to say. You’ll spend your whole life trying to solve problems with cleverness when what you really need is wisdom. And you’ll wonder why it never really seems to work. All of your optimizing, your straining to achieve and advance, your ruthless crusade to eliminate all of the well-defined problems from your life—it doesn’t actually seem make your life any better.</p><p>If you’re stuck trying to solve poorly defined problems with your slick, well-defined problem-solving skills and you’re lucky enough to have a grandma like mine still on this Earth, my god, go see her. Shut up and listen to her for a while. And once you’ve learned something, maybe ask her if she needs help with her TV.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

Authorities are tightening cybersecurity controls after hidden SIM cards were discovered during internal tests.</figcaption></figure>
<p data-start="92" data-end="304">Norway has launched a cybersecurity review after public transport operator Ruter discovered that electric buses supplied by Chinese manufacturer Yutong contained hidden SIM cards enabling potential remote access.</p>
<p data-start="306" data-end="646">According to Ruter, internal tests at a secure facility found Romanian SIM cards inside the buses, theoretically allowing the Chinese supplier to shut down vehicles or interfere via software updates. The transport operator stressed there is no evidence of misuse but said the discovery moves concerns “from suspicion to concrete knowledge”.</p>
<p data-start="648" data-end="827">Ruter has removed the SIM cards and is strengthening procurement rules, internal firewalls, and cloud-security requirements to ensure full local control over transport operations.</p>
<p data-start="829" data-end="1057">Norway’s Minister of Transport Jon-Ivar Nygård told national broadcaster NRK that the government is assessing supplier risks from countries outside Norway’s security alliances, noting the need to protect critical infrastructure.</p>
<p data-start="1059" data-end="1363">Around 1,300 electric buses operate in Norway, including approximately 850 units from Yutong, with 300 running in Oslo and Akershus. Ruter said the likelihood of attempted interference remains low, but the situation underscores the growing cybersecurity challenges linked to foreign technology suppliers.</p>
<p data-start="1365" data-end="1582">The case comes as Chinese electric buses are increasingly adopted across global markets, including Southeast Asia, raising wider questions about digital security and strategic dependencies in public transport systems.</p>
<p data-start="1584" data-end="1714">“It’s unlikely these buses would ever be misused,” Ruter CEO Bernt Reitan Jenssen said, “but we must take the risk seriously.”</p>
