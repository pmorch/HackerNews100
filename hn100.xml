<p dir="auto">Most Claude Code workflows operate in isolation – a single developer working with AI in their local environment. This creates a fundamental problem: <strong>AI-assisted development becomes a silo</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By using GitHub Issues as our database, we unlock something powerful:</p>

<li>AI can start a task, human can finish it (or vice versa)</li>
<li>Progress updates are visible to everyone, not trapped in chat logs</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Traditional single-thread approach:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Main conversation carries ALL the implementation details</li>
<li>Context window fills with database schemas, API code, UI components</li>
<li>Eventually hits context limits and loses coherence</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Parallel agent approach:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li>Implementation details never pollute the main conversation</li>
<li>Main thread maintains oversight without drowning in code</li>

This funding values the company at &gt;$100 billion.</p><p>The company expects to use the new capital to accelerate its AI strategy — expanding Agent Bricks, investing in its new database offering Lakebase, and fueling global growth. At the June Data + AI Summit, Databricks introduced a new product, Agent Bricks, which builds high-quality, production AI agents optimized on your enterprise data, and Lakebase, a new type of operational database (OLTP), built on open source Postgres, and optimized for AI Agents. The investment is also expected to support future AI acquisitions and deepen AI research.</p><p>“We’re seeing tremendous investor interest because of the momentum behind our AI products, which power the world's largest businesses and AI services,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “Every company can securely turn its enterprise data into AI apps and agents to grow revenue faster, operate more efficiently, and make smarter decisions with less risk. Databricks is benefiting from an unprecedented global demand for AI apps and agents, turning companies’ data into goldmines. We’re thrilled this round is already over-subscribed and to partner with strategic, long-term investors who share our vision for the future of AI.”</p><p>This new investment comes on the heels of strong momentum for Databricks. In the last two quarters, the company has launched or expanded partnerships with Microsoft, Google Cloud, Anthropic, SAP, and Palantir. More than 15,000 customers around the world use the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.databricks.com/product/data-intelligence-platform" tabindex="0" rel="noreferrer">Databricks Data Intelligence Platform</a> to democratize access to data and AI, making it easier to harness the power of their data for analytics and AI apps and agents. Built on an open source foundation, the platform enables organizations to drive innovation that increases revenue, lowers costs, and reduces risk.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Databricks</strong></p><p>Databricks is the Data and AI company. More than 15,000 organizations worldwide — including Block, Comcast, Condé Nast, Rivian, Shell and over 60% of the Fortune 500 — rely on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to take control of their data and put it to work with AI.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

						
						
						
						
						
						

						
						<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Between approximately 00:34 and 01:48 (Beijing Time, UTC+8) on August 20, 2025, the Great Firewall of China (GFW) exhibited anomalous behavior by unconditionally injecting forged TCP <code>RST+ACK</code> packets to disrupt all connections on TCP port 443. This incident caused massive disruption of the Internet connections between China and the rest of the world (<a href="https://t.me/DNSPODT/11175">source1</a> and <a href="https://t.me/zaihuapd/35214">source2</a>).</p>
<p>This report documents our measurements and analysis of this temporary, widespread blocking event. Our primary findings are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The unconditional <code>RST+ACK</code> injections was on TCP port 443, but not on other common ports like 22, 80, 8443.</li>
<li>The unconditional <code>RST+ACK</code> injection disrupted connections both to and from China, but the trigger mechanism was asymmetrical. For traffic originating from inside China, the <code>SYN</code> packet from the client and the <code>SYN+ACK</code> packet could each trigger three injected <code>RST+ACK</code> packets. For traffic to inside China, only the server’s <code>SYN+ACK</code> response, not the client’s <code>SYN</code> packet, could trigger the <code>RST+ACK</code> packets.</li>
<li>The responsible device does not match the fingerprints of any known GFW devices, suggesting that <strong>the incident was caused by either a new GFW device or a known device operating in a novel or misconfigured state</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that our analysis was limited by the short duration of the incident (approximately 74 minutes). We encourage others in the community to share their observations to build a more complete picture of this event.</p>
<h2 id="2-triggering-the-blocking">2. Triggering the blocking</h2>
<p>We first confirmed the blocking by sending probes from a vantage points inside of China (AS45090, Tencent Cloud, Beijing), and from multiple vantage points outside of China.</p>

<p>And the <code>SYN+ACK</code> packet sent by the server also triggered three <code>RST+ACK</code> packets, each with a relative sequence number <code>1</code>, as well as incremental TCP window sizes of <code>3293</code>, <code>3294</code>, and <code>3295</code>.</p>

Indeed, we couldn’t trigger the blocking when the sending <code>SYN</code> packets to a Chinese IP address within the same <code>/24</code> subnet as <code>$CN_IP</code> which didn’t have an open port (and thus did not send any <code>SYN+ACK</code> packet back to the client.)</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="3-attribution-and-device-fingerprinting">3. Attribution and Device Fingerprinting</h2>
<p>The Great Firewall of China (GFW) is not a single entity but a complex system composed of various network devices that perform censorship. Previous research has established that different components, such as those responsible for HTTP Host-based and TLS SNI-based filtering, exhibit unique packet-level fingerprints when injecting TCP RST packets. The goal of this analysis was to identify which specific GFW component was responsible for the anomalous behavior observed during the incident.</p>
<p>To fingerprint the responsible device, after the incident had concluded, we sent probes from the vantage point in China to the IP address that triggered the unconditional RSTs. We used the same destination IP address so that our probe packets would be more likely to traverse the same network path and interact with the same set of censorship middleboxes, allowing for a consistent fingerprint analysis.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the probe results revealed that <strong>no captured packet fingerprint exactly matched the characteristics observed during the incident—specifically</strong>.</p>
<p>Since the unconditionally injection contain three RST+ACK packets with the IP Flag <code>DF</code> (<code>Don't Fragment</code>) on, they are similar, but not identical, to <code>MB-1</code> identified by Niere et al. (see <a href="https://censorbib.nymity.ch/pdf/Niere2025a.pdf#page=8">Figure 4</a>); and they are also similar to, but not identical to, <code>GFW (II)</code> identified by Wu et al. (see <a href="https://gfw.report/publications/sp25/en/#tbl:4-injection-behaviors-packet-fingerprints">Table 4</a>).</p>
<p>However, a key difference exists: the known middlebox injector sends three <strong>identical</strong> TCP <code>RST+ACK</code> packets. In contrast, the packets observed during this incident contained fields that were clearly incremental, not identical. This discrepancy suggests that <strong>the incident was caused by either a previously uncatalogued GFW device or a known device operating in a novel or misconfigured state.</strong></p>

<p>The unconditional RST+ACK packets comes in three packets, with an incrementally increasing IP TTL and an incrementally increasing TCP window size. We limited data, we were not able to identify the IP ID of it.</p>

  <p>The state of CI platforms is much stronger than it was just a few years ago.
Overall, this is a good thing: access to powerful CI platforms enables
software developers and companies to ship more reliable software more
frequently, which benefits its users/customers. Centralized CI platforms
like GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, and Bitbucket provide benefits of
scale, as the Internet serves as a collective information repository for
how to use them. Do a search for <em>how to do X on CI platform Y</em> and
you'll typically find some code you can copy and paste. Nobody wants to
toil with wrangling their CI configuration after all: they just want
to ship.</p>
<h2>Modern CI Systems are Too Complex</h2>
<p>The advancements in CI platforms have come at a cost: increased complexity.
And the more I think about it, <strong>I'm coming around to the belief that
modern CI systems are too complex</strong>. Let me explain.</p>
<p>At its core, a CI platform is a specialized <em>remote code execution as a
service</em> (it's a feature, not a CVE!) where the code being executed is
in pursuit of building, testing, and shipping software (unless you
<a href="https://dev.to/thibaultduponchelle/the-github-action-mining-attack-through-pull-request-2lmc">abuse it to mine cryptocurrency</a>).
So, CI platforms typically throw in a bunch of value-add features to enable
you to ship software more easily. There are vastly different approaches and
business models here. (I must tip my hat to GitHub Actions leveraging network
effects via community maintained <em>actions</em>: this lowers TCO for GitHub as they
don't need to maintain many <em>actions</em>, creates vendor lock-in as users develop
a dependence on platform-proprietary <em>actions</em>, all while increasing the
value of the platform for end-users - a rare product trifecta.) A common
value-add property of CI platforms is some kind of configuration file
(often YAML) which itself offers common functionality, such as configuring
the version control checkout and specifying what commands to run. This is
where we start to get into problems.</p>
<p>(I'm going to focus on GitHub Actions here, not because they are the worst
(far from it), but because they seem to be the most popular and readers can
relate more easily. But my commentary applies to other platforms like GitLab
as well.)</p>
<p>The YAML configuration of modern CI platforms is... powerful. Here are features
present in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions">GitHub Actions workflow YAML</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An embedded templating system that results in the source YAML being
  expanded into a final YAML document that is actually evaluated. This
  includes a custom <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions">expression mini language</a>.</li>
<li>Triggers for when to run jobs.</li>
<li>Named variables.</li>
<li>Conditional job execution.</li>
<li>Dependencies between jobs.</li>
<li>Defining Docker-based run-time environment.</li>
<li>Encrypted secrets.</li>
<li>Steps constituting each job and what actions those steps should take.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we expand scope slightly to include actions maintained by GitHub, we also have
steps/actions features for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing Git checkouts.</li>
<li>Storing artifacts used by workflows/jobs.</li>
<li>Caching artifacts used by workflows/jobs.</li>
<li>Installing common programming languages and environments (like Java, Node.js,
  Python, and Ruby).</li>
<li>And a whole lot more.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then of course there are 3rd party Actions. And there's a lot of them!</p>
<p>There's a lot of functionality here and a lot of it is arguably necessary:
I'm hard pressed to name a feature to cut. (Although I'm no fan of using YAML
as a programming language but I concede it use is a fair compromise compared
to forcing people to write code to produce YAML or make equivalent API calls
to do what the YAML would do.) All these features seem necessary for a
sufficiently powerful CI offering. Nobody would use your offering if it didn't
offer turnkey functionality after all.</p>
<p>So what's my complaint?</p>
<p>I posit that <strong>a sufficiently complex CI system becomes indistinguishable from
a build system</strong>. I challenge you: try to convince me or yourself that GitHub
Actions, GitLab CI, and other CI systems aren't build systems. The basic
primitives are all there. GitHub Actions Workflows comprised of jobs comprised
of steps are little different from say Makefiles comprised of rules comprised
of commands to execute for that rule, with dependencies gluing everything
together. The main difference is the <em>form factor</em> and the execution model (build
systems are traditionally local and single machine but CI systems are
remote/distributed).</p>
<p>Then we have a similar conjecture: <strong>a sufficiently complex build system becomes
indistinguishable from a CI system</strong>. Earlier I said that CI systems are
<em>remote code execution as a service</em>. While build systems are historically
things that run locally (and therefore not a <em>service</em>), modern build systems
like Bazel (or Buck or Gradle) are completely different animals. For example,
Bazel has
<a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-execution.html">remote execution</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">remote caching</a> as
built-in features. Hey - those are built-in features of modern CI systems too!
<strong>So here's a thought experiment: if I define a build system in Bazel and then
define a server-side Git push hook so the remote server triggers Bazel to build,
run tests, and post the results somewhere, is that a CI system? I think it is!</strong>
A crude one. But I think that qualifies as a CI system.</p>
<p><strong>If you squint hard enough, sufficiently complex CI systems and sufficiently
complex build systems start to look like the same thing to me.</strong> At a very high
level, both are providing a pool of servers offering general compute/execute
functionality with specialized features in the domain of building/shipping software,
like inter-task artifact exchange, caching, dependencies, and a frontend language
to define how everything works.</p>
<p>(If you squint really hard you can start to see a value proposition of Kubernetes
for even more general compute scheduling, but I'm not going to go that far in this
post because it is a much harder point to make and I don't necessarily believe in
it myself. But I thought I'd mention it as an interesting thought experiment. But
an easier leap to make is to throw batch job execution (as is often found in data
warehouses) in with build and CI systems as belonging in the same bucket: batch
job execution also tends to have dependencies, exchange of artifacts between jobs,
and I think can strongly resemble a CI system and therefore a build system.)</p>
<p><strong>The thing that bugs me about modern CI systems is that I inevitably feel like
I'm reinventing a build system and fragmenting build system logic.</strong> Your CI
configuration inevitably devolves into a bunch of complex YAML with all kinds of
caching and dependency optimizations to keep execution time low and reliability
in check - just like your build system. You find yourself contorting your
project's build system to work in the context of CI and vice versa. You end up
managing two complex DAGs and platforms/systems instead of one.</p>
<p><strong>Because build systems are more generic than CI systems (I think a sufficiently
advanced build system can do a superset of the things that a sufficiently complex
CI system can do), that means that CI systems are redundant with sufficiently
advanced build systems. So going beyond the section title: CI systems aren't
too complex: they shouldn't need to exist. Your CI functionality should be an
extension of the build system.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the redundancy argument, I think unified systems are more
user friendly. By integrating your CI system into your build system
(which by definition can be driven locally as part of regular development
workflows), you can expose the full power of the CI system to developers
more easily. Think running ad-hoc CI jobs without having to push your changes
to a remote server first, just like you can with <em>local</em> builds or tests. This
is huge for ergonomics and can drastically compress the cycle time for changes
to these systems (which are often brittle to change/test).</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, aspects of CI systems not traditionally found in build
systems (such as centralized results reporting and a UI/API for (re)triggering
jobs) absolutely need to exist. Instead, it is the remote compute and work
definition aspects that are completely redundant with build systems.</p>
<p>Let's explore the implications of build and CI systems being more of the
same.</p>
<h2>Modern CI Offerings are Targeting the Wrong Abstraction</h2>
<p>If you assume that build and CI systems can be / are more of the same, then it
follows that many modern CI offerings like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and
others are targeting the wrong abstraction: they are defined as domain
specific platforms for running CI systems when instead they should take a step
back and target the broader general compute platform that is also needed for
build systems (and maybe batch job execution, such as what's commonly found
in data warehouses/pipelines).</p>
<p>Every CI offering is somewhere different on the spectrum here. I would
go so far as to argue that GitHub Actions is more a <em>CI product</em> than a
<em>platform</em>. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In my ideal <em>CI platform</em>, I have the ability to schedule an ad-hoc graph of
tasks against that platform. I have the ability to hit some APIs with definitions
of the tasks I want that platform to run and it accepts them, executes them,
uploads artifacts somewhere, reports task results so dependent tasks can execute,
etc.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions">GitHub Actions API</a>
that allows you to interact with the service. But the critical feature it
doesn't let me do is define ad-hoc units of work: the actual <em>remote execute
as a service</em>. Rather, the only way to define units of work is via workflow YAML
files checked into your repository. That's so constraining!</p>
<p>GitLab Pipelines is a lot better. GitLab Pipelines supports features like
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/parent_child_pipelines.html">parent-child pipelines</a>
(dependencies between different pipelines),
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/multi_project_pipelines.html">multi-project pipelines</a>
(dependencies between different projects/repos), and
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/parent_child_pipelines.html#dynamic-child-pipelines">dynamic child pipelines</a>
(generate YAML files in pipeline job that defines a new pipeline). (I don't
believe GitHub Actions supports any of these features.) Dynamic child
pipelines are an important feature, as they mostly divorce the checked-in YAML
configuration from the <em>remote execute as a service</em> feature. The main missing
feature here is a generic API that allows you achieve this functionality without
having to go through a parent pipeline / YAML first. If that API existed, you
could build your own build/CI/batch execute system on top of GitLab Pipelines
with fewer constraints imposed on you by GitLab Pipeline's opinionated YAML
configuration files and the intended use of its creators. (Generally, I think
a good litmus test for a well-designed platform or tool is when its authors
are surprised by someone's unintended use for it. Of course this knife cuts
both ways, as sometimes people do undesirable things, like mine
cryptocurrency.)</p>
<p><strong>CI offerings like GitHub Actions and GitLab Pipelines are more products
than platforms because they tightly couple an opinionated configuration
mechanism (YAML files) and web UI (and corresponding APIs) on top of a
theoretically generic <em>remote execute as a service</em> offering.</strong> For me to
consider these offerings as platforms, they need to grow the ability to
schedule arbitrary compute via an API, without being constrained by the
YAML officially supported out of the box. GitLab is <em>almost</em> there (the
critical missing link is a <em>schedule an inline-defined pipeline</em> API). It
is unknown if GitHub is - or is even interested in - pursuing this
direction. (More on this later.)</p>
<h2>Taskcluster: The Most Powerful CI Platform You've Never Heard Of</h2>
<p>I wanted to just mention Taskcluster in passing as a counterexample to the
CI offerings that GitHub, GitLab, and others are pursuing. But I found myself
heaping praises towards it, so you get a full section on Taskcluster. This
content isn't critical to the overall post, so feel free to skip. But if
you want to know what a CI platform built for engineers looks like or you
are a developer of CI platforms and would like to read about some worthwhile
ideas to steal, keep reading.</p>
<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs">Taskcluster</a> is a generic CI
platform originally built for Firefox. At the time it was conceived and
initially built out in 2014-2015, there was nothing else quite like it.
And I'm still not aware of anything that can match its raw capabilities.
There might be something proprietary behind corporate walls. But nothing
close to it in the open source domain. And even the proprietary CI platforms
I'm aware of often fall short of Taskcluster's feature list.</p>
<p><strong>To my knowledge, Taskcluster is the only publicly available, mega
project scale, true <em>CI platform</em> in existence.</strong></p>
<p>Germane to this post, one thing I love about Taskcluster is its core
primitives around defining execution units. The core execute primitive in
Taskcluster is a <a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/tasks">task</a>.
Tasks are connected together to form a DAG. (This is not unlike how a
build system works.)</p>
<p>A <em>task</em> is created by issuing an API request to a <em>queue service</em>. That
API request essentially says <em>schedule this unit of work</em>.</p>
<p>Tasks are
<a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/platform/queue/task-schema">defined</a>
somewhat generically, essentially as units of arbitrary compute along with metadata,
such as task dependencies, permissions/scopes that task has, etc. That
<a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/payload">unit of work</a>
has many of the primitives that are familiar to you if you use GitHub Actions,
GitLab Pipelines, etc: a list of commands to execute, which Docker image to
execute in, paths to files constituting artifacts, retry settings, etc.</p>
<p>Taskcluster has features far beyond what are offered by GitHub, GitLab, and
others today.</p>
<p>For example, Taskcluster offers an IAM-like
<a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/tasks/scopes">scopes</a> feature that
moderates access control. Scopes control what actions you can perform, what
services you have access to, which runner features you can use (e.g. whether
you can use ptrace), which secrets you have access to, and more. As a concrete
example, Firefox's Taskcluster settings are such that the cryptographic
keys/secrets used to sign Firefox builds are inaccessible to untrusted tasks
(like the equivalent of tasks initiated by PRs - the <em>Try Server</em> in Mozilla
speak). Taskcluster is the only CI platform I'm aware of that has sufficient
protections in place to mitigate the fact that CI platforms are gaping <em>remote
code execution as a service</em> risks that can and should keep your internal
security and risk teams up at night. Taskcluster's security model makes
GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, and other commonly used CI services look
like data exfiltration and software supply chain vulnerability factories by
comparison.</p>
<p>Taskcluster does support
<a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/integrations/github/taskcluster-yml-v1">adding a YAML file to your repository to define tasks</a>.
However, because there's a generic scheduling API, you don't need to use it and
you aren't constrained by its features. You could roll your own
configuration/frontend for defining tasks: Taskcluster doesn't care because it is
a true <em>platform</em>. In fact, Firefox mostly eschews this Taskcluster YAML, instead
building out its own functionality for defining tasks. There's a pile of code
checked into the Firefox repository that when run will derive the thousands of
discrete tasks constituting Firefox's build and release DAG and will register the
appropriate sub-graph as Taskcluster tasks. (This also happens to be a
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/taskcluster/ci">pile of YAML</a>.
But the programming primitives and control flow are largely absent from YAML files,
making it a bit cleaner than the <em>YAML DSL</em> that e.g. GitHub and GitLab CI
YAML has evolved into.) This functionality is its own mini build system where
the Taskcluster platform is the execution/evaluation mechanism.</p>
<p>Taskcluster's model and capabilities are vastly beyond anything in GitHub
Actions or GitLab Pipelines today. There's a lot of great ideas worth copying.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Taskcluster is very much a power user CI offering. There's no
centralized instance that anyone can use (unlike GitHub or GitLab). The learning
curve is quite steep. All that power comes at a cost of complexity. I can't in
good faith recommend Taskcluster to casual users. But if you want to host your
own CI platform, other CI offerings don't quite cut it for you, and you can
afford a few people to support your CI platform on an ongoing basis (i.e. your
total cost to operate CI including people and machines is &gt;$1M annually), then
Taskcluster is worth considering.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the post at hand.</p>
<h2>Looking to the Future</h2>
<p>In my ideal world there exists a single <em>remote code execution as a service</em>
platform purpose built for servicing both near real time and batch/delayed
execution. It is probably tailored towards supporting software development,
as those domain specific features set it apart from generic compute as a
service tools like Kubernetes, Lambda, and others. But something more
generic could potentially work.</p>
<p>The concept of a DAG is strongly baked into the execution model so you can
define execution units as a graph, capturing dependencies. Sure, you could
define isolated, ad-hoc units of work. But if you wanted to define a set
of units, you could do that without having to run a persistent agent to
coordinate execution through completion like build systems typically do.
(Think of this as <em>uploading your DAG to an execution service</em>.)</p>
<p>In my ideal world, there is a single DAG dictating all build, testing, and
release tasks. There is no DAG fragmentation at the build, CI, and other
batch execute boundaries. No N+1 system or configuration to manage and
additional platform to maintain because everything is unified. Economies
of scale applies and overall efficiency improves through consolidation.</p>
<p>The platform consists of pools of workers running agents capable of
performing work. There are probably pools for near real time / synchronous
RPC style invocations and pools for scheduled / delayed / asynchronous
execution. You can define your own worker pools and bring your own workers.
Advanced customers will likely throw autoscaling groups consisting of
highly ephemeral workers (such as EC2 spot instances) at these pools,
scaling capacity to meet demand relatively cheaply, terminating workers
and machines when capacity is no longer needed to save on billing
costs (this is what Firefox's Taskcluster instance has been doing for at
least 6 years).</p>
<p>To end-users, a <em>local build</em> consists of driving or scheduling the subset
of the complete task graph necessary to produce the build artifacts you
need. A <em>CI build/test</em> consists of the subset of the task graph necessary
to achieve that (it is probably a superset of the <em>local build</em> graph). Same
for releasing.</p>
<p>As for the configuration frontend and how execution units are defined, this
platform only needs to provide a single thing: an API that can be used to
schedule/execute work. However, for this product offering to be user-friendly,
it should offer something like YAML configuration files like CI systems do
today. That's fine: many (most?) users will stick to using the simplified
YAML interface. Just as long as power users have an escape/scaling vector
and can use the low-level schedule/execute API to write their own driver.
People will write plug-ins for their build systems enabling it to integrate
with this platform. Someone will coerce existing extensible build systems
like Bazel, Buck, and Gradle to convert nodes in the build graph to
compute tasks in this platform. This unlocks the unification of the build
and CI systems (and maybe things like data pipelines too).</p>
<p>Finally, because we're talking about a specialized system tailored for
software development, we need robust result/reporting APIs and interfaces.
What good is all this fancy distributed remote compute if nobody can see
what it is doing? This is probably the most specialized service of the bunch,
as how you track results is exceptionally domain specific. Power users may
want to build their own result tracking service, so keep that in mind. But
the platform should provide a generic one (like what GitHub Actions and GitLab
Pipelines do today) because it is a massive value add and few will use
your product without such a feature.</p>
<p>Quickly, my proposed unified world will not alleviate the CI complexity concerns
raised above: sufficiently large build/CI systems will always have an intrinsic
complexity to them and possibly require specialists to maintain. However,
because a complex CI system is almost always attached to a complex build system,
by consolidating build and CI systems, you reduce the surface area of complexity
(you don't have to worry about build/CI interop as much). Lower fragmentation
reduces overall complexity, and is therefore a new win. (A similar line of
thinking applies to justifying monorepositories.)</p>
<p><strong>All of the components for my vision exist in some working form today.</strong>
Bazel, Gradle Enterprise, and other modern build systems have RPCs for
remote execute and/or caching. They are even extensible and you can write
your own plugins to change core functionality for how the build system runs
(to varying degrees of course). CI offerings like Taskcluster and GitLab
Pipelines support scheduling DAGs of tasks (with Taskcluster's support far
more suited for the desired end state). There are batch job execution
frameworks like Airflow that look an awful lot like a domain-specific,
specialized versions of Taskcluster. <strong>What we don't have a is a single
product or service with all these features bundled as a cohesive offering.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm convinced that building what I'd like to see is not a question of
<em>if it can be done</em> but <em>whether we should</em> and <em>who will do it</em>.</strong></p>
<p>And this is where we probably run into problems. I hate to say it, but
I'm skeptical this will exist as a widely available service outside a few
corporations' walls any time soon. The reason is the total addressable market.</p>
<p>The value of my vision is through unification of discrete systems (build,
CI, and maybe some one-offs like data pipelines) that are themselves
complex enough that unification is something you'd want to do for
business/efficiency reasons. After all, if it isn't complex/inefficient,
you probably don't care about making it simpler/faster. Right here we
are probably filtering out &gt;90% of the market because their systems
just aren't complex enough for this to matter.</p>
<p>This vision requires adoption of a sufficiently advanced build system so it
can serve as the brains behind a unified DAG driving remote execute. Some
companies and projects will adopt compatible, advanced build systems like Bazel
because they have the resources, technical know-how, and efficiency incentives
to pull it off. But many won't. The benefit of a more advanced build system
over something simpler is often marginal. Factor in that many companies perceive
build and CI support as product development overhead and a virtual cost center
whose line item needs to be minimized. If you can get by on a less advanced
build system that is <em>good enough</em> for a fraction of the cost without excessive
hardship, that's the path many companies and projects will follow. Again,
people and companies generally don't care about wrangling build and CI
systems: they just want to ship.</p>
<p>The total addressable market for this idea seems too small for me to see
any major player with the technical know-how to implement and offer such
a service in the next few years. After all, we're not even over the hurdle
that what I propose (unifying build and CI systems) is a good idea. Having
worked in this space for a decade, witnessed the potential of Taskcluster's
model, and seen former, present, and potential employers all struggling in
this space to varying degrees, I know that this idea would be extremely
valuable to some. (For some companies multiple millions of dollars could be
saved annually by eliminating redundant human capital maintaining similar
systems, reducing machine idle/run costs, and improving turnaround times of
critical development loops.) As important as this would be to some companies,
my intuition is they represent such a small sliver of the total addressable
market that this slice of pie is too small for an existing CI operator like
GitHub or GitLab to care about at this time. There are far more lucrative
opportunities. (Such as security scanning, as laws/regulation/litigation are
finally catching up to the software industry and forcing companies to take
security and privacy more seriously, which translates to spending money on
security services. This is why GitHub and GitLab have been stumbling over
each other to announce new security features over the past 1-2 years.)</p>
<p>I don't think a startup in this area would be a good idea: customer acquisition
is too hard. And because much of the core tech already exists in existing tools,
there's not much of a moat in the way of proprietary IP to keep copycats
with deep pockets at bay. Your best exit here is likely an early acquisition
by a Microsoft/GitHub, GitLab, or wannabe player in this space like Amazon/AWS.</p>
<p>Rather, I think our best hope for seeing this vision realized is an operator
of an existing major CI platform (either private or public) who also has major
build system or other ad-hoc batch execute challenges will implement it and
release it upon the world, either as open source or as a service offering.
GitHub, GitLab, and other code hosting providers are the ideal candidates since
their community effect could help drive industry adoption. But I'd happily
accept pretty much any high quality offering from a reputable company!</p>
<p>I'm not sure when, but my money is on GitHub/Microsoft executing on this vision
first. They have a stronger incentive in the form of broader market/product
tie-ins (think integrated build and CI in Visual Studio or GitHub Workspaces
[for Enterprises]). Furthermore, they'll feel the call from within. Microsoft
has some really massive build systems and CI challenges (notably Windows). It
is clear that elements of Microsoft are conducting development on GitHub, in
the open even (at this point Satya Nadella's Microsoft has frozen over so many
levels of hell that Dante's classics need new revisions). Microsoft engineers
will feel the pain and limitations of discrete build and CI systems. Eventually
there will be calls for at least a build system remote execute service/offering
on GitHub. (This would naturally fall under GitHub's existing apparent market
strategy of capturing more and more of the software development lifecycle.) My
hope is GitHub (or whomever) will implement this as a unified
platform/service/product rather than discrete services because as I've argued
they are practically the same problem. But a unified offering isn't the path of
least resistance, so who knows what will happen.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I could snap my fingers and move industry's discrete build, CI, and
maybe batch execute (e.g. data pipelines) ahead 10 years, I would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take Mozilla's Taskcluster and its best-in-class specialized <em>remote execute
  as a service</em> platform.</li>
<li>Add support for a real-time, synchronous execute API (like Bazel's remote
   execute API) to supplement the existing batch/asynchronous functionality.</li>
<li>Define Starlark dialects so you define CI/release like primitives in build
   tools like Bazel. (You could also do YAML here. But if your configuration
   files devolve into DSL, just use a real programming language already.)</li>
<li>Teach build tools like Bazel to work better when units of work that can
   take minutes or even hours to run (a synchronous/online driver model such
   as classically employed by build systems isn't appropriate for long-running
   test, release, or say data pipelines).</li>
<li>Throw a polished web UI for platform interaction, result reporting, etc on
   top.</li>
<li>Release it to the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Will this dream become a reality any time soon? Probably not. But I can dream.
And maybe I'll have convinced a reader to pursue it.</p>

  <section>
    
<p>Suppose that you are walking at night, and you see someone on your side of the street coming toward you, about to pass you. Is his face angry, or is he just thinking seriously about something?</p>
<p>Your answer to that question may well depend on the faces that you are used to seeing. If you tend to encounter a lot of very angry faces, your threshold for considering a face “angry” is probably high, and so you might well think: He’s thinking seriously about something. But if the faces you encounter are rarely angry, and if you see a lot of friendly people, you might think: He looks pretty angry to me.</p>
<p>The phenomenon I am describing has a name: “prevalence-induced concept change.” It has in fact been demonstrated for judgments about whether faces are angry. When people have seen a lot of very angry faces, they are less likely to perceive arguably angry faces as angry. Prevalence-induced concept change has also been found for ethical judgments: When people see a lot of clearly unethical behavior, they are less likely to characterize arguably unethical behavior as unethical. If, for example, you live in a nation in which corruption is open and rampant, you might not be much agitated when you learn that your neighbors cheat on their taxes.</p>
<p>Prevalence-induced concept change should be seen as a demonstration of the immense power of the normal. What people normally see, or see as normal, establishes the baseline against which they make judgments about both facts and values. That principle helps explain challenges to democracy as well. If a nation is experiencing a significant increase in corruption, or a major deterioration in practices of self-government, its citizens might not be much alarmed today about something that would have been horrifying five years previously.</p>
<p>Christine Webb, a primatologist at New York University, is focused on “the human superiority complex,” the idea that human beings are just better and more deserving than are members of other species, and on the extent to which human beings take themselves as the baseline against which all living creatures are measured. As Hamlet exclaimed: “What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason!… The paragon of animals!” In Webb’s view, human exceptionalism is all around us, and it damages science, the natural environment, democratic choices, and ordinary (human) life. People believe in human superiority even though we are hardly the biggest, the fastest, or the strongest. Eagles see a lot better than we do. Sea sponges live much longer. Dolphins are really good at echolocation; people are generally really bad at it. And yet we keep proclaiming how special we are. As Webb puts it, “Hamlet got one thing right: we’re a piece of work.”</p>
<p><span>W</span>ebb does illuminating academic work on chimpanzees, bonobos, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=-1ZmyYgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=-1ZmyYgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C">capuchin monkeys</a>, and elephants. She studies empathy and consolation in particular. Do chimpanzees, for example, console bereaved mothers? In her new book, <em>The Arrogant Ape</em>, Webb turns to large ethical questions. She gives pride of place to the concept of the “<em>umwelt</em>,” introduced in 1909 by the Estonian-German biologist Jakob von Uexküll, who used the word to capture the world as it is experienced by particular organisms. I have two Labrador Retrievers, Snow and Finley, and on most days, I take them for a walk on a local trail. Every time, it is immediately apparent that they are perceiving and sensing things that are imperceptible to me. They hear things that I don’t; they pause to smell things that I cannot. Their world is not my world. Webb offers a host of more vivid examples, and they seem miraculous, the stuff of science fiction.</p>
<p>For example, hummingbirds can see colors that human beings are not even able to imagine. Elephants have an astonishing sense of smell, which enables them to detect sources of water from miles away. Owls can hear the heartbeat of a mouse from a distance of 25 feet. Because of echolocation, dolphins perceive sound in three dimensions. They know what is on the inside of proximate objects; as they swim toward you, they might be able to sense your internal organs. Pronghorn antelopes can run a marathon in 40 minutes, and their vision is far better than ours. On a clear night, Webb notes, they might be able to see the rings of Saturn. We all know that there are five senses, but it’s more accurate to say that there are five <em>human</em> senses. Sharks can sense electric currents. Sea turtles can perceive the earth’s magnetic field, which helps them to navigate tremendous distances. Some snakes, like pythons, are able to sense thermal radiation. Scientists can give many more examples, and there’s much that they don’t yet know.</p>
<p>Webb marshals these and other findings to show that when we assess other animals, we use human beings as the baseline. Consider the question of self-awareness. Using visual tests, scientists find that human children can recognize themselves in a mirror by the age of three—and that almost no other species can do that. But does that really mean that human beings are uniquely capable of recognizing themselves? It turns out that dogs, who rely more on smell than sight, can indeed recognize themselves, if we test by reference to odor; they can distinguish between their own odor and that of other dogs. (Can you do that?) In this sense, dogs too show self-awareness. Webb argues that the human yardstick is pervasively used to assess the abilities of nonhuman animals. That is biased, she writes, “because each species fulfills a different cognitive niche. There are multiple intelligences!”</p>
<p>Webb contends that many of our tests of the abilities of nonhuman animals are skewed for another reason: We study them under highly artificial conditions, in which they are often miserable, stressed, and suffering. Try caging human beings and seeing how well they perform on cognitive tests. As she puts it, “A laboratory environment can rarely (if ever) adequately simulate the natural circumstances of wild animals in an ecologically meaningful way.” Suppose, for example, that we are investigating “prosociality”—the question of whether nonhuman animals will share food or cooperate with one another. In the laboratory, captive chimpanzees do not appear to do that. But in the wild, chimpanzees behave differently: They share meat and other food (including nuts and honey), and they also share tools. During hunting, chimpanzees are especially willing to cooperate. In natural environments, the differences between human beings and apes are not nearly so stark. Nor is the point limited to apes. Cows, pigs, goats, and even salmon are a lot smarter and happier in the wild than in captive environments.</p>
<p>Webb now limits her own research to sanctuaries and the wild. She is especially focused on animal emotions. As I have noted, one of her central academic interests is whether chimpanzees console one another after the death of a loved one or after conflicts. Consolation is, of course, an indicator of empathy. In one case, Webb found that after an adult chimpanzee gave birth to a stillborn infant, group members followed her closely, groomed her, and hugged her. “They were attempting to reassure her,” Webb writes, “providing the first clear evidence that other animals console bereaved group members.” Return to the idea of the <em>umwelt</em>: Webb believes that we underestimate the emotional and cognitive experience of other species, including those to which we are not closely related, such as birds and crustaceans. Evolution often finds diverse ways to achieve the same ends. Other species might not have exactly the same abilities that we do, but with the abilities they do have, they might be able to do what we do anyway. For example, crustaceans do not have a visual cortex, but they are nonetheless able to see. Why, Webb asks, should we make human beings the measure of all things?</p>
<p><span>I</span>t would be possible to read Webb as demonstrating that nonhuman animals are a lot more like us than we think. But that is not at all her intention. On the contrary, she rejects the argument, identified and also rejected by the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, that the nonhumans animals who are most like us deserve the most protection, what Nussbaum calls the “so like us” approach. (This is also part of the title of an old documentary about Jane Goodall’s work.) Webb sees that argument as a well-meaning but objectionable form of human exceptionalism. Why should it matter that they are like us? Why is that necessary? With Nussbaum, Webb insists that species are “wonderfully different,” and that it is wrong to try to line them up along a unitary scale and to ask how they rank. Use of the human yardstick, embodied in the claim of “so like us,” is a form of blindness that prevents us from seeing the sheer variety of life’s capacities, including cognitive ones. As Nussbaum writes, “Anthropocentrism is a phony sort of arrogance.”</p>
<p>Webb is especially concerned that the commitment to human exceptionalism tends to be invisible; it is an unspoken assumption, a kind of given. Most broadly, she argues for a sense of awe. Awe “seems to keep egotism in check, prompting a reduction in self-focus and making personal concerns and goals appear less significant.” Awe leads in turn to humility, which, she thinks, is an “unsung virtue” that we ought to apply “to how we relate to the rest of the living world.” She thinks that experiencing humility leads to better science and better lives. That is one reason why she likes the idea of “hope,” which she opposes to “optimism.” Optimism is probabilistic; it suggests that with some probability, things will turn out well. Hope, by contrast, “centers on potential and uncertainty,” and it “is more aligned with humility.”</p>
<p>Webb’s vivid and moving book can be read in two different ways. You can read it as a linked set of striking and even dazzling scientific findings about the capacities of nonhuman animals—how they think, what (and how much) they feel, and what they are able to do. The findings are inspiring and potentially life-changing. After reading Webb’s book, it is hard to think of nonhuman animals in the same way. You might love dogs (I certainly do), but if you attend to what Webb has to say, you will appreciate them more and differently, and perhaps show them greater respect. And if you are inclined to evaluate nonhuman animals by reference to the capacities of human beings, Webb will get you to rethink. She demonstrates that if science insists on using the human <em>umwelt</em>, it will deprive itself of a world of knowledge—and that if ordinary people do that, they will have a blinkered understanding of other living beings. It’s as if Webb takes a black-and-white world and reveals that it’s full of colors.</p>
<p>Webb’s book is also a distinctive moral argument for protecting the well-being of nonhuman animals, informed by but not reducible to scientific findings. To get hold of the distinctiveness of that argument, consider what is probably the most famous passage ever written on the topic of animal rights, by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, founder of utilitarianism:</p>
<p>The day <em>may </em>come, when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny.… [A] full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?</p>
<p>Webb’s book makes that passage seem not at all wrong, but inadequate, thin, and a bit obtuse. To be sure, she enthusiastically agrees that suffering matters, and she offers a great deal of evidence that nonhuman animals can indeed suffer. But when Bentham says that suffering is “the question,” what does he mean, exactly? Why is that the question? In his own way, Bentham (and some though not all of his utilitarian followers) can be taken to be using human beings as the yardstick, with the important notation that with respect to the capacity to suffer, human beings are not exceptional at all. On that count, nonhuman animals are indeed so like us. Webb’s response is essentially this: “The question is not, Can they reason? Nor, can they talk? Nor, can they suffer? Nor, are they similar to us? But, what are they capable of?”</p>
<p>That is a more open-ended question. It is humbler. It does not load any dice. It is also a kind of doorway to a host of further questions. If we ask what nonhuman animals are capable of, we should certainly seek to reduce suffering; but we might also want to promote, and certainly not damage or stifle, a range of other capabilities on their part. After all, a good life for people includes much more than an absence of pain. If a powerful species put in control of our planet focused only on reducing our suffering, we would not think that they understood us at all. You can read Webb as endorsing the capabilities approach that Nussbaum elaborated in her <em>Justice for Animals</em>; Webb doesn’t do so explicitly, but her argument is certainly compatible with that approach. What makes Webb’s account novel and fresh is the sheer wealth of detail that she offers about the capabilities of nonhuman animals, and her use of that detail to support her plea for humility and awe.</p>
<p>Webb is a scientist who thinks that human exceptionalism is unscientific, but she is also a reformer who thinks that human exceptionalism is wrong. She claims that it “is at the root of the ecological crisis.” In her account, scientific experimentation on nonhuman animals is often cruel, and because laboratory conditions are so artificial, its findings are often bogus. She does not think that gorillas, chimpanzees, dogs, and rats should be seen as objects for human use. (If you are deciding whether to become a vegetarian, Webb might make that decision seem really easy.) She also urges that human exceptionalism is not good for people; it is “backfiring on us today, spurring forest fires, sea level rise, mass extinctions, and pandemics like the coronavirus.” In her view, human exceptionalism is a literally dangerous way of seeing things, a product of “brainwashing” that can be found wherever you look.</p>
<p>Webb’s claims about the concrete consequences of human exceptionalism may or may not be right; the causal chains are not simple here. Nor is her remarkable book a policy manual; it operates at a higher level of abstraction than that. But her ultimate goal for arrogant apes, including scientists, is resonant. It is nothing less than a re-enchantment of the world.</p>

 <div>
 		<p>I’ve been a member of Hacker News (HN) since 2012. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mooreds">You can see my profile here</a>. (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbeard/">Jeff Beard</a> for introducing me to it so many years ago.)</p>
<p>I currently hover around the upper 30s on the top 100 leader list. <a href="https://redmonk.com/videos/a-redmonk-conversation-engaging-with-developers-on-hacker-news-with-dan-moore/">I’ve talked about that community with the good folks at RedMonk</a>. After submitting thousands of stories, including over 400 with more than 100 points, here are outcomes I expect from a high ranking HN post.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic</strong></p>
<p>The first is the traffic. It’s not uncommon to get thousands of visits from an HN post that hangs out on the front page. Make sure <a href="https://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/2565">you have a CDN at the ready</a>. It is, however, unlikely to convert.</p>
<p>Whether you want people to buy, download, or even sign up for a newsletter, HN traffic isn’t much help. It’s low conversion, brand awareness traffic.</p>
<p>That may be what you need–just standing out among the crowd is tough these days. But don’t think you’ll trend on HN and get a ton of sign ups.</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The second valuable result is the comments. DO NOT SLEEP on these.</p>
<p>You have the attention of a large number of smart people who don’t know you, but are taking the time to share their thoughts. They are giving you precious feedback. Do not ignore it, explain it away, or get hurt by it.</p>
<p>Instead, try to understand why they are commenting the way they are. Engage and ask questions that show you have thought about their comment. The best time to do this is right after they make a comment, but even a day later you’ll get some replies.</p>
<p>You don’t have to slavishly make changes based on comments–I’m not even sure that is possible, given that they will conflict. But you should consider them the same way that you would if someone sent you an email.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-on Traffic</strong></p>
<p>After having a post trend on HN, I’ve seen follow-on smaller bumps in traffic in the weeks after. This comes from someone discovering your post on HN and sharing it. This could be from a newsletter, a FaceBook group, a follow-on blog post, or via another social network. I don’t know if this traffic converts better, but it again adds to the brand awareness of your company or product.</p>
<p>If you can figure out where these came from, either via referrer headers or a Google alert (if the referring site is public) it is also great to reach out to these sources of traffic with other content or advertising.</p>
<p>Since they self-selected and were interested in sharing your post initially, they will likely want to share other things you’ve written.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong></p>
<p>If you shared a post from someone else, which you should do for the vast majority of your HN posts (~90%), and it hits the front page, you may get a note of thanks. I’ve had both strangers and friends reach out with a quick ‘thank you’ when something I posted from them gets traction. This only works if you have contact info on your profile or they have some other way of getting in touch with you.</p>
<p>There are also results which you should not expect from a high ranking post.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Outcomes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reifyworks.com/writing/2017-03-13-hacker-news-doesnt-pay-the-bills">HN is not a marketing plan</a>. While writing content for HN can be helpful if your target buyer or buyer influencer hangs out there, it won’t lead directly to conversions. It is a piece of the top of the funnel efforts you have, not the totality.</li>
<li>Broad market feedback. Not everyone is on HN. Not every developer is on HN. Not even every developer in SF is on HN. Plan accordingly.</li>
<li>Reliable traffic. HN is very fickle. I’ve had more than one story that I posted fizzle, while the same story posted by someone else one to three days later sails to the front page.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><main><header></header><section><p><span>Published on <!-- -->19.08.2025</span><span>8<!-- --> min read</span></p></section><section><article><p>Like most tech companies, Microsoft is going all-in on AI. Their flagship AI product, Copilot (in all its various forms), allows people to utilize AI in their daily work to interact with Microsoft services and generally perform tasks. Unfortunately, this also creates a wide range of new security problems.</p><p>On July 4th, I came across a problem in M365 Copilot: Sometimes it would access a file and return the information, but the audit log would not reflect that. Upon testing further, I discovered that I could simply ask Copilot to behave in that manner, and it would. That made it possible to access a file without leaving a trace. Given the problems that creates, both for security and legal compliance, I immediately reported it to Microsoft through their MSRC portal.</p><p>Helpfully, Microsoft provides <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/what-to-expect-when-reporting-vulnerabilities-to-microsoft/">a clear guide on what to expect</a> when reporting vulnerabilities to them. Less helpfully, they didn’t follow that guide at all. The entire process has been a mess. And while they did fix the issue, classifying this issue as an ‘important’ vulnerability, they also decided not to notify customers or publicize that this happened. What that means is that your audit log is wrong, and Microsoft doesn’t plan on telling you that.</p><p>This post is split into three parts. The first part explains the Copilot vulnerability and the problems it can cause. The second part outlines how Microsoft handled the case. And the third part discusses Microsoft’s decision not to publish this information, and why I consider that to be a huge disservice to Microsoft’s customers.</p><h2 id="the-vulnerability-copilot-and-audit-logging">The Vulnerability: Copilot and Audit Logging</h2><p>The vulnerability here is extremely simple. Normally, if you ask M365 Copilot to summarize a file for you, it will give you a summary and the audit log will show that Copilot accessed that file on your behalf.<a id="note-1" href="https://pistachioapp.com/blog/copilot-broke-your-audit-log#footnote-1" data-discover="true">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a></p><p><img src="https://pistachioapp.com/bucket/images/website/blog/posts/copilot-broke-your-audit-log/expected-behavior-request.png" alt="Expected behavior request"></p><p><img src="https://pistachioapp.com/bucket/images/website/blog/posts/copilot-broke-your-audit-log/expected-behavior-log.png" alt="Expected behavior log"></p><p>That’s good. Audit logs are important. Imagine someone downloaded a bunch of files before leaving your company to start a competitor; you’d want some record of that, and it would be bad if the person could use Copilot to go undetected.<a id="note-2" href="https://pistachioapp.com/blog/copilot-broke-your-audit-log#footnote-2" data-discover="true">[<!-- -->2<!-- -->]</a> Or maybe your company has sensitive personal data, and you need a strict log of who accessed those files for legal and compliance purposes; again, you’d need to know about access that occurred via Copilot. That’s just two examples. Organizations rely on having an accurate audit log.</p><p>But what happens if you ask Copilot to not provide you with a link to the file it summarized? Well, in that case, the audit log is empty.</p><p><img src="https://pistachioapp.com/bucket/images/website/blog/posts/copilot-broke-your-audit-log/bad-behavior-request.png" alt="Bad behavior request"></p><p><img src="https://pistachioapp.com/bucket/images/website/blog/posts/copilot-broke-your-audit-log/bad-behavior-log.png" alt="Bad behavior log"></p><p>Just like that, your audit log is wrong. For a malicious insider, avoiding detection is as simple as asking Copilot.<a id="note-3" href="https://pistachioapp.com/blog/copilot-broke-your-audit-log#footnote-3" data-discover="true">[<!-- -->3<!-- -->]</a></p><p>You might be thinking, “Yikes, but I guess not too many people figured that out, so it’s probably fine.” Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. When I found this, I wasn’t searching for ways to break the audit log. Instead, I was simply trying to trigger the audit log so I could test functionality we are developing at Pistachio, and I noticed it was unreliable. In other words, this can happen by chance.<a id="note-4" href="https://pistachioapp.com/blog/copilot-broke-your-audit-log#footnote-4" data-discover="true">[<!-- -->4<!-- -->]</a> So if your organization has M365 Copilot licenses, your audit log is probably wrong.</p><h2 id="problems-with-msrc">Problems with MSRC</h2><p>I had never reported a vulnerability to Microsoft before, and my initial reaction to the process was fairly positive. The fact that I could submit something already felt unusually friendly by Microsoft’s standards. And like I mentioned, they even had a guide on what to expect.</p><p>Unfortunately, nothing went according to plan. On July 7th my report’s status was changed to “reproducing”, but when I went to provide more evidence on July 10th the functionality had changed. That isn’t Microsoft’s policy; they’re meant to reproduce, then move to “develop” when they start working on a fix. Seeing the functionality change while still in “reproducing” made me think Microsoft was going to get back to me and claim they couldn’t reproduce the issue, when actually they had simply fixed it based on my report.</p><p>So I asked MSRC what was happening, and instead of responding with a simple explanation, they changed the status of the report to “develop” and said nothing. Up until that point I thought Microsoft was going to follow a process, and coordinate with me if they had to deviate from that. Instead, it felt like the process was less a reflection of what was really happening, and more akin to the Domino’s Pizza Tracker for security researchers. The statuses aren’t real.</p><p>On August 2nd, Microsoft informed me that a full fix would be released on August 17th, that I would be free to disclose as of August 18th. I then asked when a CVE number would be issued, and I was told:</p><blockquote><p>CVEs are given to fixes deployed in security releases when customers need to take action to stay protected. In this case, the mitigation will be automatically pushed to Copilot, where users do not need to manually update the product and a CVE will not be assigned.</p></blockquote><p>That is not Microsoft’s policy at all, which I pointed out to them by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/06/toward-greater-transparency-unveiling-cloud-service-cves/">linking to their own policy</a>. MSRC then wrote back, “I understand you may not have full visibility into how MSRC approaches these cases”, as if I was the wrong one. They then explained that the vulnerability is classified as “important”, not “critical”, and that is why they will not issue a CVE.<a id="note-5" href="https://pistachioapp.com/blog/copilot-broke-your-audit-log#footnote-5" data-discover="true">[<!-- -->5<!-- -->]</a> Of course, they had not told me that they had classified the vulnerability at all prior to that point.</p><h2 id="microsofts-decision-to-say-nothing">Microsoft’s Decision to Say Nothing</h2><p>If Microsoft isn’t issuing a CVE for this vulnerability, how are they going to inform customers about it? The answer is that they’re not going to. On a call on August 14th, Microsoft told me that they had no plans to disclose this.<a id="note-6" href="https://pistachioapp.com/blog/copilot-broke-your-audit-log#footnote-6" data-discover="true">[<!-- -->6<!-- -->]</a></p><p>I strongly feel that is wrong. It might be okay to move on silently if this was some esoteric exploit, but the reality is that it is so easy that it basically happens by accident. If you work at an organization that used Copilot prior to August 18th, there is a very real chance that your audit log is incomplete.</p><p>Do organizations not need to know that? What about companies that are subject to HIPAA and are relying on Microsoft’s audit log to satisfy some of the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.312">technical safeguard requirements</a>? Do they not get to know, despite Microsoft claiming M365 Copilot can be <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/enterprise-data-protection">HIPAA compliant</a>? There are almost certainly other regulated entities with similar requirements, and they also won’t be told.</p><p>There are so many cases in which organizations rely on audit logs to detect, investigate, and respond to incidents. There are lawsuits where audit logs are used as important evidence. The US government even made an <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/when-tech-vendors-make-important-logging-info-available-free-everyone-wins">issue out of Microsoft charging more for audit logs</a>, with a US senator <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/microsoft-free-security-logs-Outlook-email-hack-backlash/688388/">shaming Microsoft</a> and referring to audit logging as an essential security feature.</p><p>And now Microsoft is saying that even though the audit log was very plausibly wrong for any customer using Copilot, no one needs to know? This raises serious questions about what other problems Microsoft chooses to silently sweep under the rug.</p></article></section><div><p><img src="https://pistachioapp.com/bucket/images/authors/zack-korman-v2.png" alt="Zack Korman"></p><div><p><span>Who wrote this?</span></p><p id="author-description">Zack Korman is the CTO at Pistachio.

            <p><span>S</span>cientists recently discovered a microbe with one of the tiniest genomes on Earth. More surprising, the creature is almost entirely dependent on its host: Its genes don’t support any of the functions of metabolism, one of the key processes of life. As such, it challenges fundamental notions of what it means to be a living organism.</p>
      
    <p>The discovery was “pure serendipity,” says Takuro Nakayama, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Takayama wanted to study the many microbes that live within a single-celled marine dinoflagellate, <em>Citharistes regius</em>, a kind of plankton. But when he and his colleagues sequenced the genes of this microbial community, they kept turning up tiny, odd chunks of DNA.</p><p>It turns out that these DNA chunks belong to some unusual archaea—a branch on the tree of life populated by single-celled microbes that can often survive in extreme environments. (Archaea are similar to bacteria, but distinct in their structure, genetics, and metabolism.)</p><blockquote><p>How did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome?</p></blockquote>

          </div><p>Nakayama and his colleagues proposed the name Sukunaarchaeum mirabile for the newly-discovered microbe: Sukunaarchaeum after the Japanese dwarf deity <em>Sukuna-biko-na</em>, and mirabile for marvelous. At only 238,000 base pairs, the number of genes in the DNA of Sukunaarchaeum is smaller than that of any other known archaea. The scientists described <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651781v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their finding</a> in a bioRxiv preprint earlier this year.</p><p>So how did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome? Over the course of evolution, genetic instructions for life often become increasingly complex. But evolution can also go in the other direction, leading to greater simplicity in the genome. This so-called genomic reduction, where organisms end up with fewer genes than their ancestors, is typically observed in the domains of bacteria and archaea. What struck Nakayama and his colleagues about Sukunaarchaeum was the extent of reduction and specialization in its genes.</p><p>With its stripped down genome, Sukunaarchaeum appears to be completely dependent on its host, <em>C. regius</em>, for essential energy and nutrients. “It likely cannot produce its own cellular building blocks,” notes Nakayama. “No previously discovered microbe has shown such an extreme degree of metabolic dependence.” </p><p>Sukunaarchaeum seems to almost inhabit a new category of life, suspended somewhere between archaea and virus. It is like viruses—which aren’t typically considered to be “alive”—in that it has a tiny genome and is totally dependent on its host for metabolism. But unlike a virus, Sukunaarchaeum has its own ribosomes, cellular structures that synthesize proteins, and it can replicate itself without the help of a host.</p>

          </div><p>To get a sense of just how unusual Sukunaarchaeum is, the researchers decided to scan the oceans for potential relatives. They analyzed environmental genetic sequence data from marine environments all over the world, focusing on spots where <em>C. regius</em> is known to live. Using a database called the Tara Oceans project, they discovered a vast array of sequences that are comparable to that of Sukunaarchaeum, which they hypothesize could represent a new, deeply branching archaeal lineage.</p><p>For Nakayama, this additional finding suggests that many more microbes that challenge the definition of life may be out there, living in what Nakayama calls “microbial dark matter,” or microbes that can’t be cultivated in the lab. “The extreme, virus-like lifestyle we hypothesize for Sukunaarchaeum is a perfect example of the surprising outcomes found in this ‘natural laboratory of evolution,’” he says.</p><p>Mart Krupovic, a virologist and microbiologist at Institut Pasteur in France who wasn’t involved in the study, called the finding “remarkable.” Krupovic has studied giant viruses that, like Sukunaarchaeum, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/cib.18624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defy categorization</a>. These giant viruses have evolved larger and more complex genomes that include some of the genes for DNA translation, a characteristic thought to be reserved for cellular life. “I think that is fascinating,” says Krupovic, “how little we still know about the world which surrounds us.”</p><p>Next, Nakayama wants to culture and isolate Sukunaarchaeum in the lab, not just its genes, and take an image or video of it. He hopes this will help him better understand its biology, ecology, and how it is built—how it achieves this curious feat of living on the edge of life. <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p>

<a href="https://muffinman.io/invaders/"><figure><img src="https://muffinman.io/blog/invaders/ui.png" alt="" width="2490" height="1696"></figure></a>
<p>Here are a few invaders it can generate:</p>

<p>While showing friends how it works, I realized the process would look great animated. So I decided to write another interactive blog post. I'll give you some background first, but if you are eager to see the process, feel free to jump straight to the <a href="#building-the-invader">interactive part</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started <a href="#how-it-started">#</a></h2>
<p>I was working on a new version of <a href="https://muffinman.io/blog/sneak-peek-of-rayven/">Rayven</a>, my vector 3D renderer. Sometimes I get stuck working on tools - they turn into never-ending projects and I never actually use them to create something. At some point I became aware of this pattern, and I think I've gotten better at wrapping projects up, releasing them in one form or another, and moving on.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be cool to do a few plots using Rayven instead of endlessly tweaking the renderer itself. I wanted something simple that I could whip up quickly. It would be a meaningful milestone, even if I didn't finish everything I planned for Rayven.</p>
<p>Then I thought of Space Invaders. They are small, easy to render with 3D blocks, and instantly recognizable as part of video game history.</p>

<p>I did a few renders of the classic space invader and started thinking that it would be fun to generate random ones and create a series of plots. That sounded like a good idea to share as a code challenge.</p>
<h2 id="the-code-challenge">The code challenge <a href="#the-code-challenge">#</a></h2>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised that people liked the idea. We drafted some rules and the <a href="https://cca.codes/invaders">Space Invaders code challenge</a> was on! At the time of writing, the challenge is still ongoing, but once it wraps up, I'll link to all the submissions. I've already seen some works in progress and there is some really cool stuff coming - stay tuned!</p>
<h2 id="from-doodles-to-pixels">From doodles to pixels <a href="#from-doodles-to-pixels">#</a></h2>
<p>I often bore people by saying you should step back and solve the problem before diving into code. This time it was no different. I literally had no idea how to generate space invaders, so I started with some research. I doodled on paper, but pixel art felt like it deserved digital tools.</p>
<p>So I fired up Aseprite and got to work:</p>
<figure><img src="https://muffinman.io/blog/invaders/invaders.png" alt="" width="1050" height="1200"></figure>
<p>These are the 38 invaders I drew. They all fit in a 15x15 pixel grid, a bit larger than the originals, but I really liked how they turned out. I enjoyed drawing them a lot. Still, I had no clue how to generate them. I had some over-engineered ideas, but with such a small canvas I worried they would end up as unrecognizable splats of pixels.</p>
<p>Looking at the drawings, a pattern started to emerge. And it was the best kind of pattern - one based on geometry and vector graphics, both things I enjoy and am good at. I chose to play to my strengths and try generating a vector invader. I'm glad to say it worked - what I implemented can generate most of the invaders I drew by hand.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the process, a small disclaimer: I won't go into every little detail, but I'll walk you through the core steps and make digressions about stuff I find interesting. If you want to see implementation details, you can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/Stanko/invaders">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>One last note: I use the terms 'generate' and 'randomly select' a lot. Usually that means I use randomness (with some constraints) to calculate a point in 2D space.</p>
<div><h2 id="building-the-invader">Building the invader <a href="#building-the-invader">#</a></h2><p>Here's our grid. It will stay in the viewport and we'll draw an invader on it as we scroll down.</p><p>We should probably start with the body. If you look at my sketches above, you might notice the same pattern I did - almost all of the bodies resemble a low-resolution polygon. The plan is to generate a vector polygon. The low resolution of the grid will help hide our (vector) crimes.</p><h3 id="finding-the-center">Finding the center <a href="#finding-the-center">#</a></h3><p>Having a central point for the body will help us draw the rest of it. Think of it as an anchor. Since we'll generate tentacles in the bottom part, it makes sense to shift the body slightly upward.</p><p>The original space invaders are symmetrical around the vertical axis, and we can use that to our advantage. It's enough to generate one side of the body and then mirror it.</p><h3 id="defining-top-and-bottom">Defining top and bottom <a href="#defining-top-and-bottom">#</a></h3><p>To generate one side of the body, we start with top and bottom points. Both sit on the vertical axis of symmetry and are randomly selected.</p><h3 id="drawing-the-left-side">Drawing the left side <a href="#drawing-the-left-side">#</a></h3><p>We only need to generate one side and then mirror it. On the left side, we'll randomly pick between one and five points.</p><p>At first I limited it to two or three points with a convex shape. Later I allowed more points and dropped the convex rule, which unlocked more interesting results. Lines sometimes overlap, but once pixelized, those imperfections disappear.</p><h3 id="mirroring-it-to-the-right">Mirroring it to the right <a href="#mirroring-it-to-the-right">#</a></h3><p>Once the left side vertices are generated, we mirror them to the right.</p><h3 id="connect-the-dots">Connect the dots <a href="#connect-the-dots">#</a></h3><p>Now we connect the points into a polygon. Side points are connected according to their vertical position.</p><p>That gives our invader a body! Now let's add some extremities.</p><h2 id="adding-limbs">Adding limbs <a href="#adding-limbs">#</a></h2><p>In code, limbs generated on the bottom side are called tentacles, and the ones on the top are horns. They are generated the same way, just with different parameters.</p><p>Let's see how to generate one tentacle, and then we'll reuse the same technique for others.</p><h3 id="finding-the-root">Finding the root <a href="#finding-the-root">#</a></h3><p>Since tentacles grow from the bottom, we start with the lowest side point of the body polygon. As usual, we do the left side first and mirror later.</p><h3 id="sketching-the-mid-line">Sketching the mid-line <a href="#sketching-the-mid-line">#</a></h3><p>From the lowest point, we generate a few random points to form a polyline. Its length is random, and it serves as a mid-line for the tentacle.</p><h3 id="fattening-the-line">Fattening the line <a href="#fattening-the-line">#</a></h3><p>On its own, the line is too thin. To turn it into a tentacle we need to give it width. The trick is to calculate points on both sides of the bisector line and connect them together. I like this technique and use it often for my drawings.</p><p>It feels natural that the tentacle is wider where it connects to the body and shrinks further away. To achieve this, we reduce the bisector length as we move outward.</p><p>Two notes on this "fat line" algorithm:</p><ul>
<li>Because the mid-line is random, we often get sharp corners, which create weird overlaps. To soften them we scale down the line width relative to how sharp the angle is.</li>
<li>In the generator, you'll see an easing parameter for the width. Probably overkill, but it lets me fine tune the width along the tentacle and occasionally fill a missing pixel. I liked the control, so I kept it.</li>
</ul><h3 id="our-first-tentacle">Our first tentacle <a href="#our-first-tentacle">#</a></h3><p>Connecting the bisector endpoints gives us our first fat line, or rather, our first tentacle.</p><p>Now we're ready to generate more tentacles and horns the same way.</p><h3 id="growing-more-tentacles">Growing more tentacles <a href="#growing-more-tentacles">#</a></h3><p>First we mirror the tentacle we just drew. Some invaders also have a middle tentacle. Let's <span tabindex="0" role="button">randomly decide</span><span><span><span>If the invader you are looking at hasn't grown a middle tentacle, refresh the page to get a new one.</span></span></span> if we should draw one.</p><p>For the middle tentacle we start from the bottom point of the body polygon. We draw a line just like before, but with one change - if we get close to a side tentacle we stop. This avoids overlaps that often create a blob of pixels.</p><p>To keep the middle tentacle symmetrical, we'll take the lazy route - draw it randomly and then mirror it.</p><h3 id="adding-horns">Adding horns <a href="#adding-horns">#</a></h3><p>We draw horns the same way, except we start from the central point and shoot diagonally upward. Horns use a slightly narrower angle range to avoid overlaps. As usual, draw the left one and then mirror it.</p><p>At this stage we have a very <del>crappy</del> rough vector invader. With this rough outline in place, the next challenge is turning it into the pixelated look we all know and love.</p><h2 id="turning-vectors-into-pixels">Turning vectors into pixels <a href="#turning-vectors-into-pixels">#</a></h2><p>By pixelization, I mean painting pixels on the grid based on the vector invader. My first idea was to calculate how much of each pixel lies inside the vector shape and paint it if it's over 50%. That would be the most accurate, but it felt over-engineered for such a tiny grid.</p><h3 id="pixelizing-the-body">Pixelizing the body <a href="#pixelizing-the-body">#</a></h3><p>Instead, we'll keep it simple - check if the center of a pixel is inside the polygon. If it is, paint it.</p><p>This method isn't perfectly accurate, but it's easy and more than good enough. We're drawing tiny fictional space invaders, not building a universal rasterizer.</p><h3 id="pixelizing-the-limbs">Pixelizing the limbs <a href="#pixelizing-the-limbs">#</a></h3><p>Tentacles can get thin, so often the center of a pixel won't fall inside them. That leaves only a few pixels painted. To improve this, we check if the center of a pixel is close to one of the tentacle points. If so, we paint it.</p><p>But if the points are far apart, that still leaves gaps. To improve it, I added a <code>line splitting</code> parameter that subdivides the mid-line into more segments. More points mean a higher chance that a pixel center will be near one. It is not essential, but it helps fine tune invaders you like.</p><p>Now it really looks like an invader - but it's still blind. Let's slap some eyes on it!</p><h2 id="adding-eyes">Adding eyes <a href="#adding-eyes">#</a></h2><p>We could get clever with eyes, but a few predefined sets work just fine. I already drew some, so we just select one set. We'll place the eyes near the central point, since the body is built around it.</p><p>To keep eyes from ending up on the edge, I padded the predefined sets with a few extra pixels. To <span tabindex="0" role="button">make it easier to see</span><span><span><span>Pun intended!</span></span></span>, these extra pixels are shown lighter in the animation. Finally, if eye pixels overlap with body pixels, we remove them to create holes.</p><h2 id="coloring-the-invader">Coloring the invader <a href="#coloring-the-invader">#</a></h2><p>Finally, we can apply some color and there is our invader! Let's talk about color a little.</p><p>To generate colors, I used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch">OKLCH color space</a>. It's similar to HSL, but unlike HSL it has predictable lightness. That means if we keep the lightness parameter fixed and randomly generate the other two, all generated colors share the same lightness. This is practical for many reasons, but in our case it helps us create colors of similar vibrancy for each invader.</p><p>The code looks like this:</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> l <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>(</span><span>0.55</span><span>,</span> <span>0.8</span><span>,</span> rng<span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>const</span> c <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span> <span>0.5</span><span>,</span> rng<span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>const</span> h <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>120</span><span>,</span> <span>420</span><span>,</span> rng<span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>360</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// skip brownish tones 60 - 120</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>documentElement</span><span>.</span><span>style</span><span>.</span><span>setProperty</span><span>(</span><span>'--theme-l'</span><span>,</span> l<span>)</span><span>;</span>

</span><span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>documentElement</span><span>.</span><span>style</span><span>.</span><span>setProperty</span><span>(</span><span>'--theme-h'</span><span>,</span> h<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre><p>Notice that for the hue I skip the range between 60 and 120 - yellow-brownish tones I didn't like.</p><h3 id="color-tweaks-with-css">Color tweaks with CSS <a href="#color-tweaks-with-css">#</a></h3><p>One cool thing is that we can keep <code>l</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>h</code> as separate CSS variables. That makes it easy to mix and match or manipulate them with CSS <code>calc</code> method.</p><p>For example, I use this to fix lightness for controls in the generator so they always have enough contrast:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>.controls</span></span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>--controls-main</span><span>:</span> <span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.6</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--theme-c</span><span>)</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--theme-h</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  <span>--controls-main-light</span><span>:</span> <span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.75</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--theme-c</span><span>)</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--theme-h</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre><p>I also use it in debug mode to make tentacle and horn pixels darker and less saturated:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>.invader--debug</span> <span>.invader-pixel--l</span></span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>fill</span><span>:</span> <span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--theme-l</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>0.8</span><span>)</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--theme-c</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>0.6</span><span>)</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--theme-h</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="bringing-it-to-life">Bringing it to life <a href="#bringing-it-to-life">#</a></h2>
<p>For the animation, we'll try to mimic the original video game. The original invaders have very simple two-frame animations with tentacles and horns moving.</p>
<p>To move tentacles and horns, we clone their mid-lines and randomly shift a few end points. This gives us a variation for each tentacle and horn. Then we redraw the fat lines around them, pixelize it again, and get the second frame. To top it off and add a bit more life, we also move the eyes by one pixel.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks in action:</p>

<p>The pink lines are alternate mid-lines for tentacles and horns. In the generator, you can see this debug view by turning on both <code>animate</code> and <code>debug</code> options.</p>
<h2 id="size">Size <a href="#size">#</a></h2>
<p>I love how increasing the grid size makes the invader feel like it’s evolving or growing. The same algorithm runs, but on a larger area, which allows for more details.</p>

<p>But if we increase the size too much, the vector shape becomes more prominent and it usually doesn't look good. Occasionally you'll get something that looks like a final boss, but most of the time you end up with ridiculous crappy ones:</p>

<p>That's why I capped the size in the generator's interface to 31x31 pixels. But there is a way to increase it a bit more. If you change the URL directly you can push it up to a maximum of <a href="https://muffinman.io/invaders/#/size:25/">51x51 pixels</a>. I left this hidden feature in to show how increasing the size breaks the illusion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>We made it!</p>
<p>Thank you for sticking with me until the end. We built a generator that can create an infinite number of little colorful invaders. I'm super happy with how they turned out, and I hope you like them too.</p>
<p>Making the generator and writing the post was a lot of fun. There are still things to add and improve, but like I said earlier - I learned how to publish a project even when my TODO list isn't empty. I might add a few more things to the generator, but I've got other projects lined up, so we'll see.</p>
<p>I honestly hope you enjoyed reading the post and generating our little colorful intergalactic friends. And don't forget to <a href="https://muffinman.io/invaders/">generate your own fleet</a>.</p>
<h2 id="making-of-the-post">Making of the post <a href="#making-of-the-post">#</a></h2>
<p>I usually keep all of the JavaScript in my posts unminified so people can read the code and hack around. But in this case, the invader generator and the animation use several external dependencies, so it was easier to add a build step.</p>
<p>The animation is made with <a href="https://animejs.com/">Anime.js</a> and its code lives in the <a href="https://github.com/Stanko/invaders/blob/dev/src/drawing/step-by-step.ts">generator repository</a>. The TypeScript gets compiled and copied to my blog repo. Finally, there is a <a href="https://github.com/Stanko/Stanko.github.io/blob/brz/site/public/js/posts/invaders/index.js">small script</a> that coordinates the animation and connects it to the page scroll.</p>
<p>The animation is also available in the generator itself. If you add the <code>step</code> parameter and toggle debug mode you'll be able to <a href="https://muffinman.io/invaders/?step#/debug:true">play with it</a> there as well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ben Lindbergh at the Ringer <a href="https://www.theringer.com/movies/2023/8/8/23824204/jerk-word-evolution-steve-martin-goodfellas-jerry-maguire">asks</a> “When did jerk stop meaning ‘stupid’?”  He starts with the Steve Martin movie <em>The Jerk</em>, saying of its protagonist:</p>
<blockquote><p>Navin is oblivious, not obnoxious. He’s ignorant, not intolerant. He’s naive, not intentionally cruel. He’s a bumpkin, a rube, and a moron, maybe, but a jerk? For the most part, no, I wouldn’t say so.</p></blockquote>
<p>There he is, of course, using the current sense of <em>jerk</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s definitely been a semantic shift in ‘jerk’ over the years,” says linguist, lexicographer, and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> language columnist Ben Zimmer. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, which dates “jerk,” an American colloquialism, back to 1935, reports: “Originally: an inept or pathetic person; a fool. Now: an objectionable or obnoxious person.” <em>Green’s Dictionary of Slang</em>, which traces “jerk” back to 1934, <a href="https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/3d633oy">defines</a> its original meaning as “a fool, an idiot, a failure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes into the change in some detail, and it makes fascinating reading, but here’s the part that grabbed my attention and made me post it:<br>
<span id="more-13463"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s the sort of spooky thing. It’s not just that there are multiple generations who’ve never known a “jerk” was once a simpleton or sap. It’s that some of the folks who used to use it that way don’t remember that they did. When I asked my mom to define the word this week, she used the modern meaning, with no apparent recollection of her former firm conviction that a jerk was a dope, dodo, or dimwit. Did someone Neuralyze my mom, or have I become a jerk truther?</p>
<p>My mom isn’t the only boomer who may have revised their history of this specific subject. You can trace the ascendance of the asshole strain of jerk through the writing of Pulitzer Prize–winning columnist and humorist Dave Barry, who’s between my mom and Martin in age. In <em>Stay Fit and Healthy Until You’re Dead</em> (1985), Barry wrote, “How many bones do you think your skeletal system has? Would you say 50? 150? 250? 300? More than 300? If you guessed 50, you’re a real jerk.” In <em>Dave Barry Turns 40</em> (1990), he wrote, “So your financial situation is a mess. Okay, fine. The important thing is—don’t be discouraged. There’s no reason to get down on yourself, just because you’ve been an unbelievable jerk.” But by 1996—the year of “Show me the money”—he was using the modern meaning in a <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-10-13-9610130409-story.html">column</a> headlined, “What It Takes to Be a Jerk.”</p>
<p>When I brought this to Barry’s attention and asked him how the great redefinition of jerk may have happened, he wrote, “I always thought jerk meant asshole. At least I <em>thought</em> I always thought that, although the quotes you cite seem to suggest otherwise. So to answer your question: I have no idea. You may be right!” […]</p>
<p>A little light searching suggests I’m not the only amateur etymologist to lose their lexical bearings over the near-forgotten former meaning of “jerk.” “When did jerk stop meaning stupid?” a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/letbs0/when_did_jerk_stop_meaning_stupid/">asked</a> in 2021 (ironically, on the NoStupidQuestions subreddit). Others have seemed similarly unnerved by how the word went from signifying one thing to signifying something else so suddenly, within living memory, as everyone who used to use it the old way overwrote the old definition. There’s a sense of suddenly standing on shaky ground: <em>Am I fluent in this language, or have I Englished wrong all along? How can we communicate if “jerk” meant nitwit in 1982 but not in 1996?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Reader, I too am such a boomer.  When I started reading the column I thought <em>jerk</em> had always meant ‘asshole’ to me (even if it wasn’t quite as harsh), but as I went along I realized that no, I used to use it in the “dummy” sense but had somehow forgotten that fact.  On the one hand, I’m glad it’s not just me, but on the other… it’s weird and unsettling!</p>

  <p>
    Collaboratively editing strings of text is a common desire in peer-to-peer applications. For example, a note-taking
    app might represent each document as a single collaboratively-edited string of text.
  </p>
  <p>
    The algorithm presented here is one way to do this. It comes from a family of algorithms called
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a>, which I will not describe
    here. It's similar to the approaches taken by popular collaborative text editing libraries such as
    <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge">Automerge</a>.
    Other articles have already been written about these similar approaches (see the
    <a href="#references">references</a> section below), but this article also has a nice interactive visualization of
    what goes on under the hood.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>The algorithm:</i></b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Each character is assigned a unique identifier consisting of <code>site</code> (the identifier of the creator)
        and <code>clock</code> (a site-specific integer that is incremented after every operation) as well as a
        (possibly null) <code>parent</code> pointer to a previous character.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To insert a character, set its <code>parent</code> pointer to the character immediately before the insertion
        point at the time of insertion (or to null when inserting at the beginning). The character order is determined
        by a pre-order tree traversal that places parents before their children. This is
        <a href="https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-tree-based-indexing/">tree-based indexing</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To order characters with the same parent, have each character also store a <code>counter</code> value and sort
        first by <code>counter</code> (use descending order), then by the <code>site</code> of the character (use
        arbitrary but consistent order). When inserting before a character with the same parent, use its counter
        incremented by 1 to be ordered before it. This order is unique because doing this means the same site will never
        reuse the same counter in the same spot.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To delete a character, put that character's identifier in a deleted set. Note that this means deleted characters
        persist forever, which is known as a "tombstone" in CRDT literature. Deleted character values can be forgotten
        but the positions must be remembered to be able to correctly order incoming changes that use one of the
        now-deleted characters as a parent.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This is not as expensive as it sounds because of three important optimizations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Successive inserts from the same site can all be merged into a single block in memory, so for example pasting a
        large chunk of text uses the same amount of metadata as inserting a single character. This works because
        character identifiers are carefully designed to be able to be implicit in a contiguous run of text (each
        character will the same <code>site</code> and <code>counter</code> and have a <code>clock</code> that's 1 more
        than the previous character's <code>clock</code>).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        These blocks of memory can be stored contiguously in a single array that's pre-sorted in document order.
        Inserting a new block just involves inserting into that array at the correct position. This avoids needing to
        store the tree data structure explicitly (e.g. with arrays of children and/or sibling pointers) and also takes
        advantage of CPU optimizations for reading memory sequentially.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The delete set can be represented more efficiently using a range-based representation. A series of deletes with
        the same <code>site</code> and with consecutive <code>clock</code> values can be represented with a single
        range. Note that this range is contiguous in identifier-space but not necessarily in document-space.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Below is a demo of what this looks like in practice. Each quadrant represents a peer, and peers send messages to
    each other with a simulated network delay. Click on a peer's text to edit it. Temporarily disable the simulated
    network with the pause button to construct simultaneous editing scenarios. You can use your browser's "view source"
    feature to view the <a href="https://madebyevan.com/algos/crdt-text-buffer/crdt-text-buffer.js">source code for this demo</a>.

      This technique has the following benefits and drawbacks:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Benefits:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Memory usage: The metadata overhead needed to track collaborative edits is reasonable and is also likely to
          compress well as it contains runs of similar values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Performance: It's possible to implement most of the queries and/or updates to the data structure in O(log n)
          time using either binary trees or arrays with binary search.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Drawbacks:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Complexity: The logic for splitting and merging is complicated and hard to implement correctly. Fuzz testing
          is likely essential for a correct implementation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Grow-only: Deleting data does not reduce the size of the metadata. Addressing this properly is quite
          challenging as it involves coordinating between peers to ensure data is only removed when it's no longer
          needed by any peer in the system. It also can break down when a peer goes offline and never comes back online,
          but the system supports peers being offline for arbitrary lengths of time. This algorithm does not attempt to
          address that problem.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Here are some excellent resources on CRDT text buffers that I found helpful when implementing this algorithm:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-go-brrr/">https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-go-brrr/</a>
        <p>Talks about how to implement text-based CRDTs efficiently. Covers some of the optimizations used here
          including storing runs of text together and storing insertions in a flat list.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://archagon.net/blog/2018/03/24/data-laced-with-history/">http://archagon.net/blog/2018/03/24/data-laced-with-history/</a>
        <p>Goes over tree-based indexing (which it calls "causal trees") in a lot of depth. Discusses a possible
          approach to distributed garbage collection as well as the complexities that come with it. Has lots of
          additional references at the bottom.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/yrs-architecture/">https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/yrs-architecture/</a>
        <p>Goes over the internals of Yjs in more detail, which is relevant because what I implemented is similar to
          what Yjs does. Some high-level differences are that a) Yjs doesn't store delete sets explicitly and sends all
          of them all over again each time syncing starts and b) Yjs gives each insert an additional rightward pointer
          for resolving ordering between children with the same parent.</p>
      </li>

        <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/">https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/</a>
        <p>"Rich text" involves attaching formatting attributes (e.g. bold or italic) to individual characters. Doing
          this in a collaborative environment requires careful algorithm to preserve the original human intention after
          an automatic merge. This article presents a way to do that.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 19:38:38 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sso.tax/">https://sso.tax/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44955457">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      

<details open="">
  <summary>
    <p>Why does this exist?</p>
  </summary>
  <p>Single sign-on (SSO) is a mechanism for outsourcing the authentication for your website (or other product) to a third party identity provider, such as Google, Okta, Entra ID (Azure AD), PingFederate, etc.</p>

  <p>In this context, SSO refers to a SaaS or similar vendor allowing a business client to manage user accounts via the client’s own identity provider, without having to rely on the vendor to provide strong authentication with audit logs, and with the ability to create and delete user accounts centrally, for all users, across all software in use by that client.</p>

  <p>For organizations with more than a handful of employees, this feature is critical for IT and Security teams to be able to effectively manage user accounts across dozens or hundreds of vendors, many of which don’t support features like TOTP 2FA or U2F. In the event that an employee leaves the company, it allows the IT team to immediately disable their access to all applications, rather than logging into 100 different user management portals.</p>

  <p>In short: SSO is a core security requirement for any company with more than five employees.</p>

  <p>SaaS vendors appear not to have received this message, however. SSO is often only available as part of “Enterprise” pricing, which assumes either a huge number of users (minimum seat count) or is force-bundled with other “Enterprise” features which may have no value to the company using the software.</p>

  <p>If companies claim to “take your security seriously”, then SSO should be available as a feature that is either:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>part of the core product, or</li>
    <li>an optional paid extra for a reasonable delta, or</li>
    <li>attached to a price tier, but with a reasonably small gap between the non-SSO tier and SSO tiers.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Many vendors charge 2x, 3x, or 4x the base product pricing for access to SSO, which disincentivizes its use and encourages poor security practices.</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>This doesn’t scale linearly for number of seats!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>Correct. Since we don’t know who’s reading the page, it’s easiest to just assume a team with no volume discount.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>How is base pricing determined?</p>
  </summary>
  <p>We disregard free tier pricing, as we can assume these aren’t intended for long term business customer use. We also disregard “single person” pricing, under the assumption that we’re looking on behalf of a team of 5, 10, or more people.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>What does “Quote” mean in the Source column?</p>
  </summary>
  <p>If a vendor doesn’t list pricing but a user has submitted pricing based on a quote, it can be included here. If a vendor feels that their actual pricing is inaccurately reflected by this quote, feel free to let me know and I’ll update the page.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>I’m a vendor and this data is wrong!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>Please feel free to submit a PR to this page, or reach out at sso @ myGitHubUsername dotcom. I only want this data to be accurate.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>I’m a vendor and this doesn’t reflect the value-add of our Enterprise tier!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>That’s the point. Decouple your security features from your value-added services. They should be priced separately.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <p>But it costs money to provide SAML support, so we can’t offer it for free!</p>
  </summary>
  <p>While I’d like people to really consider it a <em>bare minimum</em> feature for business SaaS, I’m OK with it costing a little extra to cover maintenance costs. If your SSO support is a 10% price hike, you’re not on this list. But these percentage increases are not maintenance costs, they’re revenue generation because you know your customers have no good options.</p>

            <p><span>Reasons</span></p><h2>Why choose AnduinOS?</h2>
            <p>Smaller image, friendly interface, unbeatable performance, safe and secure.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div>
                        <h4>Ready to use</h4>
                        <p>The ISO is just 2.0GB in size. Similar to Ubuntu, it is simple to install and can meet your daily needs without additional configuration or complicated operations.</p>
                    </div>
            <div>
                        <h4>Friendly interface</h4>
                        <p>The GNOME-based desktop environment have beautiful interfaces and human-computer interactions that fit user habits, allowing you to quickly get started with AnduinOS without too much learning cost.</p>

                        <h4>Root and privacy</h4>
                        <p>Privacy is no longer optional. It's essential. AnduinOS is designed to gather nothing from you. We don't track you. We don't profile you. We don't target you. You remain anonymous to the system.</p>

                        <h4>Ecological perfection</h4>
                        <p>AnduinOS is based on Ubuntu's package base. It's compatible with most of the apt packages from Ubuntu. It's a perfect combination of experience and ecology.</p>

            <div>
                        <h4>Open Source</h4>

                        <p>Graphical applications are installed via Flatpak, and keep themselves separate from the base system (Since 1.3). They also allow for fine-grained control over their permissions.</p>

                        <p>...it's pretty spectacular. It's also quite possibly one of the friendliest Linux distros I've tried when it comes to folks who may well be moving over from Windows. Built by one person, it's pretty astonishing how good it is.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://d2lang.com/blog/ascii/">https://d2lang.com/blog/ascii/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44954524">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>In the latest release of D2 (0.7.1), we introduce ASCII outputs.</p>
<p>Any output file with extension <code>txt</code> will use the ASCII renderer to write to it.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Here is an example of their rendering from the <a href="https://github.com/terrastruct/d2-vim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D2 Vim extension</a>. The user opens a <code>.d2</code> file and opens a preview window, which updates upon every save.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="D2 Vim preview" src="https://d2lang.com/assets/images/preview-d04cd1ad32fec06203b93a3ac64d903f.gif" width="1159" height="1470"></p>
<h2 id="code-documentation">Code documentation<a href="#code-documentation" aria-label="Direct link to Code documentation" title="Direct link to Code documentation">​</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most useful place for ASCII diagrams is in the source code comments. Small
simple diagrams next to functions or classes can serve to be much clearer than describing
a flow.</p>
<p>Here again the Vim extension demonstrates a functionality to write some d2 code and
replace the selection with the ASCII render.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="D2 Vim replace" src="https://d2lang.com/assets/images/replace-7658a2addaa42da73547218f1cffe1d5.gif" width="1159" height="1470"></p>
<h2 id="unicode-and-standard-ascii">Unicode and standard ASCII<a href="#unicode-and-standard-ascii" aria-label="Direct link to Unicode and standard ASCII" title="Direct link to Unicode and standard ASCII">​</a></h2>
<p>The default character set of ASCII renders is unicode, which has nicer box-drawing
characters. If you'd like true ASCII for maximum portability, you can specify this with
the flag <code>--ascii-mode=standard</code>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations<a href="#limitations" aria-label="Direct link to Limitations" title="Direct link to Limitations">​</a></h2>
<div><p><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Alpha</p><p>Note that the ASCII renderer should be considered in alpha stage. There will be many
corner cases, areas of improvements, and outright bugs. If you enjoy using it, we'd
appreciate you taking the time to file any issues you run into:
<a href="https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues</a>.</p></div>
<p>The ASCII renderer is a downscale of the layout determined by the ELK layout engine with
some post-processing to further compact it.</p>
<ul>
<li>No styles are supported<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Some will never be, e.g. <code>animated</code> and <code>font</code> don't make sense in ASCII.</li>
<li>Some may in the future with limited scope, e.g. colors when rendered to terminal.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>By extension, themes are moot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some should be considered TODOs, e.g. <code>double-border</code> and <code>multiple</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Uneven spacing<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the downscaling results in a box with uneven spacing, e.g. a rectangle with
width 5 and the label is 2 chars. Due to discrete coordinate space in ASCII renders, some
outputs may look less even than their SVG counterparts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
