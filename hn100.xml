<p>As seen previously, the Joy-Cons will be bigger than on the original Switch and will feature larger shoulder buttons on the inside edges. The system itself has a larger, "more sturdy" stand that can be adjusted to sit at multiple angles. A second USB-C outlet on the top of the system will allow for easier charging and connections.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers announced a number of ports for the Switch 2, including <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter VI, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy </em>(with new Mouse Controls)<em>, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and Hitman: World of Assassination</em>.</p>

<p>FromSoftware also offered an extended preview of a new vampire-themed, <em>Bloodborne</em>-inspired action RPG game called <em>The Duskbloods</em>. The Switch 2 exclusive, planned for 2026, showed off a wide range of metaphyiscal imagery and both melee and gun-based combat, including a character that flies around in a metal suit with a jetpack.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online memberships will carry over to Switch 2. And Switch 2 owners who subscribe to the Expansion Pack will get access to a library of Nintendo GameCube games, including <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX </em>at launch, with more to be added in the future. These games will feature "sharper graphics and higher resolution" than the original releases, Nintendo said. A replica wireless GameCube controller will also be available for purchase by Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>Nintendo also showed a small preview of a new, open-world <i>Kirby Air Riders </i>game. The follow-up to GameCube's <em>Kirby's Air Ride</em> showed the pink puffball grabbing a jetpack-propelled star across verdant, grassy fields.</p>

<p>Nintendo will send out invitations for "priority" purchasing of the Switch 2, direct from the company, starting on May 8. Those who have purchased a Switch Online membership as of April 2, have had it for a minimum of 12 months, have opted to share gameplay data, and have logged at least 50 hours get priority. There will be a 72-hour window in which to use priority purchasing invitations.</p>

    <p><span><strong>People hoping to build muscle with the support of a creatine supplement might be disappointed by new research which shows it has little to no effect when taken at the recommended level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>People who take the popular sports supplement creatine and lift weights do not build muscle any faster than those who do resistance training without the supplement, new research shows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A UNSW-led clinical trial that put 54 people through a 12-week resistance training program found no difference between those who took the supplement at the recommended dose and those who did not, the research published in <i><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/6/1081" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Nutrients" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Nutrients">Nutrients</a></i> shows.</p>
<p>Both groups in the randomised control trial put on an average of two kilograms of lean body mass during the program, which involved three supervised resistance training sessions per week.</p>
<p>“We’ve shown that taking five grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while resistance training,” said senior author <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/mandy-hagstrom" target="_self" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Dr Mandy Hagstrom" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Dr Mandy Hagstrom">Dr Mandy Hagstrom</a>, from UNSW’s <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/medicine-health/our-schools/health-sciences" target="_self" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_School of Health Sciences" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="School of Health Sciences">School of Health Sciences</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The benefits of creatine may have been overestimated in the past, due to methodological problems with previous studies,” she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which supplies energy to muscles. It is produced by the liver, pancreas and kidneys, and found in protein-rich foods. Previous research shows creatine supplements help build muscles, enhance athletic performance, and may even have cognitive benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, previous trials have started supplementation and exercise programs on the same day, making it difficult to separate the effect of each on muscle gains, Dr Hagstrom said. They’ve also overlooked the potential for creatine to cause water retention, though more research was needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>So, in this trial, those in the supplement group started on creatine one week before the exercise program began, taking five grams per day, which is at the upper end of the recommended maintenance dose of three to five grams.</p>
<p>“We had what we call a wash-in phase, where half of the participants started taking the supplement, without changing anything else in their daily life, to give their body a chance to stabilise in terms of its response to the supplement,” Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>The effect of creatine with and without resistance training</h2>
<p>During that first week people taking creatine gained more lean body mass, particularly women, gaining an average of 0.5 kilograms more than the control group. However, the extra gains they made varied greatly, and soon dropped back to match those of the control group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The people taking the creatine supplement saw changes before they even started exercising, which leads us to believe that it wasn’t actual real muscle growth, but potentially fluid retention,” Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Then once they started exercising, they saw no additional benefit from creatine which suggests that five grams per day is not enough if you’re taking it for the purposes of building muscle.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>By comparison, previous trials with no wash-in period found those on creatine gained one kilogram more muscle, than those not taking the supplement, during trials spanning four to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>“In theory then you would have expected our creatine group to put on three kilograms of muscle over the 12-week program, but they didn’t,” said first author <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/imtiaz-desai">Dr Imtiaz Desai</a>, from UNSW’s School of Health Sciences and <a href="https://neura.edu.au/" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)">Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
    <p>The participants, aged 18 to 50, were all relatively healthy people doing less than the recommended minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week.</p>
<div><p>They were put through the same training program and had their measurements taken at multiple stages using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a non-invasive imaging technique that measures bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition. They were also required to keep a food log three days prior to each assessment, which showed no significant differences in their diets.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Those on creatine did bypass a loading phase, which includes taking 20 to 25 grams daily for up to one week. While it is common to start with a loading phase, it can cause gastrointestinal issues and is not necessary to reach saturation levels – the maximum that the body can store at any one time.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <h2><strong>More research needed on creatine doses</strong></h2>
<p>The trial suggests people need to take more creatine than is commonly thought to get the desired benefit of additional muscle gains, the experts say.</p>
<div><p>Just how much more will need to be the subject of further research, but 10 grams could be the dose to test first, given it's already shown to be safe and promising for both brain and bone health, Dr Hagstrom said.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
A longer study would also be beneficial, added Dr Desai, as would measuring body water content, tracking the menstrual cycle – which can affect fluid retention – and creatine absorption, which was not feasible for this trial.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div><p>“It would be really interesting to see if creatine has more of a long-term benefit,” said Dr Desai. “When you start weight training, you have those beginner gains in strength and those start tapering off around the 12-week mark and become slower, so it’s possible the support from creatine might come at a later stage.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
In the meantime, the researchers hope it will give people more realistic expectations on creatine use, and prompt them to question claims made in the marketing of some supplements. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“For your average person taking creatine to boost their gains in the gym, this will hopefully change their perception about what it can help them achieve,” Dr Desai said. “For professional athletes, particularly those who must be at a particular weight for their sport, the findings may inform how and when they take the supplement.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
As for researchers, it’s hoped the study may encourage others to start to use a wash-in phase, to better understand the impact of supplements with and without exercise.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>It’s&nbsp;interesting to me that <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, while still full up of the nostalgia that the 80s lends us, is lately being <a href="http://the-toast.net/2014/09/30/sexual-racial-politics-nerd-culture-dialogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repositioned in the zeitgeist</a>. What was viewed for many years as a bit of harmless fun that waved the banner for nerds everywhere is finally being called out for exactly what it is; an Us vs Them revenge fest that never lets go of racism or misogyny, and damages the image of geek culture more than it applauds for it. That shouldn’t be surprising—<em>RotN</em> was always just a frat house comedy with a thin nerdy gloss applied to it. And that’s fine with me, because that was never my go-to movie for feeling the geeky solidarity.</p>
<p>No, my friends. That movie was <em>Real Genius</em>.</p>

<p><em>Real Genius</em> was loosely (very very <em>very</em> loosely) inspired by actual events that took place when university students were working to&nbsp;crack laser technology. But in <em>Real Genius</em>, this is being done on the fictional Pacific Tech campus, where the students are unknowingly creating that laser for the CIA to use in government sanctioned hits from space. They don’t know this because their odious professor, Dr. Hathaway (played to a tee by William Atherton), obviously isn’t letting them in on the secret. He’s too busy skimming off the funds that the government is providing to the project, so he can renovate his house.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius3.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius3.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Mitch Taylor" width="740" height="314"></a></p>
<p>Our protagonist is fifteen-year-old Mitch Taylor (Gabriel Jarrett), who is accepted early to Pacific Tech because, well, he’s a genius. He’s assigned to the laser project, working with his new roommate Chris Knight (Val Kilmer), a senior at the school who appears to have given up on taking college all that seriously. So… burnt out upper classman plus eager-to-please, impressionable freshman? We’re already set up for some prime Odd Couple shenanigans. We’re introduced to a guy named Kent and his cronies, who are also working on the laser project. Unlike Chris, Kent is the ultimate sycophant and only too happy to throw other students under the bus provided he gets to be top dog. So now we have a rivalry. Mitch meets a lot of strange people at Pacific Tech, one of them being Jordan, one of the campus’ few women who happens to size Mitch up and make him a sweater the day after meeting him, which she excitedly presents to him in men’s room while he’s peeing. So now we have a love story.</p>
<p>And… that’s pretty much where the comparisons to most college flicks and <em>Real Genius</em> ends. Because the film is about a lot more than that, for all it is a very 80s campus comedy. For one, the movie is better at portraying geeks in ways that don’t just melt down to old tropes of pocket protectors and bow ties and awkwardness. It communicates that having an outrageous IQ can be isolating, but doesn’t make all smart people out to be socially undeveloped shut-ins. It also shows us how being driven toward answers can blind even the most optimistic, well-meaning folks into making terrible mistakes. And it communicates what it’s like to study for finals more realistically than any film I’ve ever seen, which is an accomplishment and a half.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius4.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Chris Knight, Val Kilmer" width="740" height="355"></a></p>
<p>No really, there’s a scene where everyone is gathered around a communal table to cram for the exam, and one guy just gets up and starts <em>screaming</em> at everyone before running from the building. Everyone else is unresponsive and some other dude sitting on the room’s perimeter moves into his vacated seat without comment. That’s basically the experience distilled into its purest form.</p>
<p>Also, did I mention that it ends on a Tears For Fears song? Because that should be enough to recommend it right there.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius9.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius9.jpg" alt="Real Genius, 1985" width="740" height="416"></a></p>
<p>Another great thing about this film is how it <em>doesn’t</em> couch itself in the “nerd versus jock” dynamic. It’s a boring cliche that rarely bothers to examine the realities of persecution due to differences. Instead, it herds people into group stereotypes and activity negates character complexity. <em>Real Genius</em> knows this, and most of the rivalry here is geek-on-geek. We watch the very real dynamic of people in the same social circle trying to one-up each other to gain status, stroke their own egos, or flat out cause trouble for fun. When we reach the “party with hot girls” part of the film that so many college movies unthinkingly provide, the narrative beelines away from any form of non-consensual action; the party is full of student beauticians who are keen to meet some boys, and when the guys from Pacific Tech balk at having to talk to them, Chris Knight points out that they might try using their brains to impress them. The most uncomfortable person at the party is not any of the female attendants, but Mitch… understandable because he’s fifteen and this is probably the highest concentration of bikinis he’s ever witnessed. He finally starts having fun when he realizes that Jordan is there, testing scuba equipment in the pool.</p>
<p>The virtually opposing approaches to life that Mitch and Chris represent is the focal point of the tale, the paragon of straight-laced nerd-dom juxtaposed with the free-wheeling, frenetic creativity that Knight gears his mind toward. Mitch is distraught by the fact that a student he’d previously idolized appears to be nothing more than another party-hard slacker who doesn’t seem to care one bit about their work they’re doing. It’s not until later that he finds out this attitude is new; Chris was once just like Mitch, but he relaxed into this new mindset when he followed a man into their dorm room closet. (I swear that’s not a metaphor.) That man—Lazlo Hollyfeld—was a big shot student at Pacific Tech in the decade previous, who went a little out of his mind when he found out that his inventions were being used to harm others. Seeing this, Chris realized that spending his life focused on work for work’s sake was a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius6.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Dr. Hathaway, William Atherton" width="740" height="359"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Knight’s new groove is making it harder for Dr. Hathaway to meet his laser deadline, so the professor decides to spitefully ruin Chris’ life—giving Kent the post-school job he was already promised and flunking him out of the Pacific Tech program, preventing him from graduating. With a little pep talk from Mitch, Chris throws himself back into their project and makes real headway on the laser just to prove Hathaway wrong. It’s only after they deliver it to Hathaway that Lazlo leaves the steam tunnels below their closet and points out that what they created was likely intended for a very specific purpose—to kill people. From space. From that point on, the crew is on the clock to ruin the laser’s presentation for the military and CIA and to get even with Dr. Hathaway for using them. (Also to prank Kent because he kind of deserves it for being a lapdog and generally horrible to Mitch just because the kid is younger and smarter than he is.)</p>
<p>The film makes it a mission to prove that what geeks and geniuses are best at isn’t memorizing math formulas and elements off the periodic table; it’s their ability to be creative and in doing so, change the world around us. The students do get even with Dr. Hathaway, but they do it in an inspired way that essentially harms no one except him—they redirect the laser so it goes off at his home, where they’ve situated a giant ball of unpopped popcorn. <em>Ka-blooey.</em> Essentially, they destroy the thing that Hathaway was siphoning money off of the laser program to gain, his fancy house. It makes the project seem like a bust, effectively ruins Hathaway, and punishes him for being dishonest. As revenge schemes go, it’s a remarkably fair-minded one that’s fun to boot. And it’s not about proving their superiority over another group, but instead about taking back control over what they’ve created.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius5.jpg" alt="Real Genius, popcorn house" width="740" height="356"></a></p>
<p>The film doesn’t showcase as many women as we might hope for (and the Pacific Tech campus is also blindingly white overall, though Chris’ friend Ikagami is present and happily avoids most of your average Asian stereotypes aside from smartness), but the way it treats the majority of those women is impressive, particularly for this era in filmmaking… no doubt largely due to the movie’s female director, Martha Coolidge. There are few instances of pure objectification just for the sake of it in <em>Real Genius</em>; even though the co-ed party shows plenty of girls in swimsuits, the shots that reveal them are often at a distance, never lingering. While Knight is blunt in his sexual overtures to women, the ones he encounters are more than capable of tackling his advances and throwing them back in his face when he’s not up to snuff. His directness gives him no power, which is extremely important because it indicates that not every woman is automatically going to swoon over that kind of come-on. (Which, in turn, suggests that women are real, unique individuals with different preferences.) And when they aren’t interested, Chris is never entitled or angry about it—he simply moves on.</p>
<p>I really can’t talk about women in this film without focusing up on Jordan Cochran. While she does occupy a typically female place in the plot (Mitch’s love interest), her portrayal by Michelle Meyrink is nothing short of revelatory when it comes to broadening the variety of women that we should expect in fiction. To start, Jordan is not a conventionally attractive girl, certainly not in a California/feature film sense. She has a weird haircut and a child-like cadence to her voice, and she’s not particularly fashionable. It’s also entirely possible for this character to read somewhere on the autistic spectrum, though by way of a Hollywoodified lens; she is uncertain of common boundaries (visiting Mitch in the bathroom and being perturbed by his inability to pee in front of her), she has severe insomnia (it’s suggested that she drove her roommate to a nervous breakdown by never ever sleeping), she misunderstands the social cues of others (she frequently assumes the ends of Mitch’s sentences incorrectly), and her idea of what constitutes an everyday activity would hardly pass for your average citizen (Mitch finds her sanding her dorm room floor late one night and she uses the beautician party as an excuse to test a rebreather she designed herself). It’s not the fact that she might be on the spectrum itself that’s remarkable, but the fact that the film never suggests that Jordan should be viewed differently because of it. It doesn’t make her “special” in a manic pixie dream way, but it doesn’t make her pitiable either. She’s simply who she is, and that person is still portrayed as desirable and engaging and brilliant.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius8.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius8.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Jordan Cochran" width="740" height="357"></a></p>
<p>It helps that she’s very much her own kind of genius. Jordan makes most of her own equipment, clearly comfortable with a variety of tools and practical materials. She isn’t involved in the laser project whatsoever—in fact, we’re never told what Jordan is at Pacific Tech to do aside from being some sort of eclectic savant who cares about sled velocity on ice and the smoothness of her floors. She comes off as a kind of mad scientist, probably the sort of person to invent a few hundred incredibly useful patents throughout the course of her life and hopefully retire rich with a giant lab/workshop in her basement where she can create gorgeous metalwork in peace. Prior to <em>Real Genius</em>, Meyrink appeared in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em> as one of the members of Omega Mu, the nerd girl sorority. In that movie, she and her Greek sisters were figures to be laughed at. Here, she is an odd force to be reckoned with. There is simply no comparison; one of these characters is inspirational to young women, and the other is decidedly not. In the end, Jordan’s status as Mitch’s girlfriend has very little to do with her place in the story (outside of letting her meet these characters and form friendships with them), an effective 180 from her position as&nbsp;Gilbert’s&nbsp;love interest&nbsp;in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>. Jordan is a heroic character in <em>Real Genius</em>, whereas Judy is largely a trophy for the (male) hero in <em>RotN</em>.</p>
<p>What’s also impressive about <em>Real Genius</em> is that it allows its focal character, Mitch Taylor, to be as young as he is, with all the embarrassment and strangeness that being fifteen entails. Mitch calls his parents crying because college isn’t working out the way he’d prefer, and he begs to come home. Mitch is cornered alone by an older, more experienced woman who clearly wants to teach him “the ways of the world,” but he runs from the scenario, owning up to his discomfort and knowing that he’d rather be with Jordan.<span>&nbsp; </span>The film never makes fun of Mitch for being less advanced than his peers or a perceived “square,” never sniggers at him for being the straight-laced one who cares about his work. It’s never suggested that he should simply play along, act older, learn to enjoy things that don’t interest him. Chris Knight has to convince him to loosen up by presenting real, hard data on why sticking too hard to the work might hurt him in the long run. And even then, Mitch doesn’t become a mini version of his mentor—he simply takes Knight’s advice to heart and figures out what his own version of relaxed is.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius2.jpg" alt="Real Genius, Mitch Taylor, Chris Knight" width="740" height="317"></a></p>
<p>Rather than placing geeks on someone else’s playground, forcing them into an opposing socially-constructed box and proving that they can “play the game” better than everyone else by virtue of being smarter, <em>Real Genius</em> shows that nerds have their own games. They don’t need to run faster or get more pledges or give themselves makeovers to have fun and prove their worth. Mitch wakes up to a hall full of ice one morning; Ikagami has somehow created a gas that turns into the slippery stuff, and then back into a gas after a few hours. Chris hails the accomplishment as “Pacific Tech’s: Smart People on Ice!” The walls of the dorms are covered in strange graffiti, people shuffle back and forth between common areas and rooms in their weird-looking pajamas and towels. Knight has appointed himself as the dorm resident in charge of fun, trying to get people away from their books with “Mutant Hamster Races” and “Madame Curie Lookalike Contests.” In short, it’s like any other college campus, complete with overworked students. Nerds are not a rare and exotic breed of people, but they do make some awesome stuff, and that’s why they make for good movie plots.</p>
<p>It also helps that <em>Real Genius</em> might be one of the most quotable films on the planet. Even Joss Whedon would cry at how snappy the dialogue is, which is recommendation enough over most college movies where dialogue can be horrifically contrived. Chris Knight is the primary conduit of said snappiness, and you have to wonder how many of Kilmer’s lines are ad-libbed, because it seems like it might be a lot of them. It’s encouraging to have a character who at the start appears to be such a parody of himself—the super-smart-guy-who-can-also-be-a-jerk-because-he’s-good-looking-and-snarky—turn out to be a genuinely decent person who cares about people. And he proves that by changing his tactics with others; when he realizes that Mitch is not responding to devil-may-care antics, he quits the act and explains his reasons for exhibiting rather extreme senioritis. It comes clear very quickly that his primary reason for asking Dr. Hathaway to make Mitch his roommate is to make certain that Mitch doesn’t make his (or Lazlo’s) mistakes. Without realizing that they’re already being lured into the same gambit that snagged Lazlo years ago, Chris is already trying to provide Mitch with the tools he needs to avoid the scenario. He may be a cynic, as he says, but he’s inciting campus rowdiness to protect everyone’s health and expand their horizons, not to encourage them to blow their educations.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://reactormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/real-genius.gif" alt="Real Genius, Chris Knight, why do I bother gif" width="720" height="306"></a></p>
<p>In that way, <em>Real Genius</em> occupies an interesting middle ground in how it portrays education for a film that’s all about brainy, bookish people. It’s not suggesting that going to college should be one long non-stop alcohol-fueled party haze, but it’s also not suggesting that what you learn at a higher education facility is the only valuable knowledge you will ever absorb. Life experience is shown to be equally (or even more) valuable. And while it can be easier to retreat into books when you’re a certain kind of person, the tale&nbsp;cautions that it’s important to&nbsp;stay aware of the world around you–otherwise you might miss when you’re being taken advantage of. For a film that’s already 30 years old, the wisdom it displays is universal; value your emotional development as much as your intellectual development; use your abilities to improve the world; question authority; definitely don’t make dangerous weapons for your college professors.</p>
<p>So you can keep <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>, if that’s your thing, and all the other films of its ilk. They do a fairly poor job of committing the experience of social outsiders to memory. For a film that offers a chance to laugh with people rather than at them, to appreciate what college truly&nbsp;teaches most of us, to embrace what’s really fun about being an unabashed geek, I’d recommend <em>Real Genius</em> every single time.</p>

These acute impacts are more common for people with existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This direct exposure does cost lives, but the total number is relatively small compared to the millions that die from chronic exposure to air pollution.</span></li><li><strong><span>Formation of particulate matter: </span></strong><span>Many of the pollutants we’ll look at contribute to health impacts </span><em><span>indirectly</span></em><span> by breaking down to form secondary smaller particles. These particles are called “particulate matter”. Typically, the smaller the particles are, the worse they can be for human health because they can enter our lungs and airways — and, in some cases, the bloodstream. Particulate matter can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, including cancer, strokes, and heart attacks.</span></li><li><strong><span>Formation of ozone: </span></strong><span>Another </span><em><span>indirect</span></em><span> way these pollutants can affect our health is by forming a gas called ozone (O</span><sub><span>3</span></sub><span>). Ozone can cause breathing problems and worsen acute conditions like asthma and COPD</span><a href="#note-4"><sup><span>4</span></sup></a><span>. However, it also affects our health through chronic exposure by causing inflammation of the lungs, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases, and reducing our cardiovascular health.</span></li></ul><p><span>As we discuss each pollutant, we’ll briefly explain how it affects health through one or several pathways. While it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how many deaths each pollutant causes, wherever possible, we’ll also try to give a rough order of magnitude estimate.</span></p><p><span>To give some sense of scale, </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/global-health?tab=chart&amp;Health+Area=Risk+factors&amp;Indicator=Air+pollution&amp;Metric=Number+of+deaths&amp;Source=IHME&amp;country=OWID_WRL~CHN~ZAF~BRA~USA~GBR~IND~RWA"><span>here</span></a><span> is the Global Burden of Disease’s breakdown of global deaths from air pollution.</span><a href="#note-5"><sup><span>5</span></sup></a></p><p><span>In 2021, this totaled around</span><strong><span> 8 million deaths.</span></strong><span> Note that there are also natural sources of particulate matter, so not </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> of these pollution deaths resulted from human emissions. But most did. For more on this, see our colleague Max Roser’s </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-review-air-pollution-deaths" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>article</span></a><span>, which looks at estimates from various sources.</span></p><p><strong><span>3.1 million</span></strong><span> came from </span><em><span>household</span></em><span> air pollution, a combination of direct toxicity and particulate matter. </span><strong><span>4.7 million</span></strong><span> came from outdoor particulate matter, and another </span><strong><span>half a million</span></strong><span> from outdoor ozone pollution.</span><a href="#note-6"><sup><span>6</span></sup></a></p><div><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source id="grapher-preview-source" srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution.png?imWidth=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution.png?imWidth=1700 1700w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-household-and-outdoor-air-pollution.png" width="850" height="600" loading="lazy" data-no-lightbox="true"></picture></a></figure></div><h2 id="breaking-down-the-sources-of-different-air-pollutants"><span>Breaking down the sources of different air pollutants</span><a href="#breaking-down-the-sources-of-different-air-pollutants"></a></h2><h2 id="sulfur-dioxide-the-source-of-acid-rain"><span>Sulfur dioxide: the source of acid rain</span><a href="#sulfur-dioxide-the-source-of-acid-rain"></a></h2><p><span>Sulfur dioxide (SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span>) is the main pollutant that causes </span><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-end-of-acid-rain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>acid rain</span></a><span>. This has been a major environmental problem because acid rain can change the chemistry of rivers and lakes, affecting fish populations, soils, and the extent and quality of forests. You can also see the effects of acid rain on older limestone and marble buildings and statues, where the acidity dissolves parts of the structure.</span></p><p><span>There are two ways that SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> </span><a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/air-pollution/eow-it-affects-our-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>can threaten</span></a><span> human health. First, direct inhalation of SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> can exacerbate respiratory problems such as asthma and bronchitis. But its main contribution is by breaking down to form small particulate matter. While an exact figure is hard to pin down, given that sulfur dioxide is a substantial contributor to particulate matter and that at least 4 million deaths are linked to these small particles yearly, we would estimate that </span><strong><span>hundreds of thousands</span></strong><span> of deaths per year are linked to SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span>.</span></p><p><span>SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> is formed when we burn fuels that contain sulfur.</span></p><p><span>The charts below show where global emissions come from and how these sectors have changed over time. In 2022, energy production was the biggest contributor by far. This is predominantly due to power from coal, which has sulfur impurities that are released when it’s burned.</span></p><p><span>The main contribution of the industry is the metal smelting process.</span><a href="#note-7"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a><span> This is because many of the ores that are used to produce metals – such as pyrite – contain large amounts of sulfur, which is released when they are roasted at high temperatures.</span></p><p><span>Oil also contains sulfur, which is why road transport, shipping, and aviation all contribute. Shipping emissions have received a lot of attention in the last few years because they </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?country=~OWID_WRL&amp;Pollutant=Sulfur+dioxide&amp;Sector=International+shipping&amp;Per+capita=false"><span>dropped by more than 70%</span></a><span> in 2020 after the introduction of tight regulations on maritime fuels.</span></p><p><span>You’ll notice that global emissions of SO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span> peaked in 1979 and have almost halved since then, thanks to the introduction of pollution controls, particularly in Europe, North America, and China. SO</span><sub><span>2 </span></sub><span>can be removed from smokestacks in coal plants using technologies that filter or “scrub” the sulfur away before it’s emitted into the atmosphere. This, combined with a </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/energy?tab=chart&amp;country=USA~GBR~OWID_EU27&amp;Total+or+Breakdown=Select+a+source&amp;Energy+or+Electricity=Electricity+only&amp;Metric=Share+of+total&amp;Select+a+source=Coal"><span>move away from coal</span></a><span> in Europe and North America, has led to a rapid reduction in emissions.</span><sub><span> </span></sub></p><h2 id="nitrogen-oxides-n-ox-the-reason-car-exhaust-fumes-are-so-damaging"><span>Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ): the reason car exhaust fumes are so damaging</span><a href="#nitrogen-oxides-n-ox-the-reason-car-exhaust-fumes-are-so-damaging"></a></h2><p><span>Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) are a group of gases, mostly made up of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO</span><sub><span>2</span></sub><span>). They are formed when fuels containing nitrogen (again, mostly fossil fuels) are burned, causing them to react with oxygen.</span></p><p><span>Like sulfur dioxide, which we just looked at, NOₓ can cause acid rain, threatening wildlife and ecosystems. NOₓ has a particularly large impact on human health because it acts through all three mechanisms we looked at earlier. It can be acutely toxic, inflaming the lungs. It reacts with other gases to form particulate matter, and it also forms ozone. NOₓ, therefore, causes smog and the thick haze you often see in highly polluted cities.</span></p><p><span>Again, we don’t have exact estimates for how many deaths it contributes to. But, given that it’s a main source of ozone (which kills around half a million) and a substantial fraction of particulate matter (which kills several million), it’s reasonable to expect that NOₓ is linked to </span><strong><span>over a million deaths yearly</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Since coal, oil, and gas all contain nitrogen, NOₓ is produced in various sectors, as the chart below shows. The biggest source is transport — mostly from road vehicles — where NOₓ is emitted from the exhaust of cars and trucks. This is almost matched by the burning of coal and gas for electricity production, shown as “energy” in the chart. Like road transport, burning fuel for shipping emits significant amounts of NOₓ, making it a leading source, too.</span></p><p><span>And industrial processes such as metal smelting, cement production, and petroleum refining contribute a lot.</span></p><p><span>A smaller but still important source is agriculture. When nitrogen is applied to crops as synthetic fertilizer or manure, some of this nitrogen is converted to nitrogen oxides (and ammonia, which we’ll come on to later) in the soil.</span><a href="#note-8"><sup><span>8</span></sup></a><span> While emissions of NOₓ from processes such as transport and electricity production have declined a lot globally, progress on agriculture has been much slower: emissions have flatlined but have not fallen much.</span></p><p><span>Some countries have been successful in drastically reducing emissions of NOₓ – with huge benefits for human health. Moving away from fossil fuels – particularly coal in electricity production – has led to a large decline in “energy” emissions (have a look at </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?time=1950..2022&amp;Pollutant=Nitrogen+oxides&amp;Sector=All+sectors+%28total%29&amp;Per+capita=false&amp;country=~GBR"><span>the United Kingdom</span></a><span> as an example). Setting pollution control standards for automakers has also played a crucial role in reducing emissions from road transport. NOₓ emissions from exhausts can be dramatically reduced through the use of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>catalytic converters</span></a><span>, which are devices that split the NOₓ compounds into nitrogen and oxygen before they are released into the atmosphere.</span></p><h2 id="black-carbon-the-soot-that-fills-our-skies-and-lungs"><span>Black carbon: the soot that fills our skies and lungs</span><a href="#black-carbon-the-soot-that-fills-our-skies-and-lungs"></a></h2><p><span>Black carbon (BC) are the small particles that many of us know as “soot”.</span></p><p><span>As most of us know from experience — such as lighting a bonfire — soot is formed when we burn materials such as wood and biomass or fossil fuels like coal. It’s the </span><em><span>incomplete</span></em><span> combustion of these materials that leads to the formation of these BC particles.</span></p><p><span>These particles are black because they absorb light, and this absorption of sunlight contributes to climate change. However, when it comes to health, it contributes through its direct toxicity and the formation of small particulates.</span></p><p><span>Black carbon can be a major issue for household and outdoor particulate matter and </span><a href="https://drawdown.org/publications/reducing-black-carbon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>probably contributes to</span></a><span> </span><strong><span>several million deaths per year</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the charts below, you can see the sources of black carbon globally.</span></p><p><span>Unsurprisingly, the biggest contributor to BC is energy production, mostly coal and biomass burning for electricity and heat. Black carbon is a big problem in industrialized countries with large-scale electricity production, but also in lower-income countries where people rely on burning biomass and charcoal for cooking and heating.</span></p><p><span>Road transport is another major contributor since black carbon is also formed from diesel engines and exhausts. The open burning of waste also plays a surprisingly large role, particularly in low-to-middle-income countries, where this is often used for waste disposal.</span></p><p><span>Some countries — particularly richer ones — have seen </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?time=1950..2022&amp;Pollutant=Black+carbon&amp;Sector=All+sectors+%28total%29&amp;Per+capita=false&amp;country=GBR~FRA~DEU~USA"><span>a huge drop</span></a><span> in black carbon emissions over the last 50 years due to moving away from biomass and coal burning and introducing cleaner cars.</span></p><h2 id="methane-burping-cows-rice-paddies-and-gas-leaks"><span>Methane: burping cows, rice paddies, and gas leaks</span><a href="#methane-burping-cows-rice-paddies-and-gas-leaks"></a></h2><p><span>Methane (CH</span><sub><span>4</span></sub><span>) is a greenhouse gas, so it’s </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>mostly discussed</span></a><span> regarding contributions to climate change. However, methane can also affect health when it breaks down to form ozone, a gas that’s hazardous to human health. In fact, methane is the biggest precursor to ozone in many places.</span></p><p><span>It’s </span><a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/methane-climate-change-and-air-quality-in-europe-exploring-the-connections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>estimated that</span></a><span> methane can lead to up to </span><strong><span>half a million premature deaths</span></strong><span> a year.</span><a href="#note-9"><sup><span>9</span></sup></a></p><p><span>The charts below show where it comes from.</span></p><p><span>Agriculture, specifically livestock and rice production, is the biggest source of methane. Ruminant livestock — mostly cows — produce methane in their digestive systems and release it into the atmosphere by burping. That’s why beef and lamb </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>tend to have</span></a><span> a high carbon footprint.</span><a href="#note-10"><sup><span>10</span></sup></a><span> Rice also produces methane because it’s often grown in flooded paddy fields with low oxygen levels. This means methane is produced rather than carbon dioxide. Eating less beef, lamb, and dairy could </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>dramatically reduce</span></a><span> emissions from agriculture. Finding innovative ways to reduce the amount of methane produced per cow by changing their diets could also help.</span></p><p><span>Energy generation is another large source of methane. Most of it comes from leaks — which we call “fugitive emissions” — from oil and gas wells. If these are not properly managed, some methane escapes into the atmosphere. Another key source is coal mining. Monitoring oil and gas wells for methane leaks and enforcing regulations to ensure that limits are not breached can reduce these emissions. New drone and satellite technologies are </span><a href="https://www.catf.us/2023/02/guide-monitoring-quantifying-methane-emissions-oil-gas-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>already being developed</span></a><span> to provide a global map of where these leaks are coming from.</span></p><p><span>The third sector that contributes a lot is waste. Methane is produced when organic material — like food waste or paper — rots in conditions without much oxygen (like in a landfill). Securely sealing landfills or capturing this methane for energy can effectively reduce these emissions. Methane from waste has been falling in many richer countries — like </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/air-pollution?time=1990..2022&amp;country=~GBR&amp;Pollutant=Methane&amp;Sector=Waste&amp;Per+capita=false"><span>the United Kingdom</span></a><span> — that have implemented these strategies.</span></p><h2 id="ammonia-nh3-it-s-all-about-farming"><span>Ammonia (NH</span><sub><span>3</span></sub><span>): it’s all about farming</span><a href="#ammonia-nh3-it-s-all-about-farming"></a></h2><p><span>As the chart below shows, nearly all human emissions of ammonia (NH</span><sub><span>3</span></sub><span>) come from agriculture.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>At JangaFX, we make several products that run natively on Linux. We love the flexibility and power that Linux offers our developers, but shipping software on it is a whole different challenge.</p>
<p>Linux is an incredibly powerful platform, but when it comes to shipping software, it can feel like a minefield. Unlike other operating systems, Linux isn’t just one system—it’s a chaotic mix of different services, libraries, and even philosophies. Every distribution does things a little differently, and that means the same executable that works flawlessly on one system might completely break on another.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t even be a problem. The Linux kernel itself has maintained relatively stable system calls. But everything built on top of it changes constantly in ways that break compatibility, making it incredibly frustrating to ship software that "just works." If you’re developing for Linux, you’re not targeting a single platform—you’re navigating an ecosystem that has evolved without much concern for binary compatibility.</p>
<p>Some of us, coming from the game industry before moving into VFX have dealt with this problem before. Shipping games on Linux has always been a nightmare, and the same issues persists regardless of industry. In this article, We're going to explain why we think containers are <strong>the wrong approach</strong>, how we build and ship Linux software in a way that actually works, what we think is responsible for Linux's binary compatibility problem and what needs to change to fix it.</p>
<h4>The latter part of this article will get deeply technical about what exactly the problem is and how it can be fixed.</h4>
<h2>Containers</h2>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>, <a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImage</a>, and similar solutions attempt to simplify shipping executables by creating "containers"—or as as we've recently taken to calling them, <strong>"a Linux Environment inside a Linux"</strong> Using Linux features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">namespaces</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroots</a>, these solutions package an entire Linux environment, complete with all required dependencies, into a single self-contained bundle. In extreme cases, this means shipping an entire Linux user-space just for one application.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges with these containerized solutions is that they
often don’t work well with applications that need to interact with the rest of
the system. To access hardware-accelerated APIs like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)">Vulkan</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU">VDPAU</a> or
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone">CUDA</a>, an application must dynamically
link against the system's graphics driver libraries. Since these libraries exist
outside the container and cannot be shipped with the application, various
"pass-through" techniques have been developed to work around this, some of which
introduce runtime overhead (e.g., shimming libraries). Because containerized applications are isolated from the system, they often <strong>feel</strong> isolated too. This creates consistency issues, where the application may not recognize the user’s name, home directory, system settings, desktop environment preferences, or even have proper access to the filesystem.</p>
<p>To work around these limitations, many containerized environments rely on the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal"><strong>XDG Desktop Portal</strong></a>
protocol, which introduces yet another layer of complexity. This system requires
IPC (inter-process communication) through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus"><strong>DBus</strong></a> just to grant applications
access to basic system features like file selection, opening URLs, or reading
system settings—problems that wouldn’t exist if the application weren’t
artificially sandboxed in the first place.</p>
<p>We don’t believe that piling on more layers is an acceptable solution. As engineers, we need to stop and ask ourselves: "should we keep adding to this tower of Babel?", or is it time to peel back some of these abstractions and reevaluate them? At some point, the right solution isn’t more complexity—it’s less.</p>
<p>While containerized solutions can work under certain conditions, we believe that shipping lean, native executables—without containers—provides a more seamless and integrated experience that better aligns with user expectations.</p>
<h2>Versioning</h2>
<p>When you compile your application, it links against the specific library versions present on the build machine. This means that by default, the versions on a user's system may not match, causing compatibility issues. Let’s assume the user has all the necessary libraries installed, but the versions don’t match what your application was built against. This is where the real problem begins.
Short of shipping the exact machine used to deploy your application, how do you ensure compatibility with the versions installed on a user’s system?</p>
<p>We believe there are two ways to solve this problem, and we've given them our own names:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Replication Approach</strong> – This means bundling all the libraries from the build machine and shipping them with your application. This is the philosophy behind Flatpak and AppImage. We do <strong>not</strong> use this approach at JangaFX.</li>
<li><strong>Relaxation Approach</strong> – Instead of relying on specific or newer library versions, you link against versions that are so old they’re almost guaranteed to be compatible everywhere. This minimizes the risk of incompatibility on a user’s system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first approach works well in cases where the necessary libraries may not exist on a user’s machine, but it fails for libraries that cannot be shipped (we call these "system libraries") The second approach is particularly effective for system libraries and is the approach we use at JangaFX.</p>
<h2>System Libraries</h2>
<p>There are various libraries present on a Linux machine that cannot be shipped because they are system libraries. These are libraries tied to the system itself and cannot be provided in a container. Typically these include things like user-space drivers for the GPU, enterprise installed components for security, and of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">libc</a> itself.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to distribute Linux binaries, you may have encountered an error message like this:</p>
<pre><code>/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.18' not found
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>For those unaware, <strong>glibc</strong> (GNU C Library) provides the C standard library, POSIX APIs, and the dynamic linker responsible for loading shared libraries, and itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GLIBC is an example of a "system library" that cannot be bundled with your
application because it includes the dynamic linker itself. This linker is
responsible for loading other libraries, some of which may also depend on
GLIBC—but not always. Complicating matters further, since GLIBC is a dynamic
library, it must also load itself. This self-referential, chicken-and-egg
problem highlights GLIBC’s complexity and monolithic design, as it attempts to
fulfill multiple roles simultaneously. A large downside to this monolithic
design is that upgrading GLIBC often requires upgrading the entire system. Later in this article, we will
explain why this structure needs to change to truly solve Linux’s binary
compatibility problem.</p>
<p>Before you suggest statically linking GLIBC—<strong>that’s not an option.</strong> GLIBC relies on dynamic linking for features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch">NSS</a> modules, which handle hostname resolution, user authentication, and network configuration, among other dynamically loaded components. Static linking breaks this because it does not include the dynamic linker, which is why GLIBC does not officially support it. Even if you managed to statically link GLIBC—or used an alternative like <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>—your application would be unable to load any dynamic libraries at runtime. Static linking the dynamic linker itself is not possible, for reasons that will be explained later. In short, this would prevent your application from dynamically linking against any system libraries at all.</p>
<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>Since our application relies on many non-system libraries that may not be installed on the user’s system, we need a way to include them. The most straightforward approach is the <strong>Replication Approach</strong>, where we ship these libraries alongside our application. However, this negates the benefits of dynamic linking, such as shared memory usage and system-wide updates. In such cases, statically linking these libraries into the application is a better choice, as it eliminates dependency issues entirely. It also enables additional optimizations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization">LTO</a>, and results in a smaller package by stripping unused components from the included libraries.</p>
<p>Instead, we take a different approach: <strong>statically linking everything we can</strong>. When doing so, special care is needed if a dependency embeds another dependency within its static library. We've encountered static libraries that include object files from other static libraries (e.g., libcurl), but we still need to link them separately. This duplication is conveniently avoided with dynamic libraries, but with static libraries, you may need to extract all object files from the archive and remove the embedded ones manually. Similarly, compiler runtimes like <code>libgcc</code> default to dynamic linking. We recommend using <code>-static-libgcc</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to dealing with system libraries, we use the <strong>Relaxation Approach</strong>. Rather than requiring exact or newer versions of system libraries, we link against versions that are old enough to be nearly universally compatible. This increases the likelihood that the user’s system libraries will work with our application, reducing dependency issues without the need for containerization or bundling system components and shims.</p>
<p>The method we suggest when linking against older system libraries is to obtain a corresponding older Linux environment. You don’t need to install an old Linux version on physical hardware or even set up a full virtual machine. Instead, a <strong>chroot</strong> provides a lightweight, isolated environment within an existing Linux installation, allowing you to build against an older system without the overhead of full virtualization. Ironically, this suggests that containers were the right solution all along—just not at runtime, but at build time.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we use <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debootstrap">debootstrap</a>, an excellent script that creates a minimal Debian installation from scratch. Debian is particularly suited for this approach due to its stability and long-term support for older releases, making it a great choice for ensuring compatibility with older system libraries.</p>
<p>Of course, once you have an older Linux setup, you may find that its binary package toolchains are too outdated to build your software. To address this, we compile a modern LLVM toolchain from source and use it to build both our dependencies and our software. The details of this process are beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Finally, we automate the entire debootstrap process with a Python script, which we've included here for reference.</p>

<h2>Fixing it</h2>
<p>Generally, most applications do not link directly against system libraries, and instead load which ever is present on the user's machine already at runtime. So while these libraries are considered system components, they typically have few system dependencies beyond libc itself. This is what makes libc—specifically <strong>GLIBC</strong>—the real source of compatibility issues, it's essentially the only system component directly linked against.</p>
<p>In just the past two years, our team has encountered three separate <strong>GLIBC-specific</strong> compatibility issues, each directly impacting our products:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29456">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29456</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32653">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32653</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32786">https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32786</a></li>
</ol>
<p>From our perspective, the core issue with <strong>GLIBC</strong> is that it tries to do far too much. It’s a massive, monolithic system that handles everything—from system calls and memory management to threading and even the dynamic linker. This tight coupling is why upgrading <strong>GLIBC</strong> often means upgrading the entire system; everything is intertwined. If it were broken into smaller, more focused components, users could update only the parts that change, rather than dragging their whole system along with it.</p>
<p>More importantly, separating the dynamic linker from the <strong>C library</strong> itself would allow multiple versions of <strong>libc</strong> to coexist, eliminating a major source of compatibility issues. This is exactly how <strong>Windows</strong> handles it, which is one of the reasons Windows maintains such strong binary compatibility. You can still run decades-old Windows software today because Microsoft doesn’t force everything to be tied to a single, ever-changing libc.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t as simple as just splitting things apart. GLIBC has deep cross-cutting concerns, particularly with threading, TLS (Thread-Local Storage), and global memory management.</p>
<p>For example, even if you managed to get two versions of GLIBC to coexist, returning allocated memory from one and attempting to free it in another would likely lead to serious issues. Their heaps would be unaware of each other, potentially using different allocation strategies, causing unpredictable failures. To avoid this, even the heap would likely need to be separated into its own dedicated <strong>libheap</strong>.</p>
<p>We think a better approach would be breaking GLIBC into distinct libraries, something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>libsyscall</strong> – Handles making system calls and nothing else. This is
provided as a static library only. Used by <code>libheap</code>, <code>libthread</code> and <code>libc</code> to gain access to shared system call code. Since it's static it's embedded in all three. You can pretend this library otherwise does not exist.</li>
<li><strong>libdl (Dynamic Linker)</strong> – A standalone linker that loads shared libraries.
Links only against <code>libsyscall</code> statically. Is a true, free-standing library, depending on nothing. Provided as both a static and dynamic library. When you link against it statically you can still load things with it dynamically. You just end up with a dynamic linker inside your executable.</li>
<li><strong>libheap</strong> - The single heap shared by all below. Links against <code>libsyscall</code>
statically. Provided only as a dynamic library. Cannot ever be linked against statically.</li>
<li><strong>libthread</strong> – Deals with threading and TLS, links against
<code>libheap</code>. Provided only as a dynamic library. Cannot ever be linked against statically.</li>
<li><strong>libc</strong> – Links against <code>libthread</code>, and thus <code>libheap</code>, and <code>libdl</code> transitively. Provided as both a static and dynamic library. When linking statically it links <code>libdl</code> statically. The linking of <code>libthread</code> and <code>libheap</code> is always done dynamically though through the included <code>libdl</code> if linked statically or through <code>libdl</code> program loader if linked dynamically.</li>
</ul>
<p>These libraries would be aware of each other and allow multiple versions to
coexist in the same address space. That way, we don’t end up with this brittle
mess where upgrading GLIBC can break everything. The actual structure would look
something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This architecture is quite similar to Windows, where the equivalents of
<code>libsyscall</code>, <code>libdl</code>, <code>libheap</code>, and <code>libthread</code> are all bundled within a single
<code>kernel32.dll</code>. This DLL is pre-mapped and automatically loaded into the
address space of every executable on Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Statically Linked <code>libc</code></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Application statically links <code>libc</code> and <code>libdl</code> (it is not the program loader).</li>
<li>Application starts execution and dynamically loads <code>libheap</code> and <code>libthread</code> using embedded <code>libdl</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This architecture effectively reduces the binary compatibility problem to two key <strong>system libraries</strong>: <code>libheap</code> and <code>libthread</code>. These cannot be statically linked because they manage shared resources critical to the entire system.</p>
<p>The reason is straightforward—heap memory must be shared across all components, ensuring compatibility between allocations and deallocations. Similarly, TLS and threading require a unified system-wide approach, as they involve complex initialization and finalization logic, particularly for global constructors and destructors. However, these components are relatively small and stable, meaning they undergo fewer changes that would necessitate version updates.</p>
<h2>Questioning it</h2>
<p>This is, of course, a non-trivial amount of rearchitecting, which naturally raises the question: why is libc implemented the way it is instead of this alternative approach?</p>
<p>Setting historical reasons aside, attempting to solve this problem quickly
becomes difficult the moment you start writing any code using libc. Here is a trivial example of the issues that arise when trying to support multiple
versions of libc.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a dynamic library that contains the following C code.</p>
<pre><p><code><span>#</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>FILE</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>open_thing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fopen</span><span>(</span><span>"thing.bin"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"r"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></p></pre>
<p>And your application links against this library and calls <code>open_thing</code>. Your application would be responsible for calling <code>fclose</code> on the returned <code>FILE*</code>. If your code links against a different version of libc from the version the library links against, then it would be calling the wrong implementation of <code>fclose</code>!</p>
<p>Suppose though, that libc was written in such a way that the <code>FILE*</code> returned always required a version field or a pointer to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">vtable</a> containing the implementation of <code>fclose</code> (and other functions) and every version of libc agreed on this so that it could always call the correct one across this ABI boundary. This would solve this compatibility issue, but now lets say your code calls <code>fflush</code>.</p>
<pre><p><code><span>// Defined in header &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>fflush</span><span>(</span><span>FILE </span><span>*</span><span>fp</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></p></pre>
<p>Except it doesn't flush the file, and instead passes <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<pre><p><code><span>fflush</span><span>(</span><span>NULL</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></p></pre>
<p>If you're not familiar with C's <code>fflush</code> function, passing <code>NULL</code> to it requires flushing all open files (every <code>FILE*</code>). However, in this scenario, it would only flush files seen by the libc version your application is linked against, not those opened by other libc versions (such as the one used by <code>open_thing</code>).</p>
<p>To handle this correctly, each libc version would need a way to enumerate files across all other libc instances, including dynamically loaded ones, ensuring that every file is visited exactly once without forming cycles. This enumeration must also be thread-safe. Additionally, while enumeration is in progress, another libc could be dynamically loaded (e.g., via <code>dlopen</code>) on a separate thread, or a new file could be opened (e.g., a global constructor in a dynamically loaded library calling <code>fopen</code>).</p>
<p>This global list of things owned by libc shows up in multiple places. Take for instance:</p>
<pre><p><code><span>// Defined in header &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>atexit</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></p></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Registers the function pointed to by <em>func</em> to be called on normal program termination (via <code>exit()</code> or returning from <code>main()</code>). The functions will be called in reverse order they were registered, i.e. the function registered last will be executed first.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also another variant of this called <code>at_quick_exit</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that somewhere within libc, there must be a list of functions registered via <code>atexit</code> that need to be executed in reverse order. For multiple libc implementations to coexist, any system handling <code>atexit</code> must not only enumerate and call all registered functions, but also establish a total order for how they were inserted across all instances of libc.</p>
<p>Essentially, any resource owned by one libc would need to be sharable and accessible from any other version of libc. This turns out to be quite a lot of things. For the sake of our argument we've actually gone through all of the standard C (not POSIX) functions which produce or operate on a resource which has an opaque implementation where careful considerations would need to be made.</p>

<p>Most defines (of constants), ABI-exposed types (and typedefs) should just be stable across libc implementations for this to work reliably. Since these are baked into executables there's no real way to modify or change them without breaking stuff anyways. When discussing stuff that is opaque (listed as <code>Any opaque method</code>) we propose affixing a pointer to a vtable containing the implementation as the first value in the type, this way functions operating on it can always recover the correct implementation and dispatch it indirectly through the vtable. Other methods like using a version field can also work here too.</p>
<p>Regardless, certain aspects of libc introduce complexity, particularly global and thread-local elements like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errno.h">errno</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)">locale</a>. However, with a well-designed architecture, these challenges can be effectively addressed.</p>
<p>Memory allocation functions—<code>calloc</code>, <code>malloc</code>, <code>aligned_alloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>, and <code>free</code>—from <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> pose another difficulty. Since they can return any pointer, tracking them is non-trivial. One possible approach is to store a pointer to a vtable in the allocation header, allowing each allocation to reference its implementation. However, this method incurs significant performance and memory overhead. Instead, we propose centralizing heap management in a dedicated <code>libheap</code>. This would also contain implementation of the POSIX extensions like <code>posix_memalign</code>.</p>
<p>Things get even more interesting when moving from standard C to POSIX, which introduces unique challenges that require libc support. Some of these functionalities might be better split into separate libraries (for example, why is the DNS resolver in libc?). Among these challenges though, <code>setxid</code> stands out.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, permissions in POSIX—such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier">real, effective, and saved user/group IDs</a>—apply at the process level. However, Linux treats threads as independent processes that share memory, meaning these permissions are managed per thread rather than per process. To comply with POSIX semantics, libc must interrupt every thread, forcing them to execute code that invokes the system call to modify their thread-local permissions. This must be done atomically, without failure, and while remaining <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal-safety.7.html">async-signal safe</a>. This is a nightmare to implement and has proven to be <a href="https://ewontfix.com/17/">a major challenge</a>. More importantly, getting it right is crucial for security.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this means libc must track every thread and provide a way to synchronously execute code across all threads. To address this, we propose consolidating threading, TLS, and the necessary POSIX compliance mechanisms within a single <code>libthread</code>.</p>
<p>There are many additional complexities we’ve glossed over and many alternative ways this can be implemented. The key takeaway is that these issues are solvable—they just require significant architectural changes. This necessitates reevaluating this aspect of the Linux userspace from the ground up with binary compatibility as a core design principle. GLIBC has never seriously attempted this. Until someone decides, "enough is enough, let’s fix this," binary compatibility on Linux will remain an unsolved problem; we strongly believe this is a problem worth solving.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Douglas Coupland’s novel <em>Microserfs</em> is about the spiritual yearnings and time-frittering activities of youngish coders immersed in the drudgery of the software-development process, and how those activities become an expression of those yearnings. It was published 20&nbsp;years ago this month, which as far as I’m aware makes it the earliest significant stab by a fiction writer at the Great North American Tech-Company/Start-up Novel. It predates Po Bronson’s <em>The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest</em>, Thomas Pynchon’s <em>Bleeding Edge</em>, Dave Eggers’s&nbsp;<em>The Circle</em>, numerous other neuroman-à-clefs, score-settling pseudomemoirs and murder-dot-com whodunits,<span data-footnote-id="1" data-footnote-url="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not to mention the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Mr. Show&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; sketch about billionaire &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://youtu.be/e5i6BHBuqxE&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;#8220;Grass Valley Greg&amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and his GV Corporation (&amp;#8220;Where ideas can hang out &amp;#8212; and do whatever!&amp;#8221;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></span> as well as tech-sector TV shows like <em>Silicon Valley </em>and <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, serials that pick up where the novels leave off.</p>
<p>Coupland’s evocation of the inner lives of programmers turning entrepreneur in mid-’90s Redmond and Palo Alto should, in theory, enjoy the reputational equivalent of what marketers call first-mover advantage. But I’m not sure it does. Nobody’s talked about it much in the last two decades. Coupland’s most famous book is still his first one, which named a generation (or two) and made Coupland (b. 1961) the most visible and visibly reluctant spokesman for his peer group pre–Kurt Cobain. <a href="http://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/u-snags-rights-to-microserfs-1117435264/" target="_blank">Universal Pictures bought</a> the film rights to <em>Microserfs</em> two years after it was published, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1826756/" target="_blank">IMDb insists</a> a low-budget movie did get made in 2011, but there’s no trace of it elsewhere on the Internet.<span data-footnote-id="2" data-footnote-url="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve seen it or know how to, get in touch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></span> Nor did it become a Fox TV show, despite a mention in <em><a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/coupland.html" target="_blank">Wired</a></em> that one was in the works. Maybe the overall bagginess of the book’s epistolary narrative stymied potential screenwriters; maybe adapting a book whose first and arguably most important section is about the office culture of a nonfictional household-name software company then run by one of the richest men in America presented insurmountable legal challenges. Had the TV show taken place among the cubicles of “GloboCom” and featured characters speaking in reverent tones of their omniscient CEO “Gil Yates,” something would probably have been lost. As it stands, the only extant <em>Microserfs </em>adaptation I know of is the abridged audiobook, read by <em>Friends </em>star (and soon-to-be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGYcNcFhctc" target="_blank">Windows 95 shill</a>) Matthew Perry. I have it on cassette tape; it is maybe the most ’90s object I have ever owned, a curio as totemic as a lock of Alanis Morissette’s hair preserved in a flannel-swaddled vial of Crystal Pepsi.</p>
<p><em>Microserfs </em>is written as a series of entries from the PowerBook journal of a 26-year-old named Daniel, who when the story begins is making $26,000 a year as a “bug checker” in Building Seven<span data-footnote-id="3" data-footnote-url="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In real life there is no Building Seven at Microsoft; legend has it this doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop people from hazing new arrivals to the company by instructing them to report there for urgent meetings. It&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8220;swimming pool on the roof&amp;#8221; of Microsoft.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></span> of Microsoft’s Redmond campus, living in a $235-a-month group house with other Microsoft employees, and dealing with anxieties professional and existential<strong>:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>[F]ear of not producing enough; fear of not finding a little white-with-red-printing stock option envelope in the pigeonhole; fear of losing the sensation of actually making something anymore; fear about the slow erosion of perks within the company; fear that the growth years will never return again; fear that the bottom line is the only thing that really drives the process; fear of disposability…</p></blockquote>
<p>He has trouble sleeping and maintaining relationships and struggles with a sense of alienation from the physical world. “I feel like my body is a station wagon in which I drive my brain around,” he writes, “like a suburban mother taking the kids to hockey practice.” There’s a case to be made that this — the disconnect between the mental and the physical as experienced by members of a caste of golden-handcuffed knowledge workers, and the possibility of greater harmony between car and driver, consciousness-wise — is the book’s real subject, rather than Microsoft or “tech” or start-up-house life. When Daniel and most of his housemates leave Washington and Microsoft for Silicon Valley to work on a Next Big Thing hatched by their programming-genius coworker Michael, the move precipitates a kind of spring thaw within the crew. Everyone renegotiates their relationship with their body in one way or another: characters take up shiatsu massage, come out of the closet, come to grips with childhood eating disorders, dress experimentally, grow their hair out, fuck and procreate, and work up the courage to meet their Net-chat crushes offline. The post-corporate work environment becomes a context in which these former brains-in-a-jar learn to feel the sun on their skin again — while building a revolutionary new software application called Oop!, which allows users to do object-oriented programming by manipulating Lego-like bricks and seems to anticipate Minecraft more than a little bit.</p>
<p><em>Microserfs</em> was fiction grounded in embedded reporting; it began its life as a magazine story for <em>Wired</em>. More than one outlet had offered to send Coupland to Redmond, ostensibly to write about its burgeoning population of Gen-X-aged techies. “They really just wanted me to spy on Bill Gates and write about that,” <a href="http://www.altx.com/int2/douglas.coupland.html" target="_blank">Coupland told an interviewer</a> in 1994. “I said that I wouldn’t do it … I got <em>Wired</em> and John Battelle to write it into the contract that I was to write a piece about Microsoft and not Bill Gates.” Speaking to the <em>New York Times</em> that same year, he described his sojourn among the code-monkeys as “a ‘Gorillas in the Mist’ kind of observation. What do they put in their glove compartments? What snack foods do they eat? What posters are on their bedroom walls?” <em>Wired</em> ran Coupland’s first Microsoft piece — which would become the opening chapter of the novel — in its January 1994 issue. Coupland himself appears on the cover, fronting a quintet of serious-faced men and women presumably representing Generation Microsoft. He’s wearing a yellow spandex cycling shirt and a few days’ worth of stubble and looks a little like a bike messenger who’s been asked to stand in for a celebrity. The background is blue sky and everyone’s looking off into the middle distance; it’s like a Leninist Sears portrait.</p>

<p>The story inside presents Coupland’s anthropological notes on young Microsoft, right down to the snack-food question — when Michael suffers a professional setback and sequesters himself in his office on page two, Daniel and his gym-rat coworker Todd procure flat food (Kraft Singles, fruit leather) to slide under his door. The ironic thing about the story is that while it’s not the de facto Gates profile Coupland felt other magazines pressuring him to do, it’s certainly <em>about </em>Bill Gates, in that it’s about Microsoft employees for whom the boss is a kind of holy ghost. One of the <em>faux</em><span>–</span>Barbara Kruger–isms punctuating the hardcover of Coupland’s previous book, <em>Life After God</em>, was, “You are the first generation to be raised without religion”; in <em>Microserfs</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>those unused belief-muscles find purpose again through faith in Bill. Here’s Daniel, stopping between buildings to consider the mist above the company soccer field: “I had this weird feeling — of how the presence of Bill floats about the Campus, semi-visible, at all times, kind of like the dead grandfather in the <em>Family Circus</em> cartoons. Bill is a moral force, a spectral force, a force that shapes, a force that molds. A force with thick, thick glasses.”</p>
<p>One reason why <em>Microserfs </em>is a strange read that feels epochs and not just decades old today is that its vision of Gates has been superseded in the culture at least twice — first by the image of Gates as a <a href="http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Hank_Scorpio" target="_blank">Hank Scorpio</a>–esque corporate shark that emerged from the Senate hearings into the Microsoft–Department of Justice antitrust settlement&nbsp;in the early ’00s, then by Gates’s rebirth as benevolent mega-philanthropist, underwriter of NPR programming, and provider of clean water to the developing world. Another reason is timing. The novel was published in 1995, but Coupland did his reporting (several weeks at Microsoft, and later several more in the Bay Area tech-start-up scene) in 1993 and 1994. Rather than an on-the-ground account of the first tech boom, then, <em>Microserfs</em> is&nbsp;an inadvertent time capsule of the moment just <em>before</em> the explosive growth of the consumer-facing Internet transformed society’s relationship to technology.</p>
<p>In that sense, the story and the subsequent book are thematically consistent with the earliest issues of <em>Wired</em>, which are notable both for their blue-sky, smart-drink futurism and for what they don’t see coming. The magazine was a year old when the <em>Microserfs</em> cover story ran; the <a href="http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/net_surf.html" target="_blank">“Net Surf” column</a> in that same issue makes note of the growing popularity of something called the “World Wide Web.” It’s described as “a distributed system that presents the user with documents full of hypermedia links to other documents or information systems. Selecting one of these links, the user can then access more information about a particular topic.” Reading an explanation like this in 2015 is not unlike reading the Wikipedia description for water, “a transparent fluid which forms the world’s streams, lakes, oceans and rain, and is the major constituent of the fluids of living things”; the fact that the Web needed describing at all tells you something about the extent to which the future was still being negotiated as Coupland researched and wrote this book. In the old Net Surf columns, the future you’re living in by reading this article on your computer or phone glimmers on the horizon, but long-dead jargon words like <em>finger </em>and <em>telnet</em> and <em>point your gopher </em>are still in everyday use; in <em>Microserfs</em>, Daniel dismisses the whole concept of the “information superhighway” as a manufactured trend. “This highway — is it a joke? You hear so much about it, but really, what <em>is </em>it … The media has gone berserk with Net-this and Net-that. It’s a bit much. The Net is cool, but not <em>that cool.</em>”</p>
<p><em>Microserfs </em>hit stores in 1995, which turned out to be a pretty big year for Net-this and Net-that. Yahoo, Amazon, and Craigslist were founded; Javascript, the MP3 compression standard, cost-per-click and cost-per-impression advertising, the first “wiki” site, and the Internet Explorer browser were introduced. Netscape went public; Bill Gates wrote the infamous <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/07/internet-tidal-wave.html" target="_blank">“Internet Tidal Wave” memo</a> to Microsoft executives, proclaiming in the course of 5,000-plus words that the Internet was “the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981.” Meanwhile, at any time between May and September, you could walk into a multiplex not yet driven out of business by Netflix and watch a futuristic thriller like <em>Hackers </em>or <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em> or <em>Virtuosity</em> or <em>The Net</em>, movies that capitalized on the culture’s tech obsession as if it were a dance craze, spinning (mostly absurd) visions of the (invariably sinister) ways technology would soon pervade our lives. <em>Microserfs</em> isn’t as hysterical as those movies, and its vision of the coming world is much brighter, but in its own way it’s just as wrongheaded and nailed-to-its-context.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png" alt="microserfs-2" width="379" height="583" srcset="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png 460w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png?resize=450,693 450w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png?resize=300,462 300w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png?resize=190,292 190w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png?resize=160,246 160w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png?resize=326,502 326w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/microserfs-2.png?resize=236,363 236w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px"></p>
<p>“What is the search for the next great compelling application,” Daniel asks at one point, “but a search for the human identity?” <em>Microserfs</em> argues that the entrepreneurial fantasy of ditching a big corporation to work at a cool start-up with your friends can actually be part of that search — that there’s a way to reinvent work in your own image and according to your own values, that you can find the same transcendence within the sphere of commerce that the slackers in Coupland’s own<em> Generation X</em><span data-footnote-id="4" data-footnote-url="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And all manner of questing-young-person novels before it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></span>&nbsp;eschewed McJobs in order to chase. The notion that cutting the corporate cord to work for a start-up often just means busting out of a cubicle in order to shackle oneself to a laptop in a slightly funkier room goes unexamined; the possibility that work within a capitalist system, no matter how creative and freeform and unlike what your parents did, might be fundamentally incompatible with self-actualization and spiritual fulfillment is not on the table.</p>
<p>This, to paraphrase <em>Portlandia</em>, is one of the dreams of the ’90s — that our work selves and our true natures could be one and the same. 1995 also marked the debut of <em>Fast Company</em> magazine, <a href="http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/pics/slideshows/FAST-COMPANY-NOV-95-ISSUE-1.jpg" target="_blank">whose first issue shouted “WORK IS PERSONAL”</a>&nbsp;in type as big and bold as the publication’s name. Inside that first issue, ideas about boom-time productivity and hipness and the search for meaning hung out and did whatever.</p>
<p>“As far as I’m concerned, having to change your life when you arrive at work each morning is tantamount to slavery,” <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/26491/killer-results-without-killing-yourself" target="_blank">says</a> the head of an Intel microprocessor fabrication plant, who adjusted&nbsp;his hard-charging management style after suffering a heart attack at 36. (“To this day he visits cardiac units every six months,” we’re told, “‘just to look at the gray faces and remember.’”) Kathy Ryan, then AOL’s “Vice President of Cool,” <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/26304/vp-cool" target="_blank">explains her title</a>: “Often you’ll see it spelled k-e-w-e-l. It’s used when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, when interesting graphics, low prices, innovative concepts, and interactivity all come together. That’s kewel.” She then names a bunch of kewel websites that no one will ever hear of again. The only vision of the future of work that doesn’t sound like a New Economy opium dream comes courtesy of Hatim Tyabji, then the CEO of VeriFone, who answers a question about his demanding and (back then) unusually email-driven management style <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/26371/verifone-its-dogs-life-and-they-love-it" target="_blank">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All I can say is that every person has to come to terms with himself or herself in the context of this new environment. Let’s say it’s Sunday, and you’re at home. You walk past the den or bedroom, wherever your computer is. Are VeriFone people more likely than other people to log on? Absolutely. Am I expecting that? To some extent, yes. But I’m not demanding that. You have to decide … Now the reality is, if you are a global company, you can’t say ‘It’s Sunday in the United States so I’m not going to think about work.’ If it’s Sunday here, it’s Monday in Australia, and people there may need you. So it’s a never-ending cycle. I make no bones about that.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are all more like VeriFone people than we used to be. Mobile-device commercials appropriate the rhetoric of freedom to sell us the devices that will enable our jobs to reach into our lives at any moment, long after we’ve left the office, for the day or for life. More often than not, WORK IS PERSONAL not because we’ve turned it into a space where we can be our best selves&nbsp;but because it bleeds into and colonizes the part of the day we’re supposed to spend living and loving and finding ourselves. <em>Microserfs </em>isn’t without cynicism about Silicon Valley and the new paradigms that were being birthed there circa 1993-94. “I suppose,” Daniel says, “that this is the birthplace of the new postindustrial economy here amid the ghosts of apricot orchards, spinach farms and horse ranches … Here, where sexy new technologies are being blueprinted, CAD’ed, engineered, imagineered and modeled — post-machines making countless millions of people obsolete overnight.”</p>
<p>From across a cultural divide, the nerds from Redmond regard the breezily profligate supernerds of Palo Alto with a mix of envy and horror: “They’re immune to money. They just sort of assume it’ll appear like rain.” With Steve Jobs in exile and the Web’s billionaire boys’ club still a few years away, the Valley in the book is “a bland anarchy,” a kingdom “with a thousand princes but no kings.” A few of those princes, of course, will grow up. They’ll disrupt industries for disruption’s sake, tank the economy at least once, vigorously defend their right to treat employees like contractors, and turn a new generation of coder-dreamers into serfs. Coupland’s characters can’t conceive of any of this yet. Capitalism still seems like it can be saved from within; no matter how much it takes over your life, work never seems like <em>work</em> in the traditional sense, as long as there’s a trampoline in the backyard that you can jump on while thinking about God. And that, to coin a phrase, is how they get you.</p>
<p>Nowadays, of course, serious thinkers addressing tech culture and its promises of innovation/liberation are expected to wear their suspicion like a sidearm. Adapting Ben Mezrich’s nonfiction book <em>The Accidental Billionaires </em>for the screen as <em>The Social Network</em>, Aaron Sorkin looked at Facebook and saw junior Jacobins preparing to guillotine their social and intellectual betters. The movie is close to perfect as cinema and deeply suspect as commentary. It’s too busy judging Mark Zuckerberg and his motives to reflect on the real spiritual consequences of rampant technologization. Sorkin’s gravestone as a thinking person will have HE READ THE COMMENTS engraved on it; aggrieved by the existence of an Internet where anyone, no matter how uninformed, can just go online and say bad things about Aaron Sorkin, he turns Zuckerberg’s invention of Facebook into the vengeance of a lovelorn loser. In the movie’s last scene, Jesse Eisenberg’s Zuckerberg hits refresh in vain on the friend request that Rooney Mara’s Erica won’t accept, while the soundtrack sticks the Beatles’ “Baby You’re a Rich Man” in his guts like a shiv. The moment reads two ways. Either it’s about Zuckerberg, for all his billions, being Just Like Us — a slave to the same digital toy to which we’ve subcontracted management of our memories, our personal interactions, and our sense of self-worth — or it’s about how Facebook, born of Zuckerberg’s sense of exclusion, has made us just like him. The notion that the tech visionaries whose inventions colonize our daily lives are actually uploading the virus of their personalities to the global unconscious is an idea that floats through <em>The Social Network</em>; it’s the engine that powers Alex Gibney’s forthcoming documentary <em>Steve&nbsp;Jobs: The Man in the Machine</em>, which stops just short of postulating that every iPhone includes a fragment of poor angry uncharitable emotionally stunted Steve’s immortal soul, like a sliver of wormwood from Mordor.</p>

<p>Even Coupland would never be this credulous again about the tech sector and its promises; nothing he’s written since could be mistaken for propaganda. He undertook a grueling book tour for <em>Microserfs </em>that left him exhausted and suffering from depression, and his fiction in the ensuing years went to a pretty apocalyptic and Ballardian place. He even took a hammer to his own back catalogue in 2006’s <em>JPod</em>, a bearded-Spock reimagining of <em>Microserfs </em>set at a video-game company, with side trips via human trafficking to the industrial wastes of China, where one character acquires a heroin habit after a stint in a bootleg-Nike factory. When another character mentions Coupland’s name, someone groans, “<em>That</em> asshole.” Coupland himself shows up later in the book as a cynical and foul-mouthed would-be entrepreneur angling to poach programmers for a weather-prediction start-up. It’s a guilty meta-meltdown, the closest thing to a <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118954/" target="_blank">Deconstructing Harry</a> </em>or <em>Yeezus</em> in Coupland’s bibliography. <em>JPod </em>is a tech-culture story informed by a decade of evidence that the tech revolution has disproportionately benefited terrible people while doing nothing in particular for our evolution as a species into beings of pure light.</p>

<p>Mike Judge’s <em>Silicon Valley</em>, which just wrapped its second season on HBO this week, turns that dispiriting reality into the premise for a sitcom. Judge made his way to the real Silicon Valley after graduating from UC San Diego with a physics degree in 1985. He got a tester-engineer job at an interface-card company in Sunnyvale, called in sick on many a Monday, and quit after two and a half months to play upright bass in a blues band. Eventually he discovered animation, and went on to create <em>Beavis and Butt-Head </em>and <em>King of the Hill</em>. But he also wrote and directed 1999’s <em>Office Space</em>, about white-collar drones toiling in the kind of soul-desiccating corporate cubicle-warren from which the Internet was supposed to liberate us. One of the dark truths underlying <em>Silicon Valley </em>is that on some level workers might have had it easier under the Bill Lumberghs of the world; better a boss who asks you to come in on weekends to fill out TPS reports than a job that annihilates the idea of weekends entirely.</p>
<p>Our hero, if that’s the right word here, is Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch), a socially awkward and flop-sweaty programmer at the Google-esque software giant Hooli. Richard almost always wears a hoodie and a look of skin-crawling embarrassment; he’s the kind of gamma male to whom even Mark Zuckerberg might have administered atomic wedgies. And that’s the joke: No matter how much it still thinks of itself as the Wild West, the Valley is now an entrenched and hierarchical culture, in which power accrues to anyone willing to do the necessary bullying. Richard lives and works at a start-up incubator run by Erlich Bachman, played by T.J. Miller, who expertly conjures both Val Kilmer in <em>Real Genius </em>and Garfield sniffing for lasagna, underlining each gem of highly suspect entrepreneurial wisdom with contrails of pot smoke. Richard’s not a visionary; the project he’s incubating at Erlich’s place is a music-player app that even Erlich can’t see the point of, until someone else looks at Richard’s code and realizes he’s accidentally created a potentially revolutionary new data-compression algorithm. When he chooses to start his own company, Pied Piper, and develop the algorithm with funding from a venture capitalist (the late Christopher Evan Welch) instead of taking a $10 million buyout from his hard-charging Hooli boss, Gavin Belson, he becomes a CEO overnight, and realizes almost as quickly that the job comes with requirements he’s not equipped to handle. “If you’re not an asshole,” Erlich tells him, “it creates this kind of asshole vacuum, and that void is filled by other assholes.” The tech sector is no longer a space in which you can be your best self — it’s a space that demands your worst, and Richard has spent the rest of the series fighting that reality, usually in vain.</p>
<p>Two seasons in, <em>Silicon Valley </em>is a good show but not yet a great one. The pacing is awkward, as if the actors are leaving room after each zinger for a laugh track we can’t hear. The cameos by real-life Valley royalty (Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, tech journalists Kara Swisher and Walter Mossberg, Google’s Eric Schmidt) are as winkingly self-serving as <em>Entourage</em>’s famous-actor walk-ons always were, and add just as little in the way of verisimilitude — plus actors, unlike billionaires, can usually act. We get more than enough reality from the opening credits, which depict the Valley as an ever-changing SimCity-as-Westeros circuit board of animated tech-company logos signifying fortunes in perpetual flux. Napster is a balloon that inflates and collapses; Yahoo’s logo is elbowed into a subordinate position by Alibaba’s; Facebook’s logo just gets bigger. The show is as cynical about tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as its Sunday-night lead-out <em><a href="https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/power-steering-hbos-satiric-double-shot-of-veep-and-silicon-valley/" target="_blank">Veep</a> </em>is about Washington.<span data-footnote-id="5" data-footnote-url="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The big difference between the two shows is that Armando Iannucci&amp;#8217;s critique of the precise mix of ineptitude and calculation found in successful political operators still feels rooted in a conviction that government actually matters; Judge begins with the premise that all work is for suckers and finds evidence to support it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></span> There’s a discussion about whether a crappy piece of software is “Apple Maps bad, or just Zune bad”; VCs in a pitch meeting calmly explore the possibility that a new playground-finder app for parents might also have “pedophile-facing” implications.</p>

<p>The other residents of Erlich’s incubator become Pied Piper’s first employees, including Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) and Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani), who communicate through scatological insults and references to jerking off. “Our corporate culture is that we don’t have a corporate culture,” Erlich says, not unproudly. The dude-clubhouse sets are an achievement in production design; when you look at them, you can practically smell the energy-drink burps and the trash can that everyone has decided is someone else’s problem. We’re meant to root for these guys against Hooli the way we rooted for the Deltas against the Omegas in <em>Animal House</em>; they don’t stand for anything in particular, but their loutishness establishes them as de facto counterculture heroes, standing in opposition to the pretensions of ruling-class phonies like Gavin Belson, who says things like, “I don’t know about you people, but I don’t want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do.”</p>
<p>But the smartest thing about <em>Silicon Valley </em>is that — at least so far — it’s not a show about a scrappy new start-up taking on the big guys and winning; it’s a show about a scrappy new start-up taking on the big guys and barely surviving. Better-lawyered and deeper-pocketed, Hooli keeps finding new ways to knock them around; every ally they find on the VC side turns out to have an ego-driven agenda of their own. Richard finds out that Welch’s Peter Gregory funded Pied Piper only as part of a feud with Belson; when he expresses incredulity to Gregory’s assistant (Amanda Crew), she responds, “That’s nothing. Peter would spend millions just to <em>mildly annoy </em>Gavin. These are billionaires, Richard. Annoying each other means more to them than we’ll make in a lifetime.” They’re utterly at the mercy of the behemoths whose hegemony they’re supposed to be disrupting, pawns moved about the board by capricious gods. And in that sense, they’re just like us — there’s something cathartically funny about watching the Pied Piper guys suit up for a game that’s already been decided because our own interactions with Apple, Google, and Facebook tend to leave us feeling just as powerless.</p>
<p>The quintessential <em>Silicon Valley </em>character isn’t Richard or Erlich or Belson; it’s Richard’s old Hooli coworker Nelson “Big Head” Bighetti, who stays behind when Richard strikes out on his own. Big Head has nothing to offer the company or the world; his one invention is a lousy and morally deplorable app called “Nip Alert.” But like <em>Being There</em>’s Chauncey Gardner or the hypnotized Ron Livingston in <em>Office Space</em>, his blankness registers with management as the sphinxlike affect of a star. Belson, obsessed with re-creating the Pied Piper algorithm, repeatedly promotes Big Head all the way to a position as “head dreamer.” In Judge’s universe, money is destruction, success just makes you a target, cynicism blankets Northern California like Wi-Fi, and the only morally sound way to win is by not trying. Forget the search for human identity, self-reinvention, post-humanity, God in the machine, art, emotion, making a faith out of commercial detritus, or building the future; Richard and the rest of the Pied Piper crew are too busy trying to avoid being bulldozed into a landfill.</p>
<p><span>♦</span><span>♦</span><span>♦</span></p>
<p>In <em>Microserfs</em>, Daniel’s Microsoft coworker and eventual girlfriend Karla describes coders as “the fabricators of the human dream’s next REM cycle … building the center from which all else will be held.” Nobody talks that way about computers anymore; maybe it was always a sales pitch when they did. Our relationship to technology and our sense of the people who profit from putting it in our hands has changed dramatically since 1995; we’re no longer convinced that the engineers of our way of life have our best interests at heart. (The apple.com page where you can buy the $17,000 yellow-gold Apple Watch actually says the watch “represents a new chapter in the relationship people have with technology” — a chapter in which Apple stops pretending it isn’t as much a luxury-goods concern as LVMH, I guess.) So <em>The Social Network </em>works because it villainizes Mark Zuckerberg, and <em>Ex Machina</em>’s twists feel telegraphed because <em>of course</em> Oscar Isaac’s health-conscious tech billionaire is a creep, and <em>Silicon Valley </em>connects because it makes its tech bros hapless and goofy enough to be sympathetic, and the only place where the old notion of programmers as creatives and inventors of new paradigms can still live and breathe is on a low-rated TV show that’s also a period piece set 30&nbsp;years in the past.</p>
<p>AMC’s <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> takes its name from a mythical command that would supposedly cause a computer to accelerate and multitask to the point of self-destruction; in <em>Halt</em>, ex-IBM executive Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace) does approximately the same thing to a pokey early-’80s Dallas software company called Cardiff Electric, hot-wiring its business model by cloning an IBM machine and launching Cardiff into the personal-computer market before his bosses can object. The part about the cloning is more or less fact-based; Joe and engineer Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy) are essentially doing what the founders of Texas-born Compaq did in 1982. This was the dawn of the PC wars, a hugely important moment in personal-computing history, but it’s hard to look at <a href="http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/compaq.jpg" target="_blank">these guys</a> and imagine their story striking anyone as a worthy successor to <em>Mad Men</em>.<span data-footnote-id="6" data-footnote-url="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The possibility of a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV_RLmuoCkE&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Young John Cleese&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; episode notwithstanding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></span> You can understand why <em>Halt</em>’s creators felt the need or the pressure to overload Pace’s Joe with a whole soap opera’s worth of plot-sparking character traits — a murky employment history, hidden agendas, sexual ambiguity, a propensity for stagey outbursts of violence. The <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/halt-and-catch-fire-tries-reverse-engineer-mad-men-205150" target="_blank">A.V. Club</a> smugly rechristened him “Tron Draper.”</p>
<p>For a while, you could assume you knew where all this was headed — to Joe and Gordon changing the world with their amazing knockoff computer, to an Apple parallel with Joe as Steve Jobs and Gordon as Steve Wozniak, to the truism that innovation in technology requires perfect sharks as well as perfect geeks. And yet from the beginning, you could feel the show trying to escape the arc suggested by its premise, to pull the rug out on itself. In the pilot, Joe meets Cameron, a punk computer science major who between games of <em>Centipede</em> has come up with some oddly prescient ideas about a worldwide network of linked computers. They have sex; later, when Joe needs to produce an engineer who’s never seen IBM’s code in order to evade legal action from Big Blue, she becomes Cardiff Electric’s newest employee.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Cameron, like Joe, is a strung-together collection of traits and ideas — about women in technology, about women in general, about punk —&nbsp;that the actress Mackenzie Davis managed to render consistent by sheer force of will. But Cameron becomes the character whose presence bends the story away from what “really happened.” Joe has instructed Gordon and Cardiff’s engineers to build a computer, the Cardiff Giant, that’s twice as fast as anything on the market and costs half as much; they’re close to accomplishing this goal when Cameron comes up with the idea to give the Giant a personality, via an interface that asks questions like, “What do you want to do today?” She’s essentially invented Siri a generation ahead of schedule, dreaming up a future when computers aren’t mere office supplies. Joe loves the idea, because he’s in love with Cameron; Gordon objects, on the grounds that giving the machine a soul will be hard to implement and cost them in speed, although Gordon’s wife, Donna, who’s also an engineer, understands the idea immediately. Suddenly we were watching a show about artistic collaboration and compromise, and while we all knew Gordon&nbsp;was&nbsp;wrong when he groused that a personable OS will be like “having your mother inside your computer,” we could&nbsp;see where he was coming from. The story twists again: Joe loses his nerve. The Giant goes to market as a regular old fast/cheap PC. Then, in a Comdex hotel room darkened as if for a séance, Joe comes face-to-face with his first Macintosh, and realizes he’s made the wrong call: “It <em>speaks</em>,” he says, his voice full of wonder and dread. We realize we’ve spent the better part of a season watching these characters<em> fail</em> — that Gordon and Joe aren’t going to become the Jobs and Wozniak of this world because <em>Jobs and Wozniak</em> are the Jobs and Wozniak of this world.</p>
<p>And it quickly became a show with no comfort zone to return to; Joe became a frustrated artist, Gordon ended up a businessman, and Cameron took off with Donna to start an online-gaming company called Mutiny out of a suburban Dallas punk-pad. A third of the way into Season 2, <em>Halt</em>’s vision of start-up life at Mutiny looks a little like the early days of Nolan Bushnell’s Atari, back when the company consisted of T-shirted potheads building Pong machines in an old roller rink. If there’s a substantive <em>Mad Men </em>parallel to be drawn here, it’s that these shows share a willingness to shift the ground under their characters’ feet and understand that sometimes the best stories involve people on the wrong side of history. Recall that for all his brilliance as an ad man, Don Draper could often be as blinkered and resistant to change as anyone else at Sterling Cooper. He started out in Season 1 sneering at Doyle Dane Bernbach’s iconic “Lemon” ad for Volkswagen, which sparked advertising’s so-called Creative Revolution; it took him a decade and no small amount of suffering to get around to buying the world a Coke. There’s no story to be told about someone who’s always right.</p>
<p>“Something’s coming, and it’s gonna be big, and it won’t include this place, and it won’t include you,” Joe MacMillan tells Cardiff Electric’s founder, on what might be the last day of their acquaintance. But the compelling thing about this show as a portrait of an industry destined to transform our world is that the change in the air might not include Joe or Gordon or even Cameron, who in a recent episode was presented with something that looked an awful lot like a social network and failed to see the point of it. She’s trying to make online gaming happen in a world that’s about a year away from going cartridge-crazy again thanks to Nintendo. We’ll see. The important thing is the sense of manic excitement that pervades the Mutiny scenes this season, and the way it bleeds into the show itself<span>. W</span>e know exactly where computers are and aren’t going, but it still feels like anything is possible.</p>
