<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en">
    
    

    
    <h2 id="code-is-read-more-than-written">Code is read more than written</h2>

<p>This phrase is, by now, common programmer knowledge, a reminder that the person first writing a piece of code shouldn’t buy convenience at the expense of the people who will have to read it and modify it in the future. More generally, <em>code is read more than written</em> conveys that it’s usually a good investment to make the code maintainable by keeping it simple, writing tests and documentation, etc. It’s about having perspective over the software development cycle.</p>

<p>Let me express this idea more succinctly:</p>

<p>
<code>maintainer &gt; author</code>
</p>

<p>I think this line of thought can be extended beyond code-writing and used as a rule of thumb to identify problems and make decisions.</p>

<h2 id="code-is-used-more-than-read">Code is used more than read</h2>

<p>Code is a means to an end. Software should have a purpose, it’s supposed to provide a service to some user. It doesn’t matter how well written or maintainable the code is, nor how sophisticated the technology it uses if it doesn’t fulfill its purpose and provides a good experience to the user:</p>

<p>
<code>user &gt; maintainer &gt; author</code>
</p>

<p>Or, since we won’t need to distinguish between developer roles anymore:</p>

<p>
<code>user &gt; dev</code>
</p>

<p>This is why, instead of guessing or asking what they need, it’s best to put the program in front of the users early and frequently and to incorporate what we learn from their feedback.</p>

<p>This is a strong mental model, just keeping the users in mind during development can get us quite far. It’s approximately how I learned the job and how I understood it for the first half of my career.</p>

<h2 id="code-is-run-more-than-read">Code is run more than read</h2>

<p>When I say “run” I don’t just mean executing a program; I mean operating it in production, with all that it entails: deploying, upgrading, observing, auditing, monitoring, fixing, decommissioning, etc. As Dan McKinley <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is basically always the case that the long-term costs of keeping a system working reliably vastly exceed any inconveniences you encounter while building it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can incorporate this idea into our little model:</p>

<p>
<code>user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code>
</p>

<p>It took me a while to fully grasp this because, in my experience, much of the software being built never really gets to production, at least not at a significant scale. Most software is built on assumptions that never get tested. But when you run your code in production, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> mantra takes on a new dimension. It’s not just about code anymore; it’s about reducing the moving parts and understanding their failure modes. It’s about shipping stuff and ensuring it works even when it fails.</p>

<h2 id="also-theres-business">Also, there’s business</h2>

<p>I said that keeping the users in mind during development can get us very far. This works under the assumption that software that’s useful and works well, software of value to users, will be of value to the organization. It’s a convenient abstraction for developers: we produce good, working software, and the business deals with turning it into money. And it mostly works, especially for consumer and enterprise software. But, eventually, that abstraction proves to be an oversimplification, and we can benefit from incorporating some business perspective into our working process:</p>

<p>
<code>biz &gt; user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code>
</p>

<p>The most obvious example is budget: we don’t have infinite resources to satisfy the user needs, so we need to measure costs and benefits. There’s marketing, there’s deadlines. There are stakeholders and investors. There are personal interests and politics at play. Decisions that make sense for our software, our team or our users considered in isolation, but not when we consider the organization as a whole. Sometimes, we need to work on what generates revenue, not what pleases the user. I’ll get back to this.</p>

<h2 id="smells">Smells</h2>

<p>We arrived at a little model that expresses the relative importance of various factors in software development, one that can perhaps help us see the bigger picture and focus on what matters. Now I want to look at some common software development dysfunctions and see how they map to the model.</p>

<h3 id="unmaintainable-code">Unmaintainable code</h3>

<p>
<code>author &gt; maintainer</code>
</p>

<p>This is where we started. This is clever and lazy code that turns into spaghetti and haunted forests, this is premature optimizations, this is only-carlos-can-touch-that-module, etc.</p>

<h3 id="unusable-software">Unusable software</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; user</code>
</p>

<p>Software from teams that don’t learn from their users or that put technology first. Over-engineered programs, “modernizations” that degrade the user experience, web apps that break the browser features, etc.</p>

<h3 id="works-on-my-machine">Works on my machine</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; ops</code>
</p>

<p>Software that wasn’t designed with its operation in mind. This is overly complicated software with lots of moving parts, fancy databases for small data loads, microservice ecosystems managed by a single small team. Software prematurely architected for scale. Software designed by different people than the ones woken up at midnight when it breaks.</p>

<h3 id="the-right-thing">The right thing</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; biz</code>
</p>

<p>Code considered as an end in itself. Software built by pretentious artisans, musicians of the Titanic, and <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">Lisp Hackers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="resume-driven-development">Resume-driven development</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; *</code>
</p>

<p>Software produced when there’s nothing at stake and developers get to do whatever they want.</p>

<h3 id="imaginary-software">Imaginary software</h3>

<p><code>biz &gt; user &gt; <del>ops &gt;</del> dev</code></p>

<p>This is software that’s built but rarely (or never) gets to production. I call this <em>imaginary software</em>. Charity Majors <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1308641574448803840?lang=es">calls it</a> living a lie.</p>

<p><code>biz &gt; <del>user &gt;</del> ops &gt; dev</code></p>

<p>Another kind of imaginary software is the one that doesn’t have users. (But scales). This is software that doesn’t solve a problem, or solves the wrong problem, perhaps nobody’s problem. Software that results from taking some hyped tech and hammering everything with it until something vaguely resembling a use case comes up.</p>

<h3 id="late-capitalism">Late capitalism</h3>

<p><code><del>biz &gt;</del> user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code></p>

<p>Venture-backed software without a business model or whose business model is grow-until-monopoly-then-exploit-users.</p>

<h2 id="an-elephant">An elephant</h2>

<p>If you didn’t rage-close the browser tab yet, let me wrap up by going back to this:</p>

<p>
<code>biz &gt; user</code>
</p>

<p>This one has ramifications that can be hard to swallow.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, the way I learned the job, software was about solving problems for end users. This is summarized in one of the final tips of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer,</em> saying that our goal is to <em>delight users, not just deliver code</em>. But, since I started working as a programmer, and as software became ubiquitous, I’ve seen this assumption become increasingly hard to uphold.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of software being produced that just doesn’t care about its users, or that manipulates them, or that turns them into the product. And this isn’t limited to social media: as a user, I can’t even book a room, order food, or click on the Windows start button without popups trying to grab my attention; I can’t make a Google search without getting back a pile of garbage.</p>

<p>There’s a mismatch between what we thought doing a good job was and what a significant part of the industry considers profitable, and I think that explains the increasing discomfort of many software professionals. And while we can’t just go back to ignoring the economic realities of our discipline, perhaps we should take a stronger ethical stand not to harm users. Acknowledging that the user may not always come before the business, but that the business shouldn’t unconditionally come first, either:</p>

<p>
<code>user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code><br>
<code>biz &gt; ops &gt; dev</code><br>
<code>biz ≹ user</code>

<p>Choosing good colors for your charts is hard. This article tries to make it easier.</p>



<p>I want you to feel more confident in your color choices. And if you have no sense of color at all, here’s my attempt to help you find good ones anyway. We’ll talk about common color mistakes I see out there in the wild and how to avoid them.</p>



<p>This is not the right article for you if you’re trying to find good gradients or shades. But if you need to find beautiful, distinctive colors for different <strong>categories (e.g., continents, industries, bird species)</strong> for your line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, etc., then read on.</p>







<h4>Index</h4>



<p><a href="#0"><strong>00</strong> Before we start…</a><br><a href="#1"><strong>01</strong> Broaden your understanding of colors</a><br><a href="#2"><strong>02</strong> Don’t dance all over the color wheel</a><br><a href="#3"><strong>03</strong> Use saturation and lightness to make your hues work</a><br><a href="#4"><strong>04</strong> Use warm colors &amp; blue</a><br><a href="#5"><strong>05</strong> When using green, make it a yellow or blue one</a><br><a href="#6"><strong>06</strong> Avoid pure colors</a><br><a href="#7"><strong>07</strong> Avoid bright, saturated colors</a><br><a href="#8"><strong>08</strong> Combine colors with different lightness</a><br><a href="#9"><strong>09</strong> Make your colors equally “colorful”</a><br><a href="#10"><strong>10</strong> Avoid too little contrast with the background</a><br><a href="#11"><strong>11</strong> Avoid too much contrast with the background</a><br><a href="#12"><strong>12</strong> Choose a background that’s desaturated enough</a><br><a href="#13"><strong>13</strong> Copy colors, or understand them</a></p>



<h4 id="0">Before we start…</h4>



<p>I will mention saturation, brightness, and hue a lot. The HSB (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>B</strong>rightness) or HSV (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>V</strong>alue) color spaces work fairly well to check them:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hue</strong> ranges from 0° to 360° — that’s your typical color wheel: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li><strong>Saturation</strong> ranges from 0% (gray) to 100% (super duper colorful!!): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li><strong>Brightness/Value</strong> ranges from 0% (black) to 100% (the actual color): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li></ul>



<p>To convert your colors from HEX (e.g. <code>#cc0000</code>) or RGB (e.g. <code>rgb(207, 176, 58)</code>) to HSB/HSV, use a tool like <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>colorizer.org</strong></a>.</p>



<p>A relative of HSB/HSV is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCL</a> color space. It uses the same parameters (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>C</strong>hroma = saturation, <strong>L</strong>ightness), but is closer to “how we really see colors.” <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/255-how-to-pick-colors-in-datawrapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Datawrapper</strong> uses the HCL color space</a> for its color picker:</p>

<p>They’re different. The red that Nadieh uses <span>⬤</span> is different from your typical red <span>⬤</span>. The green <span>⬤</span> is… can you even call it a green <span>⬤</span>? </p>



<p>So before we impose rules that limit us, let me freak you out a bit: There are thousands of colors you can use. There is yellow-ish red <span>⬤</span> and blue-ish red <span>⬤</span> and everything in between. There is gray <span>⬤</span>, but there is also cold gray <span>⬤</span> and there is warm gray <span>⬤</span>. And then there is blue. So much blue! Like this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span> and this <span>⬤</span>. And we haven’t even talked about orange and yellow.</p>



<p>You have <em>lots</em> of choices. Which means you can stay in a small area of the color wheel and still have many options. Which means:</p>



<h4 id="2">Don’t dance all over the color wheel</h4>

<p>There’s no need to rely on hues from all around the color wheel like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> for your visualizations. It will look more professional — and therefore more trustworthy — when it only uses a few hues and their neighbors.</p>



<p>Here’s where it becomes a good idea to actually look at a color wheel. You can use <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a> or <a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> to do so.</p>

<p>Lots of these tools let you choose different harmonies. One of them is called “square” or “tetradic.” <strong>Don’t use it.</strong> It will result in too many hues —&nbsp;and we’re on a mission to avoid that.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/200805_goodcolors20.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>In the video above, I used the color tool <a href="https://paletton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paletton</a> to start with a tetradic harmony and then decrease the distance. Note how much more beautiful the color combinations become.</p>



<p>If the distance becomes small enough, you’re basically using <strong>complementary</strong> colors. And that’s a great choice! Lots of complementary color pairs look fantastic together. <strong>When in doubt, use complementary colors and their neighbors.</strong></p>



<p>So let’s do this —&nbsp;this time with Adobe Color:</p>

<p>Our colors are opposite each other on the color wheel, so they’re clearly complementary. Yay! But they’re also unusable: The two oranges are way too similar. And everything looks so… bright.</p>



<p>There’s where we need to change the saturation and lightness:</p>

<p>Saturation and brightness are as important as hue. In fact, you can create new colors when you change just the saturation and brightness. Here are two color pairs with the same hue, just different saturation and lightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. (If you change the hue just a tiny bit, you’ll achieve even better results: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.)</p>



<p>Let’s come back to our color combination: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. After playing around with the saturation and darkness, it becomes this:</p>







<p>I desaturated the light blue <span>⬤</span> and the lighter orange <span>⬤</span> and made every color darker except the lighter orange. Heck yeah, we can work with that!</p>



<p>So if your color combination doesn’t look awesome yet, don’t immediately add another hue. <strong>Change the saturation and lightness first and see if that’s better.</strong></p>



<p>That’s what I did to all of these color palettes: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. They’re all roughly complementary, and they all come with different saturations and lightness. That’s what makes them work.</p>

<p>There’s a complementary color combination that is especially loved by data visualization designers: <strong>yellow/orange/red and blue</strong>. Scroll through graphics portfolios like this one from the <a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a> or this one by <a href="https://infographics.economist.com/2019/AChristmasGiftForYou/AYearInGraphicDetail.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist (PDF)</a>, and you’ll notice that they use these colors far more often than colors like purple or green.</p>

<p>That’s because these warm colors and blue are super versatile for categories. Yellow and orange and red look very pleasing together, but people will still perceive them as different: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> —&nbsp;which is exactly what we want for categorical colors. And blue is more flexible than any other hue. Lots of blues, no matter if dark <span>⬤</span> or light <span>⬤</span> or saturated <span>⬤</span> or not saturated <span>⬤</span>, look pleasing, calming, and professional.</p>



<p>And they are accessible: colorblind people can easily distinguish blue and orange/red from each other.</p>



<p>So when in doubt, use an orange/red with blue.</p>



<h4 id="5">When using green, make it a yellow or blue one</h4>

<p>Forest green covers a full sixth of the color wheel, from approximately 90° <span>⬤</span> to 150° <span>⬤</span>, with 120° as its peak <span>⬤</span>. However, you will find few well-designed visualizations that use it. Why is that?</p>



<p>First, forest green is just very dark. And lightening the forest green means going into an awkward neon <span>⬤</span>. So you need to lighten <em>and</em> desaturate green enormously — more than other color —&nbsp;to get to a nice one. That’s exactly what the Washington Post does with their green <span>⬤</span> here: </p>

<p>It’s a 142° green, but only 14% saturated. Here’s what the same hue with the same brightness would look like 100% saturated: <span>⬤</span>. Yikes.</p>



<p>And remember our colorblind friends: A pure green in combination with red, orange, or brown is hard for them to distinguish.</p>



<p>So when using green, make it a bit yellow or a bit blue. You can see this in the examples at the top of this article: All of the greens except FiveThirtyEight’s <span>⬤</span> have a hue greater than 160° (= bluer) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> or less than 60° (= more yellow) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. Nadieh uses both yellow-green and blue-green in this project we’ve already seen:</p>

<p>Here’s an example: In HSV/HSB, the <strong>H</strong>ue value of this bright blue <span>⬤</span> is 180°, the <strong>S</strong>aturation value is 67%, and the <strong>L</strong>ightness value is 91%. You can also check the RGB values of your color: If at least two of the values are the same, they’re “pure”. For example, our <span>⬤</span> is a <code>rgb(77, 232, 232)</code>.</p>



<p>To make your colors look more natural and pleasing to your readers’ eyes, you can either tone down the saturation of pure colors or make them darker. <strong>If you want to have bright, saturated colors, rely on mixed colors</strong> at least 5-10° away from the pure hues.</p>



<p>In the image above, the red and orange, the blues and the greens have the same saturation and lightness. The only difference is the hue: The red <span>⬤</span> (0°), blue <span>⬤</span> (240°), and green <span>⬤</span> (120°) look more colorful than the orange <span>⬤</span> (40°), medium blue <span>⬤</span> (211°), and blue-ish green <span>⬤</span> (170°).</p>



<h4 id="7">Avoid bright, saturated colors</h4>

<p>Neon colors will definitely attract the attention of readers. But these readers won’t thank you. Most of us get a bit stressed out when we see them: “Highly saturated, light colors will NOT be appropriate [to communicate] Serious or Trust, or Calm,” researchers Bartram, Patra, and Stone explain in their paper “Affective Color in Visualization” from 2017 (<a href="https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/Affective%20Color%20CHI%202017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a>).</p>



<p>If your colors come close to 100% saturation <strong>and</strong> 100% brightness, it’s likely your colors are too colorful. That’s definitely the case for pure colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</p>



<p>“But I’ve seen such crazy colors before, and they look good,” you might say, and refer to projects like these:</p>

<p>But if you compare the colors from these examples with colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>, you see how the former ones are all less saturated or darker. A 100% saturated and 100% bright green <span>⬤</span> becomes less saturated in the New York Times <span>⬤</span>, and less saturated <em>and</em> darker in both the Bloomberg article <span>⬤</span> and the Pudding article <span>⬤</span>. </p>



<p>They have the same fun, attention-grabbing effect as neon colors have, while being easier on the eye.</p>



<p>This works more or less because the people at The Pudding, The New York Times, and Bloomberg are great designers. <strong>When in doubt, avoid 100% saturation combined with 100% lightness.</strong></p>

<p>I sometimes see charts —&nbsp;especially area charts —&nbsp;where neighboring elements have the same lightness. You can easily check this: Just convert your colors to black &amp; white (e.g., with an external colorblindness simulator or with our <a href="https://twitter.com/Datawrapper/status/1298293123584536578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper colorblind check</a>). If they all have the same gray, they’re the same lightness.</p>



<p>For example, the <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> from the far left chart look like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> in grayscale.</p>



<p>To avoid that dull and eye-hurting experience, you have two options:</p>



<ul><li>“Get it right in black &amp; white”: change the darkness of each area, making some brighter and some darker, like so: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. They look like this in grayscale: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>Separate the areas, e.g., with a white border</li></ul>



<p>I highly recommend the first option (you can still put a white border around it if you like the style): The colors will look more dynamic, and colorblind people will thank you. Actually, everyone will thank you, regardless of their color-seeing abilities.</p>



<p>In fact, a valid way to pick colors for categorical data is to pick colors from gradients like these ones:</p>

<p>All these gradients move smoothly from light to dark, so colors you pick from there will all have a different lightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> or <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.

<p>In your visualizations, you often want colors to stand out. There are different ways to achieve that. Colors stand out:</p>



<ul><li>because they’re way darker <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> </li><li>because they’re way lighter <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>because they’re more saturated <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>because they’re more “pure” <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li></ul>



<p>But you usually just want one or two colors to stand out. Most of your colors are supposed to be <strong>more or less equally attention-grabbing</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’re using colors with different lightness (“Get it right in black &amp; white”), you’ll need to balance them out. <strong>Try to desaturate bright colors. Put more saturation in dark colors.</strong></p>



<p>Or choose a less pure hue: in the image above, the green <span>⬤</span> and blue <span>⬤</span> are very pure, so I darkened them. (Here’s how they look with 100% brightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.)</p>



<p>I then wanted to bring a red in… but the bright red would have been too intense as a pure hue (at 0°) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. So I had two options:</p>



<ol><li>simply darken it: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</li><li>move the hue (and just the hue) to 30° to make it more orange <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</li></ol>



<p>I chose the second option to make it look a bit more friendly. But both options work.</p>

<p>A surprising number of charts on bright backgrounds use very pastel-ish colors. They’re often not very saturated, and awfully light.</p>



<p>That comes with problems: If you work with small areas like lines and dots, light and desaturated colors can be hard for your readers to distinguish. But even if legibility is not an issue —&nbsp;e.g. for bigger areas — your visualizations should have enough visual contrast with the background to confidently communicate: “Hey, I’m here, and I have something to say.”</p>



<p>Here’s what to do when your colors are too desaturated and light <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>:</p>



<ul><li>Increase the saturation: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>Make them darker: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>Or do both for the best result: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li></ul>



<p>Of course, that’s also a matter of taste. But if you’re not sure if your colors are too pastel-ish, simply try to make them more saturated and darker. Just see how it feels. And if it feels good, keep it.</p>

<p>The opposite is true, too: Don’t make your colors too dark and saturated when you’re using a bright background. If in doubt, try it out. Make your colors lighter, pull some saturation out of them and see how it feels.</p>

<p>Once you become more confident with colors, colorful backgrounds can seem like a good idea. But they come with two big drawbacks: First, they easily distract from your data. Second, they’re limiting your potential color palette and are therefore hard to work with. In fact, the more saturated your background, the harder it gets —&nbsp;so desaturated colors are your best bet. Here are some rules of thumbs for the HSB/HSV color space:</p>



<ul><li>If you want a light background, stay away from colors below 95% lightness and above 7% saturation.</li><li>If you want a dark background, stay below 20% saturation. Also, <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t go full black</a> —&nbsp;keep your lightness between 10% and 25%.</li></ul>



<h4 id="13">Copy colors, or understand them</h4>



<p>Picking good colors is hard. It’s totally ok to be bad with colors, to keep being bad with colors, and to just copy colors. Seriously, there’s no shame in stealing. <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorguide/"><strong>I wrote a whole article</strong></a> about where to get inspiration for colors: From movies, artists, color palettes others have created, etc. (And may I add: Other data visualizations are an excellent source.)</p>



<p>If you do want to build a better intuitive understanding of which colors fit well together, try this: Analyze them. Some ways to do that include:</p>

<ul><li>Select a picture with colors you consider beautiful, like an art piece or photo of nature. Then pick colors out of them with an eyedropper tool, e.g., in Photoshop or <a href="https://image-color.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>image-color.com</strong></a>. Try to use them in your next chart.</li><li>Install <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Adobe Capture</strong></a>, which is the same idea but for “live images”: It lets you capture colors from your environment. (It’s fascinating to see how desaturated many colors are around us!)</li><li>Play “manual color picker”: <strong>Look up your screen. Which colors do you see?</strong> How dark and how saturated are there? Which hues are close by; which ones are opposite on the color wheel?</li><li>Pick colors from beautiful data visualizations. <strong>Change a few colors.</strong> Do they still work well together?</li></ul>



<p>Also, the next time you’re creating a data visualization and you’re not happy with your colors, <strong>analyze them in the HSV/HSB color space</strong>, e.g., with <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colorizer.org</a>:</p>



<ul><li>How <strong>saturated</strong> are they —&nbsp;and do they look better if you increase or decrease the saturation by a few (or a lot of) percentage points?</li><li>Which <strong>hue</strong> value do they have? What happens if you change the hue by just a few degrees?</li><li>Are your colors differently <strong>bright</strong>?</li></ul>



<p>With time, your understanding will move from “that’s beautiful, but I don’t know why” to “that’s beautiful, because…” And you’ll find that you can break more and more of these rules I explained here —&nbsp;and still create great color combinations.</p>

</p><p>Thanks to technological advancements, photography has come a long way from flash bulbs and film. Every time the iPhone shutter button is clicked, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/03/16/iphone-vs-android-two-different-photography-and-machine-learning-approaches">billions of operations</a> occur in an instant that results in a photo.
</p><p>A U.K. comedian and actor named Tessa Coates was trying on wedding dresses when a shocking photo of her was taken, according to her Instagram post <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/11/16/one-in-a-million-iphone-photo-shows-two-versions-of-the-same-woman/">shared by</a> <em>PetaPixel</em>. The photo shows Coates in a dress in front of two mirrors, but each of the three versions of her had a different pose.
</p><p>One mirror showed her with her arms down, the other mirror showed her hands joined at her waist, and her real self was standing with her left arm at her side. To anyone who doesn't know better, this could prove to be quite a shocking image.
</p><p>What's actually occurred here is a mistake in Apple's computational photography pipeline. The camera wouldn't realize it was taking a photo of a mirror, so it treated the three versions of Coates as different people.
</p><p>Coates was moving when the photo was taken, so when the shutter was pressed, many differing images were captured in that instant. Apple's algorithm stitches the photos together, choosing the best versions for saturation, contrast, detail, and lack of blur.
</p><p>The final composite image should be the best, most realistic interpretation of that moment. However, since there was a mirror present, the algorithm determined that different moments shown in each mirror were the best for that reflection. That's what resulted in three different Tessas.
</p><p>This result can be recreated on any recent iPhone and many kinds of smartphone due to the limitations of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/02/inside-apples-deep-fusion-the-iphone-11-and-pros-computational-photography-feature">computational photography</a> dealing with mirrors. Younger generations have figured this phenomenon out and used it to generate silly images for social media.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker">https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38482007">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Marker</h2>
<p dir="auto">Marker converts PDF, EPUB, and MOBI to markdown.  It's 10x faster than nougat, more accurate on most documents, and has low hallucination risk.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Support for a range of PDF documents (optimized for books and scientific papers)</li>
<li>Removes headers/footers/other artifacts</li>
<li>Converts most equations to latex</li>
<li>Formats code blocks and tables</li>
<li>Support for multiple languages (although most testing is done in English).  See <code>settings.py</code> for a language list.</li>
<li>Works on GPU, CPU, or MPS</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto">Marker is a pipeline of deep learning models:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Extract text, OCR if necessary (heuristics, tesseract)</li>
<li>Detect page layout (<a href="https://huggingface.co/vikp/layout_segmenter" rel="nofollow">layout segmenter</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/vikp/column_detector" rel="nofollow">column detector</a>)</li>
<li>Clean and format each block (heuristics, <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/nougat-base" rel="nofollow">nougat</a>)</li>
<li>Combine blocks and postprocess complete text (heuristics, <a href="https://huggingface.co/vikp/pdf_postprocessor_t5" rel="nofollow">pdf_postprocessor</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Relying on autoregressive forward passes to generate text is slow and prone to hallucination/repetition.  From the nougat paper: <code>We observed [repetition] in 1.5% of pages in the test set, but the frequency increases for out-of-domain documents.</code>  In my anecdotal testing, repetitions happen on 5%+ of out-of-domain (non-arXiv) pages.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nougat is an amazing model, but I wanted a faster and more general purpose solution. Marker is 10x faster and has low hallucination risk because it only passes equation blocks through an LLM forward pass.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mac</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install system requirements from <code>scripts/install/brew-requirements.txt</code></li>
<li>Set the tesseract data folder path
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Find the tesseract data folder <code>tessdata</code> with <code>brew list tesseract</code></li>

<li><code>poetry install</code></li>
<li><code>poetry shell</code> to activate your poetry venv</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">First, some configuration:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Set your torch device in the <code>local.env</code> file.  For example, <code>TORCH_DEVICE=cuda</code> or <code>TORCH_DEVICE=mps</code>.  <code>cpu</code> is the default.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If using GPU, set <code>INFERENCE_RAM</code> to your GPU VRAM (per GPU).  For example, if you have 16 GB of VRAM, set <code>INFERENCE_RAM=16</code>.</li>
<li>Depending on your document types, marker's average memory usage per task can vary slightly.  You can configure <code>VRAM_PER_TASK</code> to adjust this if you notice tasks failing with GPU out of memory errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, the final editor model is off.  Turn it on with <code>ENABLE_EDITOR_MODEL</code>.</li>
<li>Inspect the settings in <code>marker/settings.py</code>.  You can override any settings in the <code>local.env</code> file, or by setting environment variables.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Convert a single file</h2>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>convert_single.py</code>, like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python convert_single.py /path/to/file.pdf /path/to/output.md --parallel_factor 2 --max_pages 10"><pre><code>python convert_single.py /path/to/file.pdf /path/to/output.md --parallel_factor 2 --max_pages 10
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--parallel_factor</code> is how much to increase batch size and parallel OCR workers by.  Higher numbers will take more VRAM and CPU, but process faster.  Set to 1 by default.</li>
<li><code>--max_pages</code> is the maximum number of pages to process.  Omit this to convert the entire document.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Make sure the <code>DEFAULT_LANG</code> setting is set appropriately for your document.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Convert multiple files</h2>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>convert.py</code>, like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python convert.py /path/to/input/folder /path/to/output/folder --workers 10 --max 10 --metadata_file /path/to/metadata.json --min_length 10000"><pre><code>python convert.py /path/to/input/folder /path/to/output/folder --workers 10 --max 10 --metadata_file /path/to/metadata.json --min_length 10000
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--workers</code> is the number of pdfs to convert at once.  This is set to 1 by default, but you can increase it to increase throughput, at the cost of more CPU/GPU usage. Parallelism will not increase beyond <code>INFERENCE_RAM / VRAM_PER_TASK</code> if you're using GPU.</li>
<li><code>--max</code> is the maximum number of pdfs to convert.  Omit this to convert all pdfs in the folder.</li>
<li><code>--metadata_file</code> is an optional path to a json file with metadata about the pdfs.  If you provide it, it will be used to set the language for each pdf.  If not, <code>DEFAULT_LANG</code> will be used. The format is:</li>
<li><code>--min_length</code> is the minimum number of characters that need to be extracted from a pdf before it will be considered for processing.  If you're processing a lot of pdfs, I recommend setting this to avoid OCRing pdfs that are mostly images. (slows everything down)</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
  &quot;pdf1.pdf&quot;: {&quot;language&quot;: &quot;English&quot;},
  &quot;pdf2.pdf&quot;: {&quot;language&quot;: &quot;Spanish&quot;},
  ...
}"><pre><code>{
  "pdf1.pdf": {"language": "English"},
  "pdf2.pdf": {"language": "Spanish"},
  ...
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Convert multiple files on multiple GPUs</h2>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>chunk_convert.sh</code>, like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="MIN_LENGTH=10000 METADATA_FILE=../pdf_meta.json NUM_DEVICES=4 NUM_WORKERS=15 bash chunk_convert.sh ../pdf_in ../md_out"><pre><code>MIN_LENGTH=10000 METADATA_FILE=../pdf_meta.json NUM_DEVICES=4 NUM_WORKERS=15 bash chunk_convert.sh ../pdf_in ../md_out
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>METADATA_FILE</code> is an optional path to a json file with metadata about the pdfs.  See above for the format.</li>
<li><code>NUM_DEVICES</code> is the number of GPUs to use.  Should be <code>2</code> or greater.</li>
<li><code>NUM_WORKERS</code> is the number of parallel processes to run on each GPU.  Per-GPU parallelism will not increase beyond <code>INFERENCE_RAM / VRAM_PER_TASK</code>.</li>
<li><code>MIN_LENGTH</code> is the minimum number of characters that need to be extracted from a pdf before it will be considered for processing.  If you're processing a lot of pdfs, I recommend setting this to avoid OCRing pdfs that are mostly images. (slows everything down)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benchmarks</h2>
<p dir="auto">Benchmarking PDF extraction quality is hard.  I've created a test set by finding books and scientific papers that have a pdf version and a latex source.  I convert the latex to text, and compare the reference to the output of text extraction methods.</p>
<p dir="auto">Benchmarks show that marker is 10x faster than nougat, and more accurate outside arXiv (nougat was trained on arXiv data).  We show naive text extraction (pulling text out of the pdf with no processing) for comparison.</p>

<p dir="auto">Peak GPU memory usage during the benchmark is <code>3.3GB</code> for nougat, and <code>3.1GB</code> for marker.  Benchmarks were run on an A6000.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Throughput</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Marker takes about 2GB of VRAM on average per task, so you can convert 24 documents in parallel on an A6000.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running your own benchmarks</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can benchmark the performance of marker on your machine.  First, download the benchmark data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiN4K2-jQfwyQMe4wSSurbpz3hxo2fG9/view?usp=drive_link" rel="nofollow">here</a> and unzip.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python benchmark.py data/pdfs data/references report.json --nougat"><pre><code>python benchmark.py data/pdfs data/references report.json --nougat
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will benchmark marker against other text extraction methods.  It sets up batch sizes for nougat and marker to use a similar amount of GPU RAM for each.</p>
<p dir="auto">Omit <code>--nougat</code> to exclude nougat from the benchmark.  I don't recommend running nougat on CPU, since it is very slow.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto">PDF is a tricky format, so marker will not always work perfectly.  Here are some known limitations that are on the roadmap to address:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Marker will convert fewer equations to latex than nougat.  This is because it has to first detect equations, then convert them without hallucation.</li>
<li>Whitespace and indentations are not always respected.</li>
<li>Not all lines/spans will be joined properly.</li>
<li>Only languages similar to English (Spanish, French, German, Russian, etc) are supported.  Languages with different character sets (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc) are not.</li>
<li>This works best on digital PDFs that won't require a lot of OCR.  It's optimized for speed, and limited OCR is used to fix errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Commercial usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Due to the licensing of the underlying models like layoutlmv3 and nougat, this is only suitable for noncommercial usage.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm building a version that can be used commercially, by stripping out the dependencies below. If you would like to get early access, email me at <a href="mailto:marker@vikas.sh">marker@vikas.sh</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are the non-commercial/restrictive dependencies:</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Upon its release in late 2022, ChatGPT has brought a seismic shift in the entire landscape of AI, both in research and commerce. Through instruction-tuning a large language model (LLM) with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, it showed that a model could answer human questions and follow instructions on a broad panel of tasks. Following this success, interests in LLMs have intensified, with new LLMs flourishing at frequent interval across academia and industry, including many start-ups focused on LLMs. While closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude) generally outperform their open-source counterparts, the progress on the latter has been rapid with claims of achieving parity or even better on certain tasks. This has crucial implications not only on research but also on business. In this work, on the first anniversary of ChatGPT, we provide an exhaustive overview of this success, surveying all tasks where an open-source LLM has claimed to be on par or better than ChatGPT.

<p><span>We at Duke University Libraries have decided to stop using the project management platform, Basecamp, to which we have subscribed for almost a decade. We came to this decision after weighing the level of its use in our organization, which is considerable, against the harms that we see perpetuated by the leadership of Basecamp’s parent company, 37signals. As a result of our discussions, we will not renew our current subscription when it ends in December. In the meantime, a small group of our staff have committed to help colleagues export their Basecamp content so it can be archived, and we will move to using other productivity platforms.</span></p>
<p><span>In July of this year, in a team chat, one of our colleagues shared a link to a blog post authored by one of the founders and owners of 37signals, and commented, “We really might want to rethink our usage of Basecamp.”</span></p>
<p><span>It jogged our memories of events some 26 months earlier, when another colleague shared an article published on The Verge, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy"><span>“Breaking Camp.”</span></a><span> As reported, internal conflict regarding a culturally-insensitive list of “funny” customer names led Basecamp’s leadership to ban employees from holding “societal and political discussions,” ignoring that the conflict focused on workplace dynamics. Mass resignations resulted, and the experiences of the employees interviewed paints a picture of company leaders who initially supported Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) activities but eventually placed severe restrictions on how those activities could play out at work. In a playbook for the ages, those in power failed to acknowledge the complicated interconnectedness and nuance of the issues under discussion, and set policies that shut down discussions challenging the company culture.</span></p>
<p><span>The discussions we had in 2021 identified concerns about both the culture at Basecamp and the impact a decision to leave it would have on our daily work. Staff reflected on the ease of using the platform, the large number of projects that rely on it, and the complication of a decision that would impact groups across in the Libraries in such a direct way. While we talked about how we might respond to the values of third-party companies, we eventually decided not to pursue a cancellation.</span></p>
<p><span>When we revisited the discussion this summer, it took a decidedly different direction. The blog post that our colleague shared in July, titled </span><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-law-of-the-land-c2231109"><span>“The law of the land,”</span></a><span> by 37signals co-founder, co-owner, and CTO, David Heinemeier Hansson, celebrates the US Supreme Court’s ruling ending considerations of race in admission to colleges and universities. In that post, Hansson links to another that drew our attention, </span><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-waning-days-of-dei-s-dominance-9a5b656c"><span>“The waning days of DEI’s dominance.”</span></a><span> We also read a third post of his, </span><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/meta-goes-no-politics-at-work-and-nobody-cares-d6409209"><span>“Meta goes no politics at work (and nobody cares).”</span></a><span> We found there a thread of ugly thought, couched in an overriding intellectual dishonesty, that re-escalated our discussion about continued use of Basecamp.</span></p>

<p><span>We’re not going to address each of the many falsehoods and distortions in the blog posts by David Heinemeier Hansson. Instead, we will focus on a few emblematic statements that stand in for a pattern of rhetoric that runs counter to our own values.</span></p>
<p><span>In the “waning days” piece, Hansson depicts Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as a movement that became entrenched in 2020, a process he characterizes being “accelerated” by a number of factors, including “the riots in the wake of George Floyd.” Referring to the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd as “riots” is an offhand gesture as Hansson uses it, but it gets our attention because we know how false, ideological, and ugly it is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://acleddata.com/2020/09/03/demonstrations-political-violence-in-america-new-data-for-summer-2020/"><span>Research and the documentary record</span></a> <a href="https://wapo.st/3ZcERFW"><span>show</span></a><span> that the protests of 2020 were overwhelmingly peaceful, that incidents of violence were limited and often instigated by counter protestors or provocateurs, and that in many cases the responses of the police and federal authorities provoked and exacerbated the violence. The characterization of these events as “riots” followed as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by right-wing groups, media’s distorting focus on isolated incidents, and biased framing by political campaigns. It plays on a longstanding and shameful tendency in the US of depicting any protest or demands for justice from Black members of our society as innately violent and threatening.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the same post, Hansson takes glee in the mass layoffs of tech workers in late 2022. He imagines that they were the group “from whom the DEI movement drew its most active and engaged disciples,” and seems to be delighted that “hundreds of thousands” of tech workers will be out of work – “perhaps for quite a while!” – and therefore “the most fervent ideologues among them” will be unable to find work. The implication is unavoidable, that he and perhaps other tech bosses might blacklist workers who have records of advocating for more diverse and inclusive workplaces.</span></p>
<p><span>Hansson certainly is entitled to his opinion, and to publish his own blog. We are not in the habit of running “ideological enforcement” to ensure “quick compliance” from beleaguered corporate executives or whatever it is that he’s talking about in his posts. We simply have our own opinions and our own blogs, and in some cases, we have good choices available to us regarding the companies to which we give our business.</span></p>
<p><span>After all, we’re the libraries. We have plenty of experience with corporate entities that don’t reflect our values. We deal with the journal publishers who practice a business model that hoards the world’s knowledge and maximizes profit from the research that our university’s scholars conduct. When it comes to the academic publishing system, institutions of higher learning have made a deal with the devil, and we, the libraries, are the campus units who pay the bill. We do it every year, often facing steep price increases with flat budgets.</span></p>
<p><span>We also know all too well the very worst of what humanity can create, because we collect it. Our shelves hold some of the most god-awful, hateful stuff you can imagine, in the form of explicit hate literature; and the much larger bulk of mainstream materials we hold are pervaded by casual racism and assumptions of white supremacy. Our job is to maintain it all for research, and to provide the context required for responsible inquiry. We know that our collections as a whole are themselves the legacies of systems of oppression in what they do and do not contain. The entire foundation of our organization was developed on assumptions, in the early days of Duke University, that excluded groups would not use the materials we collect or the services we provide. We know about these legacies, and we reckon with them by considering the harm they’ve caused, and asking what we can do to mitigate it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also know the harms that our own workplace practices and culture have caused over the years. We know about it because we listen to each other, both informally and formally, via climate surveys, workshops, and other practices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The point is not that we’re perfect, or a model to emulate. The point is that we are not naive. We have seen (and done) some stuff.</span></p>
<p><span>So when we encounter a tech company boss who takes in a nationwide movement of organized protest against police brutalization and systemic racism, led by Black activists, and amplifies the rare incidents of violence, much of it instigated by the police or right-wing counter protestors, using the mendacious language of extremists to refer to it as “riots,” we have a good idea what we’re looking at.</span></p>
<p><span>When we enter into business with a company whose boss takes delight in the mass layoffs of tech workers because it disempowers those who might speak out against their company keeping a list of non-Anglophone names that some members of the team find hilarious, we have a decent sense of who we’re dealing with.</span></p>
<p><span>We here in the libraries are world-weary and sophisticated. We recognize that it’s the nature of our world, so interconnected now. We think all that interconnection makes us stronger, more vibrant; it’s wondrous, but it also means that as we encounter difference, we need to “do the work” (as Hansson mocks), be aware, and be open. Not every situation is going to be easy, but bringing “our whole selves” (another phrase that he mocks) to it has an impact, makes it more real, more human.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are always going to be the free riders – tech companies, perhaps – who benefit from the interconnectedness of the world while refusing to do the work. They may even taunt, from their blogs, those who try. Their paths are going to intersect with ours; that’s just the way it works. Often, we’re not in a position to choose not to deal with them.</span></p>
<p><span>But occasionally, we are. Not because we want to eliminate anyone’s livelihood, or harry executives, or because we imagine our subscription fee makes much of a difference. But just because we can. In this case, there are other productivity tools that can fill the space. In this case, we have options. And we’ve chosen to end our subscription with Basecamp.</span></p>

          transformed. We <a href="#method">show in theory</a> and practice that our method supports a broad range of transformations

<!-- METHOD -->
<div>
        <h2 id="method">Method</h2>
        <div>
          <p><img src="https://dangeng.github.io/visual_anagrams/static/images/method.jpg"></p><p>
            Our method is conceptually simple. We take an off-the-shelf diffusion model and use it
            to estimate the noise in different views or transformations, \(v_i\), of an image. 
            The noise estimates are then aligned by applying the inverse view, \(v_i^{-1}\),
            and averaged together. This averaged noise estimate is then used to take a diffusion step.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

<!-- CONDITIONS -->
<div>
        <h2>Conditions on Views</h2>
        <p>
            We find that not every view function works with the above method. Of course, \(v_i\) must
            be invertible, but we discuss two additional constraints.
          </p>
        <h2>Linearity</h2>
        <p>
            A diffusion model is trained to estimate the noise in noisy data \(\mathbf{x}_t\) conditioned 
            on time step \(t\). The noisy data \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is expected to have the form 
            \[\mathbf{x}_t = w_t^{\text{signal}}\underbrace{\mathbf{x}_0}_{\text{signal}} + w_t^{\text{noise}}\underbrace{\epsilon\vphantom{\mathbf{x}_0}}_{\text{noise}}.\]
            That is, \(\mathbf{x}_t\) is a weighted average of pure signal \(\mathbf{x_0}\) 
            and pure noise \(\epsilon\), specifically with weights \(w_t^{\text{signal}}\) and \(w_t^{\text{noise}}\). 
            Therefore, our view, \(v\) must maintain this weighting between signal and noise. This can be achieved
            by making \(v\) linear, which we represent by the square matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). By linearity
            \[\begin{aligned} v(\mathbf{x}_t) &amp;= \mathbf{A}(w_t^{\text{signal}} \mathbf{x}_0+w_t^{\text{noise}} \epsilon)\\[7pt] &amp;= w_t^{\text{signal}} \underbrace{\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0}_{\text{new signal}} + w_t^{\text{noise}} \underbrace{\mathbf{A}\epsilon}_{\text{new noise}}. \end{aligned}\]
            Effectively, \(v\) acts on the signal and the noise independently, and combines the result with the correct weighting.
          </p>
        <h2>Statistical Consistency</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Diffusion models are trained with the assumption that the noise is drawn iid from a standard normal.
            Therefore we must ensure that the transformed noise also follows these statistics. That is, we need
            \[\mathbf{A}\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I).\]
            For linear transformations, this is equivalent to the condition that \(\mathbf{A}\) is orthogonal.
            Intuitively, orthogonal matrices respect the spherical symmetry of the standard multivariate Gaussian distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, for a transformation to work with our method, it is <b>sufficient for it to be orthogonal.</b>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>


<!-- ORTHOGONAL -->
<div>
        <h2>Orthogonal Transformations</h2>
        <p>
            Most orthogonal transformations on images are meaningless, visually. For example, we transform
            the image below with a randomly sampled orthogonal matrix.
          </p>
        <p><img src="https://dangeng.github.io/visual_anagrams/static/images/orthogonal.jpeg">
        </p>
        <p>
            However, <b>permutations matrices are a subset of orthogonal matrices,</b> and are quite interpretable. 
            They are just rearrangements of pixels in an image. This is where the idea of a <b>visual anagram</b>
            comes from. The majority of illusions here can be interpreted this way—as specific rearrangements of pixels—such as
            <a href="#rot90_examples">rotations</a>, <a href="#flip_examples">flips</a>, 
            <a href="#misc_examples">skews</a>, <a href="#misc_examples">"inner rotations,"</a> 
            <a href="#jigsaw_examples">jigsaw rearrangements</a>, and 
            <a href="#perm_examples">patch permutations</a>. Finally, <a href="#inversion_examples">color inversions</a>
            are not permutations, but are orthogonal as they are a negation of pixel values.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    <p>This post is the second part of a multi-series blog focused on how to accelerate generative AI models with pure, native PyTorch. We are excited to share a breadth of newly released PyTorch performance features alongside practical examples to see how far we can push PyTorch native performance. In part one, we showed how to accelerate <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-generative-ai/">Segment Anything over 8x</a> using only pure, native PyTorch. In this blog we’ll focus on LLM optimization.</p>

<p>Over the past year, generative AI use cases have exploded in popularity. Text generation has been one particularly popular area, with lots of innovation among open-source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm">MLC-LLM</a>.</p>

<p>While these projects are performant, they often come with tradeoffs in ease of use, such as requiring model conversion to specific formats or building and shipping new dependencies. This begs the question: <strong>how fast can we run transformer inference with only pure, native PyTorch?</strong></p>

<p>As announced during our recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWpM_9AsC-U">PyTorch Developer Conference</a>, the PyTorch team wrote a from-scratch LLM <strong>almost 10x faster than baseline,</strong> with no loss of accuracy, all using native PyTorch optimizations. We leverage a breadth of optimizations including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html">Torch.compile</a></strong>: A compiler for PyTorch models</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/ao/tree/main#torchao">GPU quantization</a></strong>: Accelerate models with reduced precision operations</li>

  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/tp.py">Tensor Parallelism</a></strong>: Accelerate models by running them across multiple devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, even better, we can do it in <strong>less than 1000 lines of native PyTorch code</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Note: We will be focusing on latency (i.e. batch size=1) for all of these benchmarks. Unless otherwise specified, all benchmarks are run on an A100-80GB, power limited to 330W.</em></p>

<h2 id="starting-point-255-toks">Starting Point (25.5 tok/s)</h2>

<p>Let’s start off with an extremely basic and simple implementation.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image23.png" alt="simple implementation"></p>

<p>Sadly, this does not perform very well. But why? Looking at a trace reveals the answer - it’s heavily <strong>CPU overhead bound</strong>! What this means is that our CPU is not able to tell the GPU what to do fast enough for the GPU to be fully utilized.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image14.png" alt="trace"></p>

<p>Imagine the GPU as this super massive factory with a ridiculous amount of compute available. Then, imagine the CPU as some messenger shuttling instructions back and forth to the GPU. Remember, in large scale deep learning systems, the GPU is responsible for doing 100% of the work! In such systems, the only role of the CPU is to tell the GPU what work it should be doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image16.png" alt="factory"></p>

<p>So, the CPU runs over and tells the GPU to do an “add”, but by the time the CPU can give the GPU another chunk of work, the GPU has long finished the previous chunk of work.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the GPU needs to perform thousands of computations while the CPU only needs to do orchestration work, this is surprisingly common! There’s a variety of reasons for this, ranging from the fact that the CPU is likely running some single-threaded Python to the fact that GPUs are just incredibly fast nowadays.</p>

<p>Regardless of the reason, we now find ourselves in the <strong>overhead-bound regime</strong>. So, what can we do? One, we could rewrite our implementation in C++, perhaps even eschew frameworks entirely and write raw CUDA. Or…. we could just send more work to the GPU at once.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image3.png" alt="factory"></p>

<p>By just sending a massive chunk of work at once, we can keep our GPU busy! Although during training, this may just be accomplished by increasing your batch size, how do we do this during inference?</p>

<p>Enter torch.compile.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-reducing-cpu-overhead-through-torchcompile-and-a-static-kv-cache-1070-toks">Step 1: Reducing CPU overhead through torch.compile and a static kv-cache (107.0 tok/s)</h2>

<p>Torch.compile allows us to capture a larger region into a single compiled region, and particularly when run with mode=”reduce-overhead”, is very effective at reducing CPU overhead. Here, we also specify fullgraph=True, which validates that there are no “graph breaks” in your model (i.e. portions that torch.compile cannot compile). In other words, it ensures that torch.compile is running to its fullest potential.</p>

<p>To apply it, we <a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/generate.py#L296">simply wrap a function (or a module) with it</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code>torch.compile(decode_one_token, mode="reduce-overhead", fullgraph=True)
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, there are a couple of nuances here that make it somewhat nontrivial for folks to get significant performance boosts from applying torch.compile to text generation.</p>

<p>The first obstacle is the kv-cache. The kv-cache is an inference-time optimization that caches the activations computed for the previous tokens (see <a href="https://www.dipkumar.dev/becoming-the-unbeatable/posts/gpt-kvcache/">here</a> for a more in-depth explanation). However, as we generate more tokens, the “logical length” of the kv-cache grows. This is problematic for two reasons. One is that reallocating (and copying!) the kv-cache every time the cache grows is simply expensive. The other one is that this dynamism makes it harder to reduce the overhead, as we are no longer able to leverage approaches like cudagraphs.</p>

<p>To resolve this, we use a<a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/0afae1ace441ce4c5d02ef11a72da28cf7ca4795/generate.py#L154"> “static” kv-cache</a>, which means that we statically allocate the maximum size of the kv-cache, and then mask out the unused values in the attention portion of the computation.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image2.png" alt="code"></p>

<p>The second obstacle is the prefill phase. Transformer text generation is best thought of as a two phase process: 1. The prefill where the entire prompt is processed, and 2. Decoding where each token is generated autoregressively.</p>

<p>Although decoding can be made entirely static once the kv-cache is made static, the prefill stage still requires significantly more dynamism, due to having a variable prompt length. Thus, we actually need to compile the two stages with separate compilation strategies.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image9.png" alt="compile"></p>

<p>Although these details are a bit tricky, the actual implementation is not very difficult at all (see gpt-fast)! And the performance boost is dramatic.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image28.png" alt="chart"></p>

<p>All of a sudden, our performance improves by more than 4x! Such performance gains are often common when one’s workload is overhead bound.</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-how-is-torchcompile-helping">Sidenote: How is torch.compile helping?</h2>

<p>It is worth disentangling how exactly torch.compile is improving performance. There’s 2 main factors leading to torch.compile’s performance.</p>

<p>The first factor, like mentioned above, is overhead reduction. Torch.compile is able to reduce overhead through a variety of optimizations, but one of the most effective ones is called <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/">CUDAGraphs</a>. Although torch.compile applies this automatically for you when “reduce-overhead” is set, saving the extra work and code you need to write when doing this yourself manually  without torch.compile.</p>

<p>The second factor, however, is that torch.compile simply generates faster kernels. In the decoding benchmark above, torch.compile actually generates every single kernel from scratch, including both the matrix multiplications and the attention! And even cooler, these kernels are actually faster than the built in alternatives (CuBLAS and FlashAttention2)!</p>

<p>This may sound implausible to many of you, considering how hard it is to write efficient matrix multiplication/attention kernels, and how much manpower has been put into CuBLAS and FlashAttention. The key here, however, is that transformer decoding has very unusual computational properties. In particular, because of the KV-cache, for BS=1 <em>every single matrix multiplication in a transformer is actually a matrix vector multiplication</em>.</p>

<p>This means that the computations are completely <em>memory-bandwidth bound</em>, and as such, are well within the range of compilers to automatically generate. And in fact, when we benchmark torch.compile’s matrix-vector multiplications against CuBLAS, we find that torch.compile’s kernels are actually quite a bit faster!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image24.png" alt="code"></p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image17.png" alt="code"></p>

<h2 id="step-2-alleviating-memory-bandwidth-bottleneck-through-int8-weight-only-quantization-1574-toks">Step 2: Alleviating memory bandwidth bottleneck through int8 weight-only quantization (157.4 tok/s)</h2>

<p>So, given that we’ve already seen massive speedups from applying torch.compile, is it possible to do even better? One way to think about this problem is to compute how close we are to the theoretical peak. In this case, the largest bottleneck is the cost of loading the weights from GPU global memory to registers. In other words, each forward pass requires us to “touch” every single parameter on the GPU. So, how fast can we theoretically “touch” every single parameter in a model?</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image11.png" alt="weights"></p>

<p>To measure this, we can use <strong>Model Bandwidth Utilization (MBU).</strong> This measures what percentage of our memory bandwidth we’re able to use during inference.</p>

<p>Computing it is pretty simple. We simply take the total size of our model (# params * bytes per param) and multiply it by the number of inferences we can do per second. Then, we divide this by the peak bandwidth of the GPU to get our MBU.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image8.png" alt="MBU"></p>

<p>For example, for our above case, we have a 7B parameter model. Each parameter is stored in fp16 (2 bytes per parameter), and we achieved 107 tokens/s. Finally, our A100-80GB has a theoretical 2 TB/s of memory bandwidth.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image25.png" alt="MBU"></p>

<p>Putting this all together, we get **72% MBU! **This is quite good, considering that even just copying memory struggles to break 85%.</p>

<p>But… it does mean that we’re pretty close to the theoretical limit here, and that we’re clearly bottlenecked on just loading our weights from memory. It doesn’t matter what we do - without changing the problem statement in some manner, we might only be able to eek out another 10% in performance.</p>

<p>Let’s take another look at the above equation. We can’t really change the number of parameters in our model. We can’t really change the memory bandwidth of our GPU (well, without paying more money). But, we <strong>can</strong> change how many bytes each parameter is stored in!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image18.png" alt="MBU"></p>

<p>Thus, we arrive at our next technique - int8 quantization. The idea here is simple. If loading our weights from memory is our main bottleneck, why don’t we just make the weights smaller?</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image7.png" alt="MBU"></p>

<p>Note that this is quantizing <em>only</em> the weights - the computation itself is still done in bf16. This makes this form of quantization easy to apply with very little to no accuracy degradation.</p>

<p>Moreover, torch.compile can also easily generate efficient code for int8 quantization. Let’s look again at the above benchmark, this time with int8 weight-only quantization included.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image1.png" alt="code"></p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image27.png" alt="code"></p>

<p>As you can see from the dark blue line (torch.compile + int8), there is a significant performance improvement when using torch.compile + int8 weight-only quantization! Moreover, the light-blue line (no torch.compile + int8) is actually much worse than even the fp16 performance! This is because in order to take advantage of the perf benefits of int8 quantization, we need the kernels to be fused. This shows one of the benefits of torch.compile - these kernels can be automatically generated for the user!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/quantize.py#L314">Applying int8 quantization to our model</a>, we see a nice 50% performance improvement, bringing us up to 157.4 tokens/s!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image19.png" alt="chart"></p>

<h2 id="step-3-reframing-the-problem-using-speculative-decoding">Step 3: Reframing the problem using speculative decoding</h2>

<p>Even after using techniques like quantization, we’re still faced with another problem. In order to generate 100 tokens, we must load our weights 100 times.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image5.png" alt="diagram"></p>

<p>Even if the weights are quantized, we still must load our weights over and over, once for each token we generate! Is there any way around this?</p>

<p>At first glance, the answer might seem like no - there’s a strict serial dependency in our autoregressive generation. However, as it turns out, by utilizing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192">speculative decoding</a>, we’re able to break this strict serial dependency and obtain speedups!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image21.png" alt="engineers"></p>

<p>Imagine you had a senior engineer (called Verity), who makes the right technical decisions but is rather slow at writing code. However, you also have a junior engineer (called Drake), who doesn’t always make the right technical decisions but can write code much faster (and cheaper!) than Verity. How can we take advantage of Drake (the junior engineer) to write code faster while ensuring that we are still making the right technical decisions?</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image6.png" alt="engineers"></p>

<p>First, Drake goes through the labor-intensive process of writing the code, making technical decisions along the way. Next, we give the code to Verity to review.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image15.png" alt="engineers"></p>

<p>Upon reviewing the code, Verity might decide that the first 3 technical decisions Drake made are correct, but the last 2 need to be redone. So, Drake goes back, throws away his last 2 decisions, and restarts coding from there.</p>

<p>Notably, although Verity (the senior engineer) has only looked at the code once, we are able to generate 3 pieces of validated code identical to what she would have written! Thus, assuming Verity is able to review the code faster than it would have taken her to write those 3 pieces herself, this approach comes out ahead.</p>

<p>In the context of transformer inference, Verity would be played by the role of the larger model whose outputs we want for our task, called the <strong>verifier model</strong>. Similarly, Drake would be played by a smaller model that’s able to generate text much faster than the larger model, called the <strong>draft model</strong>. So, we would generate 8 tokens using the draft model, and then process all eight tokens in parallel using the verifier model, throwing out the ones that don’t match.</p>

<p>Like mentioned above, one crucial property of speculative decoding is that <strong>it does not change the quality of the output</strong>. As long as the time it takes for generating the tokens using the draft model + verifying the tokens is less than it would have taken to generate those tokens, we come out ahead.</p>

<p>One of the great things about doing this all in native PyTorch is that this technique is actually really easy to implement! Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/generate.py#L76">entirety of the implementation</a>, in about 50 lines of native PyTorch.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image10.png" alt="code"></p>

<p>Although speculative decoding guarantees that we have mathematically identical results compared to regular generation, it does have the property that the runtime performance varies depending on the generated text, as well as how aligned the draft and verifier model are. For example, when running CodeLlama-34B + CodeLlama-7B, we’re able to obtain a 2x boost in tokens/s for generating code. On the other hand, when using Llama-7B + TinyLlama-1B, we’re only able to obtain about a 1.3x boost in tokens/s.</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-running-this-on-amd">Sidenote: Running this on AMD</h2>

<p>Like mentioned above, every single kernel in decoding is generated from scratch by torch.compile, and is converted into OpenAI Triton. As AMD has a <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/experience-power-pytorch-2.0/">torch.compile backend</a> (and also a Triton backend), we can simply go through all of the optimizations above… but on an AMD GPU! With int8 quantization, we’re able to achieve 102.5 tokens/s with one GCD (i.e. one half) of a MI250x!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image4.png" alt="chart"></p>

<h2 id="step-4-reducing-the-size-of-the-weights-even-more-with-int4-quantization-and-gptq-2021-toks">Step 4: Reducing the size of the weights even more with int4 quantization and GPTQ (202.1 tok/s)</h2>

<p>Of course, if reducing the weights down from 16 bits to 8 bits allows for speedups by reducing the number of bytes we need to load, reducing the weights down to 4 bits would result in even larger speedups!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when reducing weights down to 4-bits, the accuracy of the model starts to become a much larger concern. From our preliminary evals, we see that although using int8 weight-only quantization has no perceptible accuracy degradation, using int4 weight-only quantization does.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image13.png" alt="table"></p>

<p>There are 2 main tricks we can use to limit the accuracy degradation of int4 quantization.</p>

<p>The first one is to have a more granular scaling factor. One way to think about the scaling factor is that when we have a quantized tensor representation, it is on a sliding scale between a floating point tensor (each value has a scaling factor) and an integer tensor (no values have a scaling factor). For example, with int8 quantization, we had one scaling factor per row. If we want higher accuracy, however, we can change that to “one scaling factor per 32 elements”. We choose a group size of 32 to minimize accuracy degradation, and this is also a common choice among the community.</p>

<p>The other one is to use a more advanced quantization strategy than simply rounding the weights. For example, approaches like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323">GPTQ</a> leverage example data in order to calibrate the weights more accurately. In this case, we prototype an implementation of GPTQ in the repository based off of PyTorch’s recently released <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_export_tutorial.html">torch.export</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, we need kernels that fuse int4 dequantize with the matrix vector multiplication. In this case, torch.compile is unfortunately not able to generate these kernels from scratch, so we leverage some handwritten CUDA kernels in PyTorch.</p>

<p>These techniques require some additional work, but putting them all together results in even better performance!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image12.png" alt="chart"></p>

<h2 id="step-5-combining-everything-together-2447-toks">Step 5: Combining everything together (244.7 tok/s)</h2>

<p>Finally, we can compose all of the techniques together to achieve even better performance!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image22.png" alt="chart"></p>

<h2 id="step-6-using-tensor-parallelism">Step 6: Using Tensor Parallelism</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve been restricting ourselves to minimizing latency while on a single GPU. In many settings, however, we have access to multiple GPUs. This allows us to improve our latency further!</p>

<p>To get an intuitive sense of why this would allow us to improve our latency, let’s take a look at the prior equation for MBU, particularly the denominator. Running on multiple GPUs gives us access to more memory bandwidth, and thus, higher potential performance.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image8.png" alt="MBU"></p>

<p>As for which parallelism strategy to pick, note that in order to reduce our latency for one example, we need to be able to leverage our memory bandwidth across more devices simultaneously. This means that we need to split the processing of one token across multiple devices. In other words, we need to use tensor parallelism.</p>

<p>Luckily, PyTorch also provides low-level tools for tensor-parallelism that compose with torch.compile. We are also working on higher-level APIs for expressing tensor parallelism, stay tuned for those!</p>

<p>However, even without a higher-level API, it’s actually still quite easy to add tensor parallelism. Our implementation comes in at <a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/tp.py">150 lines of code</a>, and doesn’t require any model changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image20.png" alt="code"></p>

<p>We are still able to take advantage of all the optimizations mentioned previously, which all can continue to compose with tensor parallelism. Combining these together, we’re able to serve Llama-70B at 55 tokens/s with int8 quantization!</p>

<p><img src="https://pytorch.org/assets/images/accelerating-generative-ai-2/image26.png" alt="chart"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at what we’re able to accomplish.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simplicity: Ignoring quantization, <a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/model.py">model.py</a> (244 LOC) + <a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/generate.py">generate.py</a> (371 LOC) + <a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast/blob/main/tp.py">tp.py</a> (151 LOC) comes out to 766 LOC to implement fast inference + speculative decoding + tensor-parallelism.</li>
  <li>Performance: With Llama-7B, we’re able to use compile + int4 quant + speculative decoding to reach 241 tok/s. With llama-70B, we’re able to also throw in tensor-parallelism to reach 80 tok/s. These are both close to or surpassing SOTA performance numbers!</li>
</ol>

<p>PyTorch has always allowed for simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility. However, with torch.compile, we can throw in performance as well.</p>

<p>The code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast">https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast</a>. We hope that the community finds it useful. Our goal with this repo is not to provide another library or framework for people to import. Instead, we encourage users to copy-paste, fork, and modify the code in the repo.</p>

This was causing all sorts of interruptions to our normal customer service. Gusto employees in the middle of answering customer emails or phone calls might suddenly find themselves without visibility into customers’ accounts necessary to do their jobs.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ExG_6KfMf8cUHrm9LmHDU2kBRAE_OMuKRAT7SO41Lp-kmih7BJ-kR9MNKHZwbo9qIqNgSRZ_52bRXbTKMlmeLv-TrMMUPMsOn2g-6YFjjdzA9MCcx9JtgZxt0eKFhc_133dVzHFJP36SIpGkQwTrIw" alt="Chrome browser showing crash error" loading="lazy" width="619" height="297"><figcaption><span>Chrome tab crash</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was fairly far outside the usual scope of our on-call issues. Our team is generally well-insulated by other teams from issues like browser compatibility, so I didn’t know the first thing about browser debugging. Where would I even begin? I leaned on a more experienced teammate, our product infrastructure team, and our IT team. </p><h2 id="the-first-clues">The first clues&nbsp;</h2><p>We started by trying to find out what the affected users had in common.</p><p>We learned rather quickly that:</p><ul><li>Not all Gusto employee users were affected.</li><li>Our customer-facing software did not appear to be affected.</li><li>Other internal software webpages appeared to be fine.</li><li>Crashing did not occur consistently. Users who experienced it could reload the same page multiple times, and sometimes it would crash and sometimes it would not.</li><li>Not all of our internal pages crashed, but more than one of them did, including our most heavily-trafficked pages.</li><li>The issue was not occurring with Safari or Firefox.</li></ul><h3 id="hunch-1-a-bad-chrome-version">Hunch #1: A bad Chrome version</h3><p>Our first hunch was that maybe it was the Chrome version. We had one affected user update their Chrome version, and early signs looked promising that the issue was resolved. However, we soon learned that although installing the new Chrome version decreased the frequency of crashing, it didn’t eliminate the issue.</p><p>We added the following new clues to our list:</p><ul><li>The specific Chrome version had already been released for a while.</li><li>We had affected users on different versions of Chrome.</li><li>We had affected users and unaffected users on the same version of Chrome.</li><li>Upgrading/downgrading the Chrome version for affected users did not fix the issue.</li></ul><h3 id="hunch-2-a-bad-chrome-extension">Hunch #2: A bad Chrome extension</h3><p>Okay, maybe it was a Chrome extension? We thought the crashing stopped when one of our users disabled three core extensions. When we tried to reproduce the fix with a guest profile (without extensions present), we still saw crashing. Back to the drawing board, then.</p><h2 id="trouble-reproducing-the-bug">Trouble reproducing the bug</h2><p>Our Infrastructure team put out a call to all of engineering to ask if anyone could reproduce the issue. Frustratingly, although many of our customer service representatives were affected, none of our engineering teams reported any crashes at all except for two engineers in Turkey. With precious little overlap in available pairing time due to time zone differences, we slowly learned the following over several weeks:</p><ul><li> For security reasons, we do not have Chrome crash reporting enabled.</li><li>Checking out code from several weeks prior did not fix the issue, which indicated that the cause was not a recent change.</li><li>Loading a static html version of a crashing page did not cause crashing.</li><li>Using open-source Chromium instead of Chrome did not cause crashes, so we couldn’t see what Chrome code was failing either.</li><li>Several different internal applications were causing Chrome to crash, not just one.</li><li>Removing all of the page-specific content from the page did not fix the issue.</li><li>Disabling our in-house font did not fix the issue.</li></ul><p>As urgency waned because our users were using other browsers as a workaround, progress on this bug slowed to make way for other priorities. We didn’t have much left to go on without being able to reproduce the bug. However, we wanted to resolve it since users had bookmarks/settings/preferences in Chrome. We believed that we shouldn’t have to ask our users to avoid the world’s most popular browser, and we were also still getting periodic pings from various users asking whether we had made any progress on this bug.</p><h2 id="a-stroke-of-good-luck">A stroke of good luck</h2><p>One day out of the blue, one of our Denver engineers reported being newly affected. The only change she had made was downloading the Grammarly desktop app.</p><p>Wait, really? We had to see if we could reproduce the bug.</p><ul><li>I downloaded the Grammarly desktop app too. Instant reproduction of the issue (at last!).</li><li>I deleted Grammarly. The issue didn’t go away. I restarted my computer and the issue went away again.</li><li>I reinstalled Grammarly. Chrome started crashing again.</li></ul><p>We also confirmed with many of our affected users that they had Grammarly installed on their computers. Now we were cooking with fire!</p><h2 id="making-headway">Making headway</h2><p>With our ability to debug now greatly improved, we started making tedious headway: make a change, reload the page ten times or until it crashes.</p><p>Our main internal application is built on ActiveAdmin, but newer parts of it use React without the same ActiveAdmin framework as the rest of the application. The pages that are built in React did not crash. Hmm, so maybe our ActiveAdmin code was causing the crashes?</p><p>We learned earlier that removing all page-specific content did not fix the issue, so we started looking at parts of the code that were common to multiple pages, like the main navigation header and sidebar. Notably, our React pages do not use the same navigation header.</p><p>The code for our main navigation bar has a fair amount of metaprogramming, and chasing down threads here was often more confusing than not. We eventually figured out how to comment out pieces of the navigation bar, until we pinpointed one line that stopped crashing Chrome when it was commented out:</p><pre><code>dropdown 'My History', [], turbo: true, src: '/navigation/my_history'
</code></pre><p>This section is called “My History” and it differs from the rest of the main navigation in that instead of being more-or-less the same for all users, it is customized for each user, displaying the handful of pages that each user has visited most recently. We discovered that even when the page loaded successfully, hovering over the “My History” section could cause Chrome to immediately crash.</p><h2 id="so-close-we-can-smell-it">So close we can smell it</h2><h3 id="hunch-3-turbo">Hunch #3: Turbo</h3><p>Then we looked at <code>turbo: true</code>. Could that be causing the issue? <a href="https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails?ref=engineering.gusto.com"><u>Turbo</u></a> is a gem we added to speed up our Rails application, but it turned out to be a red herring: it was only introduced after the bug had already been reported, and we learned that the engineer who introduced it had actually been experiencing these Chrome crashes for months prior to Turbo being introduced, and months prior to the bug being escalated to us.</p><p>Okay, so where was the dropdown being defined? We use a framework called <a href="https://activeadmin.github.io/arbre/?ref=engineering.gusto.com"><u>Arbre</u></a> to metaprogram html from this type of method. To navigate the internal plumbing, I turned to one of our engineers with deep Rails knowledge. In this case, the relevant code (once we finally found it) looked like this:</p><figure><pre><code>ul(class: 'dropdown-menu') do
  li(style: 'text-align: center;') { frontend_image_pack 'loaders/loader-spinner.gif' } if has_spinner
  menu_items.each do |item|
    li(id: "#{attributes[:id]}_#{item.id}") do
       text_node link_to item.name, item.url
     end
   end
 end</code></pre><figcaption><p><span>Rails code for drop down menu</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This code generates html that looked something like this:</p><figure><pre><code>&lt;ul class="dropdown-menu"&gt;
  &lt;li style="text-align: center;"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/vite-dev/images/loaders/loader-spinner.gif" /&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="recent_companies_123"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/companies/123"&gt;Totally Awesome Company A&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="recent_companies_124"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/companies/124"&gt;Even More Awesome Company B&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre><figcaption><p><span>HTML for drop down menu</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>We replaced the call to dropdown with the generated html, removing pieces of the new html until we zeroed in on the culprit.</p><h2 id="eureka">Eureka!</h2><p>When I removed <code>loader-spinner.gif</code>, the placeholder we display while the menu options load, the page stopped crashing.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Character Animation aims to generating character videos from still images through driving signals. Currently, diffusion models have become the mainstream in visual generation research, owing to their robust generative capabilities. However, challenges persist in the realm of image-to-video, especially in character animation, where temporally maintaining consistency with detailed information from character remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image, we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity, we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames. By expanding the training data, our approach can animate arbitrary characters, yielding superior results in character animation compared to other image-to-video methods. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on benchmarks for fashion video and human dance synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results.

          The overview of our method. The pose sequence is initially encoded using Pose Guider and fused with multi-frame noise, followed by the Denoising UNet conducting the denoising process for video generation. The computational block of the Denoising UNet consists of Spatial-Attention, Cross-Attention, and Temporal-Attention, as illustrated in the dashed box on the right. The integration of reference image involves two aspects. Firstly, detailed features are extracted through ReferenceNet and utilized for Spatial-Attention. Secondly, semantic features are extracted through the CLIP image encoder for Cross-Attention. Temporal-Attention operates in the temporal dimension. Finally, the VAE decoder decodes the result into a video clip.

Avocados occupy an interesting place among commercially popular fruits. Unlike most other fruit, avocados do not ripen on the tree—they only begin ripening off the tree after reaching full maturity. But then the race to ripeness is off and running, and, in the case of avocados, that race is relatively quick, with limited opportunities for long-term storage.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2">
These two facts put the concerns of commercial avocado growers, shippers, and vendors exactly opposite of those of the home cook. Those in the avocado industry want to find as many ways as possible to delay ripening of the picked fruit for as long as possible, buying them as much time as possible to get the avocados from the filed to your kitchen counter in good condition. Through lots of study, they've become pretty good at that—by lowering temperatures, reducing environmental oxygen and boosting carbon dioxide, shrink-wrapping or waxing the fruit, and other techniques, the avocado industry can manage to keep the fruit in its mature-but-unripe state all the way to the point of sale, despite significant shipping distances and other challenges.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4">
The home cook, on the other hand, usually wants to know how the heck to speed up ripening so they can eat the darned thing. This can present a timing challenge when shopping for and eating avocados because, to put it bluntly, perfectly ripe avocados are a pain in the ass to find. The window of time in which they are absolutely perfect—soft and tender with no brown spots or streaks—is notoriously short. It can make planning an avocado-based party a harrowing experience. <em>Will my avocados ripen in time for game day? What if they turn brown?</em>
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-6">
Fortunately, there are a few ways to moderate the rate at which they ripen, and then there are some ways other articles on this topic recommend, but we don't. Read on for more.<br>
</p>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-8"> <span> How to Choose a Quality Avocado When Shopping </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-9">
We've all seen those avocados that <em>seem</em> perfect on the outside, but once you cut into them, a series of deep brown stripes and striations appear. What's up with that?
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-11">
Unfortunately, it's not something that can be predicted or prevented. It's caused by uneven enzymatic action inside the avocado as it's developing and is exacerbated by extreme weather conditions and other seasonal, environmental, and agricultural factors.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-13">
For Hass avocados, you can expect the likelihood of this phenomenon to increase starting in December and maxing out around February. (Ack, Super Bowl season!)
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-16">
Another common flaw in some avocados are woody strings that stretch through the flesh. These strings are part of the plant's vascular strands, responsible for transporting nutrients into the fruit. They're actually always there, but they only become noticeably woody and stringy later in the season as the avocado becomes more mature.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18">
Unfortunately, just as with the brown spots, there's no way to predict which avocados will have these strands until you've cut into it, aside from knowing that the likelihood of encountering them goes up later in the growing season, with fruit harvested in the late summer and early fall (though this will vary depending on the avocado variety and growing region).
</p>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-20"> <span> How to Know If an Avocado Is Ripe </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-21">
While the color of the avocado's skin can change as ripening progresses, that is not a reliable way to determine perfect ripeness, since avocado skin color can vary from variety to variety and fruit to fruit. Better is to gauge ripeness by touch: Using your fingers, very gently press on the avocado near the stem end (that's where the avocado was once attached to the tree). You want to feel a slight tenderness and give. If the avocado is very firm, it's not ready; if it feels soft and mushy, it's gone too far.
</p>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-23"> <span> The Best Ways to Ripen Avocados: Tested </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-24">
Ripening in avocados and many other fruits is regulated by a gas called ethylene. It's produced naturally by the fruit itself and is intended to make sure that all the fruit in one area ripens at the same time. The higher the concentration of ethylene, the faster your fruit ripens. <em>That's</em> why you'll see instructions to leave underripe avocados or bananas in paper bags—it concentrates ethylene and causes fast ripening.
</p>

<figure id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-26">

<figcaption id="mntl-figure-caption_1-0-1">
<span><p>Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez</p></span>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-27">
Left on its own, it generally takes an underripe avocado somewhere in the range of three-to-five days when stored in a paper bag at room temperature. If you need your avocados sooner, you will need to turn to other fruit.
</p>

<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-29"> <span> How to Ripen Avocados Quickly </span> </h3>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-30">
In side-by-side tests tests, avocados from the supermarket showing no softness at all take between three-to-five days to ripen in a brown paper bag. Throw a banana in there (an ethylene powerhouse), and you can bring that range down to two-to-three days. It's not instant, but it does give you a wider range of control over having a ripe avocado when you need it.
</p>

<figure id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-32">

<figcaption id="mntl-figure-caption_1-0-2">
<span><p>Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez</p></span>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-33">
You could, for instance, buy several avocados, leaving some out in the open kitchen air, some in a brown paper bag, and yet a few more in a second brown paper bag with a banana added. By doing so, you'd stagger their ripeness-reaching days, with the banana-ripened avocados ready in a couple days, the paper bag ones a day or two after that, and the open-air ones ready right on the heels of those, assuming they all started at the same stage of un-ripeness.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-35"> <span> Can You Ripen an Avocado in the Microwave? </span> </h3>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-36">
This is one of those popular internet and social media tips that sound so good, we all just want to believe it's true. <em>You can rapidly ripen an avocado in the microwave?! Thank you, TikTok!</em>
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-38">
But we're sorry to say, having tried it ourselves, it's a terrible method.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-40">
The truth is, using the microwave (or a low oven for that matter) does not ripen an avocado at all, it <em>cooks</em> it. Indeed, there are similarities between cooking and ripening: In both cases the fruit's flesh softens as cell walls weaken, leading to a more tender texture. On top of that, new flavors and aromas develop. But the way the texture changes, and the nature of the flavor and aroma changes are not comparable between ripening and (even very, very gentle) cooking. While a properly ripened avocado grows buttery and creamy as time passes, a microwaved one becomes slick and sweaty, and soft like a lit candle—overly mushy in the hotter spots and still too firm in others.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-42">
The flavor of a microwaved avocado, though, is by far its greatest failing. We would describe it as re-warmed, undercooked chicken, a bizarre combination that somehow manages to smell simultaneously of the crudeness of raw poultry and <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-warmed-over-flavor-leftover-chicken-meat" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">stink of reheated poultry</a>. A microwaved avocado might be easier to chew, but it's not easier to swallow.
</p>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-44"> <span> How to Store Ripe Avocados for Later </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-45">
Once ripened, an avocado will start to produce brown spots and streaks within about two days if left at room temperature. However, refrigerating a ripened avocado can increase that window up to around five days, though avocados are susceptible to chilling damage, so the will begin to show signs of browning if left too long.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-47">
The best way to guarantee perfect avocados for a Sunday night game? Buy them the Monday before, ripen them at room temperature in a brown paper bag and refrigerate them as soon as they soften.
</p>

<h2 id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-49"> <span> How to Prevent Avocados From Browning </span> </h2>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-50">
What about leftover avocado? Any way to keep it from browning? Oxygen is the enemy of avocados—it's what causes them to turn that unsightly brown. Plastic wrap works alright on cut avocado halves, but even plastic wrap is oxygen-permeable. In our tests, avocados didn't last more than about eight hours wrapped in plastic before visible browning occurred.
</p>

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-52">
The old rub-with-oil-and-place-face-down-on-an-oiled-plate works fine if you've got a perfect half of an avocado with a smooth face, but it doesn't help if you've got, say, 3/4 or 1/4 of an avocado.

The better short-term solution in that situation? Just submerge the sucker in water. Simply put any unused avocado pieces in a container filled with water in the fridge to keep oxidation at bay, but do note you can't hold them there for long. After several hours, a ripe avocado will begin to grow mushy where water has managed to penetrate it.

<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-57">
As for mashed avocado like guacamole, we think the best solution, aside from preparing it right before serving, is to press a double layer of plastic wrap directly against the surface of the avocado mixture. It's not a perfect solution—the avocado will still brown eventually—but you can mix in a minimal amount of browning such that diners won't know, buying yourself at least a few hours before it becomes a problem.

<p>Google has agreed to pay Canadian news businesses $100 million a year to comply with the country's Online News Act, despite previously saying it would remove Canadian news links from search rather than make the required payments.</p>
<p>Google and government officials agreed to a deal that lets Google negotiate with a single news collective and reduce its overall financial obligation. Facebook owner Meta is meanwhile holding firm in its opposition to payments.</p>
<p>"Google will contribute $100 million in financial support annually, indexed to inflation, for a wide range of news businesses across the country, including independent news businesses and those from Indigenous and official-language minority communities," Minister of Canadian Heritage Pascale St-Onge said in a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/news/2023/11/statement-by-minister-st-onge-on-next-steps-for-the-online-news-act.html">statement</a> today.</p>
<p>The $100 million in Canadian currency is worth about $74 million in US currency. Before today's deal, the federal government <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/online-news-act-google-meta-1.6954656">estimated</a> that Google would have to pay $172 million a year.</p>
<p>"After extensive discussions, the Canadian Government agreed to a number of changes to address our deeply held concerns that C-18 would require payment for links and create uncapped financial liability through an unworkable bargaining process, simply for helping Canadians find relevant and useful information," Google said in a statement provided to Ars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-18/royal-assent">C-18 law</a> contains a "duty to bargain" requiring large search engines and social media services to negotiate payments with news businesses or groups of news businesses. In June, six months before the law's implementation, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/google-tells-canada-it-wont-pay-link-tax-will-pull-news-links-from-search/">Google said</a> it would not pay the "link tax" and instead would remove links to Canadian news sources from Google Search and Google News for users who access the services in Canada.</p>
<h2>Payments based on number of journalists</h2>
<p>Today, Google thanked St-Onge "for acknowledging our concerns and deeply engaging in a series of productive meetings about how they might be addressed." The resulting deal provides "a streamlined path to an exemption at a clear commitment threshold," <a href="https://blog.google/intl/en-ca/company-news/outreach-initiatives/an-update-on-canadas-bill-c-18-and-our-search-and-news-products/">Google said</a>.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"While we work with the government through the exemption process based on the regulations that will be published shortly, we will continue sending valuable traffic to Canadian publishers," Google said.</p>
<p>The Canadian government confirmed that Google will be allowed to negotiate with a single collective, instead of separately with multiple news organizations or groups of news organizations. "Google will have the option to work with a single collective to distribute its contribution to all interested eligible news businesses based on the number of full-time equivalent journalists engaged by those businesses," St-Onge said.</p>
<p>New rules to effect the change will be implemented before the Online News Act is enforced. St-Onge's announcement said the Canadian Heritage agency "will share more details about the final regulations following approval by the Treasury Board of Canada and prior to the Act coming into effect on December 19, 2023."</p>
<p>Google said that "under the revised regulations, there is a path for publishers to continue to receive valuable traffic... which Google can allocate through a deal with a single collective of its choosing. Importantly, this will allow Google to bypass the requirement to settle with publishers directly or individually, and any corresponding mandatory bargaining obligations."</p>
<h2>No Canadian news on Facebook</h2>
<p>Meta, the other company affected by the Online News Act, "ended its talks with the government last summer and stopped distributing Canadian news on Facebook and Instagram," the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/google-online-news-act-1.7043330">CBC noted</a> today.</p>
<p>Meta hasn't changed its stance. "Unlike search engines, we do not proactively pull news from the Internet to place in our users' feeds and we have long been clear that the only way we can reasonably comply with the Online News Act is by ending news availability for people in Canada," Meta told the CBC.</p>
<p>Canadian officials previously estimated that Facebook would have to pay $62 million a year, but the deal with Google suggests that Meta could lower that amount significantly. Meta reportedly hasn't resumed talks with the government.</p>
<p>"This [deal with Google] shows that this legislation works," St-Onge said, according to the CBC. "Now it's on Facebook to explain why they're leaving their platform to disinformation and misinformation instead of sustaining our news system."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As with the best science fiction, Lem’s novel “The Invincible” has as much to teach us about our present situations as any futures we may face.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-invincible_lead-image-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"></figure><p><em>In the grand tradition of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, Stanisław Lem’s “The Invincible” tells the story of a space cruiser sent to an obscure planet to determine the fate of a sister spaceship whose communication with Earth has abruptly ceased. Landing on the planet Regis III, navigator Rohan and his crew discover a form of life that has apparently evolved from autonomous, self-replicating machines — perhaps the survivors of a “robot war.” Rohan and his men are forced to confront the classic quandary: What course of action can humanity take once it has reached the limits of its knowledge? In “The Invincible,” Lem has his characters confront the inexplicable and the bizarre: the problem that lies just beyond analytical reach. </em></p><p><em>The following is literary critic and theorist N. Katherine Hayles’ foreword to the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262538473/the-invincible/" target="_blank">2020 edition of Lem’s classic novel</a>, which was originally published in Polish in 1964. </em></p><hr><p>Science fiction has famously predicted many of the important technologies of the 20th century: space travel, satellites, the atomic bomb, television, the internet, and virtual reality, to name a few. In “The Invincible,” Stanisław Lem predicts another: artificial life. Although speculations about self-reproducing artificial systems date from the 1940s, the scientific field received its name from Christopher Langton only in 1986, more than two decades after the original publication of “The Invincible” (1964). One of the central controversies in artificial life is whether evolutionary programs and devices are actually alive (the strong version), or whether they merely simulate life (the weak version). Researchers who follow the strong version argue that the processes embedded in software programs such as genetic algorithms are as “natural” as life itself; what is artificial is the medium in which these processes take place.</p><div><figure><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262538473/the-invincible/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" width="320" height="476" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-invincible-cover.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>This foreword first appeared in the 2020 English edition of Stanisław Lem’s novel “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262538473/the-invincible/" target="_blank">The Invincible</a>.”</figcaption></figure></div><p>The issue prompted Robert Rosen, among others, to speculate about the essential characteristics of “life itself,” not only as it evolved on Earth in carbon-based life forms but also about the possibility of life-as-it-could-be in exoplanetary systems, arguing that silicon-based artificial life forms may provide insight into these theoretical speculations.</p><p>“The Invincible” presents a fascinating hybridization of these different views. Dr. Lauda’s hypothesis proposes that a space ship from the Lycran system landed on Regis III millions of years ago; while the biological visitors perished, the automata did not. There then followed an evolutionary struggle between the automata and the planet’s indigenous life forms, on the one hand, and between the different kinds of automata, on the other. Such a scenario requires that the “survive and reproduce” mandate that governs life on Earth could also operate on this planet. Lem minimally fulfills the requirement by postulating that the automata could manufacture themselves with modifications dictated by evolutionary processes. Clearly his interest is not in filling out how this might take place (John von Neumann, encountering a similar problem, imagined metal parts floating on a lake that could self-assemble). Rather, Lem’s focus is on envisioning an artificial life form that won the evolutionary competition on Regis III for profoundly different reasons than did <em>Homo sapiens</em> on Earth.</p><p>The effect is achieved by introducing a significant factor that has a monumental impact on evolutionary trajectories: rather than fulfilling their energy needs through ingesting food, the automata on Regis III evolve to use solar power. The smaller the artificial organism, the less energy it needs. Hence the evolutionary driver is toward smaller forms, which overcome not through superior intellect but through swarm intelligence. Lem added to this the ability of the swarm of “flies” to generate immensely powerful electromagnetic fields, which meant that the tiny automata are not only the evolutionary winners on their planet but a powerful force against the invading humans. Their tiny size notwithstanding, their awesome potential illuminates the profound ambiguity of the work’s title, which can be taken to refer either to the spaceship’s proud name or to the swarms of alien automata that threaten it.</p><figure><blockquote><p>“From a broader cosmic perspective, the best of human science, engineering, and weaponry may reveal humans to be completely out of our depth, mere kindergarteners bidding for a place in the universe’s adult civilizations.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Contemporary research in artificial life has validated Lem’s insight that swarms of artificial beings require only a few simple rules to manifest complex behaviors and hence each member needs to carry only a little cognitive power onboard. Computer simulations that have accurately depicted swarm behaviors in fish, birds, bees, and other biota demonstrate that each individual responds only to the four or five closest to it, with rule sets that take up only a few lines of code. For example, a school of fish swimming to evade a predator is guided by the fish closest to the predator. The direction this most imperiled individual follows determines how the entire school will run as it flashes back and forth, a simple strategy that makes excellent sense, since the fish that has the most to lose will try hardest to escape. Although each fish’s behaviors are simple, the collective result nevertheless generates swarm intelligence of considerable complexity.</p><p>Decades before these ideas became disseminated within the scientific community, Lem intuited that different environmental constraints might lead to radically different evolutionary results in automata compared to biological life forms. Although on Earth the most intelligent species (i.e., humans) has tended to fare the best, their superior intelligence comes with considerable costs: a long period of maturation; a lot of resources invested in each individual; socialization patterns that emphasize pair bonding and community support; and a premium on individual achievement. But these are not cosmic universals, and different planetary histories might result in the triumph of very different kinds of qualities.</p><p>The contrasts between humans and the automata swarm are brought out most poignantly in the scene between Captain Horpach and First Officer Rohan, in which the captain delegates to Rohan the decision whether to put another crew member in grave danger to determine if the missing four men have indeed perished, as seems all but certain, or whether one or more might still be alive. The assumptions that make this gamble even remotely worth taking are revealing: human life is precious; human solidarity depends on the crew’s belief that everything possible will be done to save them if they are in peril; and every human is unique and therefore uniquely valuable. None of these, of course, holds true for the swarm, whose individual members are virtually identical to one another, with each tiny automaton easily replaced and therefore disposable. Consequently, none is valuable in itself; only the swarm has evolutionary survival value. The contest, then, is not only between different life forms but also between the different values that have resulted from the divergent evolutionary pathways of humans on Earth and the “flies” on this strange planet. As with “Solaris,” Lem suggests that assumptions born and bred of Earth may appear hopelessly provincial in light of human encounters with radically different life forms. From a broader cosmic perspective, the best of human science, engineering, and weaponry may reveal humans to be completely out of our depth, mere kindergarteners bidding for a place in the universe’s adult civilizations. The reduction of crew members to infancy when attacked by the “flies” may be a metaphor for this realization.</p><p>Of all the human characters, Rohan has the strongest claim to have encountered the planet on its own terms. He has traversed its terrain with his own feet; he has mixed his sweat with its crevices, valleys, and hills; he has breathed its native atmosphere into his lungs. The insight he gains from his heroic trek therefore commands our respect. When he concludes that “not everything everywhere is for us [humans],” we are right to hear in this pronouncement Lem’s own challenge to the anthropocentric assumptions that continue to dominate human ethical frameworks as well as human exploitations of planet Earth. As with the best science fiction, “The Invincible” has as much to teach us about our present situations as any futures we may face.</p><hr><p><em><strong>N.

            <span>Abstract:</span>A chief goal of artificial intelligence is to build machines that think like people. Yet it has been argued that deep neural network architectures fail to accomplish this. Researchers have asserted these models' limitations in the domains of causal reasoning, intuitive physics, and intuitive psychology. Yet recent advancements, namely the rise of large language models, particularly those designed for visual processing, have rekindled interest in the potential to emulate human-like cognitive abilities. This paper evaluates the current state of vision-based large language models in the domains of intuitive physics, causal reasoning, and intuitive psychology. Through a series of controlled experiments, we investigate the extent to which these modern models grasp complex physical interactions, causal relationships, and intuitive understanding of others' preferences. Our findings reveal that, while these models demonstrate a notable proficiency in processing and interpreting visual data, they still fall short of human capabilities in these areas. The models exhibit a rudimentary understanding of physical laws and causal relationships, but their performance is hindered by a lack of deeper insights-a key aspect of human cognition. Furthermore, in tasks requiring an intuitive theory of mind, the models fail altogether. Our results emphasize the need for integrating more robust mechanisms for understanding causality, physical dynamics, and social cognition into modern-day, vision-based language models, and point out the importance of cognitively-inspired benchmarks.

<p>A newly discovered system of six planets circling a nearby Sun-like star may be the key to unlocking how planetary systems form. All between the size of Earth and Neptune, the worlds are orbiting in a so-called resonant chain — a configuration that it’s relatively rare to observe in nature, making the system a valuable find that offers a window into a uniquely “gentle” history. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The discovery was published today in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06692-3">Nature</a></em>.</p>



<h2><strong>Links in a chain</strong></h2>



<p>The planets’ path to discovery spawned from an initial detection in 2020 by NASA’s <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/tess-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-nasas-latest-planet-hunter/">Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)</a>, which searches for dips in brightness as planets cross in front of their parent star. At that time, based on the dips, researchers were able to confirm one planet and posit a second possible world.</p>



<p>But TESS only observes a given patch of sky for about two months before moving on; it doesn’t return for two years. TESS finally observed the star again in 2022, yielding more transits. This revealed a sure second planet, but there were still more transits than could be explained by two worlds.</p>



<p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/ask-astro-how-many-exoplanets-does-the-transit-method-miss/">How many exoplanets does the transit method miss? </a></p>



<p>So, the team turned to a different telescope: the European Space Agency’s CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (Cheops), to observes the star without the limitations of a survey timetable. Using Cheops, they watched for additional transits from further planets. And after five or six observations, “we got a hit, like a battleship,” said study co-author Hugh Osborn, CHESS Fellow at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics in the U.S. and the University of Bern in Switzerland, during a press briefing Tuesday morning.</p>



<p>They’d found a third planet. Looking at the orbits together, the researchers noticed something intriguing. Each planet’s orbital period was related to the next in line: The inner planet (called b) orbits every 9.114 days, the next planet out (c) every 13.673 days, and the last (d) every 20.519 days. Each of those periods is about 1.5 times the next, meaning the planets are in a configuration called a 3:2 (pronounced “three to two”) mean motion resonance. For every three orbits of the innermost world, b, the next planet out (c) makes two. Then, for every three orbits of c, d makes two.</p>



<p>The team followed the pattern to look for more worlds in this “resonant chain.” First, they modeled how often various additional planets in different resonances would transit, picking out the configurations that were most stable.</p>



<p>Then, they went looking for the transits they expected from those models — and found three more planets: e, f, and g, with periods of 30.793, 41.059, and 54.770 days, respectively. The entire system could fit inside the orbit of Mercury.</p>



<p>In all, the innermost four planets are in a 3:2 resonance. The outer planets f and g are in 4:3 resonance — for every four orbits of the planet interior to it, next planet out makes three full revolutions. Overall, for every six orbits the innermost planet b makes, the outermost planet g makes one full revolution.</p>



<p>“Often we make the predictions and nature finds a way to do something else, to not quite match what we expect,” said Osborn. But in this case, nature was spot-on. Osborn recalled he was “shocked and delighted” when they began spotting planets transiting right when their models suggested: “My jaw was on the floor.”</p>

<h2><strong>Seeking sub-Neptunes</strong></h2>



<p>The planets circle HD 110067, a star similar to our Sun, with roughly 80 percent its size and mass. It is located in the constellation Coma Berenices, now visible in the early-morning sky in the east above Venus (in Virgo) in the hours before sunrise.</p>



<p>Just 100 light-years away, HD 110067 has an apparent magnitude of 8.4. That makes it the brightest star now known to host four or more planets, outshining the famous red dwarf <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/this-tiny-solar-system-packs-in-seven-earth-size-planets/">TRAPPIST-1</a> by some 10,000 times at optical wavelengths, said Osborn.</p>



<p>Further, TRAPPIST-1’s seven planets are all <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/trappist-1-cs-atmosphere-is-not-like-venus/">rocky worlds with thin atmospheres</a> — if any at all. HD 110067’s six known planets have cores of ice or rock but also thick, extended atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. All are some two to three times the diameter of Earth.</p>



<p>The team knows this based on the planets’ densities, which are calculated from size and mass. But transits only give a planet’s size, based on how much light it blocks. To get masses, the team used a different technique, called radial velocity, which measures the subtle “wobbles” in a star induced as orbiting planets tug it this way and that. “You can imagine that with six planets, this was a mess,” said co-author Enric Palle of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in Tenerife, Spain.</p>



<p>More than 100 radial velocity observations provided enough information to measure three of the planets’ masses, while placing upper limits on the remaining three. And once astronomers know a planet’s size and mass, they can calculate its density, which reveals the type of planet it is — in this case, worlds with some rock and extended atmospheres that are more like Neptune than Earth. Thus, they are called sub-Neptunes. (Neptune is 3.88 times as wide as Earth.) Planets larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune with densities more suggestive of largely rock with a thin atmosphere, such as TRAPPIST-1’s gaggle, are called super-Earths.</p>



<p>Our solar system has no planets of either type, but they are the most commonly found exoplanets when surveying other stars.</p>

<h2><strong>A key system</strong></h2>



<p>How does a system of planets end up orbiting in perfect mathematical ratios at all? This is likely how planetary systems begin, the team said, reflecting the initial conditions left when the protoplanetary disk that forms the planets eventually disappears. Such resonant chains should be exceedingly common in nature — but they’re not. That’s because over time, chaotic events such as passing stars, meteor impacts, and wandering giant planets muddy any resonances until they are gone.</p>



<p>But HD 110067’s resonant chain has persisted for the billions of years since these planets formed, indicating “the evolution of this system has been very quiet, very gentle,” said lead author Rafael Luque of the University of Chicago.</p>



<p>Ultimately, about 1 percent of all planetary systems are still orbiting in resonance. We know of some 40 or 50, the team said. And this isn’t the first six-planet resonant system discovered.</p>



<p>Yet HD 110067 still stands out. In addition to its pristine orbital configuration, the star is very bright and there are six planets, all with substantial atmospheres. This makes it a prime target for the James Webb Space Telescope to peer through the atmospheres of these planets as they transit, looking for the presence of molecules such as methane, carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Doing so will not only tell us the composition of the planets’ atmospheres, but also their interiors as well, including whether they might contain plentiful water.</p>



<p>Perhaps most compelling, this system provides the perfect testbed for studying how sub-Neptunes form and planetary systems evolve without outside influences. Each of the six planets formed from the same material, started from the same initial conditions, and has experienced the same history as its peers. Astronomers can compare these worlds to each other to study how subtle differences in size, mass, temperature, and distance from their star might affect the evolution of planets in the absence of any other factors.</p>



<p>In HD 110067 and its planets, Luque said, astronomers have a single, perfect testbed — a “controlled experiment … that is going to set us up to learn so much in the coming years.”</p>

<p dir="auto">yabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS.
yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd">↗&nbsp;skhd</a> and other third-party software.</p>
<p dir="auto">The primary function of yabai is tiling window management; automatically modifying your window layout using a binary space partitioning algorithm to allow you to focus on the content of your windows without distractions.
Additional features of yabai include focus-follows-mouse, disabling animations for switching spaces, creating spaces past the limit of 16 spaces, and much more.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US Senator Ron Wyden <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-urges-justice-department-to-release-information-about-hemisphere-phone-surveillance-program-that-would-outrage-americans-and-congress" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wants the public;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">wants the public</a> to know about the details surrounding the long-running Hemisphere phone surveillance program. Wyden has written US Attorney General Merrick Garland a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_hemisphere_surveillance_letter_112023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:letter;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">letter</a> (PDF), asking him to release additional information about the project that apparently gives law enforcement agencies access to trillions of domestic phone records. In addition, he said that federal, state, local and Tribal law enforcement agencies have the ability to request "often-warrantless searches" from the project's phone records that <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-26-atandt-reportedly-spies-on-its-customers-for-government-cash.html" data-ylk="slk:AT&amp;T has been collecting;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0">AT&amp;T has been collecting</a> since 1987.</p><p>The Hemisphere project first came to light in 2013 when <em>The New York Times</em> reported that the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was paying AT&amp;T to mine and keep records of its customers' phone calls. Four billion new records are getting added to its database every day, and a federal or state law enforcement agency can request a query with a subpoena that they can issue themselves. Any law enforcement officer can send in a request to a single AT&amp;T analyst based in Atlanta, Georgia, Wyden's letter says, even if they're seeking information that's not related to any drug case. And apparently, they can use Hemisphere not just to identify a specific number, but to identify the target's alternate numbers, to obtain location data and to look up the phone records of everyone who's been in communication with the target.</p><p>The project has been defunded and refunded by the government several times over the past decade and was even, at one point, receiving federal funding under the name "Data Analytical Services (DAS)." Usually, projects funded by federal agencies would be subject to a mandatory Privacy Impact Assessment conducted by the Department of Justice, which means their records would be made public.</p><p>However, Hemisphere's funding passes through a middleman, so it's not required to go through mandatory assessment. To be specific, ONDCP funds the program through the Houston High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, which is a regional funding organization that distributes federal anti-drug law grants and is governed by a board made up of federal, state and local law enforcement officials. The DOJ had provided Wyden's office with "dozens of pages of material" related to the project in 2019, but they had been labeled "Law Enforcement Sensitive" and cannot be released to the public.</p><p>"I have serious concerns about the legality of this surveillance program, and the materials provided by the DOJ contain troubling information that would justifiably outrage many Americans and other members of Congress," Wyden wrote in his letter. "While I have long defended the government’s need to protect classified sources and methods, this surveillance program is not classified and its existence has already been acknowledged by the DOJ in federal court. The public interest in an informed debate about government surveillance far outweighs the need to keep this information secret."</p></div></div>]]></description>

	<p>On 22 November, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231117IPR12219/child-sexual-abuse-online-meps-ready-to-start-negotiations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the European Parliament officially adopted its position on the draft ‘Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse’</a> (CSAR). With strong support for this position from all seven European political groups, this marks a <b>positive</b><b> </b><b>development </b><b>for human rights </b><b>in one of the most controversial draft E</b><b>uropean</b><b> </b><b>Union (EU)</b><b> laws in recent memory</b>.</p>
<p>EDRi has long advocated against the <b>CSAR’s </b><b>mass scanning and encryption-breaking measures</b> proposed in 2022 by the EU executive’s unit for home affairs. We are reassured, therefore, that the Parliament has listened to the evidence and the rule of law. At the same time, <b>we are still </b><b>far from the end of the</b><b> legislative process.</b> This means that we must stay alert to how the other two law-making institutions – the Council of EU Member States and the European Commission – respond. Will they agree with the Parliament that new EU laws need to respect fundamental rights? Or will they double down on ‘Chat Control’?</p>
<h3>The position of the European Parliament</h3>
<p>As we explained when <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/">this position was </a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provisionally agreed</a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/"> by the </a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/">Parliament’s</a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/"> Civil Liberties </a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/">C</a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/">ommittee </a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/">on 14</a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/eu-parliament-committee-rejects-mass-scanning-of-private-and-encrypted-communications/"> November</a>, it is a clear political statement that <b>even </b><b>the most </b><b>important </b><b>societal </b><b>aims do not justify measures at any cost.</b> EU fundamental rights law requires that limitations on people’s rights are necessary for the aim they seek to achieve – including being objectively effective and the least intrusive possible – and proportionate. That means that their broader impact must be reasonable.</p>
<p>On this basis, <b>the Parliament firmly rejected </b><b>rules which would force companies to scan huge volumes of people’s private messages </b>– instead now requiring there to be reasonable suspicion. <a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230426-opinion-legal-services-on-csar-proposal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawyers for the Council of EU Member States </a><a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230426-opinion-legal-services-on-csar-proposal.pdf">had </a><a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230426-opinion-legal-services-on-csar-proposal.pdf">previously</a><a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230426-opinion-legal-services-on-csar-proposal.pdf"> made </a>a<a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230426-opinion-legal-services-on-csar-proposal.pdf">n</a><a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230426-opinion-legal-services-on-csar-proposal.pdf"> unprecedented warning</a> that the original proposal would violate the essence of the right to privacy. In EU-speak, this is a damning assessment, because case law from the Court of Justice of the EU has always upheld that while rights can be limited for justifiable reasons, <b>the “essential core” of any human right must never be violated.</b> The Parliament has clearly listened to this warning.</p>
<h3>EDRi’s work and coalition</h3>
<p>Since before the home affairs unit (DG HOME) first put forward this law, <b>EDRi has been </b><b>on the front lines </b>urging the EU to ensure that measures to tackle the serious crime of child sexual abuse are in line with human rights rules. Yet our ‘<a href="https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-10-principles-to-defend-children-in-the-digital-age/">10 principles to </a><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-10-principles-to-defend-children-in-the-digital-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defend children in the digital age</a>’ were ignored in the original legislative proposal (so too were <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/leaked-opinion-of-the-commission-sets-off-alarm-bells-for-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/">concerns from the Commission’s own review board</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks to the <b>EDRi-led <a href="https://stopscanningme.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stop Scanning Me</a> campaign</b>, thousands of people across Europe have since sounded the alarm about the draft measures. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Aeex72MtFBjKhExRTooVMWN9TC-pbH-5LEaAbMF91Y/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientists and researchers across the world</a> have been unambiguous that as proposed, the measures would undermine encryption, putting everyone’s digital information at risk of harm. And <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/most-criticised-eu-law-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other stakeholders</a> such as journalists, youth activists, lawyers and survivors’ associations have warned how they could be put at risk by the proposal.</p>

<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>As their position has been officially adopted, <b>the European Parliament is ready to enter “trilogues”</b>. This is closed-door negotiations between lead Parliamentarians and the Council of EU Member State governments. However, in this case, the <b>Council does not </b><b>currently </b><b>have </b><b>a</b><b> negotiating mandate with which to enter the trilogues</b>. In fact, <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2023/internes-protokoll-immer-mehr-eu-staaten-gegen-unverhaeltnismaessige-chatkontrolle/#2023-10-18_AA_AStV_CSAR_Weisung" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Member State governments have been divided on the issue</a>, with <b>some countries refusing to listen to technological </b><b>and</b><b> legal </b><b>reality</b><b>.</b> Fortunately, many others have stood up against their colleagues, rightly warning that the <b>EU cannot give a </b><i><b>carte blanche </b></i><b>to the destruction of digital security</b>, privacy and anonymity.</p>
<p>Back in July, <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/council-poised-to-endorse-mass-surveillance-as-official-position-for-csa-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDRi urged Member State governments not to agree</a> to a position which would usher in the mass surveillance of everyone’s digital private lives. People subsequently took to the streets in Germany, Sweden and several other locations to urge their governments not to accept ‘Chat Control’. These efforts paid off, with the <b>governments of Germany, Austria, Poland, Estonia and Slovenia <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2023/internes-protokoll-immer-mehr-eu-staaten-gegen-unverhaeltnismaessige-chatkontrolle/#2023-10-18_AA_AStV_CSAR_Weisung">reportedly</a> taking a firm stance against the misguided proposal, and France </b><b>subsequently raising major concerns.</b></p>



<p><b>W</b><b>ithout a Council position, the legislative process for the CSAR is currently in limbo</b>. The Spanish Presidency of the Council is reportedly attempting to push through a position before the end of their mandate (end December 2023). But at the time of writing, they do not have a text on the table – let alone political agreement from a sufficient number of Member States.</p>
<p>Even if the Council is able to agree their position soon, <b>it is highly unlikely that they would be able to pass </b><b>the </b><b>law </b><b>during this political mandate</b><b>.</b> That’s because we are approaching a once-in-five-years event: European elections. In June 2024, a new Parliament will be elected, and subsequently, a new set of European Commissioners will be appointed. According to <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-institutions/news/leak-eu-parliament-sets-deadlines-for-closing-files-under-this-mandate/">leaked documents</a>, this means that <b>any </b><b>negotiations between the legislative institutions must wrap up by early February 2024.</b></p>
<p>Whilst trilogue negotiations on even simple laws can take months, <b>it would be unprecedented for such a complex and sensitive file </b><b>as CSAR</b><b> – with so </b><b>much </b><b>at stake – to be pushed through in </b><b>such a</b><b> short time.</b> This current limbo also means that the political figurehead for the CSAR, controversial Swedish Commissioner Ylva Johansson, is unlikely to remain in post for this proposal’s life-cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://edri.org/our-work/european-commission-must-uphold-privacy-security-and-free-expression-by-withdrawing-new-law/">EDRi has consistently advocated</a> that laws to tackle CSA online must be in line with fundamental rights law and with objective evidence of effectiveness. With this latest step, the European Parliament has firmly rebutted DG HOME’s attempt to pass a law which bitterly fails on both of these counts. Whilst the next steps for this law are not clear, this is nevertheless a huge milestone for the protection of digital human rights, and <b>we are counting on the Council not to go backwards.</b></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Generalist foundation models such as GPT-4 have displayed surprising capabilities in a wide variety of domains and tasks. Yet, there is a prevalent assumption that they cannot match specialist capabilities of fine-tuned models. For example, most explorations to date on medical competency benchmarks have leveraged domain-specific training, as exemplified by efforts on BioGPT and Med-PaLM. We build on a prior study of GPT-4's capabilities on medical challenge benchmarks in the absence of special training. Rather than using simple prompting to highlight the model's out-of-the-box capabilities, we perform a systematic exploration of prompt engineering. We find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks. The prompting methods we explore are general purpose, and make no specific use of domain expertise, removing the need for expert-curated content. Our experimental design carefully controls for overfitting during the prompt engineering process. We introduce Medprompt, based on a composition of several prompting strategies. With Medprompt, GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine of the benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. The method outperforms leading specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by a significant margin with an order of magnitude fewer calls to the model. Steering GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves a 27% reduction in error rate on the MedQA dataset over the best methods to date achieved with specialist models and surpasses a score of 90% for the first time. Beyond medical problems, we show the power of Medprompt to generalize to other domains and provide evidence for the broad applicability of the approach via studies of the strategy on exams in electrical engineering, machine learning, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology.
