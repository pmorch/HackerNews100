<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a few months since I deleted a lot of apps on my phone and instead installed many restrictive apps to control my insatiable <em>scrolling</em> addiction.</p>
<h2>Fighting the interconnected reality</h2>
<p>There are simply too many means to escapism in one's electronic devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Content apps: Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.
</li>
<li>
Work apps: Slack, Workplace, etc
</li>
<li>
All these apps have moderate web apps, so no getaway while you have an easily accessible browser on your phone
</li>
<li>
You can easily login to these websites on your work laptop
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is hyper-connected and available at all times to occupy us. Wouldn't people prone to procrastination, such as myself, naturally choose to enter the rabbit hole if everything is at their fingertips? I think they would. At least, I did so.</p>
<h2>Do I need all these means of viewing content and scrolling at all times?</h2>
<p>Probably not. Let's experiment.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delete content apps
<ul>
<li>
Entertainment: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit
</li>
<li>
Information databases: GoodReads, StoryGraph, IMDB
</li>
<li>
Messaging: Gmail, Slack
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete the browser from the phone
<ul>
<li>
Chrome, or rather disable it, because deleting it is not an option on my Android phone
</li>
<li>
Google, a super-app on Android phones with the browsing feature
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete personal profile/browser from the work laptop
<ul>
<li>
I used to have "Arc" browser on my work laptop with my personal Google account profile
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some early-stage issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Sharing a link/content from the work laptop to a personal space got more difficult. However, it's not a frequent problem.
</li>
<li>
I lost access to some services I used with my personal account. It was more convenient to do a simple task while working on my corporate laptop. Again, a problem that one can get used to.
</li>
<li>Deleting Chrome browser and Google apps caused worse problems
<ul>
<li>
I didn't even realize until then that some separate apps rely on the Google super-app. Like the weather app or some functionalities of the translation app! I lost access to these functionalities with disabling the super-app.
</li>
<li>
In some rare cases, the web app is better than the native Android app. I lost the ability to use them because I didn't have a browser anymore.
</li>
<li>
Some bank transfers need the browser page for authentication. Rarely, some other operations get blocked too without a browser.
</li>
<li>
Some quick, simple tasks don't need a whole Android app, a browser can handle them. But without a browser, those simple tasks become cumbersome.
</li>
<li>
Without the Email app, it's difficult to quickly access a ticket or receipt when you need it outdoors, away from your laptop.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Deleting the personal account browser from the work laptop was successful. After a while, I got used to the minor inconveniences. More importantly, I removed some easily accessible procrastination tools from my professional workflow. No more checking personal emails, running quick online errands, or look something up.
</li>
<li>
Deleting work feeds from my phone was also successful. I realized I don't really need Slack, Gmail and Workplace apps all the time. It helped me set healthy boundaries with work. Now I only check my messages when I'm behind my desk and I'm not busy with focused, deep work.
</li>
<li>
Deleting content apps from my phone was another successful attempt. I've tried this method now and then. This time, I stuck with it once and for all.
</li>
<li>Deleting the browser apps from my phone proved more problematic, though. It impeded some daily operations with my phone.
<ul>
<li>
Some actions became impossible, as I mentioned in the previous part
</li>
<li>
To resolve that, I had to return to having browser apps on my phone, but with new restrictions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Later modifications</h4>
<p>To resolve the complications of not having a browser on my phone, I took these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimal launch UI to break my habits:
<ul>
<li>
The new UI is a simplistic black screen with no widgets or app icons
</li>
<li>This app can restrict other apps or hide an app from the view
<ul>
<li>
For example, I use this feature to enable the Google super-app, but hide it completely. So it's difficult for me to open it directly.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A more advanced website blocker and set restrictions on social media and browsing websites
<ul>
<li>
An interesting method I found in this app was to block distracting websites based on the location. I set them to be blocked at home, where I spend most of my focused time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new browser instead of Chrome
<ul>
<li>
Doing this helped me break some old habits I've formed over the years with a browser I'm used to. For example, the Google ecosystem knew me too well and constantly recommended articles to me to click on. A new browser without this historical data helped me to focus on the task at hand instead of getting distracted by the shiny, new, but useless information online.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>After a few months of making the above changes and applying some adjustments, I'm seeing its effects. I still procrastinate, however, my devices can't lure me into the rabbit hole anymore. I have more control over what's available to me and I have an easier time choosing the alternatives over infinite scrolling.</p>
<p>These days when I spend time on my phone, I usually play "Spelling Bee," a game I enjoy and it has a daily "end" state unlike the infinite content apps. When I reach that point, I know that there isn't much to do with my phone. I always wanted to expand my reading time but never got to do that with the constant exposure to easy content. It's been a while that I'm able to choose to read when I'm looking for something to do besides work and chores.</p>
<p>I constantly need to find new ways to constrain my media consumption addictions, but I'm happy with my efforts. When it works, I feel saner and calmer and I do what I actually enjoy doing with my time. And if not, at least I'm doing what I need to do.</p>

<p>On the day of Trump’s second presidential inauguration, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/21/instagram-democrat-hashtags-blocked-search">Instagram censored search results</a> for the most popular hashtags associated with American Democrats, like “#Democrat”, “#PresidentBiden”, “#VoteBlue”, “#MichelleObama”, “#Kamala”, and dozens more. This ban lasted for 9 total hours and affected users worldwide, regardless of their content settings. During that same time, Instagram was displaying full search results for “#Republican”, “#Trump”, “#VoteRed”, “#PresidentTrump”, and every other popular Republican hashtag I tried. I found about 50 censored political tags related to Democrats, but every Republican tag was still working fine. </p>



<figure><a href="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-1024x576.jpg" alt="Search results for #Biden on Instagram have no results, while search for #Trump shows a full collection of photos and videos." srcset="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-300x169.jpg 300w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-768x432.jpg 768w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden-480x270.jpg?crop=1 480w, https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/instagram-censoring-biden.jpg 1828w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>The removal of these pro-Democrat hashtags started on the evening of January 20th, 2025, coincidentally a few hours after Trump signed the “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/">Restoring Freedom Of Speech</a>” executive act. These censored results lasted for about 9 hours, then went back to normal at around 5 am PST. I want to state again that these words were censored for all Instagram users on the website and app regardless of that user’s content settings or their location.</p>



<figure><a href="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08%E2%80%AFAM.png"><img decoding="async" width="515" height="207" src="https://docpop.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-21-at-11.12.08%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="A screenshot from man-vs-spider on Reddit that says &quot;

<p>Meta claimed this was a technical “error” affecting hashtags “across the political spectrum,” but this is demonstrably false. I searched through the most popular hashtags used by Democrats and Republicans last night and found that the majority of Democrat terms were being censored, while none of the popular Republican tags were affected. This selective censorship is a scary look into Meta’s updated content moderation practices and its potential alignment with the new administration.</p>



<p>The following hashtags were actively blocked by Instagram on the first day of Trump’s second presidency. While they are now searchable again, I personally confirmed all of these hashtags were inaccessible last night:</p>



<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Barack</li>



<li>BarackObama</li>



<li>Bernie</li>



<li>BernieSanders</li>



<li>Biden</li>



<li>Constitution</li>



<li>Democrat</li>



<li>Democrats</li>



<li>DNC</li>



<li>Fascism</li>



<li>FuckTrump </li>



<li>Insurrection</li>



<li>Jan6th</li>



<li>JohnOliver</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul>
<li>JoeBiden</li>



<li>Kamala</li>



<li>Leftist</li>



<li>Liberal</li>



<li>Liberals</li>



<li>MichelleObama</li>



<li>Obama</li>



<li>OccupyDemocrats</li>



<li>PresidentBiden</li>



<li>PresidentObama</li>



<li>Queer</li>



<li>ReproductiveRights</li>



<li>VoteBlue</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>And those were just the ones I could find yesterday. I’m sure there are many more. Instagram is still blocking other hashtags like ProChoice, GeorgeConway (a writer critical of Trump), JackSmith (the special counsel against Trump), 14thAmendment, and Drumpf. It’s possible those words were already being censored before Trump’s inauguration, so I didn’t include them on the list above.</p>



<p>During that same 9-hour window, I confirmed the following words were <strong>not</strong> being censored on IG:</p>



<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>AltRight</li>



<li>DonaldJTrump</li>



<li>DonaldTrump</li>



<li>FuckObama</li>



<li>FuckBiden</li>



<li>FuckKamala</li>



<li>LetsGoBrandon</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul>
<li>MelaniaTrump</li>



<li>PresidentTrump</li>



<li>Republican</li>



<li>RNC</li>



<li>Trump</li>



<li>VoteRed</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>Those words all worked. You couldn’t search for FuckTrump, but you could search for FuckObama or FuckBiden. Trump was searchable, but Biden, Kamala, Bernie, and Obama were not. You could search for MelaniaTrump, but not MichelleObama. PresidentTrump still showed millions of results, while discussions of PresidentBiden were marked as “sensitive content”. </p>



<p>We don’t know what caused Meta to censor these words, but we do know this was not affecting “both sides.”. This was an extremely targeted list of censored words.</p>



<p>As a contrast, I saw several claims on Threads and IG that TikTok was also heavily censoring content. I tested it out for myself and was still fully able to search for words like “Fascist,” “Fascism,” “Democrat,” and “Trump”. I was also able to post pro-Palestinian content like “Free Palestine” without having the post removed. If TikTok is censoring content, they are being more clever about it than Instagram is. </p>



<p>Though we can prove that Instagram was censoring certain hashtags last night, we can’t say why they were doing it. It’s possible this really was a computer error with no human oversight, but I’ve never heard of a computer bug that only affects people based on their political affiliation. </p>



<p>To understand why this happened, take a look at the context surrounding it. Last year, Trump accused Zuckerberg of election interference and threatened <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-once-threatened-jail-112328545.html">to lock Mark up “for life”</a>. After Trump won the election, Zuckerberg started a series of regular visits to Mar-a-Lago for private meetings with the President-Elect. Last week, Zuckerberg announced big changes to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-instagram-meta-changes-dei-fact-checkers-dana-white-rcna187370">Meta’s content moderation team</a> and added Dana White (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-dana-white-ufc-trump-ally-meta-board-zuckerbeg-2025-1">a Trump loyalist</a>) to Meta’s board. Yesterday, Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-inaugural-brings-worlds-billionaire-elites-en-masse-dc-2025-01-21/">attended Trump’s inauguration along with</a> Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Shou Zi Chew, and several other of the richest tech oligarchs. </p>



<p>With all of that in mind, I find it unlikely that an Instagram error selectively silencing Trump’s political opponents would coincidentally occur on the first day of his second presidency. Given the state of *gestures broadly at everything around me*, I believe that Meta has many systems in place to quickly silence Trump’s political opponents, and last night we saw one of those systems being used. If Meta really did have an “error” yesterday, it was probably that they activated that system too early. </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The number zero was invented against a backdrop of numbering systems which don't have placeholders.  So instead of "nothing in the tens place" they would just omit that place entirely and provide a different kind of thing instead.  Roman numerals do this, they just make 10 and 100 fundamentally different by using X or C instead.</p>
<p>Along these lines, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-12-20/knots-representing-numbers-the-mathematics-of-the-incas.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">knots have been used</a> as a system of accounting.  The idea is that you'd have a container full of things, and tied to it would be a string.  Knots on that string would tell you how many things are in there, which might be easier than cracking the lid and counting, especially if it's something like cups of rice.</p>
<p>My point is that when you're doing this kind of accounting, you physically group the objects into recognizable shapes (likely rectangles of consistent side length).  But then if you're using a numbering system with 0 in it, you don't directly correspond the shapes to symbols, you have to count the number of same-type shapes you have.  So you end up asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how <strong>many</strong> of that shape do I have?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's this implicit potential for "many", even if it might turn out that there's only one in your particular case. I imagine a proponent of the new system, explaining it to one of the old guard.  They would have them group the objects into piles of certain shapes/sizes and at some point say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't have 1 or 2 or 3 ... or 9 ten<strong>s</strong> then you put a zero here.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2018/assumed-audiences.html">Assumed audience</a>:</b> Software developers who want to improve at their craft. Assumes a bit of background about programming in general, and also just a <em>little</em> bit of background knowledge about Rust and TypeScript. (You’ll be just fine if you know no more of either than that they exist and roughly what they are.)</p><p>As a bit of a prelude, consider this extended quote from Fred Hebert, <a href="https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html">Complexity Has to Live Somewhere</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fighting complexity is a recurring theme of software development I’ve seen repeat itself over and over again. It’s something I keep seeing debated at all levels: just how much commenting should go on in functions and methods? What’s the ideal amount of abstraction? When does a framework start having<span></span> <span>“</span>too much magic”? When are there too many languages in an organisation?</p>
<p>We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When we adopt something like microservices, we try to make it so that each service is individually simple. But unless this simplicity is so constraining that your actual application inherits it and is forced into simplicity, it still has to go somewhere. If it’s not in the individual microservices, then where is it?</p>
<p>Complexity has to live somewhere. If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places. In code where you decided a bit of complexity should go, in documentation that supports the code, in training sessions for your engineers. You give it a place without trying to hide all of it. You create ways to manage it. You know where to go to meet it when you need it. If you’re unlucky and you just tried to pretend complexity could be avoided altogether, it has no place to go in this world. But it still doesn’t stop existing.</p>
<p>With nowhere to go, it has to roam everywhere in your system, both in your code and in people’s heads. And as people shift around and leave, our understanding of it erodes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s more, and it’s good, so <a href="https://ferd.ca/complexity-has-to-live-somewhere.html">read the whole thing</a>! And as you do, you might consider how it pairs with the quote from Peter Naur <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/notes/two-quotes-on-software-engineering/">I shared yesterday</a>. Now — </p>
<p>Hebert applies this to microservices, I think appropriately. I think it also applies to <em>types</em>. The types always exist; the complexity they represent always exists. The question is first of all whether we have written them down anywhere — that is, whether we have a contract about them that can be enforced, and if so what can enforce them. Secondarily, then, the expressiveness of a type system is a measure of what kinds of the program’s complexity we <em>can</em> write down as types.</p>
<p>People who are a bit allergic to types often feel constrained by them, but those of us who like robust types see that relationship the other way around. As <a href="https://dfreeman.io/">Dan Freeman</a> put it to me recently: types are a tool, just like tests, but you have to <em>use</em> that tool. Types do provide constraints, much as tests do — but they are only the types <em>we choose to impose</em>. That is, they are knowledge we are encoding into the program.</p>
<p>The same basic thesis applies to our tests, which represent a different set of knowledge than our types. This is the benefit of<span></span> <span>“</span>test-driven development”, particularly in the red-green cycle: it is a way of encoding knowledge into the program. Test expressiveness works in different ways than type expressiveness, but it is a useful way of evaluating different kinds of and different approaches to testing.</p>
<p>This is why I like Rust. The complexity of correctly <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/temporal-spatial-memory-safety/">spatial and temporal safety</a> has to live somewhere. Rust pushes the majority of that complexity into its type system, and particularly the famed borrow checker. The rest of the complexity it isolates in <code>unsafe</code> blocks. Mind: <code>unsafe</code> allows you to know where the complexity lives, but it does not tell you where your getting that complexity wrong will <em>surface</em>. But the combination of the borrow checker and the isolation that <code>unsafe</code> offers <em>does</em> allow us to <em>control</em> the complexity. We cannot get rid of it. We can only isolate it.</p>
<p>A garbage collector gives you memory safety and not having to think explicitly about memory allocation and deallocation, but the complexity is still not gone — it has moved to the implementation, to weird performance cliffs, and to difficult-to-debug leaks of memory or other resources. That trade is very often worth it, though!</p>
<p>Whether with Rust or with a garbage collector, isolating the temporal and spatial safety means we don’t have to keep it in our heads <em>most of the time</em>, and that allows us to focus on other problems. This is why there are so many developer tools for JavaScript and Python being written in Rust: not because people didn’t want fast tools before, but because for many developers, keeping all the safety issues in their heads as they would have had to do with C or C++ was more than they felt they could reasonably do <em>and also ship the thing they cared about</em>. Rust’s borrow checking opens that door to many more people, because it has isolated that complexity, and thereby provided a more usable tool.</p>
<p>This exact dynamic is also why I like TypeScript, even including some of the wilder types I ended up writing for Ember and LinkedIn in years past. The complexity was always there — often far more than anyone realized before we started trying to write down types that actually accurately represented the system. TypeScript did not create the complexity, much as people sometimes <em>felt</em> like it added complexity to the code we were looking at. No, it merely shone a light on the existing complexity, and gave us the opportunity — and a tool with which — to <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/is-typescript-good/#:~:text=In%20software%2C%20the,of%20the%20system.">start grappling with it</a>.</p>
<p>Isolating complexity is useful. As Hebert says,<span></span> <span>“</span>If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places.” It is not always possible to isolate complexity — we are not always lucky — , but when isolating complexity <em>is</em> possible, it is glorious, because isolating complexity is the essence of successful abstractions.</p>

<p dir="auto">We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.
This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale
texture synthesis model - Hunyuan3D-Paint.
The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly
aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications.
The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant
texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio - a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation
process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently.
We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models,
including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and
e.t.c.</p>

<p dir="auto">Hunyuan3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the
synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and
texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>tl;dr</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The map you see is the Mercator projection.</p>
        <p>But unlike a standard Mercator projection, you can substitute any point on earth as the "pole". (The initial view shows Boston as the pole point)</p>
        <p>Furthermore, this map cuts off much, much closer to the poles than normal, allowing you to see many more orders of magnitude of distortion.</p>
        <p>Because this yields a map several times taller than it is wide, it is shown sideways from its usual orientation.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Backstory</h3>
      <div>

        <p>
          The Mercator projection is infamous for its distortion at high latitudes.
          This distortion gets exponentially worse as you approach the poles.
          It is in fact impossible to show the poles on a Mercator map — they are infinitely far away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any Mercator map you've ever seen must cut off the top/bottom edges at some arbitrary point.
          The map usually stops hundreds, if not thousands of miles short of the poles.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I've often wondered what lies beyond those cut-offs... to make a map that didn't cut off but simply kept going.
          As the distortion progresses towards infinity, you would eventually reach the scale of cities, houses, insects, atoms...
        </p>

        <p>
          But of course that'd all be on a featureless expanse of ice.
        </p>

        <p>
          To make things actually interesting, we must artifically shift the pole of the projection to a more interesting place.
          Imagine the earth encased by a rigid cage of latitude and longitude lines.
          We rotate the earth while leaving the cage fixed until a new point of interest has taken the place of the North Pole.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is called an <em>oblique Mercator</em>, and is normally used to shift an area of interest onto the equator of the map to avoid distortion.
          But whereas others avoid the distortion, we embrace it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note how strange the oblique Mercator looks even without the increased cutoffs.
          The standard Mercator is so ingrained in the public consciousness that we perceive it as 'normal'.
          But once you shift the pole its pervasive distortion is shockingly apparent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, increasing the cutoffs produces a map much taller than it is wide.
          So it is presented sideways here for easier viewing (<a href="#" dest="sp">set the pole to the North/South Pole</a> like usual to see this most clearly).
          You can also switch back to "normal" orientation via the <a href="#"><img src="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/img/rotate.png"> button</a>.
        </p>

      </div>
      <h3>Orientation</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Let's take a moment to digest what we have here. Namely:
          </p><ul>
            <li>a single map projection
            </li><li>…showing the entire surface of the earth
            </li><li>…while traversing all the way from the human scale, to the global scale
          </li></ul>
        

        <p>
          It really creates this "center of the universe" feeling.
          Basically a mathematical embodiment of the sentiment in this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mappery.com/maps/A-View-of-World-from-9th-Avenue-Map.jpg">famous <i>New Yorker</i> cover</a>. (<a href="#" dest="ny" layer="map"><i>Mercator: Extreme</i> version</a>)
        </p>

        <p>Keep these principles in mind to best navigate around the map:

          </p><ul>
            <li>
              Horizontal lines on the map ("meridians") represent straight lines radiating out from the pole point in all directions.
              Lines one half of a map-width apart from each other represent <em>opposite</em> directions.
              The properties of the meridians are best seen with a central plaza like the <a href="#" dest="arc" layer="sat">Arc de Triomphe</a>.
            </li><li>
              Vertical lines ("parallels") show rings of constant distance from the pole point.
              This can visualize <a href="#" dest="vulcan">encircledness</a> or <a href="#" dest="sthelena">remoteness</a>.
              The nearest landfall from St. Helena in any direction can be found by a vertical line sweeping towards the left.
          </li></ul>
        

        <p>
          You may find yourself trying to get 'behind' or 'to the other side of' the pole point.
          There is no such thing!
          All directions away from the pole point proceed towards the left.
          The pole itself exists at all points along the right-hand edge (technically, infinitely far to the right).
        </p>

        <p>
          If at any time you get disoriented, I strongly recommend using the <a href="#">companion map <img src="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/img/map.png"></a> to see the correspondence to a normal map which makes these navigational principles clear.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Other Curiosities</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Now knowing that horizontal and vertical lines represent distance and bearing, if we center the pole on a <a href="#" dest="atl" layer="map">major city</a>, we can visualize its transportation network in a whole new way.
          Beltways and ring roads become vertical frontiers, while highways become a dendritic network branching off to destinations in all directions.
          We can see all of Atlanta's highway links in a single view, including the special few that make it as far as New York, St. Louis, Dallas, and Miami.
        </p>

        <p>
          Closely related, the extreme Mercator is an excellent way to visualize <a href="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/img/routes_example.jpg" target="_blank">long-distance driving routes</a>.
          Think about how when you drive such a route, you start on some local/residential roads, then make your way to bigger arteries, and eventually to a highway.
          Here, even as smaller roads fade into nothing, the next road of your route always seems to still be visible.
          Size in this map is proportional to distance, so the extreme Mercator ends up normalizing scale in a very human-accessible way.
          The only cost is you have to turn your mind inside-out a bit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, the extreme Mercator is an excellent way to visualize antipodes — points that are on the complete opposite sides of the earth from each other.
          So far we haven't touched the left-side cutoff, namely because the antipode is usually <a target="_blank" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Antipodes_LAEA.png">in the middle of the ocean</a>.
          But this is <a href="#" dest="antipode" layer="sat">not always the case</a>.
          Here we find two buildings exactly opposite the planet from each other.
          Where one is day, the other is always night.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you enjoy this novel way of viewing our world.
        </p>
      </div>

Inspired by the worlds of <a href="https://abakcus.com/must-read-books-on-mathematics-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mathematics</a> and nature, Araujo employs <a href="https://abakcus.com/top-10-islamic-geometry-books/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">geometry</a>, trigonometry, and sequences of dots to produce jaw-dropping three-dimensional images that often appear to have been generated by cutting-edge computer software. However, what sets Araujo apart is his unwavering commitment to traditional techniques; each artwork is painstakingly rendered by hand using only essential tools—a lamp for light, a ruler, a compass, and a protractor. Through this meticulous process, he unfolds the significance of the <a href="https://abakcus.com/products/fibonacci-golden-spiral-clock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden</a> Ratio, showcasing its spiritual depth and presence within the natural order.</p><p>In Araujo’s artistic journey, there truly is no room for error. He understands that while the creative spirit might flow freely, the technical execution must be flawless: <strong>“Working by hand, with ink on canvas, my main concern is to be aware of what I’m always doing.

Have a relative (sort of) who works at a 3M plant. Shit still occasionally 
happens.<br>
&gt; You can't just say that and go away!! How are you not irresistibly <br>
&gt; interested in that?? I would've interrogated that relative so hard<br>
It just came up in passing at Thanksgiving! I don't really know him 
that 
well; he's an in-law. He mentioned being able to throw small washers and 
bolts at the field and watching them get repelled. People got 
interested, and so someone came with a voltmeter, and after throwing a 
couple more, they checked for voltage, and there was a residual charge 
after they finally caught on on a plastic sheet to prevent immediate 
grounding. It also had a very slight magnetic field. It's apparently 
fairly common, but engineering hasn't come up with a solid explanation 
why.</i>

I met this guy at an ESD meeting in austin once. He said the strength of 
the field maxed out his equipment at a distance so he couldn't get a 
maximum measurement.
<br>
After he published the paper he was contacted by NASA and all the three 
letter agencies asking for more info. He wanted to experiment around with 
it but no company had millions to throw into such a project (presumably, 
the government did). It had to be a pretty narrow window of temperature, 
pressure, humidity, etc. They kept the garage door open so that's where 
the insects and sparrows got sucked in (which obviously ruined the 
product).
<br>
He said it was actually known to the technicians for awhile before he 
experienced it and they just were kinda like "meh". Eventually they fixed 
the grounding issue on the machine and the problem never popped up again.
<br>
edit: found the ESD website. David Swenson apparently is still with them 
on their board of directors. http://centxesdassoc.homestead.com/

<p>
  Problems: coulomb forces would be expected to <i>attract</i> a person
  into the "chamber" formed by the PP film, and the attractive force
  should increase linearly across distance. There should be no "wall" in
  the center, a discrete wall is repulsive, also nonlinear.<br></p>

<p>If for some reason a
  person was repelled from the center of the chamber rather than being
  attracted, there still should be no "wall," since the repulsion force 
should exist over a large distance; it
  should act like a deep pillow which exerts more and more force as one
  moves deeper into it.  Large fuzzy fields, this is how
  magnets and iron behave, and this is how e-fields and conductive objects
  should also behave.
<br></p>

<p>

  A thought: unspooling of film typically generates a much higher net 
charge on
  the long piece of film than on the small surface of the spool.
  However, since charge is created in pairs, and net charge is conserved, 
the imbalances of charge <i>must</i> 
be
  equal and opposite.  The charge on the entire length of moving film 
<i>must</i>
  be equal in magnitude to the charge on the spool.  Yet the charge on the
  film is very large and is continuously increasing.  The limited
  surface-charge on the spool required that opposite charge is being 
<i>lost
  through some unseen path.</i>  
<br></p>

<p>
Very probably the spool is spewing out 
enormous quantities of ionized air with polarity opposite that of the 
charge on the moving plastic film.
<br></p>

<p>

  Charged air would be created by discharge in the cleft between film and 
spool as the 
film
  was peeled from the spool.  I wonder if film was being peeled from the 
top of
  the spool, so that any ionized air created in the cleft would be 
launched into the
"tent-chamber" region?  (If it was peeled from the bottom of the spool,
the charged air would end up outside the "tent.")  Or, if a corona
discharge arises in the cleft between film and spool, perhaps the UV and
e-fields of this corona can ionize the air on both sides of the exiting
plastic film, and spray the charged air everywhere. 
<br></p>

<p>

  So, if the charged "tent" of film is negative in the above situation,
  and if a large quantity of positively charged air is being generated
  by the spool, then perhaps the "invisible wall" is caused by a cloud of
  suspended air ions held in position by e-fields.  Perhaps it's a 
pressure gradient created by
  ionized air trapped under the tent by electrostatic attraction.  Yet
  again this effect would be expected to create a diffuse zone of 
increasing
  force, not a "wall", but an "invisible pillow."  Added note: concrete 
floors behave as conductors (resistors) in this situation.  Where 
megavolts at 
microamps are involved, the division between insulators and conductors is 
at 10^6/10^-6 =  1000 gigaohms.  Concrete resistivity is 
in the realm of megohms, so it behaves like a grounded metal sheet. 
<br></p>

<p>

  However, a volume of charged air is somewhat analogous to iron
  filings near a magnet.  If a solid sheet of iron filings is held in
  place by a magnet, then a literal "wall" is created, and this wall will
  resist penetration by nonferrous objects.  If in the above manufacturing
  plant, a sheet of highly charged air is for some reason being held in
  place by the fields created by the charged film, then a transparent
  "wall" made of charged air would come into being.  It might produce 
pressures on surfaces, and resist  penetration by human bodies. 
<br></p>

<p>

  My question is this: if the entire situation could be turned on its
  side, so the "invisible wall" became an "invisible floor", could a
  person *<i>stand</i>* on it?  Have we discovered the long-sought "Zero-G
  waterbed?"  :)    - B.B.
