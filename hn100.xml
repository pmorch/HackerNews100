	<span><span><span><b><span>WASHINGTON, D.C.</span></b><span>&nbsp;(August 1, 2025) – The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced today that it will begin an orderly wind-down of its operations following the passage of a federal rescissions package and the release of the Senate Appropriations Committee’s FY 2026 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-H) appropriations bill, which excludes funding for CPB for the first time in more than five decades.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>For nearly 60 years, CPB has carried out its Congressional mission to build and sustain a trusted public media system that informs, educates, and serves communities across the country. Through partnerships with local stations and producers, CPB has supported educational content, locally relevant journalism, emergency communications, cultural programming, and essential services for Americans in every community.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” said CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison. “CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>CPB informed its employees today that the majority of staff positions will conclude with the close of the fiscal year on September 30, 2025. A small transition team will remain through January 2026 to ensure a responsible and orderly closeout of operations. This team will focus on compliance, final distributions, and resolution of long-term financial obligations, including ensuring continuity for music rights and royalties that remain essential to the public media system.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said. “We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><span>CPB’s Board of Directors and management are working closely to address the legal, financial, and operational requirements of the closure. CPB will provide regular updates and guidance to stations and producers navigating the profound challenges ahead.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
	<span><span><span><b><span>About CPB</span></b><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><span>Linda Martin found out the hard way that the most powerful law enforcement agency in the U.S.—the FBI—can seize your assets without articulating why. Worse: Law enforcement took her savings in a raid that was itself unconstitutional. Worse still: A lawsuit she filed met its demise last week, allowing the federal government to continue the dubious practice of taking people's valuables without having to explain the reason it is justified in doing so.</span></p>
<p><span>The agency never did furnish a specific reason in Martin's case—because she wasn't charged with a crime. Her saga began in 2021, when the FBI sought to take more than $100 million in assets from U.S. Private Vaults, a business that offered safe-deposit boxes. That company was suspected of, and ultimately charged with, criminal wrongdoing. But the warrant expressly </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700649-21-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-return-of-property-pursuant-to-fed-r-crim-p-41g/#document/p10"><span>forbade</span></a><span> agents from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure" of customers' boxes, like Martin's.</span></p>
<p><span>They did so anyway, rummaging through approximately 800 of them and seizing assets that belonged to a <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/11/fbi-raid-safety-deposit-boxes-los-angeles-jennifer-paul-snitko-85-million-civil-forfeiture/">slew of innocent people.</a> That included Travis May, who stored gold and $63,000 in cash; Jeni Verdon-Pearsons and Michael Storc, who kept $2,000 in cash, as well as approximately $20,000 worth of silver; Paul and Jennifer Snitko, whose box contained personal items, like marriage, birth, and baptismal certificates; and Don Mellein, who had invested in gold coins, many of which the FBI said it lost (to the tune of over $100,000).</span></p>
<p><span>A federal court later ruled that the bureau's actions <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/23/appeals-court-fbis-safe-deposit-box-seizures-violated-fourth-amendment/">violated the Fourth Amendment</a>. </span><span>But it was too late for Martin, who received notice that the FBI had taken $40,200, her life savings, from her box. To justify that, the notice listed hundreds of federal crimes that would lead to a seizure. As Institute for Justice (I.J.) Director of Media Relations Andrew Wimer </span><a href="https://x.com/andrewwimer/status/1948831860622053716"><span>points out</span></a><span>, that included things like copyright infringement and doing business with North Korea. But the bureau notably did not specify how Martin was supposedly connected to any of those offenses, because it is not required to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>So she sued. "When the FBI attempts to forfeit someone's property, due process requires that it say why, citing </span><i><span>specific facts and laws</span></i><span>," reads her appellant </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CADC-15-Brief-of-Appellant.pdf"><span>brief</span></a><span>. "By sending notices that initiate and, often, consummate property's forfeiture—all without ever saying what exactly the FBI thinks justifies the forfeiture, the FBI deprives owners of crucial information they need to protect their rights." After she filed the lawsuit, and about two years post-seizure, the agency returned Martin's cash. But she continued in court in hopes that the judiciary would agree that the FBI was violating people's due process rights by seizing assets with effectively no explanation.</span></p>
<p><span>That died last week, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia </span><a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2025/07/24-5144-2126635.pdf"><span>dismissed</span></a><span> the suit for lack of jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span>"The FBI took Linda's savings without clearly saying what she did wrong. That shouldn't happen in America, but taking on the entrenched federal civil forfeiture system is challenging," said Bob Belden, an attorney at I.J. (which represented Martin), in a statement via email. "Unfortunately, there is not a clear path to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. We know that several Justices are alarmed at how civil forfeiture works in America and hope that the right case will work its way to the Court."</span></p>
<p><span>Robert Frommer, a senior attorney at I.J., </span><a href="https://reason.com/2025/03/20/the-fbi-seized-this-womans-life-savings-without-telling-her-why/"><span>told</span></a><span> me in March that "without specific notice, property owners can't understand what this is all about, and therefore can't do any investigation or get meaningful advice from attorneys." That helps explain, he says, why the agency is so successful at avoiding scrutiny for its seizures. "Owners must decide whether to fight against the federal government, default, or plead for mercy, all without knowing why the FBI is doing this to them," he says. "It's therefore little surprise that 93% of federal forfeitures never get to a court, meaning the FBI gets to keep the money without ever telling anyone why they should be allowed to"—which, at least for now, will remain the status quo.</span></p>

            <guid>44757316</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 14:28:11 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lts.html">https://www.sqlite.org/lts.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44757316">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>






<p>
The intent of the developers is to support SQLite through
the year 2050.

</p><p>
At this writing, 2050 is still 25 years in the future.
Nobody knows what will happen in that time, and we cannot
absolutely promise that SQLite will be viable or useful that
far out.
But we can promise this: we plan as if we will be
supporting SQLite until 2050.
That long-term outlook affects our
decisions in important ways.

</p><ul>
<li><p>
<b>Cross-platform Code</b> →
SQLite runs on any platform with an 8-bit byte,
two's complement 32-bit and 64-bit integers, 
and a C compiler.  It is actively
tested on all currently popular CPUs and operating
systems.
The extreme portability of the SQLite code and file
format will help it remain viable on future platforms.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Stable, Cross-platform Database Files</b> →
SQLite <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">database files</a> are bit-for-bit identical on
32-bit, 64-bit, big-endian, and little-endian platforms.  You
can copy an SQLite database file from one system to another
without having to translate or convert the database.
Furthermore, the file format is well documented and stable.
Database files created today will be readable and writable by
future versions of SQLite decades in the future.

</p></li><li><p>
<b><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">Aviation-grade testing</a></b> →
Every machine-code branch instruction is tested in both
directions.  Multiple times.  On multiple platforms and with
multiple compilers.  This helps make the code robust for
future migrations.  The intense testing also means that new
developers can make experimental enhancements to SQLite and,
assuming legacy tests all pass, be reasonably sure that the
enhancement does not break legacy.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Extensive, detailed documentation</b> →
SQLite has candid, developer-friendly,
and open-source documentation.  Docs are written by and
for programmers.
(A few examples:
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html">[1]</a>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html">[2]</a>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html">[3]</a>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/opcode.html">[4]</a>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html">[5]</a>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/malloc.html">[6]</a>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/debugging.html">[7]</a>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html">[8]</a>)
The extensive documentation helps new developers
come up to speed on SQLite very quickly.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Heavily commented source code</b> →
The SQLite source code is over 35% comment.  Not boiler-plate
comments, but useful comments that explain the meaning of variables
and objects and the intent of methods and procedures.  
The code is designed
to be accessible to new programmers and maintainable over a span
of decades.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Disaster planning</b> →
Every byte of source-code history for SQLite is cryptographically
protected and is automatically replicated to multiple
geographically separated servers, in datacenters 
owned by different companies.
Thousands of additional clones exist on private servers around the
world.
The primary developers of SQLite live in different regions of the world.
SQLite can survive a continental catastrophe.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Old school</b> →
Nobody is completely immune to trends and fads, but the SQLite
developers work hard to avoid being sucked into the latest programming
fashion.  Our aim is to produce timeless code that will be
readable, understandable, and maintainable by programmers 
who have not yet been born.
</p></li></ul>

<p>
In addition to "supporting" SQLite through the year 2050, the developers
also promise to keep the SQLite 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cintro.html">C-language API</a> and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">on-disk format</a> 
fully backwards compatible.
This means that application written to use SQLite today should be able to
link against and use future versions of SQLite released decades in the
future.

</p><p>
Our goal is to make the content you store in SQLite today as 
easily accessible to your grandchildren as it is to you.

</p><p>
<b>Update on 2018-05-31:</b>
Our goal of supporting SQLite long-term have apparently come to the
notice of the preservationist at the 
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/">US Library Of Congress</a> who have identified
SQLite as a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html">recommended storage format</a> for the preservation of
digital content.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hadid.dev/posts/living-coding/">https://hadid.dev/posts/living-coding/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44756045">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people enjoy live coding interviews. I’m not one of them.</p><p>Two days ago, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sklivvz_we-ask-every-candidate-a-trivial-coding-question-activity-7356034496846094336-KHaE/">post on LinkedIn</a>:</p><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ln-post" src="https://hadid.dev/posts/living-coding/ln-post.png" width="693" height="479"></p></figure><p>Sounds absurd at first. Why would a senior engineer, who has been writing code for years, struggle with
something as simple as a basic algorithm? Did they suddenly forget how to code? Maybe. But I have a different
perspective.</p><h3 id="a-quick-story">A quick story
<a href="#a-quick-story">#</a></h3><p>Four years ago, I applied for <a href="https://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a>. I passed the initial stage(s). I passed a 90-minute Codility assessment (three
problems as I recall it). Then, I failed to finish a live coding test for a full 30 minutes (more or less, I don’t
remember exactly). I revisited the test a few hours later, and I solved the problem in no time.</p><p>That was super confusing. The problem wasn’t that hard really. I was able to solve it, but failed to do so in the live
coding session.</p><p>This triggered my curiosity, and I did some research back then. Turns out it’s a well-known phenomenon in the scientific
literature. It’s all about stress.</p><h3 id="your-brain-under-stress">Your brain under stress
<a href="#your-brain-under-stress">#</a></h3><p>When you’re placed in a high-stakes, time-pressured situation, like live coding, your brain reacts exactly like it would
to any other threat. The amygdala <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29896088">gets activated</a>. Cortisol levels <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30859159/">spike</a>. Your prefrontal cortex, the part of the
brain <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28448453/">responsible</a> for complex reasoning and working memory, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19455173/">gets impaired</a>. Either mildly, moderately, or severely,
depending on the individual and their baseline stress resilience.</p><p>Working memory is the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21037165/">most reliable proxy</a> (I know of) for fluid intelligence, your ability to reason, solve novel
problems, and think abstractly. It’s what you mostly need to pass live coding tests, I believe. When your prefrontal
cortex is impaired due to stress, your working memory capacity shrinks.</p><p>For some people, especially those with even mild <em>performance anxiety</em>, it becomes nearly impossible to think clearly.
Your attention narrows. You can’t hold multiple steps in your head. You forget what you just typed a few seconds ago. It
feels like your IQ dropped by 30 points. In fact, it feels like you’re a completely different version of yourself; a
much dumber one.</p><h3 id="the-definitive-paper">The definitive paper
<a href="#the-definitive-paper">#</a></h3><p>As I was writing this post, I found a paper that absolutely surprised me. It’s a rigorous scientific study done on this
exact topic: performance during live coding.</p><p><a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10196170">The paper</a> titled “Does Stress Impact Technical Interview Performance?”, and it’s co-authored by researchers at
<em>Microsoft</em>. They basically asked participants to solve a coding problem in two settings:</p><ul><li>Private setting: Alone in a room; no one watching.</li><li>Public setting: In front of a proctor, while thinking aloud.</li></ul><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="private-vs-public-setting" src="https://hadid.dev/posts/living-coding/private-vs-public-setting.png" width="1337" height="386"></p></figure><p>Same task. Same time limit. Just different levels of stress.</p><p>Here’s what they found: <strong>The participants being watched scored half compared to those who were alone.</strong></p><p>The cognitive performance in the public setting had both a lower average and much wider spread (high variance);
indicating that some candidates are disproportionately impaired under stress, while others perform as usual or even
slightly better. That’s why live coding is so unfair.</p><p>All of these findings are no surprise to me. But here’s a surprising finding: <strong>not a single woman in the public setting
passed</strong>, while every woman in the private setting did. So if your company wants to “support women in tech” but still
do live coding interviews… congrats, you’re running a scientifically validated exclusion filter.</p><h3 id="performance-under-stress">Performance under stress
<a href="#performance-under-stress">#</a></h3><p>I like to think of live coding as a proxy for <em>performance under stress</em>. The paper I just mentioned shares the same
view.</p><p>Some companies genuinely care about this. Some even mention it in their job descriptions. They want candidates who
perform well under pressure. If that’s the case, then sure, live coding might help.</p><p>But that’s not how most companies frame it.</p><p>Most hirings don’t mention stress resilience. They don’t describe the job as “high-pressure.” They’re not looking for
someone to “perform well under pressure.” They just want a good engineer.</p><p>The engineer who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17880916/">froze</a> during a 30-minute LeetCode exercise might be the same person who quietly ships flawless code,
writes excellent docs, and debugs complex systems. You’re not rejecting a bad engineer, you’re rejecting someone who
doesn’t perform well while being watched.</p><p>That’s not a skill most jobs require.</p><p>Companies frame live coding as a test of your coding skills; it’s misleading. Even worse, it compounds performance
anxiety. It makes candidates believe this test is a reliable measure of their coding skills. That’s never true for most
engineers.</p><p>Live coding fails to measure what we think it measures. It’s more accurately measuring cortisol under stress than coding
skills.</p><h3 id="mitigating-the-stress">Mitigating the stress
<a href="#mitigating-the-stress">#</a></h3><p>We can’t change the fact that live coding is a common practice in tech interviews. But we can try to mitigate the stress
it causes.</p><p>The best way to desensitize your brain to stress is repeated exposure. Do mock live coding sessions that mimic the real
thing: use platforms like <a href="https://www.pramp.com/">Pramp</a>, <a href="https://interviewing.io/">Interviewing.io</a>, or <a href="https://leetcode.com/assessment">LeetCode’s mock assessment</a>.</p><p>You could also set a timer, record yourself (to simulate being “watched”), and think aloud. Gradually increase
pressure (e.g., invite a friend to watch).</p><p>I’ve also been thinking of experimenting with some supplements that I believe might help with performance under stress.</p><ul><li><p><strong>L-tyrosine</strong>: Stress depletes catecholamines, which <em>may</em> underlie the cognitive deficits we see during stressful
situations. Supplementing with L-tyrosine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26424423/">may help</a> replenish these neurotransmitters under stress.</p></li><li><p><strong>L-theanine</strong>: An amino acid found in tea that promotes relaxation. It has been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34562208/">reduce stress</a> and improve
focus.</p></li></ul><p>I haven’t tried any of these yet (during an interview), and I’m not encouraging anyone to do so. But I think it <em>might</em>
be worth experimenting with, especially if you struggle with performance anxiety. You should definitely test it in
practice sessions first. Everyone is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.</p><p>Being bad at live coding doesn’t mean you’re a bad engineer. It means you’re human.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        The Untold Impact of Cancellation
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        I have never before been open about the impact that being cancelled had upon me. Cancellations try to silence their targets, so their stories are less often heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my account.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you read about my experience over the last four years, you may come to understand why I have found it so hard to share. This is my own unique story, but other targets of online “mob justice” may find similarities.
      </p>
      <div>
        <details>

            The author recounts being publicly accused online in 2021 of sexual misconduct, leading to immediate social and professional ostracism from the Scala programming community. He lost his job, income, home, friendships, and reputation overnight without due process. Despite supportive statements from some women, he faced isolation, financial ruin, and health problems, eventually becoming homeless. Legal action was settled in his favor, but his reputation damage remained significant. He discusses the psychological trauma, financial struggles, and advocates awareness of cancellation's severe consequences, urging caution when participating in public condemnation due to its profound impact on individuals' mental health and livelihoods.

          </p>
        </details>
      </div>
      <p>
        Before my cancellation, I was an active and prominent software developer, conference organizer and frequent speaker in a vibrant community of software developers working with the Scala programming language. Scala is a powerful and deeply technical programming language that’s used by a lot of companies, including X (Twitter) and many large banks. The Scala Community is based all over the world and has anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 members, depending on how you count.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lost my reputation in that community overnight. I lost many of my friends. Soon after, I lost my job and my income. I then lost my home, and later I even lost my pension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overwhelming majority of those involved in the cancellation, I believe, acted in good faith. They believed that the allegations they read were true, and that their actions were moral and just. They had conviction that they were on the side of good; that it was right. And with the one-sided evidence they had, probably nothing was more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obvious as it may have been, their “evidence” was false, and the action that led to my cancellation was executed in the complete and total absence of due process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This account is not about the lies told about me, or the shoddy investigation that led to their publication. This is not about whether I deserved to be condemned or not. This is about what I suffered as a consequence.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-evening-of-the-cancellation">
        The Evening of the Cancellation
      </h2>
      <p>
        On the evening of 27 April 2021, I was accused by two women, in coordinated blog posts, of a pattern of sexually-predatory behavior. Both had been in relationships with me, one lasting nearly two years; the other, much shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minutes later, an “open letter” appeared online and was shared widely on social media throughout the community I had been part of since 2004. The letter was co-signed by 23 authoritative figures from that community, more than half of whom I had considered my friends until that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        That instant cut my life into the time before, and the time after.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only found out about the publication of the two statements from a friend. Nobody had told me it was going to happen then; nobody had told me it was going to happen at all. Nobody had ever put any of the claims to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was an ambush, and I was blindsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was also the moment that I discovered the identity of the second of my two accusers. This shocked me because I had no reason to expect it. It might seem incredible that I wouldn’t have known who she was, but her portrayal of our relationship was untrue; she was never part of the Scala community; and most importantly, she just didn’t have a reason to condemn me. While our two-year relationship had an unhappy end for both of us, and we stopped speaking afterwards, it was over three years earlier, and I believed we had both moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The substance of the blog posts was the greatest shock. I remember standing in a doorway, reading them on my phone, over and over again, in stunned disbelief. It was like reading a fiction about me concocted from benign fragments of reality, transplanted into new context to make them sound abominable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew it wasn’t true, but I also knew in that moment that thousands of people would read it and believe it. And they did.
      </p>
      <h2 id="signing-my-condemnation">
        Signing My Condemnation
      </h2>
      <p>
        With publication, the Open Letter collected signatures. I watched in horror throughout the evening as it grew, unable to do anything about it. I wrote and published my own rushed response, which was roundly ignored. Many of the names I didn’t know, but others were familiar; people I had interacted with online or in person over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many had been friends. Some had visited my home or hosted me at theirs. I had been a guest at the wedding of another. None of them contacted me about it before signing—with the exception of one who simply <em>told</em> me he would be signing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each name added to that letter smote me with psychological torture that was particular and personal to that name and the person I knew behind it; bound up with years of pleasant memories about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each name I read took the breath out of me. It felt similar to learning of their untimely death because reading their name meant they were <em>gone</em> from my life—but it was more brutal because it was their choice and they were all doing it at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every happy memory of times spent with them—at conferences, in conversations, video calls, dinners and even on vacations—were transformed into stains on my psyche. Thousands of friendly interactions I had with hundreds of people over more than a decade were tainted in less than a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The torrent of signatures continued throughout the evening, but had reduced to a slow trickle after a couple of days.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few others contacted me that evening to offer support, but they were outnumbered by the public messages of condemnation from former friends and strangers alike. But I remain grateful for those supportive messages which helped me through the next few days.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of this onslaught, three women who knew me independently wrote unprompted blogposts strongly supporting me, and disputing my characterization in the allegations. I saw them, and each one was touching. But unfortunately, they were largely ignored, unseen or dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe even sadder were the dozens of people who neither contacted me nor signed the letter. Even without condemning me, many people who had been my friends never made contact again. Either their perception of me changed, or our friendship became too burdensome to maintain. I may never know.
      </p>
      <p>
        I became afraid to reach out to people I once counted on as friends, unless they contacted me first.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time passed, exclusion became so familiar to me that I began to find it hard even to talk to people I knew were categorically my friends, particularly when I knew they shared friends with signatories of the letter. I felt uncomfortable having them straddle the community divide on my behalf.
      </p>
      <h2 id="my-life-in-scala">
        My Life in Scala
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Scala Community was central to my life. Nobody else attached so much of their life to that community. Nobody attended and spoke at so many conferences. Nobody gave as many presentations to meetup groups. Nobody traveled to so many different countries in support of Scala.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I did it for the love of that community; for the satisfaction I got from interacting with other people who shared my interest in Scala; for the stimulating conversations I so often had in a community that was dense with intelligence and rich with kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had spent the previous few years traveling. I had been partly nomadic, living in AirBnbs in several different countries, before I had settled down the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that time, the one constant in my life was the Scala Community. It was the people I interacted with daily, talked to and dined with at conferences, and met up with on any other occasion I had the chance. It went beyond my professional life; it was my social life too. Its members were not just work associates; they were friends. As I traveled between countries and continents, the Scala Community felt like my home.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-end-of-my-life-as-i-knew-it">
        The End of My Life as I Knew It
      </h2>
      <p>
        And in that one moment, I lost most of the life I knew. I offered my resignation from my developer advocacy job because it became untenable and it was damaging my employer, even though we both knew there was no cause to terminate my employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gave away my most successful open-source project to new maintainers so that it could continue. I abandoned training courses I had planned. The free educational website I devoted six months to was shut down, to my detriment and to Scala’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        I abandoned a charitable foundation to promote Functional Programming in Africa, which I was just starting. Online videos of my presentations were deleted, and my name was even removed from historical conference programs, as if I had never been there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my online interactions just stopped dead. My ability to earn a living was obliterated. A huge swathe of my friends would no longer talk to me. I was no longer welcome at the events I once considered the center of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My then-girlfriend, for all the love and support she gave me, found herself in a very different relationship from the one we started a year earlier, and it survived only a few months more, though we remain friends. And although I did not realize it until much later, the experience had a long-term impact on my health.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also did not realize <em>then</em> that 18 months later, I would be unable to afford to continue paying rent, and would be forced to move out of my home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m well aware of the many ills of this world, but it’s hard to imagine anything so sweeping as to devastate one’s professional life, social life, private life and health; even less so, an action perpetrated by a group of professional software developers in the name of “justice”.
      </p>
      <h2 id="recontextualization">
        Recontextualization
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have come to understand psychology and human nature better since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you learn something which permanently changes how you see the world, you undergo a process of <em>recontextualization</em>, where you re-evaluate past beliefs in the context of the new knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you become a parent, it changes your life, and changes your outlook on life. You recontextualize your entire future to accommodate a new person being there with you, and dependent on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once revealed, the new context never goes away. You can’t forget it or escape it. But old thoughts that made sense in the <em>old</em> context can return days, weeks or years later, and each must be processed so it fits into the <em>new</em>. In the beginning, this happens frequently and the mental burden is enormous. But it reduces over time, with a long tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe surprisingly, I did not lose sleep during the first few weeks. Instead, although I had no work and no deadlines, I felt overwhelmingly exhausted, day after day. I had several calls with friends, but struggled to speak to more than one person per day. When I went to bed, I slept easily, slept long and slept well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be explained. In those first weeks, my waking hours were consumed by the heavy toll of recontextualization, as years of my professional and social life was forced into a new context. This was the same community of people whose enthusiasm I had shared, and whose qualities and characters were the reason I devoted so much time and energy to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But not only did I have to come to terms with losing most of my friends, I started questioning why I had devoted so much to a community that so willingly condemned me upon unproven accusations. The burden was all-encompasing and tiring, and it took its toll on me. It was weeks before I began to feel closer to normal, and I still don’t feel the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might seem like the obvious thing to do would have been to publish a response to the allegations. But for weeks, I was simply not mentally fit to do so. Furthermore, I was scared: my last interactions with the Scala Community had been the most traumatic experience of my life, and the condemnation had been so comprehensive I became convinced that anything I said would just be ignored.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-financial-toll">
        The Financial Toll
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was cancelled in the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic. Besides the isolation, which affected everyone, the pandemic was not kind to me, as a professional trainer and conference organizer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the previous years, I had created and run four editions of a conference, Scala World, which attracted about 200 attendees each time. It had established a good reputation, but it never made any profit, and would have made a loss if I had paid myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I had also offered an advanced programming course since 2018, which could be very profitable for a couple of days at a time. And with just four or five training sessions per year, I covered my basic living costs and budget travel, and it allowed me to work on the open source projects I cared about. So for about three years, I did no more paid work than necessary. I traveled to and spoke at almost every conference I could, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I knew these were the best years of my life, and I was grateful; this was my lifestyle choice, and it was a luxury.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never had any trouble rationalizing those years as a kind of startup that failed. It was a gamble I took, a gamble I devoted all my time to, which I hoped might make me a decent salary doing something I loved. And it was a gamble which didn’t pay off—not even slightly. But I accepted the failure was on me and I owned it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the second half of 2019, with hapless timing, I decided to focus on my training and conference, and I invested my modest savings in that. I sponsored Scala Days, the biggest conference of the year. And I placed an early booking on accommodation for my conference in 2020, and devoted time to developing further training material and planning several training events.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then the pandemic started. Conferences and training became impossible. My investment was wasted. So I entered the first lockdown without savings and without an income. My most valuable asset at that time was a deposit on the conference accommodation for later in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to these unlucky choices I made, I was in debt and needed to find work. I approached the company I had recently been working with, and we began employment discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many small businesses at that time, I kept going thanks to a government business loan. And in the summer of 2020, as lockdowns were relaxed, I planned a small hybrid conference with my prospective employer at the pre-booked venue.
      </p>
      <p>
        But within a couple of weeks, this event had to be cancelled, in part due to the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there was a second reason: around that time, my co-organizers were informed by a third party of vague “concerns about my behavior,” but which lacked sufficient clarity to act on. They were nevertheless enough to seal the event’s cancellation, pause my hiring process, and trigger an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        That investigation lasted around four months, and found no evidence of wrongdoing. But at a time when I most needed to earn, I was forced to wait a further four months without pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not the first I learned of the actions that led to my cancellation, nine months later, but it was the first time it caused me material losses.

      <p>
        With the exception of the creator of the language, and one other, there was not a single person in the Scala Community with a longer continuous history of working with Scala. I had been one of the first users in 2004, when I started using it in the first months after my graduation. Almost my entire professional career had been Scala.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the seventeen years covered by my résumé, every success was a success with Scala. Every contract or job I worked used Scala. My entire public output was related to Scala. And I wanted to continue working with Scala.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if they didn’t already associate my name with the allegations in 2021, any potential employer reading my résumé could search for me and immediately find content that would raise justifiable concerns about hiring me. (My name is unique enough that there’s little doubt that the publications refer to me.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have felt like I’ve had a choice when applying for work: to be open and upfront about my situation, and give the employer the option to back out right away; or to remove all Scala references from my résumé, hide my experience, and hope that nobody ever searches for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could I apply for a job in another language? Perhaps: my programming skills may be transferrable to other languages and other communities. But unfortunately, my undeserved reputation is a red flag that’s more universally transferrable. Even if I got a job writing another language like Haskell or Rust, I would forever be one tip-off and a Google search away from having to explain the publications, and risk losing my job. I cannot take the risk of learning a new language, and <em>then</em> losing my job over the same false accusations. I’m an expert at Scala, and that’s where my future lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also considered—and quickly rejected—changing my name.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of these are good options. I’m not comfortable hiding who I am, and what I’ve been through has become part of my identity. I choose to be open about it, because anything less feels like living a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, I have found very little work, even with friendly companies in the Scala Community. To be specific, in the three years between my last job after cancellation, and the contract I started last year, I earned an average of $14,600 per year, before tax.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent about a third of this income on compulsory health insurance, and more than the total amount I earned went on legal costs. I also needed to pay for rent, bills and sustenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        These numbers clearly don’t add up. I survived only thanks to financial help from friends, and selling some assets. This included withdrawing everything from my small private pension account for less than I paid into it. I was reluctant to add to my problems by getting into more debt, but with few options available to me, I accepted help when it came.
      </p>
      <h2 id="escapism">
        Escapism
      </h2>
      <p>
        In January 2022 I found the courage and finance to begin legal action against the few people involved in my cancellation who shared my jurisdiction. I hoped that this would trigger real scrutiny into my case.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, by September 2022, it became clear that I would not be able to keep paying my rent. I was already in debt, and as a recent immigrant to Germany, I was not eligible for any kind of state support. My legal action was proceeding very slowly, accruing costs, and the risk of abandoning it would not only have thrown away my one hope of definitively clearing my name, but would have made me liable for my opponents’ costs as well, which I certainly could not afford.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I lived the most frugal life I could for as long as I could. When that was no longer possible, I moved out of my flat, taking a backpack, tent and sleeping bag, as well as my laptop. I took a train and spent €20 on a shared ride to France, where I started walking the <em>Camino de Santiago de Compostela</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decision was not rushed. I knew for months that I was spending more than I was earning, and not because I was spending a lot. For months I had been looking for work, or some other way to fix my situation. I had hoped for serendipity to relieve me of my financial problems: serendipity had already intervened to delay that moment a couple of times.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so my decision was made only in desperation. I left my home with no certainty of what would come next; not knowing where I would be in a month or through the winter; or in a year. I had no idea how difficult it would be. I had no idea what I would do when the cash in my pocket ran out.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I was also deceiving the people who cared about me. The choice to walk a long-distance path across Europe appealed to me because it was a way to mask my desperation from the people I didn’t want to worry; a way to maintain my pride that I wasn’t relying on charity; a way to make it look like a <em>choice</em>. But it was no choice. That was a lie, first of all to them, and second to myself. The situation was diabolical, and it was the most vulnerable I’ve ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was also relief, in a way. It gave me exercise and time to think. I spent nearly six weeks living each day as it came, walking by daylight, and spending most nights sleeping outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were nights where I suffered in the conditions and had to endure bitterly cold temperatures. It would have been easy to dismiss these as “just camping”, except that most people go camping with a comfortable home to come back to afterwards. I did not.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all, I walked 800km in six weeks. I had time alone, and time walking with others. I made new friends. I kept my circumstances private. And despite the physical challenges, not only did the simpler life allow me to escape my financial problems for a few more weeks, but it was a mental escape, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was <em>escapism</em>, but it too was unsustainable. It ended when I finally ran out of money and had to call on my last lifeline. It ended with losing my independence and becoming financially dependent on someone else. This was the end of my walk, but not the end of my hardship. However, beyond this point I prefer to keep private.
      </p>
      <p>
        My legal action continued for more than a year after this, as I looked for opportunities to conclude it without incurring unaffordable costs, or revealing to my opponents that I was in financial trouble. The risk of default lingered over me. We reached a settlement in my favor in early 2024, avoiding an expensive court hearing by a few days. However, this compromise meant that I missed the chance for my case to be scrutinized in court.
      </p>
      <h2 id="perseverance">
        Perseverance
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have found the last four years tough, even though I have tried to pretend they weren’t. I got through them by indulging in my work: unpaid open-source software. The intellectual stimulation it has given me, day after day, has kept me going and provided motivation to continue—and hope that people may one day give me a fair hearing. Without a project to work on, I believe I would not have had the resilience to continue, and I credit Scala’s endless learning curve with giving me the grit to carry on.
      </p>
      <p>
        To those people who have suggested I would be better leaving Scala to do something else, I respectfully disagree. I shouldn’t have to, and I’m not going to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year I learned more about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and recognized that I was suffering from some of its symptoms. Most of these only began three years after my cancellation. They are real, but thankfully mild, and should not be overstated: they affect my quality of life, but are not debilitating. I take some non-prescription medication to help.
      </p>
      <h2 id="a-lesson">
        A Lesson
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my own particular way, I am getting through this. But I know that a different person thrust into a similar situation could decide on a very different way out. My experience has taught me how it feels to be the target of cancel culture, and unless you go through a similar experience, you’re unlikely ever to feel the same visceral sense of isolation that can trigger an extreme resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not idle scaremongering. The same concerns about “self-policing” were raised after the tragic death of a student at Oxford University in 2024, who fell victim to cancel culture. In the <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alexander-Rogers-Prevention-of-Future-Deaths-Report-2024-0624.pdf">Prevention of Future Deaths Report</a> published following his death, the coroner poses legitimate concerns about social ostracism as “self-policing”, and the normalization of exclusionary behavior. I fully support the findings in the report, and they should be taken seriously by the Scala Community and other communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Group action coordinated by powerful authority figures against an individual has to be recognized for what it is, and understood for the dangers it poses to its target.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I have this advice: if you are invited to sign a letter condemning someone, please stop, remember what happened to me, and think about the potential consequences. If you are in a position of authority and find yourself considering coordinated social ostracism against an individual, please stop, and seek an alternative resolution. If you witness someone targeted by cancel culture—regardless of what they’re accused of—show them your support, either publicly or privately; your contact could make the small difference that saves their life.
      </p>
      <h2 id="a-request">
        A Request
      </h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately in today’s world, too many claims today are valued for their <em>popularity</em>, over their <em>substance</em>. Each name that remains on the Open Letter adds the perception of popularity and the appearance of credibility to the words of the letter that has caused me so much misery for four years. Each name dilutes the scrutiny on the actual claims. And each name continues to cause real harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        I make this clear request now to each of the signatories: please <a href="https://pretty.direct/removal">remove your name</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you did not sign the letter, but know one of the signatories as a friend or colleague, please contact them and respectfully encourage and support them in making the right decision. Make them aware of what they contributed to.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider the signatories to be misguided; not malicious. I believe that they wanted to do the right thing. I judge them by their intent, not their lack of foresight into the consequences. You should too.
      </p>
      <p>
        And they should be judged for their ability to recognize their mistake, and correct it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always had a hopeful and positive outlook on life. My faith in the innate goodness of people has been shaken, but remains intact.

On Android we can see the app was pulling much more fine grained statistics from their user's devices by utilizing permissions granted under the pretext of showing the user app data usage (we will see how this looked in an embedded video below). But that was not enough, Facebook wanted to take this one step further and intercept encrypted traffic towards specific competitor's analytics domains in order to obtain data on the "<strong>in-app actions"</strong>.</p><p>All they would need to do is to get the user to install a custom certificate into the user's phone's trust store (and be on specific Android releases).</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p>The wiretapping information is new and perhaps not to be confused with what occured prior:</p><p>In 2023, two subsidiaries of Facebook was ordered to pay a total of $20M by the Australian Federal Court for "engaging in conduct liable to mislead in breach of the Australian Consumer Law", according to the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/20m-penalty-for-meta-companies-for-conduct-liable-to-mislead-consumers-about-use-of-their-data?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">ACCC</a>.</p><p>Facebook had shutdown Onavo in 2019 after an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">investigation </a>revealed they had been paying teenagers to use the app to track them. Also that year, Apple went as far as to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220609072355/https://www.vox.com/2019/1/30/18203231/apple-banning-facebook-research-app" rel="noreferrer">revoke Facebook's developer program certificates</a>, sending a clear message. </p><p>Despite the apps being taken offline, we are able to find old archived versions which enabled the technical insights offered in this post. </p></div></div><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical analysis</h2><p>Websites and applications on end user devices trust remote websites or servers over HTTPS/TLS due to public certificates that are stored in the device's trust store. These "certificate authority" certs are the "trust anchor" that applications rely on to verify they communicating with the intended party. These certificates are generally distributed and stored within the operating system. By adding your own self-signed certificate to the appropriate trust store, it is often possible to intercept encrypted TLS traffic. Corporations may also do this as a means of inspecting outbound traffic from employee's devices. Security testers may also do this on their own devices. There are legitimate reasons for doing this. The question here is if what Facebook did was legitimate, meaning, was it legal or not.</p><div><p>There is some irony that the documentation for software that Facebook is said to employ to do the interception contains the following <a href="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslBump?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">warning</a>:</p></div><blockquote>HTTPS was designed to give users an expectation of privacy and security. Decrypting HTTPS tunnels without user consent or knowledge may violate ethical norms and may be illegal in your jurisdiction. </blockquote><p>Unlike iOS on the iPhone, Google has made numerous changes to make it extremely difficult to install a CA cert that will be trusted by most applications on the phone. In Android 11, released in September 2020, Google had completely blocked the mechanism which the app used to prompt a user to install the cert and no application would trust any certificate in the user store by default.</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p>People have asked "<i><em>what about cert pinning? wouldn't this have prevented successful MITM of the traffic?</em></i>"</p><p>While that would be the case, as we will see later, at the time, the Snapchat app did not implement cert pinning for it's analytics domain. This would likely hold true for the other app domains.

The actual MITM certificate was removed in 2017. Detail in the court documents may offer plausible explanation:</p><blockquote>Where is the key generated that's used for the SSL bump and how it protected from abuse? (e.g., is generated on the device, specific to that device, and never leaves the device, or is there a shared key that's downloaded with the app and installed)<p><strong>The certificate is generated on the server and being sent to the device</strong></p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="933" height="104" srcset="https://haxrob.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-15.png 600w, https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-15.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Page 3 - Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 736</span></figcaption></figure><p>So we need to go back to much older releases before 2019, specifically a version from September 2017.

<p>The aim is to deter piracy by making sites more difficult to find, but these measures are only partially effective.</p>
<p>More recently, site-blocking requests have begun to target other intermediaries. This includes DNS providers, such as Google and Cloudflare, which were ordered to block sites in France, Italy, and elsewhere. </p>
<p>A few months ago DNS blocking arrived in Belgium, where several orders required both ISPs and DNS resolvers to restrict access to pirate sites. This prompted significant pushback, most notably Cisco’s OpenDNS ceasing operations in the country.</p>
<h2>Broad Blocking Order Targets Internet Archive’s ‘Open Library’</h2>
<p>A new order, issued by the Brussels Business Court in mid-July, targets an even broader set of intermediaries and stands out for other reasons as well. </p>
<p>Requested by various publishing and author organizations, the order aims to block access to known pirate libraries including Anna’s Archive, LibGen, OceanofPDF, and Z-Library. In addition, it also targets the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> project. </p>

<p>Open Library was created by the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> and Internet Archive’s founder Brewster Kahle, among others. As an open library its goal is to archive all published books, allowing patrons to borrow copies of them online. </p>
<p>The library aims to operate similarly to other libraries, loaning only one copy per book at a time. Instead of licensing digital copies, however, it has an in-house scanning operation to create and archive its own copies.</p>

<p>The Open Library project was previously sued by publishers in the United States, where the Internet Archive ultimately <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/internet-archive-loses-landmark-e-book-lending-copyright-appeal-against-publishers-240905/">losing</a> the case. As a result, over 500,000 books were made unavailable. </p>
<p>However, many other books remain available to patrons. The authors and publishers in Belgium argue that, since this is done without permission, the site should be blocked alongside Anna’s Archive, LibGen and Z-Library.</p>
<h2>Clear and Significant Infringement</h2>
<p>The rightsholders describe Open Library as a website where registered members of the public can easily access and download their books. This includes 1,542 works from the publisher Dupuis, over 5,000 works from the publisher Casterman, and many others. </p>
<p>According to the publishers, the operators of the Open Library are not easily identified, while legally required information is allegedly missing from the site, which they see as an indication that the site is meant to operate illegally. </p>
<p>This description seems at odds with the fact that Open Library is part of the Internet Archive, which is a U.S.-registered  501(c)(3) non-profit.</p>

</center>
<p>The publishers also reference a U.S. court order in favor of other publishers, which allegedly confirms the unlawful nature of Open Library. </p>
<p>The Brussels court, after reviewing these arguments and the submitted evidence, concluded that there was a <em>prima facie</em> case of “clear and significant infringement,” which justified granting a provisional blocking order against Open Library and the other targeted sites.</p>
<h2>Broad Blocking Order Targets ISPs, Search, Payments, and More</h2>
<p>Internet Archive was not heard in this case, as the blocking order was issued <em>ex parte</em>, without its knowledge. This is remarkable, as the organization is a legal entity in the United States, which receives support from many American libraries.</p>
<p>The broad nature of the order doesn’t stop there either. In addition to requiring ISPs, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, to block the library’s domain names, it also directs a broad range of other intermediaries to take action. </p>
<p>This includes search engines, DNS resolvers, advertisers, domain name services, CDNs, and hosting companies. An abbreviated overview of the requested measures is as follows; </p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Search Engines</strong></p>
<p><em>Google</em> must remove the target sites from search results, deactivate related Google Ads, remove an infringing app from the Google Play Store, and block DNS requests for the associated domains.</p>
<p><em>Microsoft</em> is ordered to remove the target sites from the “Bing” search engine and block related DNS queries.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting, DNS, CDNs, and Domain Name Services</strong></p>
<p>The following companies must terminate hosting, and deactivate or suspend the domain names of the target sites: Hostinger, GoDaddy, Amazon Web Services, SEDO, Cloudflare, Unmanaged Ltd, AlexHost, and Internet Archive.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Intermediaries</strong></p>
<p>These companies are ordered to suspend all payment services benefiting the target sites: Alipay (Europe), Cash App and Squareup Europe, and PayPal (Europe).</p>
<p><strong>ISPs including Starlink</strong></p>
<p>The following ISPs, active in Belgium, are required to implement DNS blocking measures: Telenet, Proximus, Mobile Vikings, Orange Belgium, Voo, DIGI Communications, Cybernet, EDPnet, CENTREA, Yoin, Tchamba Refinder, IPTelecom, United Mobile, SkyDSL Europe, Starlink Internet Services.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Given the broad nature of the order, pushback from some of the intermediaries is expected. The Internet Archive’s Open Library won’t be pleased either, as the order effectively blocks their service in Belgium, including all access to public domain content. </p>

From our humble beginnings with Privacy Friendly Torchlight, our apps have always been available in the Google Play Store. Our current selection of Privacy Friendly Apps has grown since then to more than 30. And with more than 350,000 installs we believe we left a dent. We want to take this opportunity to also thank all our users for their continued support!</p>

<p>However, in 2025, eight years after we took on this project, things have changed. Not in regards to apps demanding more permissions than they need. No, unfortunately not that. What changed, however, is the effort to keep the apps updated. The maintenance for the provision of privacy-friendly apps in the Google Play Store is significantly greater than on F-Droid and is no longer feasible for a research group.</p>

<p>Please note that existing installations of our apps on your devices will not be deleted or affected by this change. However, you will no longer receive updates through the Google Play Store, which means that our apps may eventually stop working properly as the Android operating system evolves and compatibility issues arise. We recommend switching to the F-Droid Store for continued support and updates.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Friendly Apps will continue to be available on the F-Droid Store. For your convenience, we created instructions that explains how you can easily make the switch to the F-Droid Store while keeping all your data: <a href="https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/downloads/play-store-to-f-droid-migration.pdf">Migration Instructions</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <article>
        <p>Hear me out, I can already read the descenting opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>But I need session persistence!</li>
<li>But I need split windows!</li>
<li>But I need to group windows per project!</li>
<li>But I need lots of terminals inside of a remote server!</li>
</ul>
<p>I had the exact same response whenever someone would argue against using <code>tmux</code>.
For context, I've been a huge fan of <code>tmux</code> and have been using it as a daily
part of my workflow for 7+ years. Whether I'm developing on my local machine or
in SSH, I was using <code>tmux</code>.</p>
<p>However, a couple of years ago I stumbled across a
<a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745" rel="nofollow">GitHub issue in the kitty project</a>
that has stuck in my mind like an itch that I cannot scratch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary: multiplexers add unnecessary overhead, suffer from a complexity
cascade, because they actually have to <em>translate</em> escape codes, modifying
them in hackish ways to get them to work with their concepts of
windows/sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then a couple of weeks ago I watched this excellent interview from
<code>linkarzu</code> and kovid (creator of kitty). In it, they
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOK4EJDyjcM" rel="nofollow">discussed <code>tmux</code></a>.</p>
<p>I have to say, the arguments are convincing. Over the years, I have had a
handful of problems with <code>tmux</code> that were not necessarily deal breakers but very
annoying to deal with on a regular basis.</p>
<p>For example, if you do not set <code>TERM</code> with <code>tmux</code> properly, your colors will
render incorrectly. Without <code>tmux</code> everything looks good, but with it things can
look washed out or just wrong. So when debugging issues related to terminal
features, you need to consider both your terminal emulator and <code>tmux</code>. Now add
another layer like <code>ssh</code> and you're really pulling your hair out.</p>
<p>Another example is buffer scrollback. It's one of those things where you have to
learn the <code>tmux</code> way of scrolling a window. You get used to it, of course, but
it's just not great.</p>
<p>And what about mouse select to copy/paste? It works most of the time, but
sometimes <code>tmux</code> gets ignored and I'm selecting across splits which makes the
thing I'm copying impossible to grab without bailing.</p>
<p>Another issue I ran into a couple of times is the lack of experimental protocol
support. I use "experimental" loosely since some of them are gaining popularity
inside terminal emulators, like the
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/" rel="nofollow">kitty graphics protocol</a>.
Even if your terminal emulator supports the kitty graphics protocol,
<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/3395#issuecomment-1327312472" rel="nofollow"><code>tmux</code> does not</a>.</p>
<p>This is why kovid argues that terminal multiplexers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[...] act as a drag on the ecosystem as a whole, making it very hard to get
any new features."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I get it, I'm sympathetic to the issue terminal multiplexers cause to the
wider terminal ecosystem, but what's the alternative? <code>tmux</code> solves problems
that are not easy to replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>session persistence (detach + attach process from terminal)</li>
<li>window management (tabs, splits, moving them around)</li>
</ul>
<p>Session persistence can be accomplished in a number of ways, with varying
degrees of feature overlap with what <code>tmux</code> provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ctrl-z</code> + <code>fg</code></li>
<li><code>nohup {cmd} &amp;</code></li>
<li><code>disown</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These are discussed in this
<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/178587/how-do-i-detach-a-process-from-terminal-entirely" rel="nofollow">stack exchange</a>
post. None of them quite work the way <code>tmux</code> works. In particular, these
commands will either a) get killed when you close your terminal, or b) cannot
reattach easily.</p>
<p>For window management, the argument is we should use our window managers to
manipulate our windows. That works great for local development, but what happens
when you are SSH'd into a server? How do you let your window manager manipulate
windows within an SSH session?</p>
<p>Darn, built-in tools don't quite check all of our boxes, I wonder, are there any
<code>tmux</code> alternatives that could work?</p>
<p>I was desperate for a solution and I really did not want to build my own. I also
didn't want to replace <code>tmux</code> with something equally as large of a dependency.
Here's what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dtach.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">dtach</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/martanne/abduco" rel="nofollow">abduco</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool" rel="nofollow">shpool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these tools embody the unix philosophy of doing one thing, well. So they
are targeting session persistence (detach and attach functionality). What's
exciting about this idea is since there are no virtual splits, I can get native
scrollback!</p>
<p>Most of them work by <strong>creating a daemon<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup></strong> with some permutation of <code>fork()</code>
and communicating with a unix socket between the detached process and "client"
terminals. Some of them support buffer playback so when you reattach you can see
where you left off. Most of them haven't quite nailed this aspect of what <code>tmux</code>
does well, but <code>shpool</code> does a pretty good job.</p>
<p>I tried all of them with varying degrees of success. They could do what they
claim, but they are buggy. In particular, I could not get them to detach when
inside of <code>nvim</code>, which is a deal breaker. I assumed it was because the
shortcuts I was using to detach were being captured by <code>nvim</code>. Who knows, it
might be something misconfigured on my end.</p>
<p>However, out of those tools I used, <code>shpool</code> checked the most boxes.
Specifically they have a command <code>shpool detach</code> which allowed me to run a
command to detach the current process. So I was able to create a keymap that
sent the detach command to <code>shpool</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>1</span><span><span>-- https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool/issues/71#issuecomment-2632396805</span>
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span><span>vim.keymap</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>({</span> <span>"n"</span><span>,</span> <span>"v"</span><span>,</span> <span>"i"</span><span>,</span> <span>"t"</span> <span>},</span> <span>"&lt;C-space&gt;&lt;C-d&gt;"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span>
</span></span><span><span>3</span><span>  <span>vim.cmd</span><span>(</span><span>"!shpool detach"</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>4</span><span><span>end</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre><p>Nice, this is working well for session persistence. Let's move onto window
management. I'm using <code>ghostty</code> on my work laptop and <code>sway+foot</code> on my personal
machines. I can use both of them for window management, but as a note I employ a
client+server development workflow. This means my client (e.g. laptop, desktop)
connects to a headless VM on my <code>proxmox</code> box where I do all of my dev. So I am
always SSH'd during development. So how can I use my local window managers to
control all my <code>shpool</code> sessions on a remote server?</p>
<p><code>shpool</code> has some docs on how to
<a href="https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-automatically-connect-to-shpool" rel="nofollow">automatically connect to <code>shpool</code></a></p>
<p>The idea is simple: use your window manager to create new terminal windows and
then <code>ssh</code> into each <code>shpool</code> session. Here's the <code>ssh_config</code> I use to make
this easier:</p>
<pre><code>Host *
    # ping server to make sure it's still responding
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3

Host = d.*
    HostName 192.168.88.xxx

<a href="https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool/issues/40" rel="nofollow">doesn't support "multiplayer"</a>
which has caused some issues with using <code>autossh</code> on multiple clients since they

There are thousands of satellites in the sky above us at this moment, orbiting Earth. Satellites have many uses for the government, military, and even civilians. They provide us with the ability to have things like Internet access, television, GPS, and much more. They also have scientific purposes such as Earth and space observation and provide the means for high-level technology development. More than half of the 4,550 satellites orbiting Earth are used for communications purposes, and that number will continue to rise as tech billionaires look to bring high-speed Internet access to every corner of Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>But what we want to know is, who owns our orbit?

As of Sept. 1, 2021, SpaceX is leading the race, with their Starlink satellite program planning to send more than a thousand new satellites into orbit every year. SpaceX owns an incredible 36% of the satellites in orbit around Earth.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure data-testid="cne-audio-embed-figure"></figure><p>Hearings before the Commerce Committee of the Arizona House of Representatives normally draw a modest crowd of lobbyists in suits. On March&nbsp;19, 2024, a throng of people in more casual attire appeared. They wore matching green T-shirts adorned with the message “Save Our Tips.” The slogan caught the eye of Analise Ortiz, a Democrat on the committee. She assumed that the visitors were bartenders and waitstaff who had come to voice opposition to a bill that could lower their salaries.</p><p>The bill was called the Tipped Workers Protection Act, a name that disguised its true purpose. The legislation, if approved, would place an initiative on that November’s ballot to amend the Arizona constitution so that employers could pay tipped workers twenty-five per cent less than the state minimum wage, then $14.35 an hour. In Arizona, the minimum wage for such workers was already $11.35 an hour. The formula being proposed would allow employers to pay tipped workers just $10.76 an hour—a pay cut that would reduce a full-time server’s annual salary by twelve hundred dollars.</p><p>Ortiz, who had worked at a restaurant to help pay for college, knew from experience that servers were vulnerable to exploitation and mistreatment. She’d noticed that the chief supporter of the Tipped Workers Protection Act was the Arizona Restaurant Association, an industry lobby that represents the interests of owners. It had persuaded Republicans to introduce the measure as a way of blocking another ballot initiative, the One Fair Wage Act, which called for raising Arizona’s minimum wage to eighteen dollars an hour and insuring that by 2028 tipped workers would be paid that amount (without relinquishing their gratuities).</p><p>As the hearing progressed, Ortiz expected the workers in the green T-shirts to explain why they deserved a raise or, at the very least, did not want their salaries lowered. But, when three members of the group came forward to testify, all expressed support for the Tipped Workers Protection Act and opposition to the One Fair Wage Act, which they portrayed as an effort to steal their tips. A waitress named Jaime Sarli said, “If restaurants had to pay us more money and eliminated tips, why would I want to do this?” She explained that she made such “great money” as a server that she’d turned down salaried managerial positions. “I don’t want to work a minimum-wage job,” she said.</p><p>Ortiz, who is now a state senator, told me that, as she listened, she “became confused.” The One Fair Wage Act proposed guaranteeing servers a full minimum wage that would still be supplemented by tips. She found it odd that workers would instead promote a bill that cut their base salaries, especially at a time when the price of virtually everything—food, gas, rent—was rising. Ortiz subsequently came across a video, produced by a YouTuber called HistorySock, that clarified what she’d witnessed. The Save Our Tips activists all had ties to the Arizona Restaurant Association, the video revealed, and none were entry-level servers. Sarli, the waitress who’d testified about her fantastic tips, was an assistant manager at Streets of New York, a pizza chain whose owner, Lorrie Glaeser, was the vice-chair of the Arizona Restaurant Association’s board. Beth Cochran, who testified after Sarli, was the vice-president of Snooze A.M. Eatery, a breakfast chain, and served on the same board. “These people were management and were advocating for a bill that would allow them to undercut their own workforce,” Ortiz said. “That really upset me.”</p><p>Some workers at the hearing did speak against the Tipped Workers Protection Act. Meschelle Hornstein, a waitress at a restaurant in the Phoenix airport and a member of the trade union Unite Here, said that the measure “would harm the working-class people that make up the majority of tip positions.” Her testimony didn’t persuade the Republicans on the committee. One of them said, “Except for some of the unions, it’s clear the employees are happy with the situation as it is.” This message was echoed by Dan Bogert, the chief operating officer of the Arizona Restaurant Association, who urged the committee to “really just listen to the workers who are <em>here</em>.” He didn’t mention that the slogan on the green T-shirts matched the name of a new political-action committee, Save Our Tips AZ, that his organization was funding. According to a form filed with the Arizona secretary of state last October, the <em>PAC</em> received nearly a quarter of a million dollars from the Arizona Restaurant Association in the months that followed. The form was signed by Bogert, who was listed as the <em>pac</em>’s treasurer.</p><p>Until recently, tipped workers were politically all but invisible. This changed last summer, when Donald Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Las Vegas. Nevada was a swing state with many tipped employees in hotels, night clubs, restaurants, and casinos. Trump had a message for such workers: “You’re going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips.”</p><p>Had Trump abandoned this pledge after winning Nevada and the general election, few observers would have been shocked. During his first term, the Department of Labor had hardly championed the interests of tipped workers, issuing a proposal that would have enabled restaurant owners to pocket pooled tips, under the guise of redirecting them to untipped, back-of-house workers. The Labor Department didn’t lay out what this would cost tipped workers, perhaps because it didn’t want the public to know. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, estimated that it could deprive employees of nearly six billion dollars in tips annually. (After a public outcry, Congress blocked the move.)</p><p>Trump recently claimed that the idea of eliminating taxes on tips was inspired by an exchange he’d had with a waitress he’d encountered at a dinner in Vegas. “She happened to be beautiful,” he told a group of blue-collar workers who were invited to the White House in June. “And she looked at me—she said, ‘Sir, there should be no tax on tips.’&nbsp;” This was “the coolest thing I’ve ever heard.” The idea was included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed on July 4th; it was one of the few items in the package that some Democrats supported. Republicans released a video playing up the bill’s benefits for people like Peggy Weir, a waitress in Indiana who praises Trump for “fighting for the working men and women.” Many economists, however, consider the notion misguided. According to Yale’s Budget Lab, thirty-seven per cent of tipped workers don’t make enough money to pay any federal income taxes. Under the new law, casino dealers earning six-figure salaries with tips will receive large tax breaks, whereas busboys making poverty wages will get no benefit. And, though ending taxes on tips has a populist veneer, it won’t cost the owners of hotels and restaurants a penny. (This may be why Trump—himself a member of this class—embraced the idea.) The policy could even encourage employers to shift more kinds of work to tipped, subminimum-wage positions—thus reducing labor costs.</p><p>In February, Congressman Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, tried to rally support for an alternative measure called the Tipped Income Protection and Support Act, a bill that advocates a different approach. In <em>addition</em> to ending taxes on tips, it proposes to eliminate the subminimum wage that tipped workers are paid—a rate that, in sixteen states, is just $2.13 an hour before tips. Currently, the poverty rate among tipped workers is more than double the rate of other employees. Tipped workers are also more likely to rely on food stamps and other federal assistance.</p><p>Raising the minimum wage is popular even in red states—in 2022, voters in Nebraska, which Trump won by more than twenty points, approved a ballot measure to increase it from nine dollars to fifteen dollars an hour in the course of four years. But raising the subminimum wage for tipped workers has proved far more challenging, owing, in no small part, to the power of the National Restaurant Association, an industry lobby that some labor advocates call “the other N.R.A.” The lobby, which has a partnership with the Arizona group and similar associations in all fifty states, emerged as a potent force in the nineteen-nineties, under the leadership of Herman Cain, previously the C.E.O. of Godfather’s Pizza. (In 2012, he unsuccessfully ran for President.) During Cain’s era, the N.R.A. helped to fight President Bill Clinton’s 1993 health-care-reform plan, which would have required restaurant owners to provide insurance to full-time employees. Later, when Clinton sought to raise the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour, the N.R.A. went along with the idea on the condition that the subminimum wage for tipped workers remain $2.13. This two-tiered wage system had existed since 1966, when an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act permitted tipped workers to be paid a fixed portion of the standard minimum wage as long as gratuities covered the difference. For decades, the two rates rose in tandem. In 1996, they were decoupled, and the $2.13 federal subminimum wage has been locked in place ever since.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27376&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27376" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“True, only God can make a tree, but only man can make it into a cardboard box.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Barbara Smaller</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Robert Reich, Clinton’s first Labor Secretary, described this situation to me as “utterly outrageous.” He also called it a corporate giveaway that shifted the cost of paying restaurant workers from employers to customers and taxpayers: “American taxpayers are subsidizing the biggest restaurant chains in the country with food stamps and other benefits that go to their tipped workers, because these workers can’t afford to make it any other way.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In 2021, an amendment to raise the federal minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour and phase out the subminimum wage for tipped workers was attached to President Joe Biden’s pandemic-relief package. But the Senate parliamentarian removed the proposal from the bill, on procedural grounds. Bernie Sanders, then the Budget Committee chairman, forced a vote on the bill anyway, with the provision included. This decision sparked a furor among supposedly liberal lawmakers, according to Ari Rabin-Havt, Sanders’s legislative director at the time. “I got such an incoming of shit, like nothing else I’ve <em>ever</em> gotten, from Democratic legislative directors about how dare I force their bosses to take this terrible vote,” Rabin-Havt recalled. “I’m talking four-letter-word screaming—stuff I didn’t even get when we were doing something on Israel that people didn’t like.” The source of the rage wasn’t the raising of the federal minimum wage, a proposal that had broad support, but eliminating the subminimum wage for tipped workers and potentially incurring the wrath of the National Restaurant Association. In the end, seven Democrats and an Independent voted against the bill—among them Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, and Kyrsten Sinema, of Arizona—and the legislation was defeated, 58–42. A few weeks later, Manchin and Sinema spoke at the N.R.A.’s annual public-policy convention.</p><p>The outsized power of corporate lobbies is often attributed to their vast financial resources and to the absence of meaningful restrictions on campaign spending since the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, in 2010. According to the nonprofit OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics, the N.R.A., during the 2024 election cycle, disbursed nearly a million dollars to various <em>PAC</em>s, party committees, and candidates, money that flowed to both Democrats and Republicans. But this isn’t the real source of the group’s power, Rabin-Havt said. “What makes them uniquely powerful is they have a grassroots network of members and supporters,” he said. “Everyone has restaurants in their districts. And all these elected officials are on the road a ton, so they’re <em>in</em> these restaurants, and they use them to host fund-raisers.” The N.R.A. knew, he said, that politicians were afraid of alienating these crucial constituents. “It’s very good at politics,” he conceded.</p><p>Few people have clashed more frequently with the National Restaurant Association than Saru Jayaraman, the founder of the U.C. Berkeley Food Labor Research Center and the president of an advocacy organization called One Fair Wage. As this name suggests, the group favors eliminating subminimum wages, a goal that it has tried to advance in numerous states, including Arizona, where it led the drive to place the One Fair Wage Act on the ballot last year. The proposal never made it to the referendum stage, because the Arizona Restaurant Association filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of signatures collected in support of the idea. The alternative pushed by the A.R.A. did appear on the ballot, after Republicans on the House Commerce Committee approved it, in a party-line vote.</p><p>It was a striking illustration of the restaurant lobby’s influence; nevertheless, Arizona voters ended up rejecting the industry-backed measure, by a three-to-one margin. Jayaraman sees this as a sign that, for all the N.R.A.’s resources and connections, resistance to its agenda is growing. She has been a leader in this area since 2002, when she co-founded an organization called the Restaurant Opportunities Center to help workers who had been employed at Windows on the World, a restaurant in the World Trade Center, after 9/11. The organization was soon flooded with appeals from servers at other restaurants who complained about more systemic problems—wage theft, sexual harassment, paltry pay. Jayaraman, who is Indian American, attributes the pervasiveness of some of these problems to gender and race. The idea of tips as a substitute for wages is “a direct legacy of slavery,” she said when we met at a Mexican restaurant in the East Village. After emancipation, the practice flourished at firms such as the Pullman Company, which hired formerly enslaved men as porters but declined to pay them a salary, causing them to rely on handouts from white customers. It’s no coincidence, Jayaraman said, that immigrants and Black people are overrepresented among the ranks of tipped workers today. So, too, are women, whose dependence on tips makes them vulnerable not only to harassment but also to discrimination. In a recent book, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/One-Fair-Wage-Subminimum-America/dp/1620975335" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/One-Fair-Wage-Subminimum-America/dp/1620975335&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Fair-Wage-Subminimum-America/dp/1620975335" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1620975335" data-aps-asc-tag="">One Fair Wage: Ending Subminimum Pay in America</a>,” Jayaraman cites a study revealing that, in New York, Black women at dining establishments earn eight dollars an hour less than their white male peers, in part because customers tip them less.</p><p>The restaurant where we met is called La Palapa. Jayaraman said that she chose the place because it’s an establishment that pays employees a living wage, which, she argues, is not only fair but also good for business. (The restaurant’s owner, Barbara Sibley, agrees; she told me that eliminating subminimum wages had significantly reduced staff turnover.) During the pandemic, many workers at restaurants with less enlightened owners quit their jobs, Jayaraman noted, signalling their frustration with the low and erratic pay. Cities such as Chicago have since passed legislation to phase out the subminimum wage. “We are in a worker-power moment,” Jayaraman said. “Finally, we are winning.”</p><p>But, as she acknowledged, one of the N.R.A.’s most effective tactics has been persuading restaurant workers that “winning” entails defeating the agenda of organizations like hers. Last year, a canvasser named Mitchell Gaynor became aware of this strategy while campaigning for the passage of Ballot Question 5, a Massachusetts proposal to raise the base pay of tipped workers from $6.75 an hour to $15 an hour—the state minimum wage—by 2029. Gaynor, who grew up in a working-class household in the North Shore region of Massachusetts and has often worked in restaurants for meagre pay, figured that it would be easy to persuade his peers to back the proposal. Instead, he “lost friends over this,” he said, as many servers became convinced that approving Question 5 would force restaurants to raise prices so high that customers would either stop tipping or stop eating out. This was a message crafted by the Massachusetts Restaurant Association—which, like all the state groups, has a written agreement with the N.R.A. that reflects a shared mission. The notion was often relayed to tipped workers directly by their bosses. One waitress told me that the owner of her restaurant pulled servers aside before a shift and urged them to “get the word out to vote no on Question 5,” so that their tips wouldn’t be taken away. In some restaurants and bars, signs saying “Vote No on 5” were hung in prominent places, to insure that customers got the message, too. Another waiter sent me photographs of the checks that he and his co-workers were handing out to diners. “Your Crew Votes ‘NO’ on Question 5,” they stated at the top. (The waiter voted yes, a fact that he hid from his boss.)</p><p>The N.R.A.’s Massachusetts campaign was a huge success. In a liberal state where Elizabeth Warren, one of the Senate’s fiercest champions of labor, cruised to reëlection, nearly two-thirds of voters rejected Question 5. “We got our asses kicked,” Gaynor said.</p><p>I recently visited the N.R.A.’s headquarters, in Washington, D.C. Sean Kennedy, the executive vice-president of public affairs, told me that it’s entirely reasonable for bartenders and waitresses to fear that eliminating the “tip credit”—the difference between the minimum wage and their base pay—will be detrimental to their interests. Kennedy has a polished manner and a fluency with social policy that was honed on Capitol Hill. He was an aide to the former Democratic Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt and a special assistant for legislative affairs to President Barack Obama before becoming a corporate lobbyist. Kennedy told me that, if labor costs suddenly tripled, restaurants would need to either raise prices (which could lead customers to tip less) or hire fewer people. Both scenarios would harm the servers whom the policy was designed to help. Question 5 in Massachusetts and similar measures elsewhere have not failed because of the restaurant lobby, he insisted, but because owners and employees “recognized what was at stake and engaged their local policymakers to say, ‘This is a bad idea.’&nbsp;”</p><p>Kennedy continued, “Every business economist has said that, if you raise the minimum wage, there’s going to be a reduction in jobs that’s going to be particularly intense in labor-intensive industries.” For much of the twentieth century, this was indeed the prevailing view among economists. But in 1994 the <em>American Economic Review</em> published an article that challenged this belief. Its authors—David Card, who would go on to win a Nobel Prize for his research on labor markets, and Alan Krueger, then a professor at Princeton—tracked the employment levels at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey before and after the state raised its minimum wage, then compared these data with the situation in neighboring Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage hadn’t changed. They found “no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.” In 2010, a team of economists examined three hundred and sixteen pairs of counties on the opposite side of state borders where, during a period of sixteen and a half years, the minimum wage rose on one side but not on the other. They, too, found no adverse employment effects.</p><p>Michael Reich, a labor economist at U.C. Berkeley who co-authored the 2010 study, told me that most economists today no longer believe that raising the minimum wage will substantially reduce employment among low-wage workers. Doing so will cause restaurant prices to rise, he acknowledged, but the change will be far smaller than many people assume, in part because raising the minimum wage often lowers the cost of recruiting and retaining workers. In a recent policy brief, Reich examined the effects of California’s adoption, in 2024, of a twenty-dollar minimum wage for fast-food workers, a policy that the N.R.A. strenuously opposed. He found that the measure has led to price increases of less than two per cent—roughly six cents on a four-dollar hamburger. In February, Reich’s analysis was cited, misleadingly, by the Employment Policies Institute, which opposes raising the minimum wage. A blog published by the group quoted a sentence in which Reich made note of “a very small negative employment effect” from California’s wage increase. It didn’t quote the next line of the study, which explained that, when a statistical method controlling for trends in related industries and other variables was used, there was no decline in employment. The Employment Policies Institute has received funding from the N.R.A. and was founded by Richard Berman, a retired lobbyist and public-relations executive who specialized in creating nonprofit organizations that served as fronts for corporate clients, including the tobacco, alcohol, and restaurant industries.</p><p>Michael Reich’s research focusses on the fast-food industry, not on independent, full-service restaurants. Such businesses would be more endangered if the tip credit were eliminated, Kennedy told me. But the claim that they would go bankrupt if they had to pay waitstaff and bartenders the full minimum wage is belied by the fact that seven states, including Alaska, Minnesota, and California, already require restaurants to do this. Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist who studies the minimum wage, noted that people still eat out (and tip) in those states: “I’m here in Oakland, where the restaurant industry is booming and everyone tips.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In 2023, Allegretto published a study that compared “high-road” states that have no tip credit and “low-road” states, where restaurant workers get $2.13 in base salary. In the high-road states, the poverty rate of waitstaff and bartenders was significantly lower. And restaurant jobs had not grown scarce. In fact, between 2012 and 2019, the number of businesses and the rate of employment growth in full-service restaurants were <em>higher</em> in these states.</p><p>The N.R.A. claims that there’s no need for restaurants to pay tipped workers the full minimum wage, because servers already do so well. “You can bring home a really impressive paycheck,” Kennedy told me. Before we met, the organization had sent me some industry data, including this statistic: “The median hourly income of a tipped server is $27/hour, with the top earners making over $41/hour and the low end making $19/hour.” It came from a survey of more than two thousand full-service restaurants that the N.R.A. itself conducted. No economist would regard a lobbying group as a reliable source for such information. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly pay of waiters and waitresses (including tips) was $15.36 in 2023. A quarter of full-time servers earn less than twenty-four thousand dollars a year. Although waiters in fine-dining establishments can make several times this amount, there are far more low earners who work at places such as <em>IHOP</em> and Cracker Barrel. Restaurant servers are also much less likely to receive health insurance, paid sick leave, and other benefits than other private-sector employees.</p><p>Allegretto acknowledged that small, family-owned restaurants could “struggle disproportionately” if the tip credit were eliminated, and that these institutions helped give many communities their charm. “We definitely don’t want to lose the restaurants that make your neighborhood so wonderful to live in,” she said. But there are ways to help such businesses—lowering their tax burden during a transition period, for example. Countries that have never expected servers to rely on tips, including Italy and France, are full of family-owned restaurants. “Why are we the only country in the world doing this?” Allegretto asked. “The model we have is very unfair, and it’s not necessary.”</p><p>One afternoon, I met a bartender named Max Hawla, who lives in Washington, D.C., where the debate about tipped workers has been particularly heated in recent years. Hawla is in his early thirties, with a laid-back manner and a boyish face framed by a mop of reddish-blond hair. In 2018, he was working at a bar in Dupont Circle when he heard about Initiative 77, a ballot measure backed by Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which proposed to raise wages for D.C. servers from less than four dollars an hour to the standard minimum wage by 2026. After his manager told him that the measure would “mess up our wages,” Hawla became opposed to the idea, to the point of changing his profile picture on Facebook to an Initiative 77 sign with a slash through it.</p><p>Despite stiff opposition from the N.R.A. and the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington, voters approved Initiative 77, by a nearly twelve-point margin. Later that year, under pressure from the restaurant lobby, the D.C. Council overturned it. When Hawla heard this, he was relieved. Sometime later, he visited a friend in Seattle. One night, they went to a speakeasy and chatted with the bartender. Hawla thought that he had a “very bro-ish, bodybuilder vibe,” and was the kind of guy who probably made a nice living just on tips. Hawla decided to ask him what he thought of the tip credit.</p><p>“What’s a tip credit?” the man said. There wasn’t one in Washington State or in Montana, where he’d grown up.</p><p>“You know—because you get tips, your employer can pay you a lower wage,” Hawla explained.</p><p>“Well, that sounds stupid,” the bartender said, noting that he made fifteen dollars an hour, and still got good tips on top.</p><p>In 2022, a proposal to phase out the tip credit in D.C. was again placed on the ballot. This time, Hawla voted for the measure, having come to believe that he’d been fed “a lot of misinformation” that was designed to get tipped workers to fight against their own interests. The proposal, Initiative 82, passed by nearly fifty points, seemingly settling the matter. But this past January a friend alerted Hawla that the D.C. Council was hosting a public hearing on the issue. The friend, a fellow-bartender named Rachelle Yeung, had been working a shift at a brewery when a canvasser dropped off a flyer encouraging servers to attend the hearing and testify about the “negative impact” Initiative 82 was having. “Have you or your co-workers lost hours?” the flyer asked. “Lost jobs?”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28039&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28039" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“I’ll remember anything you want for a peanut.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Lonnie Millsap</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Workers who’d experienced these problems were instructed to contact a server named Joshua Chaisson, whose e-mail address was printed at the bottom of the flyer. Chaisson had personally handed a flyer to Yeung. A week later, Chaisson, who goes by @MrTipCredit on X, appeared at the hearing in a black sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo “<em>SAVE THE TIP CREDIT RWA</em>”—the initials of a group called the Restaurant Workers of America. This organization, which Chaisson co-founded, first attracted media attention in 2018, after its members began speaking out against campaigns to eliminate the subminimum wage. Some media outlets credulously depicted it as a grassroots network of servers who opposed an imprudent policy shift. “We keep screaming from the rooftops, ‘Please don’t help!’&nbsp;” one member told BuzzFeed News. The tone of reporting on the group changed after the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em> published an article revealing that most of its members were restaurant owners, each of whom paid between a hundred dollars and five hundred dollars to join. BuzzFeed News later reported that the Restaurant Workers of America’s most prominent spokesperson, Chaisson, had strategized with the P.R. firm founded by Richard Berman, the man who created fronts for lobbying groups.</p><p>Sean Kennedy, of the N.R.A., told me that his group has no financial ties to the Restaurant Workers of America, though he acknowledged that the organizations have had “intel-sharing conversations.” In recent years, Chaisson appears to be keeping a lower profile—he didn’t respond to a request for an interview—but he’s continued to push for maintaining the tip-credit system. His crusade against Initiative 82 might seem strange, given that he waits tables in Portland, Maine, more than five hundred miles from the nation’s capital. Nevertheless, at the hearing, he blasted the measure for creating a “dumpster fire” in D.C., saying that restaurants were closing at a record pace and servers were losing hours and jobs. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paint a less dire picture. Since Initiative 82 was adopted, employment at full-service restaurants in D.C. has hovered at about thirty thousand jobs. Nonetheless, in June the D.C. Council overrode voters for a second time. It paused the minimum wage for tipped workers, which was scheduled to go up to twelve dollars an hour in July, at its current level—ten dollars an hour. The city’s minimum wage is $17.95.</p><p>Nina Mast, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, has studied the methods of the restaurant-industry lobby closely. She’s an expert on child labor, which has grown increasingly pervasive in recent years, as states have loosened restrictions on the number of hours that teens can legally work on school nights, and permitted their involvement in alcohol service and hazardous jobs such as roofing. In Iowa, Florida, and several other states, the restaurant lobby has pushed for these policies, she told me, in part to address what the lobby claims were labor shortages caused by the pandemic. Recently, Kennedy was quoted in a press release introducing a federal bill that would let teens work longer and later. N.R.A. associations and their members have portrayed the changes as harmless, family-friendly reforms. “What they do is recruit mostly white teens who work at a family-owned small business to testify that working a few extra hours a week will benefit them,” Mast said. “Of course, this is strategic. They don’t want lawmakers to hear from teens who are getting injured working in slaughterhouses owned by multinational corporations or who can’t stay awake in school, because they’re being scheduled to work late on school nights. But <em>these</em> are the young people who will be harmed.” The N.R.A.’s agenda went far beyond defeating efforts to eliminate the subminimum wage, she added: “The N.R.A. and its state affiliates are heavily invested in lobbying for anti-worker policies across the board, in areas from paid sick leave to overtime pay.”</p><p>Jessie Danielson, a member of the Colorado State Senate whom I met in May, has seen this more sinister face of the restaurant lobby. Danielson is a progressive Democrat and an outspoken champion of workers’ rights. One bill she recently co-sponsored would require the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment to publish on its website the names of employers who engaged in wage theft—a widespread problem in the restaurant industry—and report these violations to licensing and permitting bodies. Last year, a study published by the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations estimated that, in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area, forty-five thousand workers a year were paid below the minimum wage, costing them, collectively, at least a hundred and thirty-six million dollars in earnings. Among the occupations subject to the highest violation rates were servers, hosts, and chefs. Few people would defend employers who steal money from their workers, but the Colorado Restaurant Association opposed the wage-theft bill. Danielson also sponsored a bill called the Worker Protection Act, which sought to eliminate an onerous requirement for workers seeking to form a union: that they hold a second election, and win seventy-five per cent of the vote, a burden unique to Colorado. The Colorado Restaurant Association opposed this measure, too. “Does this lobby oppose <em>anything</em> that gives workers rights?” she said. “In my experience, yes.”</p><p>The Colorado restaurant lobby did support one piece of labor legislation this year—a bill, H.B. 1208, that proposed lowering the base pay of tipped workers in cities that have raised their minimum wages above the statewide level. One such city is Denver, where the measure would have cut the minimum wage for tipped workers from $15.79 to $11.79. The bill’s supporters claimed that this was necessary because labor costs were decimating Denver’s restaurant industry. They cited the fact that since 2022 the number of licensed establishments in the city had fallen by twenty-two per cent. This figure, which appeared in the Denver <em>Post</em> and was circulated widely, came from the Department of Excise and Licenses. But, as Denver Labor, a division of the city’s auditor’s office, pointed out, that department didn’t give licenses only to restaurants; it issued them to all food and retail establishments, a category that had recently been redefined, with many food trucks and concession stands removed from the department’s database. As the department itself made clear, this meant that the statistic was an unreliable barometer of the restaurant industry’s health.</p><p>After meeting Danielson, I visited the offices of the Colorado Restaurant Association to speak with Sonia Riggs, its president and C.E.O. Riggs maintained that labor costs were devastating Denver’s restaurant scene. “I talk to restaurateurs every day who are crying or are looking for an exit strategy,” she said. “When you hear those stories over and over, it literally breaks your heart.” Riggs went on to frame H.B. 1208 as a matter of fairness, not only for struggling owners but also for back-of-house workers who didn’t get tips. “Why are the lowest-paid people in the company the least important and the ones that nobody wants to help?” she asked. Servers in Denver, she said, earned an average of thirty-nine to forty-two dollars an hour—far more than chefs and dishwashers.</p><p>This was another statistic touted by H.B. 1208 supporters. It came from a survey of a hundred and thirty restaurants which was conducted by a possibly biased source: the Colorado Restaurant Association. If true, it would mean that the typical server in Denver makes more than seventy thousand dollars annually. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, the average salary of bartenders and servers in Denver is less than forty thousand dollars; economists say that this isn’t enough for a single person to cover living expenses in the city, much less to support a family. “These are economically vulnerable people,” Matthew Fritz-Mauer, the executive director of Denver Labor, told me.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>His view was echoed by Joseph Mitchell, a waiter at the Alamo Drafthouse, in Littleton. He told me that last year he made forty thousand dollars working full time. He lives paycheck to paycheck, he said, without health care, and couldn’t imagine getting by if his hourly salary was cut by four dollars.</p><p>I met Mitchell at the Weathervane Café, a restaurant in Denver whose owner, Lindsay Dalton, has vocally opposed H.B. 1208. Dalton admitted that, in many restaurants, there were tensions between front-of-house and back-of-house employees. This was why she and her husband, who co-owned the café, pooled all tips and divided them evenly among the staff. Nothing prevented restaurants in Denver that cared about fairness from doing the same, she noted. The most surprising thing about H.B. 1208, she said, wasn’t that the restaurant lobby had pushed for it but that its sponsors were all Democrats. Judy Amabile, a state senator from Boulder, was one of them. Amabile, a co-founder of a sports-water-bottle company, told me that she supported the bill because she believed that restaurants in places such as Boulder were hurting, and that flexibility on the tip credit was needed to avoid damaging “one of the big economic drivers of our community.” A spokesperson for EatDenver, a coalition of more than four hundred and fifty independent restaurateurs, told me that the rising cost of labor was their biggest concern. But the damage didn’t seem to be as grave as the restaurant lobby claimed. In 2023, a study by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment found that, in the two years after Denver raised its minimum wage above the state level, business boomed. Per-capita sales-tax revenues at bars and restaurants in the city increased by eighty-five per cent—double the rate of the rest of Colorado.</p><p>Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez, a member of the Denver City Council, appreciated the challenges that restaurant owners faced. Her parents started a restaurant some years ago, and they had to close it after having problems with the landlord. But she didn’t believe that cutting workers’ wages was the only solution. “Can we look at the inflation of food costs—or the cost of rent?” she asked. Gonzales-Gutierrez was one of thirty-seven legislators who signed a letter opposing H.B. 1208, maintaining that it undermined the authority of local governments to set the minimum wage. On this occasion, as in the past, she said, the Colorado Restaurant Association presented itself as the champion of mom-and-pop restaurants while advancing an agenda that she felt primarily benefitted large chains. In 2023, when she was a state representative, the N.R.A. lobbied against a fair-workweek law that would have required employers to give workers advance notice about their schedules. The law, which she co-sponsored, would have applied only to businesses with more than two hundred and fifty employees. The restaurant industry brought out more than eighty people to speak against it at a hearing, including the Latino owner of a small Mexican restaurant. “It wouldn’t even apply to them, but they testified,” she said.</p><p>Kjersten Forseth, the legislative consultant for the Colorado A.F.L.-C.I.O., told me that she’d struggled to contain her fury as she watched the leaders of Colorado—a blue state where Democrats control all branches of government—advance a bill to cut the wages of servers, especially after an election in which many working-class voters left the Democratic Party because they felt that it didn’t care about them.</p><p>A coalition of progressive groups, including Towards Justice and Coloradans for the Common Good, mounted strong resistance to H.B. 1208, and the bill’s sponsors were forced to amend it, stripping out the mandatory wage cuts and settling for giving municipalities more flexibility to alter the tip credit in the future. Colorado’s legislature also approved the Worker Protection Act, removing the burden on employees to hold a second election before forming a union. But Governor Jared Polis, a tech entrepreneur, promised to veto the bill. Before he did so, reports surfaced that Polis had floated to labor advocates the possibility of not vetoing it if other items returned to the negotiating table—including the original version of H.B. 1208.</p><p>Dennis Dougherty, the executive director of the Colorado A.F.L.-C.I.O., told me that the Colorado Restaurant Association was in on these negotiations, and that Polis appeared to expect the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to make a deal that sold out tipped workers to advance its agenda of facilitating unionization. But it refused to do so. Dougherty doesn’t regret the decision, even though Polis did veto the unionization bill. “They thought we were going to roll these workers,” he said. “We didn’t.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>The sharpest criticisms of the book </span><em>Abundance</em><span> have sometimes come from the antitrust movement. This group, mostly on the left, insists that the biggest problems in America typically come from monopolies and the corruption of big business.</span></p><p><span>In housing, for example, Ezra Klein and I write that a key bottleneck to homebuilding in the last few decades has been legal barriers to construction, including zoning laws and minimum lot sizes.

The antitrust left, however, claims that the more significant factor is that big homebuilders abuse their power by holding back construction to juice their profits. “Big homebuilders withhold housing supply,” the antitrust advocate Matt Stoller </span><a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1929988276124856803" rel="">has claimed</a><span>. In their paper </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5227899" rel="">“Post-Neoliberal Housing Policy,”</a><span> the law professors Christopher Serkin and Ganesh Sitaraman criticize market concentration in homebuilding and call for “tools from anti-monopoly policy.”</span></p><p><span>At a high level, I have never found these arguments persuasive.

One of the most detailed articles in this space is an analysis of the Dallas, Texas, housing market by the lawyer and writer Basel Musharbash. In “</span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/messing-with-texas-how-big-homebuilders" rel="">Messing With Texas: How Big Homebuilders and Private Equity Made American Cities Unaffordable</a><span>,” Musharbash writes that housing in the Dallas metro, like many other cities, has become much more expensive in the last few years. He also points out that homebuilders in Dallas, as in many other cities, have gotten bigger in the last few years. Musharbash claims that these things are connected: Large builders are crushing competition and restricting supply to sell houses at monopoly margins. To restore affordability, he says, policymakers should “dislodge the powerful corporations” that build America’s homes.</span></p><p>I’m not an economist or a lawyer. I’m just a journalist. To the extent that I’m good at anything, it’s calling people on the phone and writing down what they say. So I reached out to the primary sources that Musharbash quotes throughout the piece.</p><p>What I found was astonishing. The economist Musharbash cites told me that his theories had been misapplied. The housing analysts quoted in the piece told me Musharbash distorted their points and reached dubious, or even flatly wrong, conclusions. The leading monopoly researcher I spoke to, whose work has been celebrated by the antitrust left, told me that the entire thrust of the article—and, by extension, much of the antitrust-housing philosophy—defied sophisticated antitrust analysis.</p><p>The essay you’re reading is very long. But I can sum it up in one sentence: The Musharbash essay on Dallas—like too much of the antitrust left’s work on housing—is filled with out-of-context quotes, overconfident assertions lacking evidence, and generally misguided claims. Now let’s go through them one by one.</p><p><strong>Claim #1: Dallas is a “homebuilder oligopoly.”</strong></p><p><strong>Reality: I called the key oligopoly researcher cited in the Musharbash essay. He disagreed with the use of his work and told me that any city with Dallas’s construction record was “100 percent” not an oligopoly.</strong></p><p>It is a fact that home prices across the country have increased in the last decade. It is also a fact that homebuilders have gotten bigger in the last few years. The question at stake here is: Is the second fact causing the first fact?</p><p><span>I believe there is only one economic paper that unambiguously says </span><em>yes</em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-169690661" href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-anti-abundance-critique-on-housing#footnote-1-169690661" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> It is a 2023 working paper entitled </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3303984" rel="">“Fewer players, fewer homes: concentration and the new dynamics of housing supply”</a><span> by the economist Luis Quintero. This research is load-bearing in the antitrust world. It’s quoted in articles and social media posts by the antitrust advocate </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/its-the-land-stupid-how-the-homebuilder" rel="">Matt Stoller</a><span>. You’ll find it in research from other </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5227899" rel="">antitrust scholars</a><span>. And it seems to be the only empirical research in Musharbash’s essay.</span></p><p>I called Luis Quintero to ask what level of market concentration in homebuilding he considered to be dangerous. In the most concentrated markets, Quintero said, one or two firms account for 90 percent of new housing. But problems begin to accelerate, he said, if five or six firms account for 90 percent of new housing.</p><p><span>I immediately saw a problem. In Dallas, the top two firms built just </span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/HW_Assets/Marketing/BD/0324_BD_LocalLeader_Download_ONLINE.pdf" rel="">30 percent</a><span> of new homes in 2023. The top six firms barely account for </span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/HW_Assets/Marketing/BD/0324_BD_LocalLeader_Download_ONLINE.pdf" rel="">50 percent</a><span> of new housing. Musharbash's claim that a homebuilding oligopoly is crushing housing supply in Dallas relies on an economic analysis that </span><em>doesn’t apply to Dallas at all</em><span>.</span><em> </em><span>I asked Quintero about this: Would you agree that Dallas is “a bad application” of your paper? “I would definitely agree,” Quintero told me.</span></p><p>It gets worse. By Musharbash’s own calculation, the number of new single-family houses permitted per capita in the Dallas metro area rose steadily between 2010 and 2022. (This is illustrated in the graph below.) I mentioned to Quintero that steadily rising construction per capita in a fast-growing city seemed like a weird example of monopolistic abuse. “One hundred percent,” Quintero said. “I 100 percent agree that in places where construction per capita is increasing like that, it's very unlikely that [a dangerous level of] concentration is growing.”</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png" width="1269" height="712" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:712,&quot;width&quot;:1269,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:329394,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.derekthompson.org/i/169690661?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2c0q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09cebe66-f7ff-4b41-b81f-5cec3f17afb4_1269x712.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>So, Dallas doesn’t meet Quintero’s oligopoly threshold. Now let’s consider the rest of the country. I tracked down a complete listing of </span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/HW_Assets/Marketing/BD/0324_BD_LocalLeader_Download_ONLINE.pdf" rel="">the country’s 50 largest homebuilding markets</a><span>, from #1 Dallas to #50 Cincinnati. How many meet Quintero’s first oligopoly threshold (two companies = 90 percent of the market)? </span><em>Zero</em><span> out of 50. And how many meet his second threshold (six companies = 90 percent of the market)? One: Cincinnati. It turns out that the largest homebuilding markets just aren’t that concentrated, even when you accept the yardstick of the economist who’s offered the only empirical definition of market concentration in homebuilding that I can find.</span></p><p>To put it starkly: Musharbash’s essay relies on the work of an economist who told me his theory is being “100 percent” misapplied to Dallas; and the antitrust folks alleging a national homebuilding oligopoly are pointing to an economic definition of oligopoly that doesn’t apply to the 49 largest metros in the country.</p><p><strong>Brief interlude: What does Luis Quintero’s working paper actually say, and are its findings plausible?</strong></p><p>Quintero’s working paper plays such a foundational role in the antitrust housing landscape that I think it’s important to briefly address what it says and why I’m a bit skeptical of its findings.</p><p>Quintero looked at hundreds of markets along the East Coast between Virginia and New York between 2006 and 2015. He found that as dominant homebuilders increased their market share, new home production fell. “If you take two places with similar demand, and one place has fewer developers, that place is going to have less production per developer,” he said. From this study sample, Quintero calculated that the rise in market concentration in homebuilding is so severe that it has reduced the annual value of housing production nationwide by $106 billion a year.</p><p>After a long and polite conversation with Quintero on the phone, I came away with two concerns about his paper.</p><p><span>First, he uses 2006 as his baseline. This was a highly atypical year in housing. Just before the housing crash that triggered the Great Recession, May 2006 was the peak of 21st century construction employment. That very month was construction's </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USCONS" rel="">single highest share of total employment since the postwar era</a><span>. Using a bubble year as a baseline could easily throw off the overall findings of any economic analysis.</span></p><p><span>Second, as I told Quintero on the phone, I don’t think it’s plausible that oligopoly in homebuilding is destroying $100 billion in production every year if only </span><em>one</em><span> of the 50 largest homebuilding markets meets his red line of oligopoly. Quintero offered a defense of this discrepancy. He suggested that the most concentrated homebuilding markets tend to be either suburbs outside of major metros or small towns, since these are places “where new homes are a higher share of overall homes.” I can absolutely believe that. But I don’t see the value in discussing a “national” crisis in homebuilding oligopoly from which the 49 biggest metros are exempt.</span></p><p><strong>Claim #2: Dallas housing experts say local homebuilders are monopolies who are “devouring” the market.</strong></p><p><strong>Reality: When I called up a Dallas housing expert cited several times in Musharbash’s essay, he disagreed profoundly with its thesis. He’s actually a big YIMBY.</strong></p><p>Musharbash claims that Dallas homebuilders “undermine free and fair competition” by acting as monopolies. To make the case, he leans heavily on the work of John McManus, a housing analyst who is also the founder and editor-in-chief of the real estate site The Builder’s Daily. Musharbash writes:</p><blockquote><p><span>“Described as “unstoppable, market-share-devouring juggernauts” by </span><a href="https://www.thebuildersdaily.com/defying-bigger-is-better-odds-davidson-eyes-a-win-in-dallas-entry/" rel="">Builder’s Daily magazine</a><span> [</span><em>sic; should be The Builder’s Daily</em><span>] these dominant incumbents appear to deploy their power to undermine free and fair competition …</span></p><p><span>Indeed, “[t]he scale and sway of market leaders” — particularly D.R. Horton and Lennar — means they “often monopolize access to trades and vendor resources” in local markets, constraining the ability of smaller builders to build at all, according to </span><a href="https://www.thebuildersdaily.com/d-r-hortons-competitive-edge-a-market-makers-playbook-for-2025/" rel="">Builders Daily</a><span> [</span><em>sic, again</em><span>]</span></p></blockquote><p>I called McManus to ask if he really thought Dallas homebuilders were monopolies deforming the local housing market and driving up prices. “No,” he said. “I don’t think the price increases in Dallas have much to do with big companies at all. I’ve read that commentary, and I disagree with it. I don’t think the big builders have a strategy to sell fewer but more expensive homes.”</p><p><span>So, what did McManus think was more responsible for driving up the cost of housing in Dallas? “Land use regulation,” he said. “Zoning?” I asked. “Yes. Land constraints and zoning that require certain footage along the street, or minimum lot sizes, or requirements about three-car garages, are more the cause of the prices increasing now,” he said. “Municipalities have been adding more of [these rules] in the last few years, and land use constraints have become more meaningful because the new parcels that have come online are subject to stiffer restraints.” Beyond raising overall prices, McManus said, these rules specifically thwart the construction of starter homes, an issue that Stoller rightly bemoaned in a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/its-the-land-stupid-how-the-homebuilder" rel="">2024 article</a><span>. “Once you start to comply with these rules, costs rise and you can’t build something that’s accessible or attainable for a poorer household that doesn’t have a second earner.” By driving up the entry costs for homebuilding, these rules kill the market for starter homes.</span></p><p>In the Musharbash essay, The Builder’s Daily sounds like an anti-monopoly shop. But in our conversation, McManus sounded like a straight-up YIMBY. “I know some of my views reflect the narratives of the homebuilders,” he said. “But I know this industry deeply. I’ve read the work on zoning. I’ve done my research. I think it’s the zoning constraints that are in the way.”</p><p>I had one last question for McManus: What did he mean when he said big builders “monopolize” the market for craftsmen? “Oh, I didn’t mean that in a political way,” McManus chuckled. “I meant that big companies can offer more certainty for the trades. If you’re a plumbing or framing crew, and D.R. Horton can tell you, ‘we’ve got a 12-month job for you,’ you like that. You like to have that kind of certainty, because [even at lower rates] it guarantees a year of work.”</p><p><strong>Claim #3: Industry experts have data proving that homebuilding oligopolies are holding back national housing construction.</strong></p><p><strong>Reality: I reached out to an industry expert whom the antitrust folks like to quote. He told me that he disagreed with the way that his analysis is being used by Musharbash, Stoller, and other antitrust advocates.</strong></p><p><span>Another industry analyst the antitrust crowd often cites is Lance Lambert, the founder and editor of ResiClub. Lambert made the graph below showing that the largest homebuilders account for a rising share of national construction. Several antitrust folks have held up this chart as slam-dunk evidence that homebuilding monopolies are distorting the market and jacking up prices. Matt Stoller </span><a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1929988276124856803" rel="">said</a><span> this graph "really tells the story" of "how big homebuilders withhold housing supply.” In his essay, Musharbash makes the same claim when describing this chart: “As the percentage of total new home sales controlled by the top 200 homebuilders has increased over the past two decades, the total number of new home sales has declined by 25-50 percent.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png" width="1456" height="1397" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1397,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:539646,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.derekthompson.org/i/169690661?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZEy-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed219b52-f227-4652-8adf-b773a0c4cb2d_1529x1467.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>I know Lambert’s work, and I’ve always found him a hard-nosed analyst who’s neither a noisy YIMBY, nor a NIMBY, nor any other ‘IMBY. So I called him with a simple question. Did Lambert agree with the antitrust folks, who love to quote him so much, that the consolidation of big homebuilding companies was hurting housing supply?</p><p><span>“No,” Lambert said. “If you asked me what are the 20 biggest problems in housing in the last few years, I wouldn’t put market concentration in the top 20. It’s not something that comes up in my world of real estate analysis, at all. I could actually see the opposite argument from the monopoly guys, which is that larger homebuilders with easier access to capital” build more homes in the long run, thanks to the benefits of scale and large firms’ resiliency to market shocks. “It’s an observable fact that the big homebuilders build a </span><em>ton</em><span> of houses,” he said.</span></p><p>The antitrust people often point out that the Great Recession wiped out a lot of smaller homebuilders and left the bigger ones standing. Ironically, many of these folks now want to “dislodge” larger builders, to ensure that only small builders remain. Do we really want the construction industry to be exclusively populated by the sort of small, vulnerable builders who were wiped out in the last housing crisis? The antitrust crowd has an interpretation of history that seems to violate the clearest lesson of that history: Small companies can have downsides, and big companies can have benefits. A virtue of scale is that it can provide resilience in an age of crisis. </p><p><strong>Claim #4: “X companies account for Y percent of this industry” is a smart way to think about market concentration.</strong></p><p><strong>Reality: A leading monopoly researcher told me this is an incomplete and overly simplistic way to think about monopoly power.</strong></p><p>Musharbash, Stoller, and others rarely offer conclusive empirical evidence that large homebuilders are throttling the housing market for private gain. What they have instead are a lot of claims in the form of “[X number] of companies account for [Y percent] of homebuilding” in various cities. If that number is going up at the same time that other bad things are happening, readers are invited to assume that market concentration is the culprit. </p><p><span>This sort of monopoly math is so common that I wondered how useful it really was. So I reached out to James Roberts, the head of the economics department at Duke University. I think the antitrust folks will consider this a fair call. In 2019, Roberts co-authored </span><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/AMBPP.2019.12889abstract" rel="">a famous study uncovering evidence of monopoly power in the dialysis industry</a><span>, which made such a splash in the antitrust space that Stoller himself </span><a href="https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1753791572162801936" rel="">called</a><span> dialysis "the scariest monopoly I’ve ever found."</span></p><p>I wanted to know how a careful monopoly-hunter like Roberts would answer the question: If six firms account for 90 percent of a local industry, is that automatic proof of a monopoly? “No, it’s not,” Roberts said. “The statistic isn’t totally vacuous, but there’s basically no useful information about market power in that statistic alone.”</p><p>Alright, I said, if you were concerned about homebuilding monopolies, what questions would you ask? He offered this as his “non-ordered list.”</p><ol><li><p><em>Does concentration clearly drive up the price of new homes? </em><span>“I suppose it could theoretically, but keep in mind that new homes compete against existing homes that are resold,” which means a homebuilder in a big city is always competing on price against existing home sales, which ought to discipline the market. (If you’re selling your existing house in a market where D.R. Horton is building a new house, </span><em>you</em><span> are D.R. Horton’s pricing competition.)</span></p></li><li><p><em>Does concentration incentivize firms to build low-quality homes? </em><span>“I find this unlikely for a similar reason,” Roberts said. If a homebuilding monopoly purposefully made crappy new homes, they’d be out-competed quickly by existing (and presumably non-crappy) homes on the market.</span></p></li><li><p><em>Can big companies hurt subcontractors by forcing them to accept lower prices?</em><span> “Maybe, but if big homebuilders can offer trades longer guaranteed contracts”—as John McManus told me they often do—“you could see from the subcontractor’s perspective why it might be valuable to be able to negotiate with larger builders.” </span></p></li></ol><p>Like Lambert, Roberts said he couldn’t rule out the possibility that larger homebuilders are actually good for the housing market— or even that today’s homebuilding markets would benefit from being even more concentrated. In industries with high capital expenditures, “economies of scale are beneficial to society so long as they’re not abused in specific ways,” he said. “You wouldn’t automatically want lots of firms in every industry. The bottom line is this is complicated, and it really depends on the details of the industry, not just simple statistics about market concentration.”</p><p><strong>Vibes all the way down</strong></p><p><span>Is it </span><em>possible</em><span> that homebuilding oligopolies are meaningfully constraining housing construction in some parts of America today? Yes. It’s a perfectly interesting question that deserves high-quality research vetted by high-quality experts. The literature on housing monopolies, however, is threadbare. It is hard to find a single study published in a single economic journal that plausibly claims that large homebuilders today are constraining housing supply. In lieu of careful findings, the space is filled with confident assertions.</span></p><p><span>A new pillar of the antitrust-housing literature is the 2025 paper </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5227899" rel="">"Post-Neoliberal Housing Policy."</a><span> The authors, both law professors, describe "a new oligopoly” emerging in homebuilding today. If you look for a proof or citation for this claim—beyond an obligatory reference to the Quintero working paper—you’ll find a footnote that asks you to "see text accompanying note 261.” Note 261 cites a Matt Stoller essay entitled </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/its-the-land-stupid-how-the-homebuilder" rel="">"It’s the Land, Stupid: How the Homebuilder Cartel Drives High Housing Prices.”</a><span> I checked to see if that essay offered any empirical research or evidence that larger homebuilders led to higher housing prices, beyond the assertion that both things—homebuilders growing, prices rising—are happening at the same time. Other than yet </span><em>another</em><span> reference to the Quintero paper, it was hard to find. The closest thing was the screenshot of a headline of a 2017 </span><em>Wall Street Journal </em><span>article, entitled </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fewer-home-builders-means-happier-home-builders-1494870894" rel="">“Fewer Home Builders Means Happier Home Builders.”</a><span> In the article, reporter Justin Lahart writes that “One reason behind optimism among housing construction companies is there is less competition among them, which has limited supply.” But there’s no evidence provided in the article for this latter claim. There’s no quote, no analysis, no citation, and not even a hyperlink to an external source; the whole article is less than 500 words long.</span></p><p><span>In sum, a paper with no new original research on this question relies on an antitrust essay with no empirical findings, which references a </span><em>Wall Street Journal </em><span>squib with no reporting to back up its claim. In too many cases, the antitrust-housing argument is an assertion, referencing an assertion, backed up by yet another assertion. Its vibes all the way down.</span></p><p><span>Real monopolies are dangerous.

I’m concerned the same is happening in the antitrust space. Dismantling today’s largest homebuilders on baseless grounds of market manipulation would almost certainly hurt homebuilding in the long-run. Accusing companies of being monopolistic with weak, circumstantial, and misinformed evidence will do nothing to build public or elite confidence in antitrust reform. Instead, a long record of false positives could muddy the case for remedy where it’s needed.</p><p>America deserves a better antitrust movement with better evidence. Musharbash’s essay quotes experts without talking to them. He cites papers without double-checking the findings. He digs up reports whose authors reject the conclusions. The whole thing looks like a lawyer who arrived in Dallas with a conviction in hand and shaped the evidence to fit the indictment.</p><p><span>In </span><em>Abundance</em><span>, we write that policy makers should think of themselves as detectives who investigate mysteries before they indict. If the antitrust left is going to convince me that I’m wrong about housing, I don’t need them to prove to me that they’re clever lawyers. I need them to show that they can be honest detectives.</span></p><p>***</p><p><em><strong>Thanks for reading. Come back tomorrow for Part 2 of my analysis, where I’ll explain what really happened in Dallas and why I think unaffordability became a national phenomenon if the cause isn’t oligopolies.</strong></em></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

Rents started falling at the end of last year, the association’s data show.</p><p>The city’s renters are finally catching a break after a building boom in recent years led to a glut of space that landlords are struggling to fill. The pileup — including about 20,000 new units in 2024 — is leading building owners to hold down rents to attract and keep tenants.</p><p>The average rent in Denver was $1,832 per month, a decline of $71 from the same time in 2024. Current rents are similar to where they were three years ago.</p><p>This year marks the first time in 15 years that Denver rents have dropped consistently. Earlier this year, <a href="https://denverite.com/2025/05/12/denver-renters-market/">Denverite reported</a> on what the change meant for renters and landlords.</p><p>Rents were still up slightly from the first quarter due to seasonal factors. Rents typically get a boost in the spring because that’s when people are most likely to move. But the increase this year was minimal at just 0.7 percent.</p><p>“This increase is less than half of the typical increase during the second quarter over the past 20 years because vacancy remains elevated,” said Cary Bruteig, a researcher with research firm Apartment Insights, a coauthor of the report.</p><p>The vacancy rate in the metro Denver region was 6.4 percent, down from 7 percent in the first quarter. Studios have the highest vacancy rate, with 8.4 percent going unused.</p><p>On a more granular level, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson County were tied for the lowest vacancy rate at 5.2 percent. Arapahoe had the highest, with 7.1 percent of apartment units sitting empty.</p><p>In addition to lowering rents, landlords are offering generous concessions like several months of free rent and amenities to lure tenants. Those discounts don’t show up in rent calculations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pipeline of new apartment buildings is drying up. The number of properties under construction is down by roughly one-third from the peak in 2023, the report found. That likely means fewer units coming available in the months ahead, potentially giving landlords room to start raising rents again.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <p>What problems can human beings <em>only</em> solve over a very long period of time? And how can we build institutions that solve those problems?</p>
      <p>Below is a list of marvellous projects which human beings have undertaken over an exceptionally long time. Many examples contributed by people on <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1224902391331319809">Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>The focus is on goal-directed projects (e.g., a scientific experiment or a building), less on more decentralized or unplanned changes (e.g., languages, domestication of livestock, cities, religions). Of course, those are also fascinating, but they have less of a sense of a long-term goal. Jericho is incredible, but the founders probably weren't thinking "I hope this is still here in 9,000 years".</p>
      <p>This page is a <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/fast">riff on Patrick Collison's list of /fast projects</a>. There are surprisingly many commonalities with those projects.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p>The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem involved an incredible amount of mathematics developed over decades and centuries: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">wikipedia</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Many Cathedrals were built over more than a century. An example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris">Notre Dame</a>, over 1163-1345. There are many more.</p></li>
      <li><p>An ongoing example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Familia</a>, begun in 1882, and continuing today.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://research.csiro.au/acc/capabilities/cape-grim-air-archive/">Cape Grim Air Archive</a>, which has been archiving air since 1978, so later researchers can conduct longitudinal studies.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study">Framingham Heart Study</a>, a longitudinal study of the heart which began in 1948.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_England_temperature">Central England Temperature series</a>, from 1659 to the present.</p></li>
      <li><p>The early designs for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">LIGO gravitational wave detector</a> were developed in 1967; the instrument itself was developed over many decades, and first saw gravitational waves in 2016<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment">E. coli long-term evolution experiment</a>, from 1988 to the present.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment">pitch drop experiment</a> from 1927 to the present<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_of_the_Long_Now">Clock of the Long Now</a>, which aspires to last 10,000 years.</p></li>
      <li><p>I suspect many key open source systems (Linux, Wikipedia) will still be around in 100 years. I won't be surprised if certain standards still show up in a thousand years, perhaps in a modified form. ASCII gives rise to Unicode gives rise to [???] Will Unix Time or TCP/IP ever be replaced? Modified: sure. But there's at least some chance they'll be with us for millenia.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Avenue_Subway">2nd Ave Subway in Manhattan</a>, with preparatory construction beginning in 1942. First phase opened in 2017.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_companies">list of oldest companies in the world</a> is food for thought. Sad to report the 2006 demise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi">Kongo Gumi</a>, which began in 578. It was in the construction business, originally of Shinto Shrines (I believe). Such Shrines undergo a continuous process of renewal; an example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo-taisha">Izumo-taisha</a>, which may date to BCE.</p></li>
      <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_of_Mathematically_Precocious_Youth">Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth</a>, begun in 1971, and continuing as of 2025 (contributed by Tom McCarthy)</p></li>
      <li><p>Wikipedia lists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_experiment">many other long-term exeriments</a>.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>A fun question: of these projects, which <em>required</em> a long time, and which could have been greatly accelerated?</p>

      <li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>In 1998 I went to a talk by Kip Thorne where he said LIGO would likely need a strain sensitivity of "1 part in 10 to the 21" to see anything. That's an accuracy comparable to measuring the distance to the Sun to an accuracy of one atom. I laughed, and thought it would take centuries, at least. In the second sentence of the abstract of the 2016 paper they report a strain sensitivity of <span>1.0 \times
      10^{-21}</span>.<a href="#fnref1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>My office was for many years in the same building as the pitch drop experiment, and I would often walk past it multiple times a day. It has a slow but steady psychological impact in how you think about the space of projects open to you. This is fitting.<a href="#fnref2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
