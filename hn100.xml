<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Linux kernel is often mentioned as a overwhelmingly large open source software. As of this writing, the latest version is v6.5-rc5, which consists of 36M lines of code. Needless to say, Linux is a fruit of hard work of many contributors over the decades.</p>
<p>However, the first version of Linux, v0.01 was pretty small. It consisted of only 10239 lines of code. Excluding comments and blank lines, it was only 8,670 lines. It's small enough to understand and is a good starting point to learn about the internals of UNIX-like operating system kernels.</p>
<p>Reading v0.01 was really fun for me. It was like visiting Computer History Museum in Mountain View - finally I witnessed <em>tales</em> are indeed true! I wrote this post to share this exciting experience with you. Let's dive in!</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: Obviously I'm not the author of Linux v0.01. If you find any mistakes in this post, please let me know!</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-system-calls-look-like">How do system calls look like?</h2>
<p>v0.01 has 66 system calls. Here's the list of them:</p>
<pre><code><span>access acct alarm break brk chdir chmod
</span><span>chown chroot close creat dup dup2 execve
</span><span>exit fcntl fork fstat ftime getegid geteuid
</span><span>getgid getpgrp setsid getpid getppid
</span><span>getuid gtty ioctl kill link lock lseek
</span><span>mkdir mknod mount mpx nice open pause

</span><span>setgid setpgid setuid setup signal stat
</span><span>stime stty sync time times ulimit umask
</span><span>umount uname unlink ustat utime waitpid write
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>It supports reading, writing, creating, and deleting files and directories. Also, other fundamental concepts like <code>chmod(2)</code> (permission), <code>chown(2)</code> (owner), and <code>pipe(2)</code> (inter-process communication) are also supported.</li>
<li><code>fork(2)</code> and <code>execve(2)</code> were there. Only <code>a.out</code> executable format was supported.</li>
<li>The concept of sockets was not implemented. Thus, no network support.</li>
<li>Some features like <code>mount(2)</code> was not implemented: they just return <code>ENOSYS</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>sys_mount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

<h2 id="deeply-hardcoded-for-intel-386-architecture">Deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 architecture</h2>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html">a very famous debate</a> Linus had a debate with Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of MINIX, about the design of operating systems: monolithic vs. microkernel, which is better design?</p>
<p>Tanenbaum <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html#:~:text=LINUX%20is%20tied%20fairly%20closely%20to%20the%2080x86">pointed out that</a> Linux is (or <em>was</em>) not portable because it was deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 (i386):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MINIX was designed to be reasonably portable, and has been ported from the Intel line to the 680x0 (Atari, Amiga, Macintosh), SPARC, and NS32016. LINUX is tied fairly closely to the 80x86.  Not the way to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's indeed true. Linux v0.01 was deeply hardcoded for o386. Here's the implementation of <code>strcpy</code> in <code>include/string.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>extern</span> <span>inline</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span> <span>strcpy</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span> dest<span>,</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>src<span>)</span>
</span><span><span>{</span>
</span><span><span>__asm__</span><span>(</span><span>"cld\n"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"1:\tlodsb\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"stosb\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"testb %%al,%%al\n\t"</span>
</span><span>	<span>"jne 1b"</span>
</span><span>	<span>::</span><span>"S"</span> <span>(</span>src<span>)</span><span>,</span><span>"D"</span> <span>(</span>dest<span>)</span><span>:</span><span>"si"</span><span>,</span><span>"di"</span><span>,</span><span>"ax"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>return</span> dest<span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>It's written in assembly with string instructions of i386. Yes it can be found in today's portable implementations of <code>strcpy</code>, but it's in <code>include/string.h</code> - not in somewhere like <code>include/i386/string.h</code>. Moreover, no <code>#ifdef</code> to switch the implementation for different architectures. It's just hardcoded for Intel 386.</p>
<p>Also, supported devices are for PC/AT compatible machines, here's the list of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/CMOS">CMOS</a>: Real-time clock (<code>init/main.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer">Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)</a>: Timer (<code>kernel/sched.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/ATA_PIO_Mode">ATA (PIO)</a>: Hard disk (<code>kernel/hd.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Hardware">VGA (text mode)</a>: Display (<code>kernel/console.c</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/%228042%22_PS/2_Controller">Intel 8042</a>: PS/2 Keyboard (<code>kernel/keyboard.s</code>). Yes it's completely written in assembly!</li>
</ul>
<p>As you may noticed, they're not in <code>drivers</code> directory as in today's Linux. They're hardcoded in core subsystems.</p>
<h2 id="freax">"FREAX"</h2>
<p>I've read in somewhere that Linus originally named his kernel "FREAX". Makefile in <em>Linux</em> v0.01 still had the following comment:</p>
<pre><code><span># Makefile for the FREAX-kernel.
</span></code></pre>
<p>It was indeed FREAX!</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-file-system-supported-in-v001">What's the file system supported in v0.01?</h2>
<p>Today, Linux supports a variety of file systems such as ext4, Btrfs, and XFS. What about v0.01? ext2? Nope, here's a hint from <code>include/linux/fs.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span><span>define</span> <span>SUPER_MAGIC</span> <span><span>0x137F</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>The answer is, as <a href="https://sdk.vercel.ai/r/XR1FQfg">GPT-4 correctly guessed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix_file_system">MINIX file system</a>!</p>
<p>Fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_system">ext</a> ("extended file system"), the predecessor of ext2/ext3/ext4, is inspired by MINIX file system.</p>
<h2 id="there-probably-wont-be-any-reason-to-change-the-scheduler">There "probably" won't be any reason to change the scheduler</h2>
<p>Here's the scheduler of Linux v0.01:</p>
<pre><code><span>	<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>		c <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>		next <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>		i <span>=</span> NR_TASKS<span>;</span>
</span><span>		p <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>task<span>[</span>NR_TASKS<span>]</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>		<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>--</span>i<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>*</span><span>--</span>p<span>)</span>
</span><span>				<span>continue</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span>state <span>==</span> TASK_RUNNING <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span>counter <span>&gt;</span> c<span>)</span>

</span><span>		<span>}</span>
</span><span>		<span>if</span> <span>(</span>c<span>)</span> <span>break</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>		<span>for</span><span>(</span>p <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>LAST_TASK <span>;</span> p <span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>FIRST_TASK <span>;</span> <span>--</span>p<span>)</span>
</span><span>			<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span>
</span><span>				<span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span>counter <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span>counter <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
</span><span>						<span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span>priority<span>;</span>
</span><span>	<span>}</span>
</span><span>	<span>switch_to</span><span>(</span>next<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>i</code> and <code>p</code> hold the task's index in the task table (not PID!) and the pointer to <code>task_struct</code> respectively. The key variable is <code>counter</code> in <code>task_struct</code> (<code>(*p)-&gt;counter</code>). The scheduler picks up the task with the largest <code>counter</code> value and switches to it. If all runnable tasks have counter value of 0, it updates each task's <code>counter</code> value by <code>counter = (counter &gt;&gt; 1) + priority</code> and restarts the loop. Note that <code>counter &gt;&gt; 1</code> is a faster way to divide by 2.</p>
<p>The key point would be the counter update. It also updates the counter value of non-runnable tasks. This means that if a task is waiting for I/O for a <em>long time</em>, and its priority is higher than 2, counter value will monotonically increase when counter is updated. This is just my guess, but I think this is for prioritizing rarely-runnable-but-latency-sensitive tasks like shell, which would waits for keyboard typing in most of the life.</p>
<p>Lastly, <code>switch_to(next)</code> is a macro which switches the CPU context to the picked task. It's well described in <a href="https://www.maizure.org/projects/evolution_x86_context_switch_linux/">here</a>. In short, it was based on a x86-specific feature called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment">Task State Segment (TSS)</a>, which is no longer used for task management in x86-64 architecture.</p>
<p>By the way, there's an interesting comment about the scheduler:</p>
<pre><code><span> *  'schedule()' is the scheduler function. This is GOOD CODE! There
</span><span> * probably won't be any reason to change this, as it should work well
</span><span> * in all circumstances (ie gives IO-bound processes good response etc).
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes it's indeed good code. Unfortunately (or fortunately), this prophecy is false. Linux became one of most practical and performant kernel which has introduced many new scheduling improvements and algorithms over the years, like Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).</p>

<p>It calls each subsystem's initialization functions. Pretty straightforward. But there's something interesting: it calls <code>fork(2)</code> in kernel's <code>main()</code>. Also, <code>init()</code> looks like an ordinary implementation in user space, but it's hardcoded in the kernel code!</p>
<p>It looks as if it's fork(2)-ing in the kernel space, but it's actually not. The trick is in <code>move_to_user_mode()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span><span>define</span> <span>move_to_user_mode</span><span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </span><span>\</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>You don't need to fully understand the assembly code above. What it does is to switch to the user mode using <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_to_Ring_3#iret_method">IRET instruction</a> but continue executing the following lines in the kernel code with the current stack pointer! Thus, the following <code>if (!fork())</code> is executed in user mode and <code>fork(2)</code> is actually a system call.</p>
<h2 id="linus-didnt-have-a-machine-with-8mb-ram">Linus didn't have a machine with 8MB RAM</h2>
<pre><code><span> * For those with more memory than 8 Mb - tough luck. I've
</span><span> * not got it, why should you :-) The source is here. Change
</span><span> * it. (Seriously - it shouldn't be too difficult. ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>Today, machines with 8GB RAM are very common. Furthermore, 8GB is not enough at all for software engineers ;)</p>

<p>Lastly, I tried to compile the kernel with modern toolchains but failed to do so. I thought GCC (or C itself) has good backward compatibility, but it's not sufficient. Even with older standard <code>-std=gnu90</code> caused compile errors that are not trivial to fix.</p>
<p>One fun fact is Linux had used his own GCC with a feature named <code>-mstring-insns</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># If you don't have '-mstring-insns' in your gcc (and nobody but me has :-)
</span><span># remove them from the CFLAGS defines.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what it is, but it seems to be a feature to support (or optimize?) <a href="https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2017/fall/cs301/lecture/10_06_string_inst.html">x86 string instructions</a>.</p>
<p>If you managed to compile the kernel with modern toolchains, write an article and send me a link :D</p>
<h2 id="read-yourself">Read Yourself!</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading the source code of Linux v0.01 as much as I did. If you're interested in v0.01, download <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/linux-0.01.tar.gz">the tarball of v0.01 from kernel.org</a>. Reading the code is not so hard especially if you've read <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public">xv6</a> before. Linux v0.01 is minimalistic but is very well written.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Record labels including UMG, Capitol and Sony have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States targeting Internet Archive and founder Brewster Kale, among others. Filed in Manhattan federal court late Friday, the complaint alleges infringement of 2,749 works, recorded by deceased artists, including Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby.

<p>Filed in Manhattan federal court, the complaint lists UMG Recordings, Capitol Records, Concord Bicycle Assets, CMGI Recorded Music Assets, Sony Music and Arista Music as plaintiffs, with Internet Archive (IA), founder Brewster Kahle, Kahle/Austin Foundation, George Blood and George Blood L.P named as defendants.</p>
<h2>Pre-1972 78rpm Records by Iconic Artists, All Deceased</h2>
<p>The plaintiffs’ complaint focuses on the Internet Archive’s ‘Great 78 Project’ which aims to preserve, research and discover 78rpm records produced between 1898 and the 1950s.</p>
<p>“While the commercially viable recordings will have been restored or remastered onto LP’s or CD, there is still research value in the artifacts and usage evidence in the often rare 78rpm discs and recordings,” IA <a href="https://great78.archive.org/">wrote</a> following the launch of the project in 2017.</p>
<p>“Already, over 20 collections have been selected by the Internet Archive for physical and digital preservation and access. Started by many volunteer collectors, these new collections have been selected, digitized and preserved by the Internet Archive, George Blood LP, and the Archive of Contemporary Music.”</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png" alt="great-78-project" width="610" height="324" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png 740w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20610%20324'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png 740w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project-300x159.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/great-78-project.png"></a></center>
<p>From IA’s perspective, the project is all about the preservation of art. From the diametrically opposed view of the plaintiffs, the defendants willfully made copies thousands of recordings to which they own the copyrights. The digitized copies were then uploaded to the Internet Archive from where they were illegally distributed to users of the website millions of times.</p>
<p>The complaint lists 2,769 individual works from some of the most fmaous artists of all time, including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, and Louis Armstrong. Listed songs include “White Christmas” by Bing Crosby, “Sing, Sing, Sing” by Benny Goodman, “Peggy Sue” by Buddy Holly, and “Roll Over Beethoven” by Chuck Berry.</p>
<h2>Plaintiffs: Preservation Claims Are a “Smokescreen”</h2>
<p>The nonprofit Internet Archive is known for its ambitious projects that aim to retain, restore and redistribute content that they believe should never be lost to history. For the plaintiffs, these grand ambitions are nothing but a “smokescreen” to hide what amounts to IA offering “free and unlimited access to music for everyone,” regardless of copyright.</p>
<p>“In truth, Defendants’ malfeasance springs from their disregard for copyright law and the rights of artists and content owners. Internet Archive and the other Defendants have a long history of opposing, fighting, and ignoring copyright law, proclaiming that their zealotry serves the public good. In reality, Defendants are nothing more than mass infringers,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>The record companies further reject claims that the music being made available illegally needs to be ‘saved’. They claim that of the 2,749 recordings listed in the complaint, all but a “small sample” are already available to stream or download from licensed online platforms so they “face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed.”</p>
<p>The complaint states that when the 78rpm records were converted into digital files, IA reproduced copyrighted recordings without permission. When IA copied those files to a server, that amounted to another unauthorized reproduction, and when it transferred those copies to the public, yet another. When it streamed unlicensed copies to the public, each time that constituted an unlicensed public performance.</p>
<p>“When Defendants exploit Plaintiffs’ sound recordings without authorization, neither Plaintiffs nor their artists see a dime. Not only does this harm Plaintiffs and the artists or their heirs by depriving them of compensation, but it undermines the value of music,” the complaint adds.</p>
<h2>Overall Infringement and Claims For Relief</h2>
<p>The plaintiffs allege that the Great 78 Project contains more than 400,000 works that have been downloaded or streamed millions of times. In a letter sent by the RIAA to IA in 2020, the plaintiffs allege that IA owner Brewster Kahle was informed of the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“You and Internet Archive have reproduced thousands of sound recordings in which RIAA member companies own or exclusively control copyrights, and have made those recordings available to the public for unrestricted download and streaming, all without the consent of the rights owners.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>“Your unauthorized reproduction, distribution and public performance of these recordings is a plain violation of the RIAA member companies’ rights under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1401">17 U.S.C. § 1401</a>, and constitutes nothing less than piracy on a massive scale.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The RIAA says that Kahle and the Internet Archive were ordered to “immediately cease and desist from their infringement” but the demand was ignored.</p>
<p>The complaint lists several causes of action against different combinations of defendants, including unlawful reproduction under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106">17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1)</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1401">1401(a)(1)</a> for which the companies are entitled damages and any profits accrued. Alternatively the record companies seek statutory damages of $150,000 for each protected recording infringed, so with over 2,700 works in suit, damages could exceed $400m.</p>
<p>Other claims include infringing reproduction and distribution, infringing public performance, contributory copyright infringement, inducement of infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement. The companies also seek injunctive relief to restrain “continuing infringing conduct.”</p>

The flier read, "Fuel your body &amp; stock your pantry. Did you know that grad students may qualify for assistance paying for food &amp; groceries?"</p><p>Harvard University is the wealthiest academic institution globally, boasting an endowment of approximately $53 billion. With such a substantial endowment, Harvard has the means to support a wide array of academic programs, research endeavors, scholarships and initiatives.</p><p>The Harvard Graduate Students Union (HGSU) expressed its view, advocating for more substantial measures to assist graduate students, primarily by increasing their salaries. According to HGSU's proposal, all graduate student workers should receive a minimum annual salary of $60,000, a significant increase from the current minimum salary of $40,000. The union believes that providing adequate compensation directly to the students would alleviate the need for external assistance programs like SNAP.</p><p><strong><em>Don't Miss:</em></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-411044">


<h3>from the <i>getting-on-the-right-side-of-history</i> dept</h3>

<p>Microsoft has long been one of several companies that attempted to monopolize repair in a bid for profit, particularly when it has come to the company’s game consoles. But in recent years the company appears to have realized that with state and federal lawmakers and regulators cracking down on this behavior, it might be smart to stop swimming upstream when it comes to “right to repair.”</p>
<p>Last May, for example, Microsoft began&nbsp;<a href="https://grist.org/technology/microsoft-right-to-repair-quietly-supported-legislation-to-make-it-easier-to-fix-devices-heres-why-thats-a-big-deal/">urging lawmakers</a>&nbsp;to support the Washington State&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4006">Fair Repair Act</a>, which would ensure that consumers and indie repair shops have the parts, tools, and documentation to repair their own gear. The <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1392&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2023">bill</a> didn’t pass — in part thanks to Democratic Washington State Senator Lisa Wellman, a former Apple executive (Apple’s a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/30/apple-still-sucks-on-right-to-repair/">notorious, bull-headed bully</a> on this subject). </p>
<p>Still, Microsoft’s support was reflective of what seems to be a legitimate shift in tactics at Microsoft, in large part so the company can meet its goal of being <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">carbon negative</a>&nbsp;by 2030. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, Microsoft has been doing a better job ensuring that consumers have access to both service manuals and essential parts needed to independently repair the company’s hardware, ranging from its Surface tablets and laptops to <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/microsoft-selling-xbox-controller-replacement-parts">Xbox game controllers</a>. </p>
<p>The Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xbox-repair-parts">now offers</a> replacement controller boards, buttons, covers, sticks,&nbsp;and more for those looking to fix their own hardware. The company has also started doing a better job providing users with video tutorials on how to best safely repair their own hardware. You can get many of the same parts also from iFixit now (with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/31/23814642/microsoft-xbox-elite-controllers-repair-diy">lifetime warranty as compared to Microsoft’s one-year warranty</a>). </p>
<p>The about face comes as a growing number of states begin seriously pursuing right to repair legislation with an eye on consumer rights, environmental waste, counterproductive DRM, and high repair costs. Given the massive, bipartisan public support for such reform, hopefully Microsoft has genuinely realized it simply makes way more sense to be on the right side of history. </p>

    <p>
    I have worked professionally in Flutter for 3 years now. The company I worked for recently laid me off because of difficulty securing the next round of investment.
  </p><p>
    I am now in the market for a job and the majority of my recent experience is in Flutter. In my country of Canada, I am finding basically zero opportunities. One hiring manager I talked to said "It is hard to find Flutter developers". I am also observing it is nearly impossible to find Flutter positions. So its almost like no one at all is using Flutter.
  </p><p>
    I have a feeling that by the end of 2024, Flutter might be a complete afterthought (though I hope I am completely wrong!).
  </p><p>
    Is anyone seeing a any different trends with Flutter?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.johnqian.com/startup-spark">https://blog.johnqian.com/startup-spark</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37098483">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>August 2023</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-n5h05z">At a well-run seed stage startup, engineers will often describe the work experience as <em>intoxicating</em>. At a larger company, the best you get is "enjoyable". Why does this happen? Is it inevitable?</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gpa0nb">Let's inspect what makes a startup intoxicating. An engineer should spend most of their time in
	this core loop:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-szqb2g"><li>If needed, talk to users, figure out their problems.</li> <li>Come up with an idea to build.</li> <li>If needed, discuss the idea with coworkers.</li> <li>Implement the idea.</li> <li>Cross fingers and ship. Celebrate or postmortem. Then go back to step 1.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1v85j8t">At &lt;10 people, each of these steps can be <em>fun</em>.</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-hgd5la"><li>You can just directly reach out to users you’re interested in and grab a beer with them.</li> <li>If you find an idea that you think is both valuable to the company and interesting to you, you
		can just drop everything to work on it.</li> <li>Almost any coworker will be interested in discussing this idea with you because:
		<ol><li>They have skin in the game. If your idea is good, they benefit from encouraging you to take
				it on. If your idea is bad, they benefit from explaining what’s wrong. They may even care as
				users themselves.</li> <li>They might want to work with you on it.</li> <li>They can likely offer useful insights since everyone’s familiar with a significant chunk of
				the codebase.</li></ol></li> <li>Implementation is quick.
		<ol><li>Choose whatever tools you want, no security review.</li> <li>Small codebase. Can hold the whole thing in your head, so you feel comfortable making
				sweeping refactors. Fast hot reload, so can do quick trial-error debugging.</li> <li>Merge changes quick. No slow tests in CI. No need for blocking PR review for safe changes.
				Maybe just push to master. For unsafe changes, just tap coworker on shoulder for PR review.</li> <li>If not too many users, can tolerate downtime to make breaking backend/database changes
				quickly.</li></ol></li> <li>Anything is possible! Maybe this will make your equity worth something. Maybe people will be
		building upon this feature for years to come, maybe you’ll be seen as a visionary in the history
		books. Maybe you’ll attend a party with your users and hear them say “you came up with this
		idea? OMG it saved my life”. Because everyone in the team has skin in the game, they’re all
		rooting for you. Your hearts are synced.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kt06hi">As a company scales, the fun is stripped from every one of these steps. At &gt;100 people, the
	loop looks more like this:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-1a8wj8i"><li>Talking to users is for PMs, silly! You stick to what you’re good at. At best you get a summary
		of user insights and a reasonable task priority list derived from it. At worst you get a
		confusing task list built off a mistaken understanding of users and the manager’s selfish
		vision, and no one can explain why each task matters.</li> <li>You can’t just work on whatever you want; coordinating would be an O(N^2) communication mess.
		Your manager has plans for you that they’ve designed in consideration with everything else going
		on. Maybe you can work on your own idea after you’ve finished all that stuff. Or you can work on
		it secretly in your spare time.</li> <li>You can talk with your coworkers about your idea, but they’re not likely very interested. They
		don’t benefit much from your success; in fact, they might be competing with you for a promotion.
		They’ve got long task lists to do; they don’t have the freedom to drop what they’re doing and
		work with you. And they probably don’t remember much about the code you’re touching anyway.</li> <li>Implementation is slow.
		<ol><li>All the tools have been decided already. There might be better newer tools available, but
				they’re not worth introducing inconsistency. Don’t you <em>dare</em> introduce inconsistency.
				If you want to use something new, ask your manager and email the security review team.</li> <li>Large codebase, mainly for legacy reasons. Lots of code you’re afraid to touch, lots of code
				no one understands anymore. Thorough tests are your only source of confidence that you’re
				not breaking everything. You need to rely on a lot of trial and error debugging, but each
				trial-error loop is slow because the code takes awhile to compile.</li> <li>It takes 2 weeks to get a small PR in. Wait 20 minutes for CI to pass, it flakes, rerun
				tests. Merge conflicts accumulate as you await feedback from a reviewer. The reviewer just
				points out nits because they don’t have enough context or incentive to make important
				suggestions. You make requested changes, push changes, 20 more minutes. Repeat 3x per PR.</li> <li>Making any infrastructure change is a 14 step process, lest you cause downtime or data loss
				for 10 million users.</li></ol></li> <li>After 3 months quietly toiling, you ship something. You get to demo it at a Friday meeting, your
		one chance for the CEO to see what you worked on. Only a few coworkers are really paying
		attention; your work simply doesn’t affect most of them. You get some pats on the back. Your
		manager says this will be big for you on your next perf cycle in 5 months. At best, you get a
		20% salary bump and title change. At worst, in 4 months there’s a reorg, you get a new manager,
		your project gets deprioritized or scrapped. You need to convince the new manager that you’ve
		done stuff at this company.</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yw71b9">Is this preventable? I think not.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1kdvvx6">If you look closely, all these problems fundamentally come from:</p> <ol data-svelte-h="svelte-4ryo71"><li>Decreased skin in the game, which reduces team alignment</li> <li>N^2 communication, which creates need for managers and specialization, which reduces individual
		agency and breadth of learning</li> <li>Reduced risk tolerance, which slows everything down</li></ol> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rg1ziv">#1 and #2 are inevitable results of having more employees. #3 is an inevitable result of having
	more users, partially due to government regulation.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1yj01ad">However, there are things you can do to slow the death of fun. For one, don’t accelerate it. Most
	startups needlessly accelerate their corporatization by copying the processes of larger companies,
	usually by poaching managers from large companies who bring their playbooks with them. For
	example, many startups use Jira because large companies use Jira. Don’t use Jira. Y Combinator has
	helped the world realize that inspiration should go the other way--large companies should try to
	operate more like startups.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6ulmyp">Not only are large company playbooks meant for large companies, they’re also outdated. By the time
	your startup gets big, better solutions to many scaling challenges will exist. So when you
	experience scaling pains, try to solve them from first principles, or take inspiration from
	startups that move faster than you despite being the same size.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nw9j63">You can try to structure your company like a bunch of independent startups. And in fact you should
	do this to the extent that you can; Rippling has somewhat pulled it off. But you typically can’t
	get very far because the components of your product are too tightly interconnected, and most
	components don’t generate any revenue on their own.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15yg6dt">You can meaningfully slow down #1 by cleverly designing your incentives. I’ll delve into this in
	another blog post. But no incentive is as good as a fat chunk of equity + the power to influence
	its value.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1xf5n7p">Beyond that, your best bet is to hire less. I strongly believe most companies hire too fast due to
	maligned manager incentives, uninformed investors pushing you to look more like other fast-growing
	startups, and not understanding the true cost of a head. And as tools (especially AI) get better,
	the number of users a small team can support increases. Founders of the future may not need to
	worry so much about these scaling pains, and work may become fun for everyone.</p></div></div>]]></description>

It is Meta (Facebook)’s answer to ChatGPT.</p><p>But the two company takes different paths. ChatGPT is proprietary. You don’t know the code of the model, the training data, and the training method. <strong>Llama is an open-source software</strong>. The code, training data, and the training code are out there in the public.</p><p>Llama is the first major open-source large language model. It gains instant popularity upon release. In addition to being free and open-source, it is pretty small and can be run on a personal computer. The 7-billion and 13-billion parameter models are very usable on a good consumer-grade PC.</p><h2><span id="How_does_Llama_work">How does Llama work?</span></h2><p><strong>LLama is an AI model designed to predict the next word.</strong> You can think of it as a glorified autocomplete. It is trained with text from the internet and other public dataset. Llama 2 is trained with about 2 trillion words.</p><p>You may wonder why the Llama model seems to be intelligent: It gives you sensible answers to difficult questions. It can rewrite your essay. It can give you pros and cons of certain things.</p><p>The training text was written by humans. In some sense, they are a slice of human thoughts projected on a medium. By learning how to complete a sentence, the model also learns an aspect of being human.</p><p>Does the Llama model know logic? There are two opposing views. One view is no because what the model designed to learn was correlation. It just predicts the next most probable word. Nothing more. The other view is yes. Suppose the training text is a murder story. It must learn to complete the last sentence, “The murderer is”. To predict the next word accurately, it has no choice but to learn logical deduction.</p><h2><span id="Why_use_LLama_instead_of_ChatGPT">Why use LLama instead of ChatGPT?</span></h2><p>ChatGPT is zero setup. A free version is available. Why use LLama? ChatGPT is indeed highly accessible. Here are the reasons why</p><ul><li><strong>Privacy</strong>. You can use Llama locally on your own computer. You don’t need to worry about the questions you asked being stored in a company’s server indefinitely.</li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>. You may not be able to use ChatGPT for work-related queries because you are bounded by a non-disclosure agreement. You don’t have an NDA with OpenAI, after all.</li><li><strong>Customization</strong>. There are many locally finetuned models you can choose from. If you don’t like the answers of a model, you can switch to another one.</li><li><strong>Train your model</strong>.

The crew disconnected the autoflight system, assumed manual control of the aircraft, re-established the aircraft on the localizer about 12nm before the runway threshold and landed safely.<p>On Mar 6th 2020 Hong Kong's AAIA reported under the headline "Loss of Control - Inflight" the occurrence was rated a serious incident and opened an investigation.</p><p>There had been other similiar occurrences, see <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=4d42cd8c&amp;opt=0" target="_blank">Incident: Virgin Atlantic B789 at Hong Kong on Sep 29th 2019, deviated from localizer and descended below minimum safe altitude</a>, <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=4d41981b&amp;opt=0" target="_blank">Incident: Etihad B789 at Hong Kong on Sep 7th 2019, veered off localizer and descended below safe height on ILS approach</a> and <a href="https://avherald.com/h?article=4d03a5fe&amp;opt=0">Incident: Ethiopian B788 at Hong Kong on Jul 18th 2019, loss of control on ILS approach</a>.</p><p>In response to the occurrences Boeing released a bulletin in December 2019 addressing the issues (see below).</p><p>On Aug 11th 2023 Hong Kong's AAIA released their <a href="https://www.tlb.gov.hk/aaia/doc/Investigation%20Report%206-2023.pdf" target="_blank">final report</a> into this occurrence as well as three more similiar occurrences concluding the probable cause of this serious incident was:</p><p><i>The LOC course deviation was caused by the software failure of the CLC autoflight function in the AFDS.</i></p><p>The AAIA analysed:</p><p><i>During the investigation of this occurrence, another operator encountered a similar occurrence on the B787 at VHHH on 7 September 2019.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-fc514029=""><p><!--[-->With the popularity of LLM (Large Language Model), vector databases have also become a hot topic. With just a few lines of simple Python code, a vector database can act as a cheap but highly effective "external brain" for your LLM. But do we really need a specialized vector database?<!--]--></p><h2 id="why-does-llm-need-vector-search"><a href="#why-does-llm-need-vector-search"><!--[-->Why does LLM need vector search?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->First, let me briefly introduce why LLM needs to use vector search technology. Vector search is a problem that has been around for a long time. The process of finding the most similar object in a collection given an object is vector search. Text/images, etc. can be converted into a vector representation, and the similarity problem of text/images can be transformed into a vector similarity problem.<!--]--></p><figure><p><img src="https://modelz.ai/blog-images/pgvector/text.png"></p><figcaption><!--[-->Text search (<a href="https://docs.relevanceai.com/docs/what-is-vector-search" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->credit<!--]--></a>)<!--]--></figcaption></figure><p><!--[-->In the example above, we convert different words into a three-dimensional vector. Therefore, we can intuitively display the similarity between different words in a 3D space. For example, the similarity between "student" and "school" is higher than the similarity between "student" and "food".<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Returning to LLM, the limitation of the context window length is a major challenge. For instance, ChatGPT 3.5 has a context length limit of 4k tokens. This poses a significant problem for LLM's context-learning ability and negatively impacts the model's user experience. However, vector search provides an elegant solution to this problem:<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->Divide the text that exceeds the context length limit into shorter chunks and convert different chunks into vectors (embeddings).<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Before inputting the prompt to LLM, convert the prompt into a vector (embedding).<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Search the prompt vector to find the most similar chunk vector.<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Concatenate the most similar chunk vector with the prompt vector as the input to LLM.<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><p><!--[-->This is like giving LLM an external memory, which allows it to search for the most relevant information from this memory. This memory is the ability brought by vector search. If you want to learn more details, you can read these articles (<a href="https://simplicityissota.substack.com/p/what-is-an-embedding-anyways" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->Article 1<!--]--></a> and <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/enhancing-chatgpt-with-infinite-external-memory-using-vector-database-and-chatgpt-retrieval-plugin-b6f4ea16ab8" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->Article 2<!--]--></a>), which explain it more clearly.<!--]--></p><h2 id="why-is-vector-database-so-popular"><a href="#why-is-vector-database-so-popular"><!--[-->Why is vector database so popular?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->In LLM, the vector database has become an indispensable part, and one of the most important reasons is its ease of use. After being used in conjunction with OpenAI Embedding models (such as <code><!--[-->text-embedding-ada-002<!--]--></code>), it only takes about ten lines of code to convert a prompt query into a vector and perform the entire process of vector search.<!--]--></p><!--[--><pre><code><span line="1"><span>def</span><span> </span><span>query</span><span>(query, collection_name, top_k</span><span>=</span><span>20</span><span>):

</span></span><span line="20"><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> query_result</span></span></code></pre><!--]--><p><!--[-->In LLM, vector search mainly plays a role in recall. Simply put, recall is finding the most similar objects in a candidate set. In LLM, the candidate set is all chunks, and the most similar object is the chunk that is most similar to the prompt. In the reasoning process of LLM, vector search is regarded as the main implementation of recall. It is easy to implement and can use OpenAI Embedding models to solve the most troublesome problem of converting text into vectors. The remaining part is an independent and clean vector search problem, which can be well completed by current vector databases. Therefore, the entire process is particularly smooth.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->As the name suggests, vector database is a database specifically designed for the special data type of vectors. The similarity calculation of vectors was originally an O(n^2) complexity problem because it required comparing all vectors in the set pairwise. Therefore, the industry proposed the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm. By using the ANN algorithm, the vector index is constructed by pre-calculating in the vector database, using the idea of trading space for time, which greatly speeds up the process of similarity calculation. This is similar to the index in traditional databases.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Therefore, vector databases not only have strong performance but also excellent ease of use, making them a perfect match for LLM! (Really?)<!--]--></p><h2 id="perhaps-a-general-purpose-database-would-be-better"><a href="#perhaps-a-general-purpose-database-would-be-better"><!--[-->Perhaps a general-purpose database would be better?<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->We've talked about the advantages and benefits of vector databases, but what are their limitations? <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/blog/why-your-vector-database-should-not-be-a-vector-database/" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->A blog post by SingleStore<!--]--></a> provides a good answer to this question:<!--]--></p><blockquote><!--[--><p><!--[-->Vectors and vector search are a data type and query processing approach, not a foundation for a new way of processing data. Using a specialty vector database (SVDB) will lead to the usual problems we see (and solve) again and again with our customers who use multiple specialty systems: redundant data, excessive data movement, lack of agreement on data values among distributed components, extra labor expense for specialized skills, extra licensing costs, limited query language power, programmability and extensibility, limited tool integration, and poor data integrity and availability compared with a true DBMS.<!--]--></p><!--]--></blockquote><p><!--[-->There are two issues that I think are important. The first is the issue of data consistency. During the prototyping phase, vector databases are very suitable, and ease of use is more important than anything else. However, a vector database is an independent system that is completely decoupled from other data storage systems such as TP databases and AP data lakes. Therefore, data needs to be synchronized, streamed, and processed between multiple systems.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Imagine if your data is already stored in an OLTP database such as PostgreSQL. To perform vector search using an independent vector database, you need to first extract the data from the database, then convert each data point into a vector using services such as OpenAI Embedding, and then synchronize it to a dedicated vector database. This adds a lot of complexity. Furthermore, if a user deletes a data point in PostgreSQL but it is not deleted in the vector database, then there will be data inconsistency issues. This issue can be very serious in actual production environments.<!--]--></p><!--[--><pre><code><span line="1"><span>-- Update the embedding column for the documents table

Vectors are just one data type in a general-purpose database, not an independent system. This way, data consistency is no longer an issue.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->The second issue is with query language. The query language of vector databases is typically designed specifically for vector search, so there may be many limitations in other types of queries. For example, in metadata filtering scenarios, users need to filter based on certain metadata fields. The filtering operators supported by some vector databases are limited.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In addition, the supported data types for metadata are also very limited, usually only including String, Number, List of Strings, and Booleans. This is not friendly for complex metadata queries.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If traditional databases can support the vector data type, then the aforementioned issues do not exist. Firstly, data consistency is already taken care of as TP or AP databases are existing infrastructure in production environments. Secondly, the issue of query language no longer exists because vector data type is just one data type in the database, so queries for vector data type can use the native query language of the database, such as SQL.<!--]--></p><h2 id="detailed-explanation"><a href="#detailed-explanation"><!--[-->Detailed explanation<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->However, it is unfair to only compare the disadvantages of vector databases. There are several counterpoints to consider:<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[--><strong><!--[-->Ease of Use<!--]--></strong>: Vector databases are designed with ease of use in mind, and users can easily work with them without worrying about the underlying implementation details. However, integrating them with other data storage systems can be a challenge, as mentioned earlier.<!--]--></li><li><!--[--><strong><!--[-->Performance<!--]--></strong>: Vector databases have a significant advantage over traditional databases in terms of performance for certain use cases. Their design for vector search allows for fast and efficient similarity searches on large-scale datasets with high-dimensional vectors.<!--]--></li><li><!--[--><strong><!--[-->Metadata Filtering<!--]--></strong>: While metadata filtering capabilities in vector databases may be limited, they can still meet the needs of most business scenarios. However, for more complex metadata queries, a hybrid approach may be needed, where metadata is stored in a separate database or data lake and linked to the vector data in the vector database.<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><p><!--[-->How can you address these issues? In the following section, I will provide my perspective by answering these questions.<!--]--></p><h3 id="vector-databases-are-easy-to-use"><a href="#vector-databases-are-easy-to-use"><!--[-->Vector databases are easy to use<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->While it is true that vector databases are easy to use, this is not unique to them. The ease of use of vector databases is mainly due to their abstraction of a specific domain, which allows them to be specifically designed for the most commonly used machine learning programming language, Python, and optimized for vector search scenarios. However, if traditional databases could also support the vector data type, they could offer similar ease of use.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In addition, traditional databases can provide Python SDKs and other integrated tools to meet the needs of most scenarios, as well as standard SQL interfaces to handle more complex query scenarios. Therefore, it is not necessary to use a vector database solely for its ease of use.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Another advantage of vector databases is their distributed design, which allows them to scale horizontally to meet the data volume and QPS requirements of users. However, traditional databases can also meet these requirements through distributed systems. Nevertheless, the decision to use a distributed system should be based on the actual needs of the data volume and QPS requirements, as well as the associated costs.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->In summary, while vector databases have their advantages, traditional databases can also provide similar ease of use and distributed capabilities if they support the vector data type. Therefore, the choice between a vector database and a traditional database should be based on the specific needs of the application and the available resources.<!--]--></p><h3 id="vector-databases-have-better-performance"><a href="#vector-databases-have-better-performance"><!--[-->Vector databases have better performance<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->To investigate the performance of vector databases in LLM scenarios, a <a href="https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2023/04/10/nn-vs-ann/" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->naive benchmark<!--]--></a> of vector retrieval was conducted. The benchmark involved N randomly initialized 256-dimensional vectors, and the query time for the top-5 nearest neighbors was measured for different scales of N. Two different methods were used for the test:<!--]--></p><ul><!--[--><li><!--[-->Numpy was used to perform <strong><!--[-->real-time<!--]--></strong> calculation, which executed completely accurate, non-precomputed nearest neighbor calculation.<!--]--></li><li><!--[-->Hnswlib was used to <strong><!--[-->precompute approximate<!--]--></strong> nearest neighbors.<!--]--></li><!--]--></ul><figure><p><img src="https://modelz.ai/blog-images/pgvector/benchmark.png"></p><figcaption><!--[-->Benchmark (<a href="https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2023/04/10/nn-vs-ann/" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->credit<!--]--></a>)<!--]--></figcaption></figure><p><!--[-->The benchmark results show that, at the scale of 1 million vectors, the delay of real-time calculation using Numpy is approximately 50ms. Using this as a benchmark, we can compare the time spent on LLM inference after completing vector search. For instance, the 7B model requires approximately 10 seconds for inference on 300 Chinese characters on an Nvidia A100 (40GB). Therefore, even if the query time for real-time accurate calculation of the similarity of 1 million vectors using Numpy is considered, it only accounts for 0.5% of the total delay in the end-to-end LLM inference. Thus, in terms of delay, the benefits brought by vector databases may be overshadowed by the delay of LLM itself in the current LLM scenario. Therefore, we need to also consider throughput. The throughput of LLM is much lower than that of vector databases. Thus, I do not believe that throughput is the core issue in this scenario.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->If performance is not the primary concern, what factors will determine the user's choice? I think it is the overall ease of use, including ease of use for both usage and operation, consistency, and other solutions to database-related issues. Traditional databases have mature solutions for these problems, while vector databases are still in the early stages of development.<!--]--></p><h3 id="metadata-filtering-can-still-meet-the-needs-of-most-business-scenarios"><a href="#metadata-filtering-can-still-meet-the-needs-of-most-business-scenarios"><!--[-->Metadata filtering can still meet the needs of most business scenarios<!--]--></a></h3><p><!--[-->When considering metadata filtering, it's important to note that it's not just a matter of the number of supported operators. Consistency of data is also a crucial factor. Metadata in vectors is essentially data in traditional databases, while vectors themselves are indexes of the data. Therefore, it's reasonable to consider storing both vectors and metadata in traditional databases.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->Traditional databases do have the capability to support vector data types and provide similar ease of use and distributed capabilities as vector databases. Furthermore, traditional databases have mature solutions to ensure data consistency and integrity, such as transaction management and data backup and recovery.<!--]--></p><h2 id="vectors-in-traditional-databases"><a href="#vectors-in-traditional-databases"><!--[-->Vectors in traditional databases<!--]--></a></h2><p><!--[-->Since we see vectors as a new data type in traditional databases, let's take a look at how to support vector data types in traditional databases, using PostgreSQL as an example. <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->pgvector<!--]--></a> is an open-source PostgreSQL plugin that supports vector data types. pgvector uses exact calculation by default, but it also supports building an IVFFlat index and precomputing ANN results using the IVFFlat algorithm, sacrificing calculation accuracy for performance.<!--]--></p><p><!--[-->pgvector has done an excellent job of supporting vectors and is used by products such as <a href="https://supabase.com/blog/openai-embeddings-postgres-vector" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->supabase<!--]--></a>. However, the supported index algorithm is limited, with only the simplest IVFFlat algorithm supported, and no quantization or storage optimization is implemented. Moreover, the index algorithm of pgvector is not disk-friendly and is designed for use in memory. Therefore, vector index algorithms designed for disk, such as <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/09853c7fb1d3f8ee67a61b6bf4a7f8e6-Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow"><!--[-->DiskANN<!--]--></a>, are also valuable in the traditional database ecosystem.<!--]--></p><figure><p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF8KN7cXsBAGOLj.jpg"></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><!--[-->Extending pgvector can be challenging due to its implementation in the C programming language.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">List of "Hidden" Tricks</h2>

<p dir="auto">Below things are already inside the software, and <strong>users do not need to do anything about these</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that some of these tricks are currently (2023 Aug 11) impossible to reproduce in Automatic1111's interface or ComfyUI's node system. You may expect better results from Fooocus than other software even when they use similar models/pipelines.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Native refiner swap inside one single k-sampler. The advantage is that now the refiner model can reuse the base model's momentum (or ODE's history parameters) collected from k-sampling to achieve more coherent sampling. In Automatic1111's high-res fix and ComfyUI's node system, the base model and refiner use two independent k-samplers, which means the momentum is largely wasted, and the sampling continuity is broken. Fooocus uses its own advanced k-diffusion sampling that ensures seamless, native, and continuous swap in a refiner setup.</li>
<li>Negative ADM guidance. Because the highest resolution level of XL Base does not have cross attentions, the positive and negative signals for XL's highest resolution level cannot receive enough contrasts during the CFG sampling, causing the results look a bit plastic or overly smooth in certain cases. Fortunately, since the XL's highest resolution level is still conditioned on image aspect ratios (ADM), we can modify the adm on the positive/negative side to compensate for the lack of CFG contrast in the highest resolution level.</li>
<li>We modified the style templates a bit and added the "cinematic-default".</li>
<li>We tested the "sd_xl_offset_example-lora_1.0.safetensors" and it seems that when the lora weight is below 0.5, the results are always better than XL without lora.</li>
<li>The parameters of samplers are carefully tuned.</li>
<li>Because XL uses positional encoding for generation resolution, images generated by several fixed resolutions look a bit better than that from arbitrary resolutions (because the positional encoding is not very good at handling int numbers that are unseen during training). This suggests that the resolutions in UI may be hard coded for best results.</li>
<li>Separated prompts for two different text encoders seem unnecessary. Separated prompts for base model and refiner may work but the effects are random, and we refrain from implement this.</li>
<li>DPM family seems well-suited for XL, since XL sometimes generates overly smooth texture but DPM family sometimes generate overly dense detail in texture. Their joint effect looks neutral and appealing to human perception.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thanks</h2>
<p dir="auto">The codebase starts from an odd mixture of <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">Automatic1111</a> and <a href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI">ComfyUI</a>. (And they both use GPL license.)</p>

<p>Four months after the disappointing decision on summary judgment in <em>Hachette v. Internet Archive</em>, a number of <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17211300/hachette-book-group-inc-v-internet-archive/?order_by=desc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papers were filed today</a> in the district court,&nbsp;and then the judge is expected to make his final judgment. We expect that, at least while the appeal is pending, there will be changes to our lending program, but the full scope of those changes is a question pending with the district court. We will provide an update on those changes once the district court decision is final.</p>



<p><strong>Our fight is far from over—</strong>We remain steadfast in our belief that libraries should be able to own, preserve, and lend digital books outside of the confines of temporary licensed access. We believe that the judge made errors of law and fact in the decision, and we will appeal.</p>



<p><strong>Statement from Internet Archive founder, Brewster Kahle:</strong><br>“Libraries are under attack at unprecedented scale today, from book bans to defunding to overzealous lawsuits like the one brought against our library. These efforts are cutting off the public’s access to truth at a key time in our democracy. We must have strong libraries, which is why we are appealing this decision.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="dataContent">
                                    <p>MARION — In an unprecedented raid Friday, local law enforcement seized computers, cellphones and reporting materials from the <a target="_blank" href="http://marionrecord.com/">Marion County Record</a> office, the newspaper’s reporters, and the publisher’s home.</p>
<p>Eric Meyer, owner and publisher of the newspaper, said police were motivated by a confidential source who leaked sensitive documents to the newspaper, and the message was clear: “Mind your own business or we’re going to step on you.”</p>
<p>The city’s entire five-officer police force and two sheriff’s deputies took “everything we have,” Meyer said, and it wasn’t clear how the newspaper staff would take the weekly publication to press Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The raid followed news stories about a restaurant owner who kicked reporters out of a meeting last week with U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner, and revelations about the restaurant owner’s lack of a driver’s license and conviction for drunken driving.</p>
<p>Meyer said he had never heard of police raiding a newspaper office during his 20 years at the Milwaukee Journal or 26 years teaching journalism at the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>“It’s going to have a chilling effect on us even tackling issues,” Meyer said, as well as “a chilling effect on people giving us information.”</p>
<p>The search warrant, signed by Marion County District Court Magistrate Judge Laura Viar, appears to violate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000aa">federal law</a> that provides protections against searching and seizing materials from journalists. The law requires law enforcement to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mcguirewoods.com/news-resources/publications/media.0101.pdf">subpoena materials instead</a>. Viar didn’t respond to a request to comment for this story or explain why she would authorize a potentially illegal raid.</p>
<p>Emily Bradbury, executive director of the Kansas Press Association, said the police raid is unprecedented in Kansas.</p>
<p>“An attack on a newspaper office through an illegal search is not just an infringement on the rights of journalists but an assault on the very foundation of democracy and the public’s right to know,” Bradbury said. “This cannot be allowed to stand.”</p>
<p>Meyer reported last week that Marion restaurant owner Kari Newell had kicked newspaper staff out of a public forum with LaTurner, whose staff was apologetic. Newell responded to Meyer’s reporting with hostile comments on her personal Facebook page.</p>
<p>A confidential source contacted the newspaper, Meyer said, and provided evidence that Newell had been convicted of drunken driving and continued to use her vehicle without a driver’s license. The criminal record could jeopardize her efforts to obtain a liquor license for her catering business.</p>
<p>A reporter with the Marion Record used a state website to verify the information provided by the source. But Meyer suspected the source was relaying information from Newell’s husband, who had filed for divorce. Meyer decided not to publish a story about the information, and he alerted police to the situation.</p>
<p>“We thought we were being set up,” Meyer said.</p>
<p>Police notified Newell, who then complained at a city council meeting that the newspaper had illegally obtained and disseminated sensitive documents, which isn’t true. Her public comments prompted the newspaper to set the record straight in a story published Thursday.</p>

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometime before 11 a.m. Friday, officers showed up simultaneously at Meyer’s home and the newspaper office. They presented a search warrant that alleges identity theft and unlawful use of a computer.</p>
<p>The search warrant identifies two pages worth of items that law enforcement officers were allowed to seize, including computer software and hardware, digital communications, cellular networks, servers and hard drives, items with passwords, utility records, and all documents and records pertaining to Newell. The warrant specifically targeted ownership of computers capable of being used to “participate in the identity theft of Kari Newell.”</p>
<p>Officers injured a reporter’s finger by grabbing her cellphone out of her hand, Meyer said. Officers at his home took photos of his bank account information.</p>
<p>He said officers told him the computers, cellphones and other devices would be sent to a lab.</p>
<p>“I don’t know when they’ll get it back to us,” Meyer said. “They won’t tell us.”</p>
<p>The seized computers, server and backup hard drive include advertisements and legal notices that were supposed to appear in the next edition of the newspaper.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” he said. “We will publish something.”</p>
<p>Newell, writing Friday under a changed name on her personal Facebook account, said she “foolishly” received a DUI in 2008 and “knowingly operated a vehicle without a license out of necessity.”</p>
<p>“Journalists have become the dirty politicians of today, twisting narrative for bias agendas, full of muddied half-truths,” Newell wrote. “We rarely get facts that aren’t baited with misleading insinuations.”</p>
<p>She said the “entire debacle was brought forth in an attempt to smear my name, jeopardize my licensing through ABC (state Alcoholic Beverage Control Division), harm my business, seek retaliation, and for personal leverage in an ongoing domestic court battle.”</p>
<p>At the law enforcement center in Marion, a staff member said only Police Chief Gideon Cody could answer questions for this story, and that Cody had gone home for the day and could not be reached by phone. The office of Attorney General Kris Kobach wasn’t available to comment on the legal controversy in Marion, which is north of Wichita in central Kansas.</p>
<p>Melissa Underwood, communications director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, replied by email to a question about whether the KBI was involved in the case.</p>
<p>“At the request of the Marion Police Department, on Tuesday, Aug. 8, we began an investigation into allegations of criminal wrongdoing in Marion, Kansas. The investigation is ongoing,” Underwood said.</p>
<p>Meyer, whose father worked at the newspaper from 1948 until he retired, bought the Marion County Record in 1998, preventing a sale to a corporate newspaper chain.</p>
<p>As a journalism professor in Illinois, Meyer said, he had graduate students from Egypt who talked about how people would come into the newspaper office and seize everything so they couldn’t publish. Those students presented a scholarly paper at a conference in Toronto about what it has done to journalism there.</p>
<p>“That’s basically what they’re trying to do here,” Meyer said. “The intervention is just like that repressive government of Egypt. I didn’t think it could happen in America.”</p>

As part-finished drills travel in boxes along a conveyor belt, a robotic arm photographs and scans them for defects. Another robot nestles electric motors into the drills’ casings. A third one places and tightens screws. A single piece of software oversees the entire production line, which is capable of pumping out 130 cordless power tools every hour under the supervision of just seven humans. The assembly line it replaced in China needed up to 40 workers and rarely produced more than 100 an hour.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <p><span>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</span></p></div><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/068%20Science%20and%20technology%20-%20Advanced%20manufacturing-3706e394b93237b351b97f1ef9ff7e45.mp3" title="If it can be designed on a computer, it can be built by robots" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p>“Thirty years from now we will laugh at our generation of humans, putting products together by hand,” predicts Lior Susan, the boss of Bright Machines, a San Francisco-based company that installed the plant’s software. It is not that the design of the electric drills or the various steps involved in making them have changed. Rather, it is the way the automated machines doing the work are being driven by instructions that have been encoded into software having been in effect copied from the brains of Chinese factory workers, who mostly did the job manually. </p><p>Making things this way resembles a model used by the semiconductor industry, where chips are designed using software that directly links to the automated hardware which fabricates them. For the Fort Mill plant, and other firms starting to employ such software-defined manufacturing systems, it promises to transform the factory of the future by allowing more-sophisticated products to be designed and put into production more quickly. All of which promises big cost savings. </p><h2>Make this please</h2><p>To understand why, consider a simplified version of how a new power tool is made. A team of designers come up with a fresh feature, say a longer-lasting battery. They map out every element of the new product, from the battery compartment to the circuitry, that needs to be changed as a result. It is complex work, not least because a small change to one component can have a big impact on another, and so on. </p><p>The design is then “thrown over the wall” to the people responsible for making it. Sometimes that is a third-party factory, often in China. Engineers, designers and production staff exchange information and meet up, constantly tweaking the design in response to the various successes or failures involved in making a series of prototypes. Little things, such as a screw than cannot be tightened correctly because it is hard to reach with an electric screwdriver, might result in a return to the drawing board—which nowadays is mostly a computer-aided-design (<small>CAD</small>) program. </p><p>Eventually, all the kinks are ironed out (hopefully) and the new product is ready for production. The finer details of how all this was achieved, however, are likely to remain locked up in the minds of the workers assembling the prototypes. Humans are, after all, incredibly flexible and often come up with workarounds.</p><p>This process has been employed for decades, yet is inherently uncertain and messy. Designers cannot predict with any confidence what things the factory can or cannot easily accommodate. As a consequence, the design team may purposely leave some features a bit vague, and be put off innovative ideas for fear of being told it cannot be made or is impossibly costly.</p><p>When the hardware is controlled by software, rather than by humans, all this changes. Designers can dream up new products with a far greater certainty that they are manufacturable. This is because the constraints of the production line—even fiddly details like the positioning of screws—are encoded in their <small>CAD</small> programs. Those programs, in turn, are directly connected to the software which controls the machines in the factory. So, if a design works in a digital simulation, there is a good chance it will also “run” on the production line. </p><figure><span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2764/1796/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="2764" height="1796" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2764/1796/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/130/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/195/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/260/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/390/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/416/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/520/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/650/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/832/90/media-assets/image/20230812_STD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="An illustration of two robot hands with a conveyor belt and laptop between them."></span></figure><p>This tight integration of manufacturing hardware and <small>CAD</small> software has been a boon in semiconductor manufacturing, where vast machines etch circuits into silicon just a few nanometres (billionths of a metre) wide. Chip designers with firms such as Apple, Nvidia or Qualcomm use specialised programs, largely produced by two companies, Cadence and Synopsys, to sketch out circuits. The design files are then sent directly to silicon foundries, such as <small>TSMC</small>, in Taiwan, for production. </p><p>“Until the advent of those tools, people were laying out integrated circuits by hand,” says Willy Shih of Harvard Business School. Mr Shih imagines the impossibility of attempting to do that today with, for instance, Apple’s <small>M</small>1 chip, which contains 114bn transistors. Producing such complexity is only possible in a system where software allows humans to ignore the detail and focus on function. </p><p>Stanley Black &amp; Decker has not yet turned its <small>CAD</small> tools loose on Bright Machines’ system to design new products. But the idea is that they soon will. “What Cadence and Synopsys did to semiconductors is what we will do to product design,” says Bright Machines’ Mr Susan.</p><h2>Layer by layer</h2><p>Some companies have already started designing products this way. VulcanForms is a foundry, but one that makes metal components rather than chips. It operates out of a former aircraft hangar in northern Massachusetts, where its vast computer-controlled machines focus 100,000 watts of invisible laser light onto a bed of powdered metal. The powder melts and fuses into intricate patterns, layer by layer, until a component with dimensions specified to within a hundredth of a centimetre emerges. It could be part of the engine in a military drone, or a perfectly formed hip-replacement joint. This is a type of additive manufacturing, more popularly known as 3<small>D-</small>printing. VulcanForms’ machines are driven by <small>CAD</small> software and can produce any metal component with a diameter up to about half a metre.</p><p>“When I became familiar with what VulcanForms was doing, I could see predictable patterns that mirrored some of the learning with semiconductors,” says Ray Stata, the founder of Analog Devices, an American chipmaker, and a member of the foundry’s board. In chipmaking, he says, the software linking designer and manufacturer has produced huge gains in efficiency and economies of scale.</p><p>VulcanForms uses software made by nTopology. This lets people without the skills required to operate lasers, to design objects for production by the foundry. It can result in components with previously unmatched levels of performance, because they can be produced as complex geometric structures which are impossible to manufacture any other way, says John Hart, chief technology officer of VulcanForms. Objects can be created at high volumes, such as forging 1,000 spinal implants from a single powder bed. With additive manufacturing, products can also be produced in one go, as single components, rather than being assembled from individual parts. This reduces the amount of material required as the parts tend to be lighter. It also cuts down on assembly costs. </p><p>Software-defined manufacturing has an impact on some of the big trade and political challenges faced by companies. For firms that are increasingly uncomfortable with relying on Chinese manufacturers, it can make reshoring production a more viable option. Mr Susan puts it in martial terms: “Manufacturing is a weapon. When we give design files to China, we give the source code of that weapon to our enemy.”</p><p>There will be implications for manufacturing jobs. Although automation usually means a reduction in the number of people assembling things on the shop floor, it also creates some jobs. Technicians are required to program and maintain production systems, and in offices successful companies are likely to boost the numbers working in design, marketing and sales. These jobs, though, require different skills so retraining will be necessary.</p><p>Mr Shih also notes that factories themselves, not just the machine tools and processes within them, are coming under the thrall of software. He cites Tecnomatix, a subsidiary of Siemens, a German industrial giant, whose software lets designers lay out an entire factory so that the making of new products can be simulated in a virtual environment, known as a digital twin, before manufacture begins in its physical counterpart.</p><p>If the future of manufacturing is following semiconductors, then there is still some way to go. Producing mechanical objects is not the same as etching elaborate circuits that have no moving parts. For a start, things are far less standardised, with components having all sorts of end uses. “We’re just at the beginning with mechanical structures,” says Mr Stata. “The whole process of putting materials together in an additive method is in its very early stages. The flexibility and possibility that opens up is mind-boggling.”</p><p>Yet some of the implications are becoming apparent. Products could reach a level of performance and precision which is simply unachievable when their production is limited by human hands. Laying out a factory floor in two dimensions to accommodate human workers will become a thing of the past. Factories designed by software will be denser, much more complex three-dimensional places, full of clusters of highly productive, highly automated machinery. </p><p>These factories of the future may be almost deserted places, attended to by a handful of technicians. But with software also taking care of the intricacies of production, they will be easier to use by people developing and designing new products. That should free their imaginations to soar to new levels. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>Curious about the world?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"><div><p>After three years of haphazard plans for getting workers back at their desks, the return-to-office movement has entered a phase of remorse.&nbsp;</p><p>A whopping 80% of bosses regret their initial return-to-office decisions and say they would have approached their plans differently if they had a better understanding of what their employees wanted, according to <a href="https://envoy.com/content/datareport/" target="_blank">new research</a> from Envoy.&nbsp;</p><p>"Many companies are realizing they could have been a lot more measured in their approach, rather than making big, bold, very controversial decisions based on executives' opinions rather than employee data," Larry Gadea, Envoy's CEO and founder, tells <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Envoy interviewed more than 1,000 U.S. company executives and workplace managers who work in-person at least one day per week.&nbsp;</p><p>Some leaders lamented the challenge of measuring the success of in-office policies, while others said it's been hard to make long-term real estate investments without knowing how employees might feel about being in the office weeks, or even months, from now.&nbsp;</p><p>Kathy Kacher, a consultant who advises corporate executives on their return-to-office plans, is surprised the percentage isn't higher.&nbsp;</p><p>"Many organizations that attempted to force a return to the office have had to retract or change their plans because of employee pushback, and now, they don't look strong," says Kacher, the president of Career/Life Alliance Services. "A lot of executives have egg on their faces and they're sad about that."</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>The 'great resignation' to the 'great regret'</h2><div><p>As some business leaders accept hybrid work as a permanent reality, others are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/30/more-companies-could-increase-rto-requirements-soon.html">backtracking on earlier pledges</a> to let employees work from home on a full or part-time basis.&nbsp;</p><p>As of July, 59% of full-time employees are back to being 100% on-site, while 29% are in a hybrid arrangement and 12% are completely remote, according to <a href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/WFHResearch_updates_August2023.pdf" target="_blank">new data</a> from WFH Research. Offices are still only <a href="https://www.kastle.com/safety-wellness/getting-america-back-to-work/" target="_blank">half full </a>compared to their pre-pandemic occupancy.</p><p>Across industries, major corporations including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/09/disney-ceo-bob-iger-tells-employees-to-return-to-the-office-four-days-a-week.html">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/starbucks-orders-return-to-office.html">Starbucks</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/belief-in-person-workers-will-advance-more-in-careers-keeps-rising.html">BlackRock</a> are requiring employees to spend more time at the office, with executives<strong> </strong>often citing the need for more in-person collaboration.</p><p>Zoom is the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/08/08/the-death-of-remote-work-zoom-orders-workers-to-return-to-office-at-least-twice-a-week.html"> latest to reverse course</a>, telling employees who live within a 50-mile radius of a Zoom office that they need to come in at least twice a week.</p><p>It's an abrupt shift from the company's previous policy, which allowed employees to choose between hybrid, in-person or permanent remote work.&nbsp;</p><p>"We believe that a structured hybrid approach — meaning employees that live near an office need to be onsite two days a week to interact with their teams — is most effective for Zoom," a company spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC Make It, adding that the company will "continue to leverage the entire Zoom platform to keep our employees and dispersed teams connected and working efficiently" and&nbsp; "hire the best talent, regardless of location."</p><p>The sunk cost of unused office space has been a major factor in companies' decisions to change their RTO approach, says Kacher.&nbsp;</p><p>Even six months ago, companies were willing to eat these costs in a tight labor market to recruit and retain talent. But now, "Some companies are getting impatient, and want to recoup these large investments," Kacher explains.</p><p>In New York City, office space costs, on average, about $16,000 a year per employee, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/business/office-buildings-real-estate-vacancy.html" target="_blank">the New York Times </a>reports.</p><p>Yet the constant risk of losing top talent has been enough to make companies reconsider their strict RTO mandates. Research has shown that companies that put pressure on employees to return to the office are more likely to experience turnover issues than those that don't.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies that have mandated a strict return to the office three days a week without first seeking employee input are experiencing the most angst, Kacher adds.</p><p>"They're the ones struggling with retention and recruitment," she says. "Some of the companies I work with have even scaled back the number of in-office days they're requiring in response to employee backlash."</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>Who's winning the return-to-office fight&nbsp;</h2><div><p>The companies that are seeing the most success with returning to the office appear to be the ones that are making decisions with their employees, rather than for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Take Ernst &amp; Young, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>The global accounting and consulting firm weathered some employee criticism for its initial return-to-office announcement in June 2021, when the firm told employees that they would be encouraged to spend 40-60% of their time in the office.&nbsp;</p><p>Their plan was put on pause through the end of the year as Covid-19 cases ticked up once again throughout the U.S., so EY leaders used that time to ask employees about their reluctance to come into the office.&nbsp;</p><p>Common threads stood out to Frank Giampietro, EY's chief wellbeing officer for the Americas: Employees weren't sure what to do about pet care or child care.</p><p>In response, EY announced a fund in February 2022 to reimburse up to $800 per year for commuting, pet care and dependent care costs for each of its 55,000-plus U.S. employees.</p><p>The fund, which is ongoing, had an immediate positive impact on employees' in-office attendance, Giampietro adds. Since EY first rolled out this benefit in February 2022, EY has seen a 150% uptick in office attendance across the U.S.</p><p>"It didn't take a complete rehaul of our return-to-office policies to make employees happy," he says. "We just needed to listen to our people and understand what, specifically, was problematic for them, and offer resources to address that."</p><p>Kacher anticipates that it will take at least another year or two before companies settle into an office routine that employees are content with and bosses don't regret.&nbsp;</p><p>"Some organizations are still in denial that people aren't coming back to the office, and some have moved into the acceptance phase, where they're ready to think more creatively or differently," she says. "But it'll take time for all of us to get there together."</p><p><em><strong>Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work &amp; life?&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/makeitnewsletter/"><em><strong>Sign up for our newsletter</strong></em></a><em><strong>!</strong></em></p><p><em>Get CNBC's free&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/buffett-whitepaper/">Warren Buffett Guide to Investing</a><em>, which distills the billionaire's No. 1 best piece of advice for regular investors, do's and don'ts, and three key investing principles into a clear and simple guidebook.</em></p><p><em><strong>Check out:</strong></em></p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/forget-quiet-quitting-loud-laborers-are-killing-workplace-morale.html"><em><strong>Forget 'quiet quitting' — 'loud laborers' are killing workplace morale.

                <p>For a few weeks now we have been hearing concern in the Web community in regard to <a href="https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity">Web Environment Integrity</a>, and are asked more and more about it. Our silence is due to the fact that the Web Environment Integrity API is not being worked on in W3C, nor has there been any submission to W3C for <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/other/tag/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG) review.</p><p>In the rest of this article, I want to take the opportunity to explain generally <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/about/#funnel">how new work is brought</a> to the World Wide Web Consortium, and how several W3C work groups coordinate what we call "<a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a>". This review and other safeguards we have in place, transcends a particular technology by focusing on aspects that impact people and the Web: Web accessibility, architecture, internationalization, privacy, and security.</p><h2>Bringing new work to W3C</h2><p>Candidate W3C work arises from <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#GAEvents">W3C Workshops</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/">Member Submissions</a>, or tracking the activity in public <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/groups/">W3C Community Groups</a>. New work starts at W3C by <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharterDevelopment">initiating new working groups</a> based on interest from W3C Members and Team, or landing in <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/">existing working groups</a> (in which case, the groups' charters are updated.) New charters and revised charters both require Member consensus.</p><h2>Passing W3C "horizontal review"</h2><p>The W3C Process Document enshrines <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#doc-reviews">"horizontal review" as a requirement</a>. For a new working group, the review is done internally before any proposed charter is brought to W3C Members for approval. For new technology or specifications, the review must be done as part of publication on the W3C Recommendation track (i.e., the progression stages from an idea to a Web Standard.)</p>

                        "The objective is to ensure that the entire set of stakeholders of the Web community, including the general public, have had adequate notice of the progress of the Working Group and were able to actually perform reviews of and provide comments on the specification. A second objective is to encourage groups to request reviews early enough that comments and suggested changes can still be reasonably incorporated in response to the review."

                <h2>Self-review for Web platform designers</h2><p>As a starting point and as part of web developer advocacy, most W3C horizontal review groups have created guides and self-review documents so that key aspects can be resolved autonomously:</p><ul><li>The Technical Architecture Group exists to help ensure that the Web makes sense as a platform, and that the design is coherent.

While Bankman-Fried had a First Amendment right to proclaim his innocence, the judge said, free speech protections do not cover communications intended to intimidate or tamper with witnesses, a felony.</p><div><p>Bankman-Fried was immediately taken into custody in the courtroom by U.S. marshals following the ruling.

They declined comment as they left court. </p><p>The one-time Crypto King, Bankman-Fried had previously been allowed to remain free pending trial, confined to home detention at his parents' house in Palo Alto, California on $250 million bond.

They described how her fizzled romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried left her unhappy and disengaged from her job. They were featured in an article in July in The New York Times. </p><p>Kaplan said he found the writings "extremely personal and intimate" and that they  "portrayed Ms. Ellison in an unfavorable light."

Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried's attorney, said during the hearing that prosecutors lacked evidence of intent to   intimidate Ellison, and said their claim was based on a "thin record with a lot of spin." </p><p>After the writings appeared in the Times, Kaplan signed a gag order barring Bankman-Fried from speaking to the news media. But prosecutors sought the additional step of having Bankman-Fried jailed pending his trial, saying his sharing of Ellison’s musings amounted to intimidating a witness and tampering with the jury pool. Prosecutor Danielle Sassoon said his actions amounted to a "deliberate evasion of his bail conditions." </p><p>In court filings, prosecutors have noted Bankman-Fried was already warned by the judge for contacting a different prosecution witness on an encrypted messaging service early in the case and saying he hoped they could have a “constructive relationship.” During the hearing, Kaplan also concluded that the earlier contact amounted to an attempt to influence a witness. </p><p>FTX imploded amid disclosures that Alameda had borrowed $10 billion in customer funds on deposit at FTX and used the money to back high-risk trading positions that ultimately turned against it. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November and Bankman-Fried resigned as chief executive.</p><p>Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried, 31, of cheating investors and stealing deposits from customers of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges before its collapse in November. He is accused of squandering the money backing the risky trades placed by Alameda, as well as on political contributions and a lavish lifestyle.</p><p>Bankman-Fried has been in prolific contact with journalists covering the collapse of FTX and his criminal case, according to court filings. Over a period of serval months, he logged more than 1,000 calls with reporters, and has also been in frequent contact with the author Michael Lewis, who is writing a book about the matter.</p><p>It was not immediately clear where Bankman-Fried would be held in custody pending trial. Prosecutors said they had looked into arrangements with the Putnam County jail in upstate New York where he would have better access to trial preparation materials via computer, but Judge Kaplan said he believed there would be similar access at the federal jail in Brooklyn. The issue was not resolved during the hearing. Kaplan noted the Brooklyn lock-up is "not on anybody's list of five-star facilities."</p></div><figure><p><span><img alt="Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://themessenger.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcms.themessenger.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F07%2Fsam-bankman-fried-caroline-ellison-072623-1024x682.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" loading="lazy" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p><figcaption><span>Sam Bankman-Fried is going back to jail after leaking former girlfriend Caroline Ellison's personal diary pages to the New York Times.</span><span>Michael M.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sam Bankman-Fried will head to jail on Friday after a judge sided with a request by federal prosecutors to revoke the FTX founder's bail over alleged witness tampering. Bankman-Fried was remanded to custody directly from a court hearing in New York. </p><p>Judge Lewis Kaplan denied Bankman-Fried's request for delayed detention pending an appeal. Unless the appeal is successful, he is expected to remain in custody until his criminal trial, which is due to begin on Oct. 2.</p><p>"My conclusion is there is probable cause to believe the defendant tried to tamper with witnesses at least twice," said Judge Kaplan during his ruling.</p><p>As the court marshals took Bankman-Fried into custody at the end of the hearing, the defendant took off his blazer, tie, emptied his pockets, and appeared to remove his shoes. Bankman-Fried's parents were both in the gallery. His mother had her face buried in her hands for much of Judge Kaplan's lengthy ruling.</p><p>The government requested that Bankman-Fried be remanded to a jail in Putnam, New York, where he'd have access to a laptop with internet access for defense preparation, as opposed to sending him to Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, the facility closest to the courthouse that has limited internet access for prisoners. </p><p>Since his <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/12/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas-after-us-files-criminal-charges.html">arrest in December</a>, Bankman-Fried had been out on a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-on-250-million-bail.html">$250 million bail package</a> which requires him to remain at his parents' Palo Alto, California house.</p><p>Bankman-Fried's court appearance on Friday is the latest in a series of pre-trial hearings related to the ex-billionaire's continued dealings with the press – exchanges which the Justice Department characterizes as a "pattern of witness tampering and evading his bail conditions."&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Kaplan previously issued a direct and stern warning to Bankman-Fried in July over his conversations with the media.</p><p>Members of the press, including counsel for The New York Times and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, had filed letters objecting to Bankman-Fried's detention, citing free speech concerns. Defense attorneys had similarly argued that Bankman-Fried was asserting his first amendment right and did not violate any terms of his bail conditions by speaking with journalists.</p><p>The defense had also been hoping that the discovery process would help Bankman-Fried's case.</p><p>Lawyers representing the former FTX chief stipulated that with Bankman-Fried jailed, he would not be able to properly prepare for his trial due to the mountainous amounts of discovery documents only accessible via a computer with internet access.</p><p>In the motion requesting Bankman-Fried's detention, the government said that, over the last several months, the defendant had sent over 100 emails to the media and had made over 1,000 phone calls to members of the press. The final straw, according to prosecutors, was Bankman-Fried leaking private diary entries of his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, to the New York Times.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/ftxs-gary-wang-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-federal-charges-cooperating-with-prosecutors.html">Ellison pleaded guilty</a> to federal charges in Dec. 2022.</p><p>Ellison, who is also the former chief executive of Bankman-Fried's failed crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, has been cooperating with the government since December and is expected to be a star witness for the prosecution.&nbsp;</p><p>During his 33-minute ruling, Judge Kaplan walked through his rationale as to why probable cause for witness tampering had been met by the prosecution, adding that Bankman-Fried's contribution to the Ellison story was designed to "hurt" and "discredit" a witness.</p><p>"Faced with a series of conditions meant to limit the defendant's use of the internet and the phone, the defendant pivoted to in-person machinations," the prosecution said of Bankman-Fried, whose revised bail conditions include restricted internet access and a ban from smartphone use.&nbsp;</p><p>The government added that Bankman-Fried had over 100 phone calls with one of the authors of the Times story prior to publication – many of which lasted for approximately 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The prosecution described the effort by Bankman-Fried – who faces several wire and securities fraud charges related to the alleged multibillion-dollar FTX fraud – as an attempt to discredit Ellison, characterizing it as a "means of indirect witness intimidation through the press."&nbsp;</p><p>It is an argument that proved sufficient to convince Judge Kaplan to send Bankman-Fried to jail ahead of his trial.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/27/prosecutors-drop-another-charge-against-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried.html">The prosecution has had to cull charges twice</a> to comply with an extradition agreement inked with The Bahamas – where Bankman-Fried was previously held in custody. The government told the Judge in a letter that next week it plans to file a new superseding indictment.</p><p><em><strong>This story is developing.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Trolls, bots, and sybils distort online discourse and compromise the security
of networked platforms. User identity is central to the vectors of attack and
manipulation employed in these contexts. However it has long seemed that, try
as it might, the security community has been unable to stem the rising tide of
such problems. We posit the Ghost Trilemma, that there are three key properties
of identity -- sentience, location, and uniqueness -- that cannot be
simultaneously verified in a fully-decentralized setting. Many
fully-decentralized systems -- whether for communication or social coordination
-- grapple with this trilemma in some way, perhaps unknowingly. In this
Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we examine the design space, use
cases, problems with prior approaches, and possible paths forward. We sketch a
proof of this trilemma and outline options for practical, incrementally
deployable schemes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff of trust in centralized
trust anchors, decentralized operation, and an ability to withstand a range of
attacks, while protecting user privacy.

<p>During the three-year completion work that ended last summer, Wendelstein 7-X was primarily equipped with water cooling for the wall elements and an upgraded heating system. The latter can now couple twice as much power into the plasma as before. Since then, the nuclear fusion experiment can be operated in new parameter ranges. "We are now exploring our way towards ever higher energy values," explained Prof. Dr. Thomas Klinger, head of the Stellarator Transport and Dynamics Division at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald. "In doing so, we have to proceed step by step so as not to overload and damage the facility."</p><p>On 15 February 2023, the researchers reached a new milestone: for the first time, they were able to achieve an energy turnover of 1.3 gigajoules in this device. This was 17 times higher than the best value achieved before the conversion (75 megajoules). The energy turnover results from the coupled heating power multiplied by the duration of the discharge. Only if it is possible to couple large amounts of energy continuously into the plasma and also remove the resulting heat, a power plant operation is possible.</p>
<figure data-description="<em>Infrared image from the vacuum vessel of Wendelstein 7-X. The picture does NOT show the plasma itself, but the temperature distribution at the water-cooled divertor baffles. The divertor baffles are used to dissipate the heat from the plasma. A defined line in the centre, the so-called strike line, is clearly visible. This is where the plasma touches the divertor and the temperature is highest.

<p><strong>The plasma discharge lasted eight minutes</strong><br>Particularly heat-resistant divertor baffle plates are used to dissipate the largest heat flows at Wendelstein 7-X. They are part of the inner wall, which is now cooled by a system of 6.8 kilometres of water pipes since the completion of the device. No other fusion facility in the world currently has such a comprehensively cooled inner wall. The plasma heating consists of three components: the newly installed ion heating, the heating by neutral particle injection and electron microwave heating. For the current record, the electron microwave heating system was particularly important because it delivers large amounts of power over periods of several minutes. The energy turnover of 1.3 gigajoule was achieved with an average heating power of 2.7 megawatts, whereby the discharge lasted 480 seconds. This is also a new record for Wendelstein 7-X and one of the best values worldwide. Before the completion works, Wendelstein 7-X achieved maximum plasma times of 100 seconds at much lower heating power.</p><p>Within a few years, the plan is to increase the energy turnover at Wendelstein 7-X to 18 gigajoules, with the plasma then being kept stable for half an hour.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Background to nuclear fusion</strong><br>The goal of fusion research is to develop a climate and environmentally friendly power plant. Similar to the sun, it is to generate energy from the fusion of atomic nuclei. The Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics is pursuing the path of magnetic fusion. Because the fusion fire only ignites at temperatures above 100 million degrees, the fuel – a thin hydrogen plasma – must not come into contact with cold vessel walls. Held by magnetic fields, it floats almost contact-free inside a vacuum chamber. The magnetic cage of Wendelstein 7-X is created by a ring of 50 superconducting magnetic coils. It is a stellarator-type facility in which the special shapes of the coils are the result of sophisticated optimisation calculations. With the help of these coils, the quality of plasma confinement in a stellarator should reach the level of competing tokamak-type facilities<strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="section-abstract-1">This memo contains the thoughts and recountings of events that
transpired during and after the release of information about the United States National Security Agency (NSA)
by Edward Snowden in 2013.  There are four perspectives: that of someone 
who was involved with sifting through the information to responsibly 
inform the public, that of a security area director of the IETF, that of a human 
rights expert, and that of a computer science and affiliate law professor. The purpose 
of this memo is to provide some historical perspective, while at the 
same time offering a view as to what security and privacy challenges 
the technical community should consider.  These essays do not represent a consensus view, but that of the individual authors.<a href="#section-abstract-1">¶</a></p>

      </h2>
<p id="section-1-1">On June 6th, 2013, an article appeared in <em>The Guardian</em> <span>[<a href="#Guard2013">Guard2013</a>]</span>
that was the beginning of a series of what have come to be known as
the Snowden revelations, describing certain activities of the United
States National Security Agency (NSA).  These activities included,
amongst others: secret court orders; secret agreements for the receipt
of so-called "meta-information" that includes source, destination, and
timing of communications; and tapping of communications lines.  The
breathtaking scope of the operations shocked the Internet technical
community and resulted in a sea change within the IETF, IAB,
and other standards organizations.<a href="#section-1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-2">Now that some years have passed, it seems appropriate to reflect on that
period of time and to consider what effect the community's actions had,
where security has improved, how the threat surface has evolved, what
areas haven't improved, and where the community might invest future
efforts.<a href="#section-1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-3">Bruce Schneier begins this compendium of individual essays by bringing
us back to 2013, recalling how it was for him and others to report
what was happening, and the mindset of those involved.  Next, Stephen
Farrell reviews the technical community's reactions and in particular
the reactions of the IETF community, technical advances, and where
threats remain.  Then Farzaneh Badii discusses the impact of those
advances -- or lack thereof -- on human rights.  Finally Steven
M. Bellovin puts the Snowden revelations into an ever-evolving
historical context of secrets and secret stealing that spans
centuries, closing with some suggestions for IETF.<a href="#section-1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-4">Readers are invited to consider what impact we as a community have
had, what challenges remain, and what positive contribution the
technical community can and should make to address security and
privacy of citizens of the world.<a href="#section-1-4">¶</a></p>

<a href="#section-2">2. </a><a href="#name-bruce-schneier-snowden-ten-">Bruce Schneier: Snowden Ten Years Later</a>
      </h2>
<p id="section-2-1">In 2013 and 2014, I wrote extensively about new revelations regarding
NSA surveillance based on the documents provided by Edward
Snowden. But I had a more personal involvement as well.<a href="#section-2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-2">I wrote the essay below in September 2013. <em>The New Yorker</em> agreed to
publish it, but <em>The Guardian</em> asked me not to. It was
scared of UK law enforcement and worried that this essay would
reflect badly on it. And given that the UK police would raid its
offices in July 2014, it had legitimate cause to be worried.<a href="#section-2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-3">Now, ten years later, I offer this as a time capsule of what those
early months of Snowden were like.<a href="#section-2-3">¶</a></p>
<blockquote id="section-2-4">
        <p id="section-2-4.1">It's a surreal experience, paging through hundreds of top-secret NSA
documents. You're peering into a forbidden world: strange, confusing,
and fascinating all at the same time.<a href="#section-2-4.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.2">I had flown down to Rio de Janeiro in late August at the request of
Glenn Greenwald. He had been working on the Edward Snowden archive for
a couple of months, and had a pile of more technical documents that he
wanted help interpreting. According to Greenwald, Snowden also thought
that bringing me down was a good idea.<a href="#section-2-4.2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.3">It made sense. I didn't know either of them, but I have been writing
about cryptography, security, and privacy for decades. I could
decipher some of the technical language that Greenwald had difficulty
with, and understand the context and importance of various
document. And I have long been publicly critical of the NSA's
eavesdropping capabilities. My knowledge and expertise could help
figure out which stories needed to be reported.<a href="#section-2-4.3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.4">I thought about it a lot before agreeing. This was before David
Miranda, Greenwald's partner, was detained at Heathrow airport by the
UK authorities; but even without that, I knew there was a risk. I fly
a lot -- a quarter of a million miles per year -- and being put on a TSA
list, or being detained at the US border and having my electronics
confiscated, would be a major problem. So would the FBI breaking into my
home and seizing my personal electronics. But in the end, that made me
more determined to do it.<a href="#section-2-4.4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.5">I did spend some time on the phone with the attorneys recommended to
me by the ACLU and the EFF. And I talked about it with my partner,
especially when Miranda was detained three days before my departure.
Both Greenwald and his employer, <em>The Guardian</em>, are careful about whom
they show the documents to. They publish only those portions essential
to getting the story out. It was important to them that I be a
co-author, not a source. I didn't follow the legal reasoning, but the
point is that <em>The Guardian</em> doesn't want to leak the documents to
random people. It will, however, write stories in the public interest,
and I would be allowed to review the documents as part of that
process. So after a Skype conversation with someone at <em>The Guardian</em>, I
signed a letter of engagement.<a href="#section-2-4.5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.6">And then I flew to Brazil.<a href="#section-2-4.6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.7">I saw only a tiny slice of the documents, and most of what I saw was
surprisingly banal. The concerns of the top-secret world are largely
tactical: system upgrades, operational problems owing to weather,
delays because of work backlogs, and so on. I paged through weekly
reports, presentation slides from status meetings, and general
briefings to educate visitors. Management is management, even inside
the NSA. Reading the documents, I felt as though I were sitting through
some of those endless meetings.<a href="#section-2-4.7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.8">The meeting presenters try to spice things up. Presentations regularly
include intelligence success stories. There were details -- what had been
found, and how, and where it helped -- and sometimes there were attaboys
from "customers" who used the intelligence. I'm sure these are
intended to remind NSA employees that they're doing good. It
definitely had an effect on me. Those were all things I want the NSA
to be doing.<a href="#section-2-4.8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.9">There were so many code names. Everything has one: every program,
every piece of equipment, every piece of software. Sometimes code
names had their own code names. The biggest secrets seem to be the
underlying real-world information: which particular company
MONEYROCKET is; what software vulnerability EGOTISTICALGIRAFFE -- really,
I am not making that one up -- is; how TURBINE works. Those secrets
collectively have a code name -- ECI, for exceptionally compartmented
information -- and almost never appear in the documents. Chatting with
Snowden on an encrypted IM connection, I joked that the NSA cafeteria
menu probably has code names for menu items. His response: "Trust me
when I say you have no idea."<a href="#section-2-4.9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.10">Those code names all come with logos, most of them amateurish and a
lot of them dumb. Note to the NSA: take some of that more than
ten-billion-dollar annual budget and hire yourself a design
firm. Really; it'll pay off in morale.<a href="#section-2-4.10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.11">Once in a while, though, I would see something that made me stop,
stand up, and pace around in circles. It wasn't that what I read was
particularly exciting, or important. It was just that it was
startling. It changed -- ever so slightly -- how I thought about the world.<a href="#section-2-4.11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.12">Greenwald said that that reaction was normal when people started
reading through the documents.<a href="#section-2-4.12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.13">Intelligence professionals talk about how disorienting it is living on
the inside. You read so much classified information about the world's
geopolitical events that you start seeing the world differently. You
become convinced that only the insiders know what's really going on,
because the news media is so often wrong. Your family is
ignorant. Your friends are ignorant. The world is ignorant. The only
thing keeping you from ignorance is that constant stream of classified
knowledge. It's hard not to feel superior, not to say things like "If
you only knew what we know" all the time. I can understand how General
Keith Alexander, the director of the NSA, comes across as so
supercilious; I only saw a minute fraction of that secret world, and I
started feeling it.<a href="#section-2-4.13">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.14">It turned out to be a terrible week to visit Greenwald, as he was
still dealing with the fallout from Miranda's detention. Two other
journalists, one from <em>The Nation</em> and the other from <em>The Hindu</em>, were
also in town working with him. A lot of my week involved Greenwald
rushing into my hotel room, giving me a thumb drive of new stuff to
look through, and rushing out again.<a href="#section-2-4.14">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.15">A technician from <em>The Guardian</em> got a search capability working while I
was there, and I spent some time with it. Question: when you're given
the capability to search through a database of NSA secrets, what's the
first thing you look for? Answer: your name.<a href="#section-2-4.15">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.16">It wasn't there. Neither were any of the algorithm names I knew, not
even algorithms I knew that the US government used.<a href="#section-2-4.16">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.17">I tried to talk to Greenwald about his own operational security. It
had been incredibly stupid for Miranda to be traveling with NSA
documents on the thumb drive. Transferring files electronically is
what encryption is for. I told Greenwald that he and Laura Poitras
should be sending large encrypted files of dummy documents back and
forth every day.<a href="#section-2-4.17">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.18">Once, at Greenwald's home, I walked into the backyard and looked for
TEMPEST receivers hiding in the trees. I didn't find any, but that
doesn't mean they weren't there. Greenwald has a lot of dogs, but I
don't think that would hinder professionals. I'm sure that a bunch of
major governments have a complete copy of everything Greenwald
has. Maybe the black bag teams bumped into each other in those early
weeks.<a href="#section-2-4.18">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.19">I started doubting my own security procedures. Reading about the NSA's
hacking abilities will do that to you. Can it break the encryption on
my hard drive? Probably not. Has the company that makes my encryption
software deliberately weakened the implementation for it?
Probably. Are NSA agents listening in on my calls back to the US? Very
probably. Could agents take control of my computer over the Internet
if they wanted to? Definitely. In the end, I decided to do my best and
stop worrying about it. It was the agency's documents, after all. And
what I was working on would become public in a few weeks.<a href="#section-2-4.19">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.20">I wasn't sleeping well, either. A lot of it was the sheer magnitude of
what I saw. It's not that any of it was a real surprise. Those of us
in the information security community had long assumed that the NSA
was doing things like this. But we never really sat down and figured
out the details, and to have the details confirmed made a big
difference. Maybe I can make it clearer with an analogy. Everyone
knows that death is inevitable; there's absolutely no surprise about
that. Yet it arrives as a surprise, because we spend most of our lives
refusing to think about it. The NSA documents were a bit like
that. Knowing that it is surely true that the NSA is eavesdropping on
the world, and doing it in such a methodical and robust manner, is
very different from coming face-to-face with the reality that it is
and the details of how it is doing it.<a href="#section-2-4.20">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.21">I also found it incredibly difficult to keep the secrets.
<em>The Guardian</em>'s process is slow and methodical. I move much faster. I
drafted stories based on what I found. Then I wrote essays about those
stories, and essays about the essays. Writing was therapy; I would
wake up in the wee hours of the morning, and write an essay. But that
put me at least three levels beyond what was published.<a href="#section-2-4.21">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.22">Now that my involvement is out, and my first essays are out, I feel a
lot better. I'm sure it will get worse again when I find another
monumental revelation; there are still more documents to go through.<a href="#section-2-4.22">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.23">I've heard it said that Snowden wants to damage America. I can say
with certainty that he does not. So far, everyone involved in this
incident has been incredibly careful about what is released to the
public. There are many documents that could be immensely harmful to
the US, and no one has any intention of releasing them. The documents
the reporters release are carefully redacted. Greenwald and I
repeatedly debated with <em>The Guardian</em> editors the newsworthiness of story
ideas, stressing that we would not expose government secrets simply
because they're interesting.<a href="#section-2-4.23">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.24">The NSA got incredibly lucky; this could have ended with a massive
public dump like Chelsea Manning's State Department cables. I suppose
it still could. Despite that, I can imagine how this feels to the NSA.
It's used to keeping this stuff behind multiple levels of security:
gates with alarms, armed guards, safe doors, and military-grade
cryptography. It's not supposed to be on a bunch of thumb drives in
Brazil, Germany, the UK, the US, and who knows where else, protected
largely by some random people's opinions about what should or should
not remain secret. This is easily the greatest intelligence failure in
the history of ever. It's amazing that one person could have had so
much access with so little accountability, and could sneak all of this
data out without raising any alarms. The odds are close to zero that
Snowden is the first person to do this; he's just the first person to
make public that he did. It's a testament to General Alexander's power
that he hasn't been forced to resign.<a href="#section-2-4.24">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.25">It's not that we weren't being careful about security, it's that our
standards of care are so different. From the NSA's point of view,
we're all major security risks, myself included. I was taking notes
about classified material, crumpling them up, and throwing them into
the wastebasket. I was printing documents marked "TOP
SECRET/COMINT/NOFORN" in a hotel lobby. And once, I took the wrong
thumb drive with me to dinner, accidentally leaving the unencrypted
one filled with top-secret documents in my hotel room. It was an
honest mistake; they were both blue.<a href="#section-2-4.25">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.26">If I were an NSA employee, the policy would be to fire me for that alone.<a href="#section-2-4.26">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.27">Many have written about how being under constant surveillance changes
a person. When you know you're being watched, you censor yourself. You
become less open, less spontaneous. You look at what you write on your
computer and dwell on what you've said on the telephone, wonder how it
would sound taken out of context, from the perspective of a
hypothetical observer. You're more likely to conform. You suppress
your individuality. Even though I have worked in privacy for decades,
and already knew a lot about the NSA and what it does, the change was
palpable. That feeling hasn't faded. I am now more careful about what
I say and write. I am less trusting of communications technology. I am
less trusting of the computer industry.<a href="#section-2-4.27">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.28">After much discussion, Greenwald and I agreed to write three stories
together to start. All of those are still in progress. In addition, I
wrote two commentaries on the Snowden documents that were recently
made public. There's a lot more to come; even Greenwald hasn't looked
through everything.<a href="#section-2-4.28">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-4.29">Since my trip to Brazil (one month before), I've flown back to the US
once and domestically seven times -- all without incident. I'm not on any
list yet. At least, none that I know about.<a href="#section-2-4.29">¶</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="section-2-5">As it happened, I didn't write much more with Greenwald or 
<em>The Guardian</em>. Those two had a falling out, and by the time everything
settled and both began writing about the documents
independently -- Greenwald at the newly formed website <em>The Intercept</em> -- I
got cut out of the process somehow. I remember hearing that Greenwald
was annoyed with me, but I never learned the reason. We haven't spoken
since.<a href="#section-2-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-6">Still, I was happy with the one story I was part of: how the NSA hacks
Tor. I consider it a personal success that I pushed <em>The Guardian</em> to
publish NSA documents detailing QUANTUM. I don't think that would have
gotten out any other way. And I still use those pages today when I
teach cybersecurity to policymakers at the Harvard Kennedy School.<a href="#section-2-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-7">Other people wrote about the Snowden files, and wrote a lot. It was a
slow trickle at first, and then a more consistent flow. Between
Greenwald, Bart Gellman, and <em>The Guardian</em> reporters, there ended up
being steady stream of news. (Bart brought in Ashkan Soltani to help
him with the technical aspects, which was a great move on his part,
even if it cost Ashkan a government job later.) More stories were
covered by other publications.<a href="#section-2-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-8">It started getting weird. Both Greenwald and Gellman held documents
back so they could publish them in their books. Jake Appelbaum, who
had not yet been accused of sexual assault by multiple women, was
working with Poitras. He partnered with <em>Der Spiegel</em> to release an implant
catalog from the NSA's Tailored Access Operations group. To this day,
I am convinced that the document was not in the Snowden archives:
that Jake got it somehow, and it was released with the implication
that it was from Edward Snowden. I thought it was important enough
that I started writing about each item in that document in my blog:
"NSA Exploit of the Week." That got my website blocked by the DoD: I
keep a framed print of the censor's message on my wall.<a href="#section-2-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-9">Perhaps the most surreal document disclosures were when artists
started writing fiction based on the documents. This was in 2016, when
Laura Poitras built a secure room in New York to house the
documents. By then, the documents were years out of date.  And now
they're over a decade out of date. (They were leaked in 2013, but most
of them were from 2012 or before.)<a href="#section-2-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-10">I ended up being something of a public ambassador for the
documents. When I got back from Rio, I gave talks at a private
conference in Woods Hole, the Berkman Center at Harvard, something
called the Congress on Privacy and Surveillance in Geneva, events at
both CATO and New America in DC, an event at the University of
Pennsylvania, an event at EPIC, a "Stop Watching Us" rally in DC,
the RISCS conference in London, the ISF in Paris, and...then...at the
IETF meeting in Vancouver in November 2013. (I remember little of
this; I am reconstructing it all from my calendar.)<a href="#section-2-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-11">What struck me at the IETF was the indignation in the room, and the
calls to action. And there was action, across many fronts. We
technologists did a lot to help secure the Internet, for example.<a href="#section-2-11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-12">The government didn't do its part, though. Despite the public outcry,
investigations by Congress, pronouncements by President Obama, and
federal court rulings, I don't think much has changed. The NSA
canceled a program here and a program there, and it is now more public
about defense. But I don't think it is any less aggressive about
either bulk or targeted surveillance. Certainly its government
authorities haven't been restricted in any way. And surveillance
capitalism is still the business model of the Internet.<a href="#section-2-12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-13">And Edward Snowden? We were in contact for a while on Signal. I
visited him once in Moscow, in 2016. And I had him do a guest
lecture to my class at Harvard for a few years, remotely by
Jitsi. Afterwards, I would hold a session where I promised to answer
every question he would evade or not answer, explain every response he
did give, and be candid in a way that someone with an outstanding
arrest warrant simply cannot. Sometimes I thought I could channel
Snowden better than he could.<a href="#section-2-13">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-2-14">But now it's been a decade. Everything he knows is old and out of
date. Everything we know is old and out of date. The NSA suffered an
even worse leak of its secrets by the Russians, under the guise of the
Shadow Brokers, in 2016 and 2017. The NSA has rebuilt. It again has
capabilities we can only surmise.<a href="#section-2-14">¶</a></p>

<a href="#section-3">3. </a><a href="#name-stephen-farrell-ietf-and-in">Stephen Farrell: IETF and Internet Technical Community Reaction</a>
      </h2>
<p id="section-3-1">In 2013, the IETF and, more broadly, the Internet technical, security, and
privacy research communities, were surprised by the surveillance and attack
efforts exposed by the Snowden revelations <span>[<a href="#Timeline">Timeline</a>]</span>. While the
potential for such was known, it was the scale and pervasiveness of the
activities disclosed that was alarming and, I think it fair to say, quite
annoying, for very many Internet engineers.<a href="#section-3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-2">As for the IETF's reaction, informal meetings during the July 2013 IETF meeting
in Berlin indicated that IETF participants considered that these revelations
showed that we needed to do more to improve the security and privacy properties
of IETF protocols, and to help ensure deployments made better use of the
security and privacy mechanisms that already existed. In August, the IETF set up
a new mailing list <span>[<a href="#Perpass">Perpass</a>]</span>, which became a useful venue for triaging
proposals for work on these topics. At the November 2013 IETF meeting, there
was a lively and very well attended plenary session <span>[<a href="#Plenary-video">Plenary-video</a>]</span> on
"hardening the Internet" against such attacks, followed by a "birds of a
feather" session <span>[<a href="#Perpass-BoF">Perpass-BoF</a>]</span> devoted to more detailed discussion of possible
actions in terms of new working groups, protocols, and Best Current Practice
(BCP) documents that could help improve matters.  This was followed in
February/March 2014 by a joint IAB/W3C workshop on "strengthening the Internet
against pervasive monitoring" <span>[<a href="#STRINT">STRINT</a>]</span> held in London and attended by 150
engineers (still the only IAB workshop in my experience where we needed a
waiting list for people after capacity for the venue was reached!). The STRINT
workshop report was eventually published as <span>[<a href="#RFC7687">RFC7687</a>]</span> in 2015, but in the
meantime, work proceeded on a BCP document codifying
that the IETF community considered that "pervasive monitoring is an attack"
<span>[<a href="#RFC7258">RFC7258</a>]</span> (aka BCP 188). The IETF Last Call discussion for that short
document included more than 1000 emails -- while there was broad agreement on
the overall message, a number of IETF participants considered enshrining that
message in the RFC Series and IETF processes controversial. In any case, the
BCP was published in May 2014. The key statement on which rough consensus was
reached is in the abstract of RFC 7258 and says "Pervasive monitoring is a
technical attack that should be mitigated in the design of IETF protocols,
where possible." That document has since been referenced <span>[<a href="#Refs-to-7258">Refs-to-7258</a>]</span> by
many IETF working groups and RFCs as justifying additional work on security and
privacy. Throughout that period and beyond, the repercussions of the Snowden
revelations remained a major and ongoing agenda item for both of the IETF's
main technical management bodies, the IAB and the IESG (on which I served at
the time).<a href="#section-3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-3">So far, I've only described the processes with which the IETF dealt with
the attacks, but there was, of course, also much technical work started by IETF
participants that was at least partly motivated by the Snowden revelations.<a href="#section-3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-4">In November 2013, a working group was established to document better practices
for using TLS in applications <span>[<a href="#UTA">UTA</a>]</span> so that deployments would be less at risk
in the face of some of the attacks related to stripping TLS or having
applications misuse TLS APIs or parameters.  Similar work was done later to update
recommendations for use of cryptography in other protocols in the CURDLE 
Working Group <span>[<a href="#CURDLE">CURDLE</a>]</span>.  The CURDLE Working Group was, to an extent, created to
enable use of a set of new elliptic curves that had been documented by the IRTF
Crypto Forum Research Group <span>[<a href="#CFRG">CFRG</a>]</span>. That work in turn had been partly
motivated by (perhaps ultimately unfounded) concerns about elliptic curves
defined in NIST standards, following the DUAL_EC_DRBG debacle <span>[<a href="#Dual-EC">Dual-EC</a>]</span> 
(described further below) where a
NIST random number generator had been deliberately engineered to produce output
that could be vulnerable to NSA attack.<a href="#section-3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-5">Work to develop a new version of TLS was started in 2014, mainly due to
concerns that TLS 1.2 and earlier version implementations had been shown to be
vulnerable to a range of attacks over the years. The work to develop TLS 1.3
<span>[<a href="#RFC8446">RFC8446</a>]</span> also aimed to encrypt more of the handshake so as to
expose less information to network observers -- a fairly direct result of the
Snowden revelations.  Work to further improve TLS in this respect continues
today using the so-called Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) mechanism <span>[<a href="#I-D.ietf-tls-esni">TLS-ECH</a>]</span>
to remove one of the last privacy leaks present in current TLS.<a href="#section-3-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-6">Work on ECH was enabled by significant developments to encrypt DNS traffic,
using DNS over TLS (DoT) <span>[<a href="#RFC7858">RFC7858</a>]</span> or DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH) <span>[<a href="#RFC8484">RFC8484</a>]</span>, which also started as a result of
the Snowden revelations. Prior to that, privacy hadn't really been considered
when it came to DNS data or (more importantly) the act of accessing DNS data.
The trend towards encrypting DNS traffic represents a significant change for
the Internet, both in terms of reducing cleartext, but also in terms of moving
points-of-control. The latter aspect was, and remains, controversial, but the
IETF did its job of defining new protocols that can enable better DNS privacy.
Work on HTTP version 2 <span>[<a href="#RFC9113">RFC9113</a>]</span> and QUIC <span>[<a href="#RFC9000">RFC9000</a>]</span> further demonstrates
the trend in the IETF towards always encrypting protocols as the new norm, at
least at and above the transport layer.<a href="#section-3-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-7">Of course, not all such initiatives bore fruit; for example, attempts to define
a new MPLS encryption mechanism <span>[<a href="#I-D.ietf-mpls-opportunistic-encrypt">MPLS-OPPORTUNISTIC-ENCRYPT</a>]</span>
foundered due to a lack of interest and the existence of the already deployed
IEEE Media Access Control Security (MACsec) scheme. But there has been a fairly clear trend towards trying to
remove cleartext from the Internet as a precursor to provide improved privacy
when considering network observers as attackers.<a href="#section-3-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-8">The IETF, of course, forms only one part of the broader Internet technical
community, and there were many non-IETF activities triggered by the Snowden
revelations, a number of which also eventually resulted in new IETF work to
standardise better security and privacy mechanisms developed elsewhere.<a href="#section-3-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-9">In 2013, the web was largely unencrypted despite HTTPS being relatively
usable, and that was partly due to problems using the Web PKI at scale. The
Let's Encrypt initiative <span>[<a href="#LE">LE</a>]</span> issued its first certificates in 2015 as
part of its aim to try to move the web
towards being fully encrypted, and it has been extremely successful in helping
achieve that goal.  Subsequently, the automation protocols developed for
Let's Encrypt were standardised in the IETF's ACME Working Group <span>[<a href="#ACME">ACME</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-10">In 2013, most email transport between mail servers was cleartext,
directly enabling some of the attacks documented in the Snowden documents.
Significant effort by major mail services and MTA software developers since
then have resulted in more than 90% of email being encrypted between mail
servers, and various IETF protocols have been defined in order to improve that
situation, e.g., SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) <span>[<a href="#RFC8461">RFC8461</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-11">Lastly, MAC addresses have historically been long-term fixed values visible to
local networks (and beyond), which enabled some tracking attacks that were
documented in the Snowden documents <span>[<a href="#Toronto">Toronto</a>]</span>. 
Implementers, vendors, and the IEEE 802
standards group recognised this weakness and started work on MAC address
randomisation that in turn led to the IETF's MADINAS Working Group <span>[<a href="#MADINAS">MADINAS</a>]</span>, which
aims to ensure randomised MAC addresses can be used on the Internet without
causing unintentional harm.
There is also a history of IETF work on deprecating MAC-address-based IPv6 interface identifiers
and advocating pseudorandom identifiers and temporary addresses, some of
which pre-dates Snowden <span>[<a href="#RFC7217">RFC7217</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC8064">RFC8064</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC8981">RFC8981</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-3-11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-12">In summary, the significantly large volume of technical work pursued in the
IETF and elsewhere as a result of the Snowden revelations has focussed on two
main things: decreasing the amount of plaintext that remains visible to network
observers and secondly reducing the number of long-term identifiers that enable
unexpected identification or re-identification of devices or users. This work
is not by any means complete, nor is deployment universal, but significant
progress has been made, and the work continues even if the level of annoyance
at the attack has faded somewhat over time.<a href="#section-3-12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-13">One should also note that there has been pushback against these improvements
in security and privacy and the changes they cause for deployments. That has
come from more or less two camps: those on whom these improvements force
change tend to react badly, but later figure out how to adjust, and 
those who seemingly prefer not to strengthen security so as to, for
example, continue to achieve what they call "visibility" even in the face of the
many engineers who correctly argue that such an anti-encryption approach
inevitably leads to worse security overall. The recurring nature of this kind
of pushback is nicely illustrated by <span>[<a href="#RFC1984">RFC1984</a>]</span>. That informational document
was published in 1996 as an IETF response to an early iteration of the
perennial "encryption is bad" argument. In 2015, the unmodified 1996 text was
upgraded to a BCP (BCP 200) as the underlying arguments have
not changed, and will not change.<a href="#section-3-13">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-14">Looking back on all the above from a 2023 vantage point, I think that, as a
community of Internet engineers, we got a lot right, but that today there's way
more that needs to be done to better protect the security and privacy of people
who use the Internet. In particular, we (the technical community) haven't done
nearly as good a job at countering surveillance capitalism <span>[<a href="#Zubhoff2019">Zubhoff2019</a>]</span>, which has exploded
in the last decade. In part, that's because many of the problems are outside of
the scope of bodies such as the IETF. For example, intrusive backend sharing
of people's data for advertising purposes can't really be mitigated via
Internet protocols.<a href="#section-3-14">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-15">However, I also think that the real annoyance felt with respect to the Snowden
revelations is (in general) not felt nearly as much when it comes to the legal
but hugely privacy-invasive activities of major employers of Internet
engineers.<a href="#section-3-15">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-16">It's noteworthy that RFC 7258 doesn't consider that bad actors are limited to
governments, and personally, I think many advertising industry schemes for
collecting data are egregious examples of pervasive monitoring and hence ought
also be considered an attack on the Internet that ought be mitigated where
possible.  However, the Internet technical community clearly hasn't acted in
that way over the last decade.<a href="#section-3-16">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-17">Perhaps that indicates that Internet engineers and the bodies in which they
congregate need to place much more emphasis on standards for ethical behaviour
than has been the case for the first half-century of the Internet.  And while
it would be good to see the current leaders of Internet bodies work to make
progress in that regard, at the time of writing, it sadly seems more likely that
government regulators will be the ones to try force better behaviour. That of
course comes with a significant risk of having regulations that stymie the kind
of permissionless innovation that characterised many earlier Internet
successes.<a href="#section-3-17">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3-18">So while we got a lot right in our reaction to Snowden's revelations,
currently, we have a "worse" Internet.  Nonetheless, I do still hope to see a
sea change there, as the importance of real Internet security and privacy for
people becomes utterly obvious to all, even the most hard-core capitalists and
government signals intelligence agencies.  That may seem naive, but I remain
optimistic that, as a fact-based community, we (and eventually our employers)
will recognise that the lesser risk is to honestly aim to provide the best
security and privacy practically possible.<a href="#section-3-18">¶</a></p>

<a href="#section-4">4. </a><a href="#name-farzaneh-badii-did-snowdens">Farzaneh Badii: Did Snowden's Revelations Help with Protecting Human Rights on the Internet?</a>
      </h2>
<p id="section-4-1">It is very difficult to empirically measure the effect of Snowden's
revelations on human rights and the Internet. Anecdotally, we have
been witnessing dominant regulatory and policy approaches that impact
technologies and services that are at the core of protecting human
rights on the Internet. (A range of European Union laws aims to
address online safety or concentration of data. There are many more
regulations that have an impact on the Internet <span>[<a href="#Masnick2023">Masnick2023</a>]</span>.) There
has been little progress in fixing technical and policy issues that
help enable human rights. The Snowden revelations did not
revolutionize the Internet governance and
technical approaches to support human rights such as freedom
of expression, freedom of association and assembly, and privacy. It did not decrease the number of 
Internet shutdowns nor the eagerness of authoritarian (and even to some extent democratic) countries to territorialize the Internet. 
In some cases, the governments argued that they should have more data sovereignty or Internet sovereignty. Perhaps the revelations helped with the evolution of some technical and policy aspects.<a href="#section-4-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-2">After Snowden's revelations 10 years ago, engineers and advocates at
the IETF responded in a few
ways. One prominent response was the issuance of a BCP 
document, "Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack" <span>[<a href="#RFC7258">RFC7258</a>]</span> by
Farrell and Tschofenig. The responses to the Snowden revelations did not
mean that IETF had lost sight of issues such as privacy and
surveillance. There were instances of resistance to surveillance in
the past by engineers (we do not delve into how successful that was in
protecting human rights). However, historically, many engineers believed
that widespread and habitual surveillance was too expensive to be
practical. The revelations proved them wrong.<a href="#section-4-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-3">Rights-centered activists were also involved with the IETF before the
revelations. For example, staff from Center for Democracy and
Technology (CDT) was undertaking work at the IETF (and was a member of
the Internet Architecture Board) and held workshops about the
challenges of creating privacy-protective protocols and systems. The
technical shortcomings that were exploited by the National Security
Agency to carry out mass-scale surveillance were recognized by the
IETF before the Snowden revelations <span>[<a href="#Garfinkel1995">Garfinkel1995</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC6462">RFC6462</a>]</span>. In
2012, Joy Liddicoat and Avri Doria wrote a report for the Internet Society
that extensively discussed the processes and principles of human
rights and Internet protocols <span>[<a href="#Doria2012">Doria2012</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-4-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-4">Perhaps the Snowden revelations brought more attention to the IETF and
its work as it related to important issues, such as privacy and
freedom of expression. It might have also expedited and helped with
more easily convening the Human Rights Protocol Considerations
Research Group (HRPC) in the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) in July 2015. The HRPC RG was originally co-chaired
by Niels ten Oever (who worked at Article 19 at the time) and Internet
governance activist Avri Doria.
The charter of the HRPC RG states that
the group was established: "to research whether standards and
protocols can enable, strengthen or threaten human rights, as defined
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR)."<a href="#section-4-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-5">During the past decade, a few successful strides were made to create
protocols that, when and if implemented, aim at protecting privacy of
the users, as well as help with reducing pervasive surveillance. These
efforts were in keeping with the consensus of the IETF found in RFC
7258.  Sometimes these protocols have anti-censorship qualities as
well. A few examples immediately come to mind: 1) the encryption of DNS
queries (for example, DNS over HTTPS), 2) ACME protocol underpinning
the Let's Encrypt initiative, and 3) Registration Data Access Protocol
(RDAP) <span>[<a href="#RFC7480">RFC7480</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC7481">RFC7481</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC8056">RFC8056</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC9082">RFC9082</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC9083">RFC9083</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#RFC9224">RFC9224</a>]</span>. (It is debatable that RDAP had anything to do with
the Snowden revelations, but it is still a good example and is finally
being implemented.)<a href="#section-4-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-6">The DNS Queries over HTTPS protocol aimed to encrypt DNS queries. Four
years after RFC 7258, DoH was developed to tackle both active and
passive monitoring of DNS queries. It is also a tool that can help
with combatting censorship. Before the revelations, DNS query privacy
would have been controversial due to being expensive or unnecessary, but the 
Snowden revelations made it more plausible. 
Let's Encrypt was not an Internet protocol, but it was an initiative that aimed to encrypt the web, and later on
some of the automation protocols were standardized in the IETF ACME
Working Group. RDAP could solve a
long-term problem: redacting the domain name registrants' (and IP
address holders') sensitive, personal data but at the same time
enabling legitimate access to the information. As to the work of HRPC
Research Group, it has so far issued <span>[<a href="#RFC8280">RFC8280</a>]</span> by ten Oever and
Cath and a number of informational Internet-Drafts.<a href="#section-4-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-7">While we cannot really argue that all the movements and privacy-preserving 
protocols and initiatives that enable protecting human
rights at the infrastructure layer solely or directly result from the Snowden
revelations, I think it is safe to say that the revelations helped
with expediting the resolution of some of the "technical" hesitations
that had an effect on fixing Internet protocols that enabled
protection of human rights.<a href="#section-4-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-8">Unfortunately, the Snowden revelations have not yet helped us
meaningfully with adopting a human rights approach. We can't agree on
prioritizing human rights in our Internet communities for a host of
reasons. This could be due to: 1) human rights are sometimes in
conflict with each other; 2) it is simply not possible to mitigate the
human right violation through the Internet protocol; 3) it is not
obvious for the engineers in advance how the Internet protocol
contributes to enabling human rights protections, or precisely what they ought to do; 
 4) the protocol is already there, but market, law, and a
host of other societal and political issues do not allow for
widespread implementation.<a href="#section-4-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-9">IETF did not purposefully take a long time to adopt and implement protocols that
enabled human rights. There were technical and political issues that
created barriers. For example, as WHOIS was not capable of accommodating a tiered-access option, 
the IETF community attempted a few times before to create a protocol that would disclose the necessary
information of IP holders and domain name registrants while at the
same time protecting their data (Cross Registry Internet Service Protocol (CRISP) and later on Internet Registry Information Service (IRIS) are the
examples). However, IRIS was technically very difficult to implement. It was not until RDAP was developed and the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted that Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers had to consider instructing
registries and registrars to implement RDAP and its community had to
come up with a privacy-compliant policy.  Overall, a host of
regulatory and market incentives can halt or slow down the
implementation of human-rights-enabling protocols and implementation
could depend on other organizations with their own political and
stakeholder conflicts. Sometimes the protocol is available, but the regulatory framework and
the market do not allow for implementation. 
Sometimes the surrounding context includes 
practical dimensions that are easy to overlook in a purely engineering-focused argument.<a href="#section-4-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-10">
A curious example of this is sanctions regimes that target transactions involving
economically valuable assets.  As a result, sanctions might limit
sanctioned nations' and entities' access to IPv4 resources (because the existence of
a resale market for these addresses causes acquiring them to be
interpreted as buying something of value), though the same consideration
may not apply to IPv6 address resources.  But IPv6 adoption itself
depends on a host of complex factors that are by no means limited to
technical comparisons of the properties of IPv4 and IPv6.  Someone
focused only on technical features of protocols may devise an elegant
solution but be surprised both by deployment challenges and unintended
downstream effects.
Sometimes there are arguments over implementation of a protocol
because as it is perceived, while it can protect freedom of expression
and reduce surveillance, it can hamper other human rights. For
instance, the technical community and some network operators still have doubts about the implementation of DNS over HTTPS,
despite its potential to circumvent 
censorship and its ability to encrypt DNS queries. The arguments against
implementation of DoH include protection of children online and lack
of law enforcement access to data.<a href="#section-4-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-11">We must acknowledge that sometimes the technical solutions that we use
that protect one right (for example, encryption to protect the right to
privacy or to prevent surveillance) could potentially affect technical
and policy solutions that try to protect other human rights (for
example, encryption could prevent financial institutions from
monitoring employees' network activities to detect fraudulent
behavior). Acknowledging and identifying these conflicts can help us
come up with alternative techniques that could protect human rights
while not hampering other technical solutions such as
encryption. Where such alternative techniques are not possible,
acknowledging the shortcoming could clarify and bring to light the
trade-offs that we have accepted in our Internet system.<a href="#section-4-11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-12">Ironically, we advocate for connectivity and believe expressing
oneself on the Internet is a human right, but when a war erupts, we
resort to tools that impact that very concept. For example, some
believe that, by imposing sanctions on critical properties of the Internet,
we can punish the perpetrators of a war. The Regional Internet
Registries that are in charge of registration of IP addresses have
shown resilience to these requests.  However, some tech companies (for
example, Cogent <span>[<a href="#Roth2022">Roth2022</a>]</span>) decided not to serve sanctioned countries
and overcomplied with sanctions. Overcompliance with sanctions could
hamper ordinary people's access to the Internet <span>[<a href="#Badii2023">Badii2023</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-4-12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-13">Perhaps we can solve some of these problems by undertaking a thorough
impact assessment and contextualization to reveal how and why Internet
protocols affect human rights (something Fidler and I argued
for <span>[<a href="#Badii2021">Badii2021</a>]</span>). Contextualization and
impact assessment can reveal how each Internet protocol or each line
of code, in which systems, have an impact on which and whose human
rights.<a href="#section-4-13">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4-14">The HRPC RG (which I am a part of) and the larger human rights and
policy analyst communities are still struggling to analyze legal,
social, and market factors alongside the protocols to have a good
understanding of what has an impact and what has to be changed. It is
hard, but it is not impossible. If we thoroughly document and research

        </h3>
<p id="section-5.1-1">It's not a secret: many governments in the world don't like it when
people encrypt their traffic. More precisely, they like strong
cryptography for themselves but not for others, whether those others
are private citizens or other countries. But the history is longer and
more complex than that.<a href="#section-5.1-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-2">For much of written history, both governments and individuals used
cryptography to protect their messages. To cite just one famous
example, Julius Caesar is said to have encrypted messages by shifting
letters in the alphabet by 3 <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>. In modern parlance, 3 was
the key, and each letter was encrypted with<a href="#section-5.1-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-3">
            C[i] = (P[i] + 3) mod 23<a href="#section-5.1-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-4">(The Latin alphabet of his time had only 23 letters.)
Known
Arabic writings on cryptanalysis go back to at least the 8th century;
their sophistication shows that encryption was reasonably commonly
used. In the 9th century, Abū Yūsuf Yaʻqūb ibn ʼIsḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ 
al-Kindī developed and wrote about frequency analysis as a way to
crack ciphers <span>[<a href="#Borda2011">Borda2011</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.1-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-5">In an era of minimal literacy, though, there wasn't that much use of
encryption, simply because most people could neither read nor
write. Governments used encryption for diplomatic messages, and
cryptanalysts followed close behind. The famed Black Chambers of the
Renaissance era read messages from many different governments, while
early cryptographers devised stronger and stronger ciphers
<span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>. In Elizabethan times in England, Sir Francis Walsingham's
intelligence agency intercepted and decrypted messages from Mary,
Queen of Scots; these messages formed some of the strongest evidence
against her and eventually led to her execution <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.1-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-6">This pattern continued for centuries. In the United States, Thomas
Jefferson invented the so-called wheel cipher in the late 18th
century; it was reinvented about 100 years later by Étienne Bazeries
and used as a standard American military cipher well into World War II
<span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>. Jefferson and other statesmen of the late 18th and early 19th centuries regularly used
cryptography when communicating with each other. An encrypted message
was even part of the evidence introduced in Aaron Burr's 1807 trial
for treason <span>[<a href="#Kerr2020">Kerr2020</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>. Edgar Allan Poe claimed that he
could cryptanalyze any message sent to him <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.1-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-7">The telegraph era upped the ante. In the US, just a year after
Samuel Morse deployed his first telegraph line between Baltimore and
Washington, his business partner, Francis Smith, published a codebook
to help customers protect their traffic from prying eyes
<span>[<a href="#Smith1845">Smith1845</a>]</span>.  In 1870, Britain nationalized its domestic telegraph network;
in response, Robert Slater published a more sophisticated codebook
<span>[<a href="#Slater1870">Slater1870</a>]</span>. On the government side, Britain took advantage of its
position as the central node in the world's international telegraphic
networks to read a great deal of traffic passing through the country
<span>[<a href="#Headrick1991">Headrick1991</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#Kennedy1971">Kennedy1971</a>]</span>. They used this ability strategically,
too -- when war broke out in 1914, the British Navy cut Germany's
undersea telegraph cables, forcing them to use radio; an intercept of
the so-called Zimmermann telegram, when cryptanalyzed, arguably led to
American entry into the war and thence to Germany's defeat. Once the
US entered the war, it required users of international telegraph
lines to deposit copies of the codebooks they used for compression, so
that censors could check messages for prohibited content <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.1-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-8">In Victorian Britain, private citizens, often lovers, used encryption
in newspapers' personal columns to communicate without their parents'
knowledge. Charles Wheatstone and Charles Babbage used to solve these
elementary ciphers routinely for their own amusement <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.1-8">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-9">This pattern continued for many years. Governments regularly used
ciphers and codes, while other countries tried to break them; private
individuals would sometimes use encryption but not often, and rarely
well. But the two World Wars marked a sea change, one that would soon
reverberate into the civilian world.<a href="#section-5.1-9">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-10">The first World War featured vast troop movements by all parties; this
in turn required a lot of encrypted communications, often by telegraph
or radio. These messages were often easily intercepted in
bulk. Furthermore, the difficulty of encrypting large volumes of
plaintext led to the development of a variety of mechanical encryption
devices, including Germany's famed Enigma machine. World War II
amplified both trends. It also gave rise to machine-assisted
cryptanalysis, such as the United Kingdom's bombes (derived from an
earlier Polish design) and Colossus machine, and the American's device
for cracking Japan's PURPLE system. The US also used punch
card-based tabulators to assist in breaking other Japanese codes, such
as the Japanese Imperial Navy's JN-25 <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#Rowlett1998">Rowlett1998</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.1-10">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-11">These developments set the stage for the postwar SIGINT (Signals
Intelligence) environment. Many intragovernmental messages were sent by
radio, making them easy to intercept; advanced cryptanalytic machines
made cryptanalysis easier. Ciphers were getting stronger, though, and
government SIGINT agencies did not want to give up their access to
data. While there were undoubtedly many developments, two are well
known.<a href="#section-5.1-11">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-12">The first involved CryptoAG, a Swedish (and later Swiss) manufacturer
of encryption devices. The head of that company, Boris Hagelin, was a
friend of William F. Friedman, a pioneering American
cryptologist. During the 1950s, CryptoAG sold its devices to other
governments; apparently at Friedman's behest, Hagelin weakened the
encryption in a way that let the NSA read the traffic <span>[<a href="#Miller2020">Miller2020</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.1-12">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.1-13">The story involving the British is less well-documented and less
clear. When some of Britain's former colonies gained their
independence, the British government gave them captured, war-surplus
Enigma machines to protect their own traffic. Some authors contend
that this was deceptive, in that these former colonies did not realize
that the British could read Enigma-protected traffic; others claim
that this was obvious but that these countries didn't care: Britain
was no longer their enemy; it was neighboring countries they were
worried about. Again, though, this concerned governmental use of
encryption <span>[<a href="#Kahn1996">Kahn1996</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#Baldwin2022">Baldwin2022</a>]</span>. There was still little private
use.<a href="#section-5.1-13">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-5.2-1">The modern era of conflict between an individual's desire for privacy and
the government desires to read traffic began around 1972. The grain
harvest in the USSR had failed; since relations between the Soviet
Union and the United States were temporarily comparatively warm, the
Soviet grain company -- an arm of the Soviet government, of
course -- entered into negotiations with private American
companies. Unknown to Americans at the time, Soviet intelligence was
intercepting the phone calls of the American negotiating teams. In
other words, private companies had to deal with state actors as a
threat. Eventually, US intelligence learned of this and came to a
realization: the private sector needed strong cryptography, too, to
protect American national interests <span>[<a href="#Broad1982">Broad1982</a>]</span> <span>[<a href="#Johnson1998">Johnson1998</a>]</span>. This
underscored the need for strong cryptography to protect American
civilian traffic -- but the SIGINT people were unhappy at the thought of
more encryption that they couldn't break.<a href="#section-5.2-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2-2">Meanwhile, the US was concerned about protecting 
unclassified data <span>[<a href="#Landau2014">Landau2014</a>]</span>. In 1973 and again in 1974, the
National Bureau of Standards (NBS) put out a call for a strong, modern
encryption algorithm. IBM submitted Lucifer, an internally developed
algorithm based on what has become known as a 16-round Feistel network. The
original version used a long key.
It seemed quite strong, so NBS sent it off to the NSA to
get their take. The eventual design, which was adopted in 1976 as the
Data Encryption Standard (DES), differed in some important ways from
Lucifer. 
First, the so-called S-boxes, the source of the cryptologic
strength of DES, were changed, and were now demonstrably not composed of
random integers. Many researchers alleged that the S-boxes contained
an NSA back door. It took nearly 20 years for the truth to come out: the
S-boxes were in fact strengthened, not weakened. Most likely, IBM
independently discovered the attack now known as differential
cryptanalysis, though some scholars suspect that the NSA told them
about it. The nonrandom S-boxes protected against this attack. The
second change, though, was clearly insisted on by the NSA: the key size
was shortened, from Lucifer's 112 bits to DES's 56 bits. We now know
that the NSA wanted a 48-bit key size, while IBM wanted 64 bits; they
compromised at 56 bits.<a href="#section-5.2-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2-3">Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, at Stanford University, wondered
about the 56-bit keys. In 1979, they published a paper demonstrating
that the US government, but few others, could afford to build a
brute-force cracking machine, one that could try all 2<sup>56</sup> possible
keys to crack a message. NSA denied tampering with the design; a
Senate investigating committee found that assertion to be correct, but did
not discuss the shortened key length issue.<a href="#section-5.2-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2-4">This, however, was not Diffie and Hellman's greatest contribution to
cryptology. A few years earlier, they had published a paper inventing what
is now known as public key cryptography.
(In fact, public key encryption had been invented a few years earlier
at UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), but they kept their discovery classified until 1997.)
In 1978, Ronald Rivest, Adi
Shamir, and Leonard Adleman devised the RSA algorithm, which made it
usable. (An NSA employee, acting on his own, sent a letter warning
that academic conferences on cryptology might violate US export
laws.)<a href="#section-5.2-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2-5">Around the same time, George Davida at the University of Wisconsin
applied for a patent on a stream cipher; the NSA slapped a secrecy
order on the application. This barred him from even talking about his
invention. The publicity was devastating; the NSA had to back down.<a href="#section-5.2-5">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2-6">The Crypto Wars had thus begun: civilians were inventing strong
encryption systems, and the NSA was tampering with them or trying to
suppress them. Bobby Inman, the then-director of the NSA, tried
creating a voluntary review process for academic papers, but very few
researchers were interested in participating <span>[<a href="#Landau1988">Landau1988</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.2-6">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2-7">There were few major public battles during the 1980s because there
were few new major use cases for civilian cryptography during that
time. There was one notable incident, though: Shamir, Amos Fiat, and
Uriel Feige invented zero-knowledge proofs and applied for a US
patent. In response, the US Army slapped a secrecy order on the
patent. After a great deal of public outrage and intervention by, of
all organizations, the NSA, the order was lifted on very narrow
grounds: the inventors were not American, and they had been discussing
their work all over the world <span>[<a href="#Landau1988">Landau1988</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.2-7">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.2-8">In the 1990s, though, everything changed.<a href="#section-5.2-8">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-5.3-1">There were three major developments in cryptography in the early
1990s. First, Phil Zimmermann released PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a
package to encrypt email messages. In 1993, AT&amp;T planned to release
the TSD-3600, an easy-to-use phone encryptor aimed at business
travelers. Shortly after that, the Netscape Communications Corporation released SSL
(Secure Socket Layer) as a way to enable web-based commerce using
their browser and web server. All of these were seen as threats by the
NSA and the FBI.<a href="#section-5.3-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.3-2">PGP was, at least arguably, covered by what was known as ITAR, the
International Trafficking in Arms Regulations -- under American law,
encryption software was regarded as a weapon, so exports required a
license. It was also alleged to infringe the patents on the RSA
algorithm. Needless to say, both issues were problematic for what was
intended to be open source software. Eventually, the criminal
investigation into Zimmermann's role in the spread of PGP overseas was
dropped, but the threat of such investigations remained to deter
others <span>[<a href="#Levy2001">Levy2001</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.3-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.3-3">The TSD-3600 was another matter. AT&amp;T was a major corporation that did
not want to pick a fight with the US government, but international
business travelers were seen as a major market for the device. At the
government's "request", the DES chip was replaced with what was known
as the Clipper chip. The Clipper chip used Skipjack, a cipher with
80-bit keys; it was thus much stronger against brute-force attacks
than DES. However, it provided "key escrow". Without going into any
details, the key escrow mechanism allowed US government
eavesdroppers to consult a pair of (presumably secure) internal
databases and decrypt all communications protected by the chip. The
Clipper chip proved to be extremely unpopular with industry; that AT&amp;T
Bell Labs' Matt Blaze found a weakness in the design <span>[<a href="#Blaze1994">Blaze1994</a>]</span>, one
that let you use Skipjack without the key escrow feature, didn't help
its reputation.<a href="#section-5.3-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.3-4">The third major development, SSL, was even trickier. SSL was aimed at
e-commerce, and of course Netscape wanted to be able to sell its
products outside the US. That would require an export license, so they
made a deal with the government: non-American users would receive a
version that used 40-bit keys, a key length far shorter than what the
NSA had agreed to 20 years earlier. (To get ahead of the story: there
was a compromise mode of operation, wherein an export-grade browser
could use strong encryption when talking to a financial
institution. This hybrid mode led to cryptographic weaknesses
discovered some 20 years later <span>[<a href="#Adrian2015">Adrian2015</a>]</span>.)<a href="#section-5.3-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.3-5">Technologists and American industry pushed back. The IETF adopted the
Danvers Doctrine, described in <span>[<a href="#RFC3365">RFC3365</a>]</span>:<a href="#section-5.3-5">¶</a></p>
<blockquote id="section-5.3-6">
          <p id="section-5.3-6.1">At the 32cd [sic] IETF held in Danvers, Massachusetts during April of 1995
the IESG asked the plenary for a consensus on the strength of security
that should be provided by IETF standards.  Although the immediate
issue before the IETF was whether or not to support "export" grade
security (which is to say weak security) in standards the question
raised the generic issue of security in general.<a href="#section-5.3-6.1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.3-6.2">The overwhelming consensus was that the IETF should standardize on the
use of the best security available, regardless of national policies.
This consensus is often referred to as the "Danvers Doctrine".<a href="#section-5.3-6.2">¶</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="section-5.3-7">Then American companies started losing business to their overseas
competitors, who did not have to comply with US export laws. All of
this led to what seemed like a happy conclusion: the US government
drastically loosened its export rules for cryptographic software. All
was well -- or so it seemed...<a href="#section-5.3-7">¶</a></p>

        </h3>
<p id="section-5.5-1">Signal intelligence agencies, not just the NSA, but its peers around
the globe -- most major countries have their own -- are not going to go
away. The challenges that have beset the NSA are common to all such
agencies, and their solutions are likely the same. The question is
what should be done to protect individual privacy. A number of strong
democracies, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, are, in
a resumption of the Crypto Wars,
moving to restrict encryption. Spurred on by complaints from the FBI
and other law enforcement agencies, the US Congress frequently
considers bills to do the same.<a href="#section-5.5-1">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.5-2">The IETF has long had a commitment to strong, ubiquitous
encryption. This is a good thing. It needs to continue, with
cryptography and other security features designed into protocols from
the beginning. But there is also a need for maintenance. Parameters
such as key lengths and modulus sizes age; a value that is acceptable
today may not be 10 years hence. (We've already seen apparent problems
from 1024-bit moduli specified in an RFC, an RFC that was not modified
when technology improved enough that attacking encryption based on
them had become feasible <span>[<a href="#Adrian2015">Adrian2015</a>]</span>.) The IETF can do nothing about
the code that vendors ship or that sites use, but it can alert the
world that it thinks things have changed.<a href="#section-5.5-2">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.5-3">Cryptoagility is of increasing importance. In the next very few years,
we will have so-called post-quantum algorithms. Both protocols and key
lengths will need to change, perhaps drastically. Is the IETF ready?
What will happen to, say, DNSSEC if key lengths become drastically
longer? Backwards compatibility will remain important, but that, of
course, opens the door to other attacks. We've long thought about
them; we need to be sure that our mechanisms work -- we've
been surprised in the past <span>[<a href="#BellovinRescorla2006">BellovinRescorla2006</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-5.5-3">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.5-4">We also need to worry more about metadata. General Michael Hayden,
former director of both the NSA and the CIA, once remarked, "We kill
people based on metadata" <span>[<a href="#Ferran2014">Ferran2014</a>]</span>. But caution is necessary;
attempts to hide metadata can have side effects. To give a trivial
example, Tor is quite strong, but if your exit node is in a different
country than you are in, web sites that use IP geolocation may present
their content in a language foreign to you.
Some sites even block connections from known Tor exit nodes.
More generally, many
attempts to hide metadata involve trusting a different party; that
party may turn out to be untrustworthy or it may itself become a
target of attack. As another prominent IETFer has remarked,
"Insecurity is like entropy; you can't destroy it, but you can move it
around." The IETF has done a lot; it needs to do more. And remember
that the risk here is not just governments acting directly, it's also
private companies that collect the data and sell it to all comers.<a href="#section-5.5-4">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5.5-5">Finally, the IETF must remember that its middle name is
"Engineering". To me, one of the attributes of engineering is the art
of picking the right solution in an over-constrained
environment. Intelligence agencies won't go away, nor will national
restrictions on cryptography. We have to pick the right path while
staying true to our principles.<a href="#section-5.5-5">¶</a></p>

<p>About a year ago, I raised a red flag with colleagues and managers about Postgres performance. Our database was struggling to keep up with the load generated by our monolithic SaaS application. CPU utilization was riding between 60 and 80%, and at least once it spiked to 100%, causing a brief outage.</p>



<p>Now, we had been kicking the can down the road with respect to Postgres capacity for a long time. When the database looked too busy, we’d replace it with a bigger instance and move on. This saved us a lot of time and allowed us to focus on other things, like building features, which was great.</p>



<p>But this time, it wasn’t possible to scale the DB server vertically: we were already on the biggest instance. And we were about to overload that instance.</p>



<p>Lots of schemes were floated. Foremost among them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Shard writes.</strong> Spin up a cluster of independent databases, and write data to one or the other according to some partitioning strategy.</li>



<li><strong>Do micro-services.</strong> Split up the monolith into multiple interconnected services, each with its own data store that could be scaled on its own terms.</li>
</ul>



<p>Both of these options are cool! A strong case can be made for either one on its merits. With write sharding, we could potentially increase our capacity by 2 or even 3 orders of magnitude. With micro-services, we’d be free to use “the right tool for the job,” picking data stores optimized to the requirements of each service workload. Either branch of the skill tree would offer exciting options for fault tolerance and operational resilience.</p>



<p>Either way, everyone had to agree: we’d outgrown our old, naïve implementation. Onward and upward! We can do hard things!</p>



<p>In situations like this, presented with a dazzling array of next-generation architecture options that can be built to last us through the decade, it’s easy to forget what our goal was: to get database performance under control.</p>



<h2>Complexity costs attention.</h2>



<p>Sometimes, leaps in complexity must be made. It’s generally a good problem to have. If enough demand is being placed on your system to render obsolete your existing technology, then even more growth is probably on the horizon! If you can just put in the investment and build the more advanced architecture now, then you’ll be looking at a bright future of unconstrained year-over-year success.</p>



<p>But don’t just consider the implementation cost. The real cost of increased complexity – often the much larger cost – is attention.</p>



<p>If you decide to shard across databases, then not only must you pay the money-, time-, and opportunity cost of building out the new architecture: <em>you must also take the new complexity into account in every subsequent technical decision</em>. Want to shard writes? Fine, but this complicates every future decision about backups, monitoring, migrations, the ORM, and network topology (just to name a few). And don’t get me started on micro-services.</p>



<p>Just think about how massive these costs are. How much feature delivery will have to be delayed or foregone to support the additional architectural complexity?</p>



<h2>Always squeeze first</h2>



<p>We should always put off significant complexity increases as long as possible.</p>



<p>When complexity leaps are on the table, there’s usually also an opportunity to <strong>squeeze</strong> some extra juice out of the system you have. By tweaking the workload, tuning performance, or supplementing the system in some way, you may be able to add months or even years of runway. When viable, these options are always preferable to building out a next-gen system.</p>



<p>Let’s return to the example of the overloaded Postgres instance. In that case, what we ended up doing was twofold:</p>



<ol>
<li>Two engineers (me and my colleague Ted – but mostly Ted) spent about 3 months working primarily on database performance issues. There was no silver bullet. We used our telemetry to identify heavy queries, dug into the (Rails) codebase to understand where they were coming from, and optimized or eliminated them. We also tuned a lot of Postgres settings.</li>



<li>Two more engineers cut a path through the codebase to run certain expensive read-only queries on a replica DB. This effort bore fruit around the same time as (1), when we offloaded our single most frequent query (a <code>SELECT</code> triggered by polling web clients).</li>
</ol>



<p>These two efforts together reduced the maximum weekly CPU usage on the database from 90% to 30%.</p>



<p>Now we can sleep at night. We have a huge amount of room to grow, both in terms of CPU headroom and our ability to shed load from the primary. And furthermore, since our work touched many parts of the codebase and demanded collaboration with lots of different devs, we now have a strong distributed knowledge base about the existing system. We’re well positioned to squeeze it even more if need be.</p>



<h2>This doesn’t mean complexity is bad</h2>



<p>Of course, I’m not saying complexity is bad. It’s necessary. Some day we’ll reach a fundamental limit of our database architecture, and before that day arrives, we’ll need to make a jump in complexity.</p>



<p>But until then, because we <strong>squeezed first</strong>, we get to keep working with the most boring system possible. This is by far the cheaper and more practical option.</p>
