        <p>In 1904, a widow named <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=journal_articles">Elizabeth Peck</a> had her portrait taken at a studio in a small Iowa town. The photographer sold the negatives to Duffy’s Pure Malt Whiskey, a company that avoided liquor taxes for years by <a href="https://digitalchicagohistory.org/items/show/677">falsely advertising</a> its product as medicinal. Duffy’s ads claimed the fantastical: that it cured everything from influenza to consumption, that it was endorsed by clergymen, that it could help you live until the age of 106. The portrait of Peck ended up in one of these <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/214/185">dubious ads</a>, published in newspapers across the country alongside what appeared to be her <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-spokane-press-too-funny-to-not-clip/32975454/">unqualified praise</a>: “After years of constant use of your Pure Malt Whiskey, both by myself and as given to patients in my capacity as nurse, I have no hesitation in recommending it.”</p>

<p>Duffy’s lies were numerous. Peck (misleadingly identified as “Mrs. A. Schuman”) was not a nurse, and she had not spent years constantly slinging back malt beverages. In fact, she fully abstained from alcohol. Peck never consented to the ad.</p>

<p>The camera’s first great age—which began in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/invention-snapshot-changed-way-we-viewed-world-180952435/">1888</a> when <a href="https://www.kodak.com/en/company/page/george-eastman-history/">George Eastman</a> debuted the Kodak—is full of stories like this one. Beyond the wonders of a quickly developing art form and technology lay widespread lack of control over one’s own image, perverse incentives to make a quick buck, and generalized fear at the prospect of humiliation and the invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>Prior to 1888, cameras often existed in a realm of mystical unknowability. In one famed <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/490042?searchText=&amp;searchUri=&amp;ab_segments=&amp;searchKey=&amp;refreqid=fastly-default%3A4f12142dae9e22e72de48c8194abc75c">story</a> from the early days of photography, a man asks for a picture of his recently buried wife, not understanding that someone must be present in order to be photographed. The French writer Honoré de Balzac <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2018/09/pre-civil-war-photographic-technologies-the-calotype-and-daguerreotype/">confessed</a> to fearing that each time a daguerreotype was taken of him, a layer of his skin would be peeled off. Early cameras required a level of technical mastery that evoked mystery—a scientific instrument understood only by professionals.</p>

<p>All of that changed when Eastman invented flexible roll film and debuted the first Kodak camera. Instead of developing their own pictures, customers could mail their devices to the Kodak factory and have their rolls of film developed, printed, and replaced. “You press the button,” Kodak ads <a href="https://www.cameramuseum.ch/en/discover/permanent-exhibition/the-century-of-the-film/you-press-the-button-we-do-the-rest/">promised</a>, “we do the rest.” This leap from obscure science to streamlined service forever transformed the nature of looking and being looked at.</p>

<p>By 1905, less than 20 years after the first Kodak camera debuted, Eastman’s company had <a href="https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/1967/">sold</a> 1.2 million devices and persuaded nearly a third of the United States’ population to take up photography. Kodak’s record-setting yearly ad spending—$750,000 by the end of the 19th century (roughly $28 million in today’s dollars)—and the rapture of a technology that scratched a timeless itch facilitated the onset of a new kind of mass exposure.</p>

<p>“The impulse to peer into others’ affairs—an age-old feature of village life—had never actually subsided,” writes historian <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/sarah-igo/">Sarah E. Igo</a> in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/4cq10GK"><em>The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America</em></a></em>. Photography became such a phenomenon that “<a href="https://historicpittsburgh.org/islandora/object/pitt:20100623-ocl-1093">Kodak fiends</a>,” a phrase used to describe those seduced by the devilish pleasures of photography, entered the vernacular.</p>

<p>No one quite knew what to make of or how to control the fiendishness, and privacy was further unspooled by money-making schemes just as ferociously inventive as the new technology.</p>

<p>The same year Kodak cameras hit the marketplace, the<em> </em><a href="https://bklyn.newspapers.com/article/the-brooklyn-daily-eagle/1768668/"><em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em></a><em> </em>reported that Anthony Comstock—the anti-obscenity crusader after whom the 1873 <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/comstock-act-transform-abortion-debate-180982363/">Comstock Act</a> is named—had arrested an amateur photographer for selling manually photoshopped pictures that placed “the heads of innocent women on the undraped bodies of other females.” In 1890, a mugshot photographer for the New York Police Department was fired for selling copies of the mugshots to arrestees themselves—an arrangement the<em> </em><a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/03/106040745.html?pageNumber=15"><em>New York Times</em></a> described as a “lucrative business.” Boundless <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-camera-introduced-americans-their-heroines-180972526/">fascination</a> with photographs <a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/379994">created</a> a bustling economy. People bought and collected random photographs from dry goods stores, general junk shops, vending machines and even cigarette packs. Demand was so robust that amateurs were just as able to sell to this market as professionals.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of advertising by the end of the 19th century only intensified this demand. “As the growth in productive capacity outpaced the needs of the population, commercial entrepreneurs became obsessed with creating demand for consumer products,” writes historian <a href="https://www.law.buffalo.edu/faculty/facultyDirectory/barbasSamantha.html">Samantha Barbas</a> in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3W89759">Laws of Image: Privacy and Publicity in America</a></em>. “The key agent in this project was advertising.”</p>

<p>By 1900, photography began to replace earlier image-making methods as the ad technology of choice. Photos of women were especially desirable, given their association with respectability and the belief that a pretty face could sell anything. But dominant values around modesty, avoiding indulgence and anti-consumerism meant that most people had no desire to be featured in an advertisement. Commercial modeling and stock photos did not yet exist. Faced with few choices, advertisers resorted to backdoor purchases. In an arrangement Barbas dubs “the crisis of the ‘circulating portrait,’” advertisers began buying portraits from photographers without the permission of the photos’ subjects—as was the case with Peck, temperate widow turned whiskey hound by the magic and obfuscation of advertising.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just ordinary people who found themselves newly exposed. Mass photography was an equalizer twice over: Nearly anybody could use a camera, and nearly anybody might be violated by one. To their grave displeasure, even the elite were unable to assert control over the frenzy. The <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/12/101988760.html?pageNumber=6"><em>New York Times</em></a> reported that President Theodore Roosevelt was “known to exhibit impatience on discovering designs to Kodak him”; the same column mentioned that Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt horsewhipped a man he alleged took a picture of him without permission.</p>

<p>Though newspapers across the country <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2712965">cautioned</a> Americans to “beware the Kodak,” as the cameras were “deadly weapons” and “deadly little boxes,” many were also primary facilitators of the craze. The perfection of halftone printing coincided with the rise of the Kodak and allowed for the mass circulation of images. Newly empowered, newspapers regularly published paparazzi pictures of famous people taken without their knowledge, paying twice as much for them as they did for consensual photos taken in a studio.</p>

<p>Lawmakers and judges responded to the crisis clumsily. Suing for libel was usually the only remedy available to the overexposed. But libel law did not protect against your likeness being taken or used without your permission unless the violation was also defamatory in some way. Though results were middling, one failed lawsuit gained enough notoriety to channel cross-class feelings of exposure into action. A teenage girl named <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/memmott/2019/01/15/abigail-roberson-privacy/2577870002/">Abigail Roberson</a> noticed her face on a neighbor’s bag of flour, only to learn that the Franklin Mills Flour Company had used her likeness in an ad that had been plastered 25,000 times all over her hometown.</p>

<p>After suffering intense shock and being temporarily bedridden, she sued. In 1902, the New York Court of Appeals rejected her claims and held that the right to privacy did not exist in common law. It based its decision in part on the assertion that the image was not libelous; Chief Justice Alton B. Parker wrote that the photo was “a very good one” that others might even regard as a “compliment to their beauty.” The humiliation, the lack of control over her own image, the unwanted fame—none of that amounted to any sort of actionable claim.</p>

<p>Public outcry at the decision reached a fever pitch, and newspapers <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/democrat-and-chronicle/23312379/">filled</a> <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/democrat-and-chronicle/23312417/">their pages</a> with editorial indignation. In its first legislative session following the court’s decision and the ensuing outrage, the New York state legislature <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3414&amp;context=faculty_scholarship">made history</a> by adopting a narrow “right to privacy,” which prohibited the use of someone’s likeness in advertising or trade without their written consent. Soon after, the Supreme Court of Georgia became the first to <a href="https://casetext.com/case/pavesich-v-new-england-life-ins-co">recognize</a> this category of privacy claim. Eventually, just about every state court in the country followed Georgia’s lead. The early uses and abuses of the Kodak helped cobble together a right that centered on profiting from the exploitation of someone’s likeness, rather than the exploitation itself.</p>

<p>Not long after asserting that no right to privacy exists in common law, and while campaigning to be the Democratic nominee for president, Parker told the Associated Press, “I reserve the right to put my hands in my pockets and assume comfortable attitudes without being everlastingly afraid that I shall be snapped by some fellow with a camera.” Roberson publicly took him to task over his hypocrisy, <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/07/27/117944284.html?pageNumber=1">writing</a>, “I take this opportunity to remind you that you have no such right.” She was correct then, and she still would be today. The question of whether anyone has the right to be free from exposure and its many humiliations lingers, intensified but unresolved. The law—that reactive, slow thing—never quite catches up to technology, whether it’s been given one year or 100.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p><ctime>03 Jun 2022</ctime></p>
<p><code>strlcpy(3)</code> is an OpenBSD function which is often hailed as a safer
replacement for <code>strcpy(3)</code> and/or <code>strncpy(3)</code>. One of the obvious issues with
strlcpy is that it's not safe if <code>src</code> isn't null-terminated. However, that's
not the reason I don't like strlcpy. In fact despite knowing this, I used to
think it was an okay function and better than the (thought of) alternative
<code>strncpy</code> (which doesn't null-terminate in case of truncation).</p>
<p>The reason why I'm not a fan of it is because I've recently revisited this
<a href="https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00053.html">old thread</a>
where Ulrich Drepper rejects the proposal to add strlcpy to glibc.
His reasoning was:</p>
<ul>
<li>strlcpy is inefficient (which is unarguably true).</li>
<li>Anyone who has thought about the problem for a single second wouldn't use strlcpy
(<a href="https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2000-08/msg00061.html">paraphrased</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So I decided to spent a single second thinking about the problem and realized
that yup, there's no reason to be using strlcpy.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-is-the-problem">What exactly is the problem?<a href="#what-exactly-is-the-problem"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>In order to understand why a solution isn't good or optimal, one first needs to
properly understand what the problem actually is. The problem we have in our
hands is that we're trying to copy a "c-string" or a "null-terminated string"
<sup><a id="info-src-0" href="#info-ref-0"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg" width="12px"></a></sup>.</p>
<p>This problem can be divided into two main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cases where truncation matters.</li>
<li>Cases where truncation doesn't matter.</li>
</ol>
<hr><div id="info-ref-0"><p><a href="#info-src-0"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg"></a></p><p>Strictly speaking, the C standard <a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.html#7.1.1">defines a string as</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A string is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including
the first null character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the term "null-terminated string" is redundant since if it isn't
null-terminated, it's not a string according to the C standard.</p>
</div><hr>
<h2 id="truncation-doesn-t-matter">Truncation doesn't matter<a href="#truncation-doesn-t-matter"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>There are many cases where truncation doesn't matter. For example, if we're
trying to display the result on some statusbar which can only hold, let's say 64
bytes, then not only is the <code>src</code> string getting truncated is not an issue,
it's actually wanted since it makes no sense to copy more than that.</p>
<p>So assuming <code>buf</code> is a fixed length array, <code>char buf[64]</code>; an strlcpy call would
look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>strlcpy(buf, src, sizeof buf);
</code></pre>
<p>If you spend a single second thinking about what you've just done, you'd realize
that this is a horribly inefficient solution to the problem at hand. Since
strlcpy returns <code>strlen(src)</code>, and <code>src</code> might very well be let's say a
thousands byte long. By using strlcpy, you are going though all of those bytes
in a O(n) strlen call for absolutely no reason when all you really cared about
is the first 64 bytes of <code>src</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>strncpy(3)</code> is also not a good solution in this case because:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>It doesn't null-terminate in case of truncation.</li>
<li>It unnecessarily pads the rest of <code>dst</code> with 0 in case <code>src</code> length happens
to be less than <code>dst</code> length.</li>
</ol>
<p>A much better solution here is using <code>memccpy(3)</code> instead, which will only scan
the first 64 bytes of <code>src</code> at most and nothing past that:</p>
<pre><code>if (memccpy(buf, src, '\0', sizeof buf) == NULL)
    buf[sizeof buf - 1] = '\0'; /* truncation occured, null-terminate manually. */
</code></pre>
<p>And in case you're worried about this being two-liners as opposed to a
one-liner strlcpy call (which is a valid criticism, as that can open up room
for making mistake), then you can (and should) simply turn this two liner into
a wrapper function. Optionally giving it a <code>_trunc</code> prefix to make it clear
that truncation is desired here.</p>
<pre><code>mystrcpy_trunc(buf, src, sizeof buf);
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is this more efficient, it makes it clear that truncation is desired
here just by looking at the function name. Whereas in the case of an unchecked
<code>strlcpy</code> call it's not immediately obvious weather truncation is desired or
the programmer forgot to check for it.</p>
<!-- 	void -->
<!-- 	my_strncpy(char *d, const char *s, size_t n) -->
<!-- 	{ -->
<!-- 		if (memccpy(d, s, '\0', n) == NULL) -->
<!-- 			d[n - 1] = '\0'; -->
<!-- 	} -->
<h2 id="truncation-matters">Truncation matters<a href="#truncation-matters"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>In cases where truncation matters, for example file-path, url etc, you simply
<strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> be using a fixed size buffer. You have to be able to do dynamic
allocation and grow the buffer as needed.</p>
<p>The most simplest way of achieving this is just using <code>strdup(3)</code>, which will do
the allocation for us:</p>
<pre><code>char *s = strdup(src);
if (s == NULL)
    return ERROR;
/* do stuff with s */
free(s); /* don't forget to free */
</code></pre>
<p>And in case you already have an allocated buffer and you'd like to reuse it, the
following is what an strlcpy usage would looks like; assuming <code>char *dbuf</code> is a
buffer that's been allocated <code>size_t dbuflen</code> bytes via <code>malloc(3)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>size_t srclen = strlcpy(dbuf, src, dbuflen) + 1;
if (srclen &gt; dbuflen) {
    char *tmp = realloc(dbuf, srclen);
    if (tmp == NULL) {
        free(dbuf);
        return ERROR;
    }
    dbuf = tmp;
    dbuflen = srclen;
    strlcpy(dbuf, src, dbuflen);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's ignore just how inefficient this is for the moment, instead I'd like to
point out just how schizo this entire logic is:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hmm yes, let me just start copying this string without knowing if it's going
to fit inside my buffer or not."</li>
<li>"Oh shit, it didn't fit. Let me just readjust the buffer and restart the copy
entirely."</li>
</ul>
<p>A much better solution here is to just use <code>strlen(3)</code> and <code>memcpy(3)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>size_t srclen = strlen(src) + 1;
if (srclen &gt; dbuflen) {
    void *tmp = realloc(dbuf, srclen);
    if (tmp == NULL) {
        free(dbuf);
        return ERROR;
    }
    dbuf = tmp;
    dbuflen = srclen;
}
memcpy(dbuf, src, srclen);
</code></pre>
<p>This version is far more efficient than the strlcpy version. But more
importantly, the logic here is much more sane and natural:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's find out how big the <code>src</code> is.</li>
<li>If it doesn't fit then grow the buffer.</li>
<li>Then copy everything over.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="truncation-matters-but-i-m-stuck-with-a-fixed-size-buffer">Truncation matters, but I'm stuck with a fixed size buffer<a href="#truncation-matters-but-i-m-stuck-with-a-fixed-size-buffer"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>Let's not talk about how you got yourself into this situation, but instead let's
talk about what you can actually do here. And pretty much the only thing you
<em>can</em> do here, is to error out if <code>src</code> happens to be bigger than your buffer.</p>
<p>The following would be the strlcpy implementation:</p>
<pre><code>if (strlcpy(buf, src, sizeof buf) &gt;= sizeof buf)
    return ERROR; /* or call exit/abort if appropriate */
</code></pre>
<p>And once again, this is horribly inefficient because we don't want to know the
exact length of <code>src</code>, we only want to know if it's bigger than our buffer size
or not.</p>
<p>A much better way to do that is, once again, using memccpy. Which is not only
much faster than strlcpy, it actually makes much more logical sense for what
we're trying to do, as it won't scan <code>src</code> for more than <code>sizeof buf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if (memccpy(buf, src, '\0', sizeof buf) == NULL)
    return ERROR; /* truncation */
</code></pre>
<h2 id="b-but-using-mem-functions-on-string-is-bad">B-but using mem* functions on string is... bad!<a href="#b-but-using-mem-functions-on-string-is-bad"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>The <code>mem</code> and <code>str</code> prefix is often a source of confusion for amateur
programmers who get tricked into thinking that you MUST use only <code>str*</code>
functions on strings.</p>
<p>In case you've forgotten what a (c-)string is, it's nothing more than an array
of bytes terminated by a null character. Any attempt of trying to think of them
as anything else is going to result in error sooner or later because the
programmer has a fundamental misunderstanding of what a string even is.</p>
<p>Moreover, where exactly are these <code>mem*</code> functions declared? Let's take a look
at the manpage:</p>
<pre><code>$ man 3 memccpy
SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's take a look at what the <a href="https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.html#7.21">C standard</a>
has to say about <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The header string.h declares one type and several functions, and defines one
macro useful for manipulating arrays of character type and other objects
treated as arrays of character type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, there's nothing "improper", "bad practice", "code-smell" or
whatever with using the <code>mem*</code> family of functions for operating on strings,
because strings are just an array of (null-terminated) characters afterall.</p>
<p>One other criticism of this article might be that <code>memccpy(3)</code> and <code>strdup(3)</code>,
while defined in POSIX, is not defined in the ISO C standard <sup><a id="info-src-1" href="#info-ref-1"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg" width="12px"></a></sup>. But this
argument makes no sense because <code>strlcpy(3)</code> is defined in neither, and in
practice is less portable as well.</p>
<hr><div id="info-ref-1"><p><a href="#info-src-1"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/info.svg"></a></p><p>Both <code>memccpy</code> and <code>strdup</code> have been accepted into the
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/23">C2x draft</a>.</p>
</div><hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"><img src="https://nrk.neocities.org/assets/chain.svg"></a></h2>
<p>In the end, I'm unable to find a situation where <code>strlcpy</code> makes sense. In pretty
much all the cases, I'd much rather use <code>memccpy</code>, <code>memcpy</code> or <code>strdup</code> instead.
So needless to say, I'm not a fan of <code>strlcpy</code>.</p>

At the
2024 <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/">Linux Storage,
Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit</a>, Wedson Almeida Filho and
Kent Overstreet led a combined storage and filesystem session on using Rust
for Linux filesystems. Back in December 2023, Almeida had <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20231018122518.128049-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">posted
an RFC patch set</a> with
some Rust abstractions for filesystems, which resulted in <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958072/">some disagreement over the approach</a>.  On the
same mid-May day as the session, he <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240514131711.379322-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">posted</a>
a second version of the RFC patches, which he wanted to discuss along with
other Rust-related topics.
</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<p>
After updating attendees on the status of his patches, Almeida listed some
of the goals of the <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">Rust-for-Linux
project</a>, which are embodied in the filesystem abstractions that he is proposing.  The first is to express more of the requirements using Rust's
type system in order to catch more mistakes at compile time.  In addition,
the project's developers want to automate some tasks, such as cleaning up
resources, in ways that are not easily
available to C code. The overall idea is to have a more productive
filesystem-development experience, with less time spent on debugging
problems that the compiler could find, and with fewer memory-related
vulnerabilities overall.
</p>

</a></p><p>
Overstreet said that he had been a part of too many two-week bug hunts and
has been trying to find ways to avoid those kinds of problems for bcachefs.
The Rust language provides a lot more than what he can do in C; it
eliminates undefined behavior and provides facilities to see what is happening
inside the code. "You can't debug, if you can't see what's going on."  He
believes that kernel development "will get a whole lot easier over the
coming decades" due to using Rust.  It will be possible to prove the
correctness of code written in Rust, which will mean that bugs that can derail
feature development will be much less common.
</p>

<p>
From his <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dflxtAojRu3mdx19oBHP3vXCXI1vocFIVc5jVaf9FLA/">slides</a>,
Almeida showed an example of how the Rust type system can eliminate certain
kinds of errors.  He noted that the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.5/source/fs/inode.c#L1248"><tt>iget_locked()</tt></a>
function in current kernels has a complicated set of requirements.  Callers
must check to see if the return value is null and, if it is not, then the
contents of the returned <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.5/source/include/linux/fs.h#L632"><tt>struct&nbsp;inode</tt></a>
need to be checked to see if it is a new or existing inode. If it is new,
it needs to be initialized before it can be used; if that fails, <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9.5/source/fs/bad_inode.c#L244"><tt>iget_failed()</tt></a>
needs to be called, he said.
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of the finer points of what callers of
<tt>iget_locked()</tt> need to do, with Al Viro disagreeing with some of
what Almeida had on his slide.  That went back and forth, with Overstreet
observing that it was exactly that kind of discussion/argument that could
be avoided by encapsulating the rules into the Rust types and abstractions;
the compiler will know the right thing to do.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>
Overstreet noted that Christian
Brauner and Alice Ryhl have helped to improve the abstractions a great deal
since the first posting; in particular, there are things he has learned
about reference counts based on how they are being handled by the Rust
code. "This is going to make all our lives so much easier", Overstreet said.
</p>

<p>
Almeida put up a slide with the equivalent of <tt>iget_locked()</tt> in
Rust, which was called <tt>get_or_create_inode()</tt>.  The important part
is the return type, he said; as with C, callers must check for failure, but
the success case is much different.  If it is successful, the caller either
receives a regular reference-counted inode to use (which has its reference
count automatically decremented when the inode object is no longer
referenced) or it receives  
a new inode, which will 
automatically call the equivalent of <tt>iget_failed()</tt> if it is never initialized.  If
it is ever initialized (which can only be done once), it becomes a regular
inode with the automatic 
reference-count decrement.  All of that is enforced through the type system.
</p>

<p>
Viro seemed somewhat skeptical of how that would work in practice.  He wondered
where in the source code those constraints would be defined.  Almeida said
that the whole idea is to determine what the constraints are from Viro and
other filesystem developers, then to create types and abstractions that can
enforce them.
</p>

<h4>Disconnect</h4>

<p>
Dave Chinner asked about the disconnect between the names in the C API and
the Rust API, which means that developers cannot look at the C code and
know what the equivalent Rust call would be.  He said that the same names
should be used or it would all be completely unfamiliar to the existing
development community.  In addition, when the C code changes, the Rust code
needs to follow along, but who is going to do that work?  Almeida agreed
that it was something that needs to be discussed.
</p>

<p>
As far as the renamed functions goes, he is not opposed to switching the
names to match the C API, but does not think <tt>iget_locked()</tt> is a
particularly good name.  It might make sense to take the opportunity to
create better names. 
</p>

<p>
There was some more discussion of the example, with Viro saying that it was
not a good choice because <tt>iget_locked()</tt> is a library function,
rather than a member function of the superblock object.  Almeida said that
there was no reason <tt>get_or_create_inode()</tt> could not be turned into
a library function; his example was simply meant to show how the
constraints could be encoded in the types.
</p>

<p>
Brauner said that there needs to be a decision on whether the Rust
abstractions are going to be general-purpose, intended for all kernel
filesystems,  or if they will only be focused on the
functionality needed for the simpler filesystems that have been written in Rust.  There is also a longer-term problem in handling
situations where functions like <tt>get_or_create_inode()</tt> encode a lot
more of the constraints than <tt>iget_locked()</tt> does.  As the C code
evolves, which will happen more quickly than with the Rust code, at least
initially, there will be a need to keep the two APIs in sync.
</p>

<p>
It comes down to a question of whether refactoring and cleanup will be done
as part of adding the Rust abstractions, Overstreet said; he strongly
believes that is required. But there is more to it than just that, James
Bottomley said.  The object lifecycles are being encoded into the Rust API,
but there is no equivalent of that in C; if someone changes the lifecycle
of the object on one side, the other will have bugs.
</p>

<p>
There are also problems because the lifecycle of inode objects is
sometimes filesystem-specific, Chinner said. Encoding a single lifecycle understanding
into the API means that its functions will not work for some filesystems.
Overstreet said that filesystems which are not using the VFS API would
simply not benefit, but Chinner said that a VFS inode is just a structure
and it is up to filesystems to manage its lifetime.
Almeida said that the example would only be used by filesystems that
currently call <tt>iget_locked()</tt> and could benefit.  The Rust
developers are not trying to force filesystems to change how they are doing
things. 
</p>

<h4>Allocating pain</h4>

<p>
Part of the problem, Ted Ts'o said, is that there is an effort to get
"everyone to switch over to the religion" of Rust; that will not happen, he
said, because there are 50+ different filesystems in Linux that will not be
instantaneously converted.  The C code will continue to be improved and if
that breaks the Rust bindings, it will break the filesystems that depend on
them. For the foreseeable future, the Rust bindings are a second-class
citizen, he said; broken Rust bindings are a problem for the
Rust-for-Linux developers and not the filesystem community at large.
</p>

<p>
He suggested that the development of the Rust bindings continue, while the
C code continues to evolve.  As those changes occur, "we will find out
whether or not
this concept of encoding huge amounts of semantics into the type system is
a good thing or a bad thing".  In a year or two, he thinks the answer to that will become
clear; really, though, it will come down to a question of "where does the
pain get allocated".  In his mind, large-scale changes like this almost always come down to a
"pain-allocation question". 
</p>

<p>
Almeida said that he is not trying to keep the C API static; his goal is
to get the filesystem developers to explain the semantics of the API so
that they can be encoded into Rust.  Bottomley said that as more of those
semantics get encoded into the bindings, they will become more fragile from
a synchronization standpoint.
Several disagreed with that, in the form of a jumble of "no" replies and
the like. Almeida said that it was the same with any user of an API; if the
API changes, the users need to be updated.  But Ts'o pointedly said that
not everyone will learn Rust; if he makes a change, he will fix all of the
affected C code, but, "because I don't know Rust, I am not going to fix the Rust
bindings, sorry".
</p>

<p>
Viro came back to his objections about the proposed replacement for
<tt>iget_locked()</tt>.  The underlying problem that he sees is the
reliance on methods versus functions; using methods is not the proper way
forward because the arguments are not specified explicitly.  But Overstreet
said that the complaints about methods come from 
languages like C++ that rely too heavily on inheritance, which is "a crap
idea".  Rust does not do so; methods in Rust are largely just a syntactical
element. 
</p>

<p>
There was some discussion of what exactly is being encoded in the types.
Jan Kara said that there is some behavior that goes with the inode, such as
its reference count and its handling, but there is other behavior that is
inherent in the 
<tt>iget_locked()</tt> function.  Overstreet and Almeida said that those
two pieces were both encoded into the types, but separately; other
functions using the inode type could have return values with different
properties. 
</p>

<p>
Viro went through some of his reasoning about why inodes work the way they
do in the VFS.  He agreed with the idea of starting small to see where
things lead.  Overstreet suggested that maybe the example used was not a
good starting point, "because this is the complicated case". "Oh, no it
isn't", Viro replied to laughter as the session concluded.

<p>As part of the wider tech industry's wider push for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/artificial-intelligence" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>, whether we want it or not, it seems that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google">Google</a>'s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/google-launches-gemini-its-newest-and-most-capable-ai-model-and-a-full-frontal-assault-on-openais-gpt-4" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/google-launches-gemini-its-newest-and-most-capable-ai-model-and-a-full-frontal-assault-on-openais-gpt-4">Gemini AI</a> service is now reading private Drive documents without express user permission, per a report from Kevin Bankster on Twitter embedded below. While Bankster goes on to discuss reasons why this may be glitched for users like him in particular, the utter lack of control being given over his sensitive, private information is unacceptable for a company of Google's stature —and does not bode well for future privacy concerns amongst AI's often-forced rollout.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just pulled up my tax return in @Google Docs--and unbidden, Gemini summarized it. So...Gemini is automatically ingesting even the private docs I open in Google Docs? WTF, guys. I didn't ask for this. Now I have to go find new settings I was never told about to turn this crap off.<a href="https://twitter.com/KevinBankston/status/1811075836558114968" data-url="https://twitter.com/KevinBankston/status/1811075836558114968" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">July 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote></div><p>So, what exactly is going on here? Both Google support and the Gemini AI itself do not quite seem to know, but Kevin Bankston has some theories, after providing much more detail in the full thread. Contrary to the initial posting, this is technically happening within the larger umbrella of Google Drive and not Google Docs specifically, though it seems likely the issue could apply to Docs as well.</p><p>But what caused this issue? According to Google's Gemini AI, the privacy settings used to inform Gemini should be openly available, but they aren't, which means the AI is either "hallucinating (lying)" or some internal systems on Google's servers are outright malfunctioning. Either way, not a great look, even if this private data supposedly isn't used to train the Gemini AI.</p><p>What's more, Bankston did eventually find the settings toggle in question... only to find that Gemini summaries in Gmail, Drive, and Docs were already disabled. Additionally, it was in an entirely different place than either of the web pages to which Gemini's bot initially pointed.</p><p>For Bankston, the issue seems localized to Google Drive, and only happens after pressing the Gemini button on at least one document. The matching document type (in this case, PDF) will subsequently automatically trigger Google Gemini for all future files of the same type opened within Google Drive. He additionally theorizes that it may have been caused by him enabling Google Workspace Labs back in 2023, which could be overriding the intended Gemini AI settings.</p><p>Even if this issue is isolated to Google Workspace Labs users, it's quite a severe downside for having helped Google test its latest and greatest tech. User consent still matters on a granular basis, particularly with potentially sensitive information, and Google has utterly failed at least one segment of its user base by failing to stay true to that principle.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wRuffs8ZMbx8jqi7TCGfnZ"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div>

        <section property="schema:text"> <p>Could this be the world’s most interesting bird? Sure, it doesn’t <em>look</em> that interesting. In fact, at a glance, it seems like a run-of-the-mill sparrow.</p>

<p>It doesn’t live in far-off&nbsp;exotic places, either: It may be outside your window right now. The White-throated Sparrow is common and familiar, hopping on the ground under bird feeders all over the eastern states in winter. It appears by the hundreds during migration in places like New York City’s Central Park and Chicago’s lakefront parks. But this seemingly ordinary backyard bird has a secret identity—or, actually, four secret identities. And it's these multiple personalites that place&nbsp;the White-throat at the center of mysteries&nbsp;scientists are still working out.</p>

<p>Watch a flock of White-throats in spring and you’ll notice they have two kinds of head patterns. Some wear snappy stripes of black and white across the top of the head. Others have more modest head stripes of dark brown and tan. That superficial difference might not seem like a big deal, but it reflects a remarkable divergence in the lifestyles of these individuals.</p>

<p>For years it was assumed that tan stripes indicated a young White-throat. As late as 1947, in his classic <em>Field Guide to the Birds</em>, Roger Peterson described the adult’s “striped black and white crown” and said the immature was “duller, but with the same essential recognition-marks.” By that time, there’d been hints already that the colors might not be just a function of age. For example, in <em>The Birds of Massachusetts</em> in 1929, ornithologist Edward Howe Forbush mentioned a two-year-old banded White-throat that “had not attained full adult plumage.” He added that “Some require an extra year, or possibly even more, to assume highest plumage.” But he didn’t go so far as to suggest that some adults would never develop those white stripes.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1961, a landmark study by Canadian ornithologist James Lowther revealed the true nature of the color differences. A White-throated Sparrow, he demonstrated, would be white-striped or tan-striped for life—these were permanent color morphs, and about half of all males and half of all females fell into each color type.</p>


<span data-lazyblock-hash="bean::5478::1672138908">
</span><p>It’s not rare for a bird species to have color morphs. Check your field guide: There are morphs in Eastern Screech-Owls, Reddish Egrets, Red-tailed Hawks, and others. But White-throated Sparrows are different. As Lowther discovered, mated pairs of White-throats almost always involved one bird of each color morph: Either a tan-striped male with a white-striped female, or a white-striped male with a tan-striped female. Intrigued, Lowther extended his research, joined by biologist J. Bruce Falls and others. As studies continued, it became obvious that these two color morphs, existing side by side throughout the species’ range, are stunningly different from each other in behavior.</p>

<p>Within each gender, white-striped birds are more aggressive while tan-striped birds are more nurturing. That seemingly simple generalization is based on a vast amount of research. For many years, Falls and his students at the University of Toronto carried out highly detailed studies of White-throated Sparrows, showing how behavioral differences between the morphs touched every aspect of these birds’ lives.</p>

<p>Consider their defense of breeding territories. White-throated Sparrows nest in coniferous and mixed forests of Canada and the northeastern states, but within this habitat, white-striped males tend to be in slightly more open areas, while tan-striped males are often in denser forest. As with most songbirds, they defend their territories mainly by singing. White-striped males sing far more often than tan-striped males. White-striped females also sing fairly often, but tan-striped females rarely do. They all sing variations of the whistled <em>Oh, sweet, Kimberly-Kimberly-Kimberly!,</em> but the songs of tan-striped birds average slightly lower-pitched, and these lower sounds may carry better through dense habitat.</p>

<p>Now, when singing isn’t enough, White-throats will actively chase away intruders on their territory. White-striped males, though,&nbsp;are much more aggressive than tan-striped males in these chases. White-striped females will also take part in chasing, but tan-striped females don’t seem to do much to defend the territory.</p>

<p>In the actual process of raising young, tan-striped birds shine. Only females (of either morph) build the nest and incubate the eggs, but after the eggs hatch, both parents bring food for the young. On average, females bring more food than males. But within each sex, tan-striped birds bring more food than white-striped ones.</p>

<p>So are females most strongly attracted to the tough, macho, white-striped males? Actually, no. Lab studies have found that females of either morph prefer the tan-striped males. White-striped females, more pushy than their tan-striped sisters, grab the tan-striped bachelors right away, so these pairs form more quickly than the opposite combination. Males of both morphs tend to prefer the white-striped females, but those females quickly hook up with tan-striped males if they can, so eventually the leftover birds will form pairs consisting of white-striped males and tan-striped females. Once they’re paired up, tan-striped birds of either sex tend to be faithfully monogamous, but white-striped birds are sometimes promiscuous.</p>

<p>Talk about a complicated dating scene! Nesting pairs consist of one bird from each morph more than 95 percent of the time, but it’s especially interesting to consider what happens on those occasions when two birds of the <em>same</em> morph pair up. In short, it’s likely to be a bad idea. Pairs consisting of two white-striped birds may fail to raise any young because they spend too much time fighting with each other and not enough time feeding the kids. Pairs consisting of two tan-striped birds might fail completely at defending their territory, but that’s a guess; we don’t have much data.</p>


<span data-lazyblock-hash="bean::5479::1672138910">
</span><p>So the morphs differ in traits that parallel the usual differences between the sexes in birds. Looking at White-throats in the breeding season, we see four distinct types. To oversimplify, we could call them super-aggressive males, more nurturing males, somewhat aggressive females, and super-nurturing females. It’s almost as if the White-throated Sparrow has four sexes. That may sound like a joke, but it’s actually a good description of what’s going on.</p>

<p>We’ve known since the late 1960s that the two color morphs differ in their chromosomes. Tan-striped birds have two identical copies of chromosome 2, but in white-striped birds, one copy of chromosome 2 has a large section inverted, as if it had been put in backwards. Recent work by biologist Elaina Tuttle and others has established that this section of the chromosome is not just inverted, but scrambled in a variety of ways. And it doesn’t just control the color of head stripes. Many different genes here are tightly linked to form a “supergene,” so that birds of one color morph also inherit a whole range of behaviors. The resulting effect is that the White-throat <a href="http://www.molecularecologist.com/2016/02/supergenes-and-sparrows-with-four-sexes/">really does operate as a bird with four sexes</a>. For anyone curious about the scientific background, you can <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(15)01562-6">read all the technical details here</a>.</p>

<p>As far as we know, there’s no other bird in the world with this unique arrangement. And the lab work to discover the genetic details was done only because we already knew something weird was going on—because people had taken time to watch the behavior of White-throated Sparrows in the wild. Who knows what other mysteries might be just waiting to be revealed? Most of us will never discover anything quite so astonishing as this, but we can all keep in mind that even the most common bird may have its own rare secrets.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>No one wants to be the bad guy.</p><p>When narratives begin to shift and the once good guys are labelled as bad it's not surprising they fight back. They'll point to criticisms as exaggerations. Their faults as misunderstandings.</p><p>Today's freshly ordained bad guys are the investors and CEOs of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Once championed as the flagbearers of innovation and democratization, now they're viewed as new versions of the monopolies of old and they're fighting back.</p><p>The title of Paul Graham's essay, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html?ref=keenen.xyz">How People Get Rich Now</a>, didn't prepare me for the real goal of his words. It's less a tutorial or analysis and more a thinly veiled attempt to ease concerns about wealth inequality.</p><blockquote>People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into <em>how</em> they got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies?</blockquote><p>What he fails to mention is that concerns about wealth inequality aren't concerned with how wealth was generated but rather the growing wealth gap that has accelerated in recent decades. Tech has made startups both cheaper and easier but only for a small percentage of people. And when a select group of people have an advantage that others don't it's compounded over time.</p><blockquote>Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing. Of course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting more valuable companies, how could it not be?</blockquote><figure><img src="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1274" height="886" srcset="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/image.png 600w, https://keenen.xyz/content/images/size/w1000/2021/04/image.png 1000w, https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image.png 1274w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Paul paints a rosy picture but doesn't mention that incomes for lower and middle-class families have fallen since the 80s. This golden age of entrepreneurship hasn't benefitted the vast majority of people and the increase in the Gini coefficient isn't simply that more companies are being started. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.</p><figure><img src="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="848" height="830" srcset="https://keenen.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/image-1.png 600w, https://keenen.xyz/content/images/2021/04/image-1.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote>You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fight with capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would be happy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem to be. You can almost hear them saying "No, no, not <em>that</em> way."</blockquote><p>And there we have it. The slight injection of his true ideology relegated to the notes section and vague enough that some might ignore. But keep in mind this is the same guy who argued <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wtax.html?ref=keenen.xyz">against a wealth tax</a>. His seemingly impartial and logical writing attempts to hide his true intentions.</p><p>Is this really about how people get rich or why we should all be happy that people like PG are getting richer while tons of people and struggling to meet their basic needs. Wealth inequality is just a radical left fairy tale to villainize the hard-working 1%. We could all be rich too, it's so much easier now. Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</p><p>There's no question that it's easier now than ever to start a new business and reach your market. The internet has had a democratizing effect in this regard. But it's also obvious to anyone outside the SV bubble that it's still only accessible to a small minority of people. Most people don't have the safety net or mental bandwidth to even consider entrepreneurship. It is not a panacea for the masses.</p><p>But to use that fact to push the false claim that wealth inequality is solely due to more startups and not a real problem says a lot. This essay is less about how people get rich and more about why it's okay that people like PG are getting rich. They're better than the richest people of 1960. And we can join them. We just need to stop complaining and just be rich instead.</p>

<p>No rolling blackouts or grid emergencies as California continues on path to a carbon free grid.   Several strategies, including upgrades to vulnerable parts of the grid at play here, but key enabler is more clean energy, especially solar, and above all, battery storage, now equivalent to 5 very large nuclear power plants.<br></p>
