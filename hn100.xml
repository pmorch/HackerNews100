The barkeep begins a multistep pour process lasting precisely 119.5 seconds, which, whether it’s a marketing gimmick or a marvel of alcoholic engineering, has become a beloved ritual in Irish pubs worldwide. The result: a rich stout with a perfect froth layer like an earthy milkshake.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The Guinness brewery has been known for innovative methods ever since founder Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease in Dublin for £45 a year. For example, a mathematician-turned-brewer invented a chemical technique there after four years of tinkering that gives the brewery’s namesake stout its velvety head. The method, which involves adding nitrogen gas to kegs and to little balls inside cans of Guinness, led to today’s hugely popular “nitro” brews for beer and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-brew-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-according-to-science/">coffee</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">But the most influential innovation to come out of the brewery by far has nothing to do with beer.

Until then, quality control on its products consisted of rough eyeballing and smell tests. But the demands of global expansion motivated Guinness leaders to revamp their approach to target consistency and industrial-grade rigor. The company hired a team of brainiacs and gave them latitude to pursue research questions in service of the perfect brew. The brewery became a hub of experimentation to answer an array of questions: Where do the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trouble-brewing-climate-change-closes-in-on-beer-drinkers/">best barley varieties</a> grow? What is the ideal saccharine level in malt extract?

One challenge the brewers confronted involves hop flowers, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whats-brewing-in-a-beer-is-startling-complexity/">essential ingredients in Guinness</a> that impart a bitter flavor and act as a natural preservative. To assess the quality of hops, brewers measured the soft resin content in the plants. Let’s say they deemed 8 percent a good and typical value. Testing every flower in the crop wasn’t economically viable, however. So they did what any good scientist would do and tested <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-numbers-look-random-but-arent-mathematicians-prove/">random samples</a> of flowers.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Let’s inspect a made-up example. Suppose we measure soft resin content in nine samples and, because samples vary, observe a range of values from 4 percent to 10 percent, with an average of 6 percent—too low. Does that mean we should dump the crop? Uncertainty creeps in from two possible explanations for the low measurements. Either the crop really does contain unusually low soft resin content, or though the <i>samples</i> contain low levels, the full crop is actually fine. The whole point of taking random samples is to rely on them as faithful representatives of the full crop, but perhaps we were unlucky by choosing samples with uncharacteristically low levels. (We only tested nine, after all.) In other words, should we consider the low levels in our samples significantly different from 8 percent or mere natural variation?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This quandary is not unique to brewing. Rather, it pervades all scientific inquiry. Suppose that in a medical trial, both the treatment group and placebo group improve, but the treatment group fares a little better. Does that provide sufficient grounds to recommend the medication? What if I told you that both groups actually received two different placebos? Would you be tempted to conclude that the placebo in the group with better outcomes must have medicinal properties? Or could it be that when you track a group of people, some of them will just naturally improve, sometimes by a little and sometimes by a lot? Again, this boils down to a question of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-significant-problem-of-p-values/">statistical significance</a>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The theory underlying these perennial questions in the domain of small <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-secret-sauce-in-opinion-polling-can-also-be-a-source-of-spoilage/">sample sizes</a> hadn’t been developed until Guinness came on the scene—specifically, not until William Sealy Gosset, head experimental brewer at Guinness in the early 20th century, invented the <i>t</i>-test. The concept of statistical significance predated Gosset, but prior statisticians worked in the regime of large sample sizes. To appreciate why this distinction matters, we need to understand how one would determine statistical significance.</p><figure data-block="contentful/image"><picture><source media="(min-width: 750px)" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=1350 1350w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=2000 2000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=900 900w" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw"><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/60924c3d6a79769f/original/guinness_graphic2_mobile.png?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/60924c3d6a79769f/original/guinness_graphic2_mobile.png?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/60924c3d6a79769f/original/guinness_graphic2_mobile.png?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/60924c3d6a79769f/original/guinness_graphic2_mobile.png?w=750 750w" sizes="(min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw"><img alt="Chart shows that the flatter curve of the t distribution compared with the normal distribution indicates that the t distribution has a larger significant signal-to-noise ratio." decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=900" width="3753" height="2056" srcset="https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=1350 1350w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=2000 2000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/5de9585bddf6dfd0/original/guinness_graphic2_desktop.png?w=900 900w" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw"></picture><figcaption><p>Shuyao Xiao</p></figcaption></figure><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Remember, the hops samples in our scenario have an average soft resin content of 6 percent, and we want to know whether the average in the full crop actually differs from the desired 8 percent or if we just got unlucky with our sample. So we’ll ask the question: What is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-sleeping-beauty-problem-is-keeping-mathematicians-awake/">the probability</a> that we would observe such an extreme value (6 percent) if the full crop was in fact typical (with an average of 8 percent)?Traditionally, if this probability, called a <i>P</i> value, lies below 0.05, then we deem the deviation statistically significant, although different applications call for different thresholds.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Often two separate factors affect the <i>P</i> value: how far a sample deviates from what is expected in a population and how common big deviations are. Think of this as a tug-of-war between signal and noise. The difference between our observed mean (6 percent) and our desired one (8 percent) provides the signal—the larger this difference, the more likely the crop really does have low soft resin content. The standard deviation among flowers brings the noise. Standard deviation measures how spread out the data are around the mean; small values indicate that the data hover near the mean, and larger values imply wider variation. If the soft resin content typically fluctuates widely across buds (in other words, has a high standard deviation), then maybe the 6 percent average in our sample shouldn’t concern us. But if flowers tend to exhibit consistency (or a low standard deviation), then 6 percent may indicate a true deviation from the desired 8 percent.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To determine a <i>P</i> value in an ideal world, we’d start by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio. The higher this ratio, the more confidence we have in the significance of our findings because a high ratio indicates that we’ve found a true deviation. But what counts as high signal-to-noise? To deem 6 percent significantly different from 8 percent, we specifically want to know when the signal-to-noise ratio is so high that it only has a 5 percent chance of occurring in a world where an 8 percent resin content is the norm. Statisticians in Gosset’s time knew that if you were to run an experiment many times, calculate the signal-to-noise ratio in each of those experiments and graph the results, that plot would resemble a “standard normal distribution”—<a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/normal-distribution/">the familiar bell curve</a>. Because the normal distribution is well understood and documented, you can look up in a table how large the ratio must be to reach the 5 percent threshold (or any other threshold).</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Gosset recognized that this approach only worked with large sample sizes, whereas small samples of hops wouldn’t guarantee that normal distribution. So he meticulously tabulated new distributions for smaller sample sizes. Now known as <i>t</i>-distributions, these plots resemble the normal distribution in that they’re bell-shaped, but the curves of the bell don’t drop off as sharply. That translates to needing an even larger signal-to-noise ratio to conclude significance. His <i>t</i>-test allows us to make inferences in settings where we couldn’t before.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Mathematical consultant John D. Cook mused on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/06/27/wine-beer-and-statistics/">his blog</a> in 2008 that perhaps it should not surprise us that the <i>t</i>-test originated at a brewery as opposed to, say, a winery. Brewers demand consistency in their product, whereas vintners revel in variety. Wines have “good years,” and each bottle tells a story, but you want every pour of Guinness to deliver the same trademark taste. In this case, uniformity inspired innovation.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Gosset solved many problems at the brewery with his new technique. The self-taught statistician <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2331554?casa_token=1652dnOSNrEAAAAA%3AI4iWjKpCkwXkSrqiwVAsbsNLTbf6GInl0s3VM9sgZ1G-bYeUzEwaUHM3AzY0_m5SiIRrloH22n0dsDT7ShPAUie65cFhRoO-pWIXfzENzFG7HUKO7FE-&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">published his <i>t</i>-test</a> under the pseudonym “Student” because Guinness didn’t want to tip off competitors to its research. Although Gosset pioneered industrial quality control and contributed loads of other ideas to quantitative research, most textbooks still call his great achievement the “Student’s <i>t</i>-test.” History may have neglected his name, but he could be proud that the <i>t</i>-test is one of the most widely used statistical tools in science to this day. Perhaps his accomplishment belongs in <i>Guinness World Records </i>(the idea for which was dreamed up by Guinness’s managing director in the 1950s). Cheers to that.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>One year ago today, I went into surgery expecting that I’d lose half my tongue to a squamous cell carcinoma recurrence. The evening before, Bess and I got legally married;<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> it was a short, but charming, crash ceremony. I say “crash ceremony” because we wanted to marry before surgery, and on afternoon of May 24 I learned a spot had opened for the next day. It was only luck—if you could call any part of this story “lucky”—that Bess and I had picked up our marriage license a few days earlier, expecting to wed sometime before the planned surgery date of June 8 or 9. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The tumor itself has only been confirmed on May 11: I got a “hot” PET scan on April 26. Mayo Phoenix initially scheduled follow-up CT scans a few weeks later to figure out what was going on, but <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hinni-michael-l-m-d/bio-20053549">Dr. Hinni</a>, the ENT surgeon at Mayo who saved my life, did not like that delay (he dislikes any delay, a trait which has likely saved my life on several occasions) and ordered them stat, so on May 1 I went in to find out whether I was likely to live or die.</p>



<p>The CT scans were ambiguous. On May 8, I went in for a fine-needle biopsy done by interventional radiology. The fine-needle biopsy was also ambiguous. On May 9, I went in for a core biopsy, which found no cancer. I celebrated and told friends and family I was in the clear. I don’t remember if it was that day or the next that Tony Mendez, Dr. Hinni’s PA, called to say they weren’t convinced by the biopsy, and that, if I was up for it, Dr. Hinni would do a surgical biopsy on May 11. Dr. Hinni didn’t trust the biopsy results and didn’t like the ambiguity in the scans. His favorite radiologist—he said something like “she doesn’t miss”—couldn’t tell whether the images showed cancer or something else.</p>



<p>Yeah, I was up for it. The surgical biopsy removed all ambiguity: cancer. But the soonest a hemi-glossectomy could be scheduled was June 8 or 9. Throughout May, my conditioned worsened: headaches that were noticeable at the beginning of the month required oxycodone by the middle. The month-long gap between May 11 and June 8 seemed cavernous. Bess and I lurched into action to try and figure out what to do, because the only Mayo head and neck oncologist, a guy named Panayiotis Savvides, happened to be on vacation in Greece. We couldn’t get ahold of him, and Mayo, peculiarly, had no backup coverage. What happens to people who get sick while the head and neck oncologist is out of town? Eventually his PA tracked him down and got a prescription for an immunotherapy called pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to start on May 19.</p>



<p>But was that enough? We didn’t know and couldn’t ask about the rationale. Bess did some drive-by consultation from docs she knew online, some of whom recommended we look into chemo. We were lucky enough to meet with an oncologist named <a href="https://doctors.bannerhealth.com/provider/Fade+Mahmoud/673131">Dr. Mahmoud</a> at Banner-MD Anderson on May 18 or 19. He had a sense of urgency appropriate to cancer: he said that he’d admit me through the emergency room to start chemo and Keytruda right away, to possibly slow the tumor. The surgeons at Banner didn’t think clean margins were possible given the extent of the tumor, without first shrinking it. But Dr. Hinni thought clean margins were attainable, and chemo would delay surgery by weeks, possibly months, because of its effects on wound healing. If chemo didn’t work, the window for a possible cure would be closed. Would Keytruda have any effects on surgery? Dr. Hinni said no. The question of chemo first versus chemo later became moot as my condition worsened rapidly.</p>



<p>I wound up getting a Keytruda infusion on Monday, May 22. In my calendar, there is a “post-operative visit” on that day as well, so I must’ve seen Tony and/or Dr. Hinni. I was doing terribly, and one or both of them must’ve seen my deteriorating condition and deduced the obvious. The next day was my brother and sister’s birthday, which has no immediate bearing on this story, except to say that cancer has a way of ruining all sorts of things for both the patient and the people who love them. On May 24, Tony called: would I be up for hemi-glossectomy (removing half the tongue) on May 25? Dr. Hinni was leaving for vacation either that night or the next day (I think the next day).</p>



<p>When Tony asked, I felt a bizarre lurch in consciousness. But I said yes. What other answer was there? It must have taken an epic feat of coordination to make the surgery happen, because it required not only a full day from Dr. Hinni and Tony and many others, but another ENT named Dr. Nagle, who would form a “flap” of muscle out of tissue from my leg, to replace the lost half of my tongue. Two surgeons would be working on me, one up top, as it were, and the second down below.</p>



<p>I texted Bess, who was at work, right away, then family, then friends. My brother and sister drove out from L.A. My mom flew. Bess accelerated a plan to get blood drawn before the surgery and sent to a company called <a href="https://www.natera.com/">Natera</a>; they make tests that monitor circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). A Natera test can find cancer cells in the blood before a tumor is visible to imaging. We planned to monitor ctDNA to guide decisions around, for example, post-operative chemotherapy, which we’d planned to initiate in the hopes that it would kill off any microscopic errant tumor cells left behind.</p>



<p>May 24 turned into a complicated, hectic day. I don’t remember most of it. Whatever feelings I had, I stuffed down, because feelings are often not helpful in the face of difficult tasks that nonetheless must be completed. Picking up that marriage license a few days prior suddenly seemed fortuitous. In Arizona, it’s possible for anyone to become ordained to conduct marriages online, so Bess sent a text to our friend Smetana, asking if she’d like to do the honors, a role which she immediately and enthusiastically said yes to.<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>



<p>The night of May 24, I got dinner from <a href="http://www.fnbrestaurant.com/">FnB</a>, a restaurant down the street and one that we call “New-York good”—most restaurants in Arizona are not great, and one that would be worth eating at even in New York is special. FnB was a good choice for a last meal, even though I didn’t know it was my last meal and was also too sick to fully enjoy it. After, Smetana and her boyfriend Cody came over for a wedding ceremony in the dark. We stood in the courtyard of our apartment building next to the pool, in a corner under some fairy lights the apartment directly above us had hung off their balcony. Smetana wrote the ceremony with the aid of ChatGPT, and Bess <a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/forever-is-short-long-time">wore her emergency wedding dress</a>, which I think she’s had since she was a teenager. Make of that what you will.</p>



<p>It wasn’t what we’d planned. We admittedly planned nothing. Who can, in the face of a fast-moving, aggressive cancer that upends plans like Godzilla upends cities? But if we had, I had a feeling it wouldn’t be what happened. Cancer has a way of crashing the party. Thus, our “crash” wedding.</p>



<p>There wasn’t much of an immediate celebration. I fell asleep early: exhaustion, oxycodone, and a day full of tension will do that. I don’t know how much Bess slept, since she’s prone to insomnia when stressed. The next morning I got up early and saw, briefly, my brother and sister, who much later told me that I looked like shit, or a walking corpse, or both—I don’t think either had realized how bad I’d gotten. I’m not sure I realized how bad I’d gotten. Bess and I drove to Mayo and checked in. I don’t remember the exact sequence of events, except that there was, of course, some kind of problem with the lab order for the Natera blood sample and Bess had to last-minute wrangle the test for me (it had to be done pre-op or not at all) with the help of an oncologist named Kat Price at Mayo Rochester, and her own sweet-talking of the lab techs. What I mostly remember is the fear I kept in check, and Bess waiting in the pre-op area with me, but eventually Bess having to depart and anesthesiology putting me under.</p>



<p>The old me died on the table. The new me is still being born, and may not wholly be born.</p>



<p>When I woke up sufficiently to form memories that night, I knew quickly that something was wrong. I couldn’t think properly, but I had a sense that things were not well. Early on, someone—a nurse, I assume—told me not to turn my head. Someone—I think Bess, though I’m not sure—said that the hemi-glossectomy turned into a total glossectomy. The tumor had spread too far, too fast, and had taken out both major blood vessels in the tongue, so the whole tongue had to come out. However bad that night was, many worse days followed. In some ways, the horror of that period is still with me. By July 21, less than two months later, another <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/22/i-am-dying-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-and-the-treatments-that-might-save-me-are-just-out-of-reach/">six to eight tumors had grown</a>. If I’d known how things would shake out, I likely would’ve pivoted to chemo and <a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/please-be-dying-but-not-too-quickly">clinical trials</a> the moment the surgical biopsy came back. But I didn’t and couldn’t.</p>



<p>I can’t believe it’s been a calendar year, and not, say, fifteen. I’ve lived a lot of darkness. I feel like I’m only now, after a whole year, reaching towards recovery from the surgery, the chemo, the clinical-trial drugs, although the trial drug I’m currently on <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2024/05/09/the-recent-war-between-cancer-and-cancer-treatment-side-effects/">causes GI and nausea side effects</a>—and they appear to be worse for me than for most recipients. The exhaustion that comes with surgery is underrated and under-discussed. There are still moments when I forget what life is for me: the other day I looked at some of the first Rainer cherries of the summer, and wanted to buy them, then remembered I’d have to blend them, which defeats a lot of the point, and I almost cried in the grocery store.</p>



<p>The likelihood of me living to see another anniversary is low—probably under 20%—but not 0%. I know I’m supposed to feel joy and gratitude at still being corporeal, and sometimes I do, but often I don’t (though I am grateful to everyone who has helped me, and that includes <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s">thousands of people</a>, ranging from strangers who donated $5 on Go Fund Me to oncologists who oversee clinical trials). Sadness dogs me. The struggles remain acute. I’m typing this at my desk, and in front of me is a cup on a bed of tissues in which I have to routinely spit. I don’t know exactly how many times a day I have to spit daily—dozens? more than a hundred?—but it’s a lot. And that’ll be how every day will be until the last. Yet I am working on finding meaningful, generative ways to live. Without those, what is there?</p>



<p><em>If you’ve gotten this far, </em><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s"><em>consider the Go Fund Me</em></a><em> that’s funding ongoing care.</em></p>

<h3>May 26 2024</h3>

<p>This is a follow-up to my blog post <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/3.html">Updating from macOS Ventura to Sonoma silently enables iCloud Keychain</a>. In the addendum to that blog post, I discussed a workaround, which was to delete my WiFi password right before rebooting into the updater. In a trial run on my M1 Mac mini, the workaround was successful.</p>
<blockquote>Thankfully, iCloud Keychain remained disabled after I connected to WiFi again, and even after I rebooted, so this seems like a permanent solution!</blockquote>
<p>The success of the trial run gave me the confidence to update my main development machine, an M1 MacBook Pro, from Ventura to Sonoma. Unfortunately, for unknown reasons, I experienced a different result the second time. As before, the workaround did successfully prevent Sonoma from connecting to my WiFi network. And as before, I confirmed in System Settings that iCloud Keychain was still disabled after the Sonoma update. However, after I finally connected to my WiFi network again, I discovered to my horror that Sonoma <em>did</em> then silently enable iCloud Keychain. My workaround was ultimately futile.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/1.png" width="582" height="391" alt="iCloud Passwords &amp; Keychain: Sync this Mac"></p>
<p>By the way, toggling off "Sync this Mac" caused System Settings to hang and eventually crash the preference pane, which also happened in one of my earlier trial runs. Has anybody inside Apple ever tested this scenario?</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/2.png" width="372" height="330" alt="Settings Error: Extension process Apple ID exited."></p>
<p>On my Mac mini already running Sonoma, I saw a new warning in System Settings, "Some iCloud Data Isn't Syncing".</p>
<blockquote>Your end-to-end encrypted data stored in iCloud can't be accessed on this device. It includes saved passwords and data from Health and Maps. Verify your account information to resume syncing.</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/3.png" width="369" height="104" alt="Some iCloud Data Isn't Syncing"></p>
<p>(It should be noted that I don't use Health or Apple Maps.)</p>
<p>Clicking the Resume Data Sync button made the warning go away and didn't enable iCloud Keychain on the Mac mini, but I don't know why I was getting the warning in the first place. I didn't see the same warning on my iPad, also signed into iCloud.</p>
<p>Another bit of Sonoma bugginess I experienced was a zombie keychain that could not be removed from the Keychain Access app.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/4.png" width="455" height="347" alt="System Keychains: Ventura"></p>
<p>What happened was that after I noticed iCloud Keychain had been silently enabled on my MacBook Pro, I copied my login (non-system) keychain from one of my Ventura backups (of course I made redundant backups before updating to Sonoma), renamed it to "Ventura", and imported it into Keychain Access for the purpose of comparing the old and new login keychains, checking for data loss or other issues. Fortunately, I found no issues, so I deleted the imported Ventura keychain from Keychain Access. Nonetheless, the next time I launched Keychain Access, I found the above zombie keychain, misplaced under System Keychains, with all menu items disabled.</p>
<p>I was able to solve this problem by once again copying the old keychain file from backup and putting it in the same place on disk as before. Then the next time I launched Keychain Access, the Ventura keychain appeared enabled under the correct category of Custom Keychains instead of System Keychains, and on the second try I was able to delete the keychain permanently. But wow, none of my experience here inspires confidence in Apple's software quality, especially with regard to "security".</p>
<p>An unpleasant side effect of updating to Sonoma—as if there weren't enough unpleasant side effects already—is that logging into <a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/">App Store Connect</a> now offers passkeys as the default rather than passwords, despite the fact that I don't have any passkeys saved and indeed cannot save any passkeys with iCloud Keychain disabled. So now there are extra steps to login, and Apple makes you login again every time Safari is relaunched, because as I've blogged about multiple times, <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/crappstoreconnect4.html">App Store Connect is the worst web site ever made</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/5/4-images/5.png" width="485" height="354" alt="App Store Connect: Passkey for this website"></p>
<p>I'm currently working on a solution to this problem. I have noticed that the passkey option goes away if I spoof the browser User-Agent as Chrome.</p>
<p>You (a Borg) might ask, why don't I just "go with the flow", adopt iCloud Keychain and passkeys? (Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.) On principle, I should not have to upload my data to Apple if I don't want. Apple advertises itself as the "privacy" company, but uploading user data to Apple's servers without notice or consent is a gross violation of privacy. I've always managed my data myself, taking personal responsibility for protecting it and backing it up. I don't want or need Apple to insert itself into this process as a remote nanny. Paternalism makes my blood boil.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if I wanted to use iCloud Keychain, why in the world should I trust the sync system to work correctly when faced with Apple's demonstrably poor software quality? Something else I noticed after updating to Sonoma: although I've tried many times in the past to extinguish it, the text replacement <code>omw</code> has once again returned, almost like a cicada.</p>

FILE_ID.DIZ
</b>
<span size="3"><br>Version v1.9 by Richard Holler [CIS 73567,1547] Last Revision 05/17/94<br>
</span></center><pre><span size="3">
This HTML file was prepared at the request of the ASP (Association of 
Shareware Professionals), but the information contained in it may be of 
value to any shareware author.


FILE_ID.DIZ INFORMATION
-----------------------
Basically, the FILE_ID.DIZ file is a straight ASCII text file, distributed 
inside your distribution archive file along with your program files, which 
contains a description of your program. This file will be used by most BBS 
(Bulletin Board System) softwares for the online file description of your 
file. We recommend that the FILE_ID.DIZ file be used in all of your 
distribution archives. 

This text file contains a description of the FILE_ID.DIZ file, as well as a 
description of the recommended distribution archive format.


WHY SHOULD YOU USE FILE_ID.DIZ?
-------------------------------
The use of this file will insure that the online description of your 
program will be in your own words (and who better to describe your program 
than yourself?), and that it will remain the same no matter how many 
different people upload your file to various BBS systems. 

As more and more BBS software makes use of this file, you can be assured 
that your own description will replace such online descriptions as "Cool 
Program" or "OK utility, but needs better ..."

Please note that the ASP Hub Network, the Author Direct FDN (File 
Distribution Network), and the majority of other electronic distribution 
services *REQUIRE* that a valid FILE_ID.DIZ file be contained in your 
submitted distribution archive. If your file doesn't contain a valid 
FILE_ID.DIZ file, then it simply won't be distributed by these services. 
Furthermore, most BBS sysops will not accept uploads of files which do not 
contain a valid FILE_ID.DIZ file, so you automatically lose out on that 
distribution as well.


DESCRIPTION:
------------
FILE_ID.DIZ was created by Clark Development for use with their PCBDescribe 
utility, as a means for shareware authors to provide descriptions for their 
products, and thus so that BBS callers can upload the file(s) without 
having to manually type in a file description. 

As long as an author creates and includes a FILE_ID.DIZ file in their 
distribution fileset, the text from that file will be used for the online 
description (in most cases) rather than anything typed in by the uploader. 
It also ensures that the online description is always the same regardless 
of the number of different BBS systems the file is posted on. It has since 
been accepted by the BBS industry more-or-less as the "standard" file 
description source. (The extension of "DIZ" actually stands for 
"Description In Zip").

NOTE: The FILE_ID.DIZ file *MUST* be named exactly that, and *NOT* 
something like <filename>.DIZ. It will *ONLY* be used if it is named 
FILE_ID.DIZ!

The FILE_ID.DIZ file is nothing more than a straight ASCII text file which 
contains the full description of the archived file containing it. It is 
used by most popular BBS software to describe your program, rather than 
using the description supplied by the person that uploaded your file. It 
should be placed *INSIDE* your distribution archive file. The FILE_ID.DIZ 
file is defined by its creators (Clark Development) as being created by the 
program author, and *NOT* the end user who is trying to upload the program.

The BBS software will "look" inside the archive file. If a FILE_ID.DIZ file 
is found, it will replace any existing online file description with the 
text contained in FILE_ID.DIZ. It is an excellent method for making sure 
that your program files are described the way that "you" want them 
described. Even sysops who's software can't automatically make use of the 
FILE_ID.DIZ file have found it to be an excellent source for their manually 
added file descriptions.


STRUCTURE:
----------
The file consists of straight ASCII text, up to 10 lines of text, each line 
being no more than 45 characters long. It should *NOT* contain any blank 
lines, any form of centering or formatting, or any Hi-ASCII or ANSI 
characters. (i.e. it should ONLY contain alpha &amp; numeric characters).

We recommended that it consist of 5 basic parts:

   1. the proper name of your program
   2. the version number
   3. the "ASP" identifier (optional, for ASP members)
   4. the description separator
   4. the description

All of the above parts should be separated by a single "space".

PROGRAM NAME: To set it apart from the rest, it is recommended that you use 
ALL CAPS for the program name.

VERSION NUMBER: The version number should be in the form of "v12.34". 

ASP IDENTIFIER: If you are an ASP author, we recommend that an "<asp>" 
identifying mark be added after the version number, to identify your 
product as an ASP-authored product.

DESCRIPTION SEPARATOR: To separate the actual description text, insert a 
simple "-" (dash/minus) character after the ASP identifier (or version 
number, if not using the ASP identifier), and in front of the description 
text.

DESCRIPTION: You should attempt to FULLY describe your product, including 
its most important functions and features. Be sure to include anything 
which will separate your program from it's competition, and make the BBS 
user want to download your file. Also try to include any hardware or 
software requirements that your product may have.

You should try to use the first 2 lines of the text to give a basic 
description of your program. This is helpful for sysops who's BBS software 
limits them to less than 10 lines, 45 characters. Sysops who are limited to 
using shorter descriptions can simply use the 1st two lines and truncate 
the rest. Thus, you can basically still supply your own description for BBS 
software which does not actually utilize the FILE_ID.DIZ feature.

The remaining lines of text can be used to elaborate on the programs 
features, enhancements from the prior version, information concerning 
multi-file sets. Please note that older versions of some BBS software can 
only use 8 lines of text. It is advisable that you create your FILE_ID.DIZ 
file so that the file can be truncated to various line lengths without 
destroying it's usefulness.


EXAMPLE
-------
MY PROGRAM v1.23 <asp> - A program which will
do anything for anybody. Will run in only 2k
of memory. Can be run from the command line,
or installed as a TSR. Completely menu-
driven. Version 1.23 reduces the previous 4k
memory requirements, and adds an enhanced
graphical user interface. Also, MY PROGRAM 
now contains Windows and DESQview support. 
Coming soon - an OS/2 version.

MULTIPLE DISK INFO
------------------
Please note that if your distribution archive requires multiple archive 
files, you should create a separate, specific FILE_ID.DIZ file for each 
archive. This can be utilized to describe the various contents of each 
archive, and to identify each disk in the set. For example, the FILE_ID.DIZ 
file for disk #1 could contain:

   "MY PROGRAM v1.23 <asp> Program Executable 
    Files - Disk 1 of 2"
    [followed by detailed description text]

while the FILE_ID.DIZ file for disk #2 could contain:

   "MY PROGRAM v1.23 <asp> Documentation Files - 
    Disk 2 of 2"
    [followed by more detailed description text]

Optionally, you could also create a "complete" FILE_ID.DIZ file for the 
first disk, which would fully describe the program in detail, and identify 
it as Disk 1 of x. Then, for each remaining file in the set, simply include 
the Program Name, version number, ASP identifier, and the disk number (i.e. 
"MY PROGRAM v1.23 <asp> Disk 2 of x").


ADDITIONAL INFO
---------------
Please don't be tempted to use fancy graphic or ANSI sequences in the 
FILE_ID.DIZ file, as most BBS software will not allow this, and will render 
your FILE_ID.DIZ file useless. Also, don't be tempted to simply copy your 
program description file to FILE_ID.DIZ. Attempting to "format" your 
FILE_ID.DIZ file (i.e line centering, right &amp; left justification, etc) will 
also cause unexpected results, especially for BBS software which re-formats 
descriptions to other than 10line/45char.

Fred Hill <asp> has written a freeware utility which interactively creates 
a valid FILE_ID.DIZ file. The file is called DIZGEN.ZIP, and is included 
with this distribution archive.  I highly recommend that you use this 
utility for creating your FILE_ID.DIZ files.

&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;&lt;*&gt;

The following is a recommendation for the structure and contents of 
distribution archives prepared for use on BBS systems.


DISTRIBUTION DISK RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------------------------
The following are recommendations for preparing your program files for 
distribution to Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) via the ASP's distribution 
services, as well as other methods.

Two varieties of program files are defined here:

1) Program files which utilize an "install" utility and self-extracting 
program archives (later referred to as "Author-Installed Programs").

2) Programs files which do not use install utilities or self-extracting 
archives (later referred to as "User-Installed Programs").


AUTHOR-INSTALLED PROGRAMS:
--------------------------
These programs require a bit more work from the author, but will eliminate 
many user mistakes, especially in programs which require complicated 
setups.

Most "installation" utility programs will make use of program files which 
have been "archived" into Self-Extracting (SFX) archives. We will attempt 
to define which files should be contained in the Self-Extracting archives, 
and which files should not.

1. Files which should be contained in the self-extracting program file
archive:

        a. All program-specific executable files.
        b. Any required configuration and/or data files required by the
           program.
        c. Program documentation files. Optionally, these may be left
           outside of the self-extracting archive, in order to allow
           them to be viewed/read by the various archive viewing utlities.
        d. Any other program-specific files that are required for the
           operation of the program.

2. The files described above should be compiled into a self-extracting 
archive file, which will then be extracted by the install utility.

NOTE: the author is required to abide by any distribution requirements 
specified by the archive utility author, and to obtain any required 
distribution rights necessary. Please check to see if distribution rights 
are required for your archive utility choice.

3. Files which should NOT be contained in the self-extracting program file 
archive:

        a. The install utility itself (obviously).
        b. The FILE_ID.DIZ file. (described in detail in the section
           preceding this one)
        c. Any distribution/information files, such as VENDOR.TXT,
           SYSOP.TXT, etc.
        d. Any description or information file, such as DESCRIBE.TXT.
        e. A user file (such as README.1ST), which should explain how
           to use the install utility, what the user should expect
           during the installation, and any preparation that the user
           should make prior to the installation. This file might also
           contain a brief description of your program, in case the user
           is able to read the documentation files in the distribution
           archive prior to downloading (many BBS systems offer this
           ability to the user).

4. The actual distribution archive file (described below) should then 
contain the install utility, the self-extracting program archive, and the 
files described in #3 above.


USER-INSTALLED PROGRAMS:
------------------------
This type of distribution archive is much simpler than the Author-Installed 
variety. It should simply be an archive file, containing all of the files 
for the program described above.

Since this type of program requires the user to do all of the installation 
manually, it should contain very specific and detailed information 
regarding the installation requirements (such as INSTALL.TXT).


THE DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVE FILE:
------------------------------
The actual distribution archive file should merely be an archive file 
containing the files described above. For BBS distribution, this archive 
should be of the standard archive format, and -NOT- a self-extracting 
archive.  Many sysops will not allow self-extracting archives, and most BBS 
software will not allow self-extracting archives to be uploaded.

There are many popular archive utilities available, such as PKZIP, LHA, 
LHARC, ARJ, etc. Most BBS systems are capable of handling archives in 
virtually any format. However, you should be aware that most BBS systems 
will convert your archive format to the format of choice by the sysop. By 
following the methods described above, this conversion process should not 
affect your program, or any self-extracting files which are contained 
within your distribution archive file.

You should also retain the default archive file extension defined by the 
archive utility. For example, PKZIP uses a ".ZIP", LHARC uses "LZH", etc. 
Changing the file extension may cause the BBS software to delete your file 
because it doesn't recognize the format.

For the actual filename for your distribution archive, it is recommended 
that the program filename be limited to 6 characters to represent the 
program's name (i.e. MYPROG could represent "My Program"). This should be 
followed by 2 numeric digits which will represent the version number of 
your release. Even if this is your initial release it should include the 
version number in the filename (i.e. MYPROG10.ZIP would indicate the 
program called "My Program" version 1.0).

Please note that CompuServe limits filenames to only 6 characters. By 
limiting the file "name" to 6 characters, you will easily be able to rename 
the archive for CompuServe uploading by simply removing the 2-digit version 
identifier, to make the file compatible with CompuServe libraries.

By including the 2-digit version number in the archive filename, it will be 
very easy for both the user and the sysop (and yourself) to identify older 
versions of your program.


MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION ARCHIVES
------------------------------
At one time, it was recommended that your final distribution archive not be 
larger than 350k, so that it would fit on a single 360k floppy disk and 
still leave room for any distribution files necessary for Disk Vendors. 
(i.e. Disk Vendors will often include their own GO.BAT file, or other 
various small files to help their customers install the software). This 
limitation is slowly falling by the wayside as more and more computer 
systems have 3.5" floppy disk drives as standard.

If your program is large enough to require more than one distribution 
archive, it is recommended that your filename be limited to 5 characters 
rather than 6 as described above. Following the 5-character name should be 
the same 2-digit version number. Then, append a single "letter" to identify 
the disk (i.e. MYPGM10A.ZIP, MYPGM10B.ZIP, etc.). For uploading to 
CompuServe, these filenames may then be shortened to 6 characters by 
removing the version identifiers (i.e. MYPGMA.ZIP, MYPGMB.ZIP). However, 
for CompuServe it is recommended that you simply create a single 
distibution file, and eliminate the multi-part file set.

If your program requires multiple distribution archives, -BE SURE- to 
create separate FILE_ID.DIZ files for each distribution archive. Also, each 
FILE_ID.DIZ file should contain disk number information pertaining to each 
individual archive (i.e. Disk 1 of 3, Disk 2 of 3, etc.).


THE DISTRIBUTION DISK
---------------------
It is recommended that your distribution disk simply contain a ZIPd version 
of your product. However, If you choose to supply "unarchived" files on a 
distribution disk for Disk Vendor use, it is _VERY_ important that you 
specify in your documentation a suggested archive filename, so that BBS 
sysops can create archived files with the proper author-specified 
filenames. This information should be contained in your SYSOP.TXT (or 
VENDOR.TXT) file. If you don't supply a suggested archive file name, the 
sysops will be forced to create the name themselves, thus you may end up 
with thousands of versions of your products on BBS systems all over the 
world, but all with different filenames.

Please note that the ASP Hub Network, and nearly every other electronic 
distribution service *REQUIRE* that your files be submitted as an archived 
file, using the ZIP format. Also note that many BBS sysops will not go to 
the trouble of ZIPing your unarchived files for you. If you don't supply 
them with an archived distribution version of your product, it might not 
get distributed by BBSs.

If you supply your own disk labels, it is recommended that the ASP logo, or 
at least the initials "ASP" be included on the label, so that anyone can 
immediately identify your disk as an ASP member's software.


SUMMARY
-------
Your distribution disk should now be ready to submit to the various BBSs, 
distribution services, and Disk Vendors.

You may choose to create a separate distribution disk for use by BBSs and 
Disk Vendors. However, if you follow the above steps in preparing your 
distribution archive file, a separate "Disk Vendor" disk is probably not 
necessary. The majority of disk vendors will be able to accept your 
distribution file/disk if it is prepared in the above described format.

But take container queries, for example. They were the number one feature requested by front-end devs for a looong time. So <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/weve-got-container-queries-now-but-are-we-actually-using-them/">why don’t we use them</a> more, now that they’re finally here?</p><p>From my own experience, I think there’s different factors at play:</p><h2 id="h-the-support-excuse"> The support excuse</h2><blockquote><p>I can’t use <em>[feature X]</em>, I need to support <em>[old browser]</em>.</p></blockquote><p>That old chestnut.<br>Browser support is an easy argument against most new things, and sometimes a convenient excuse not to bother learning a feature.</p><p>The answer there is usually progressive enhancement - except that’s easier to do for actual “enhancements”, if they are optional features that don’t impact the usability of a site that much.</p><p>For some of the new features, theres no good path to do this.</p><p>CSS Layers or native nesting for example are not something you can optionally use, they’re all-or-nothing. You’d need a separate stylesheet to support everyone.</p><p>And while support for Container Queries is <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries">green in all modern browsers</a>, people still seem reluctant to go all-in, fearing they could break something as fundamental as site layout in older browsers.</p><h2 id="h-invisible-improvements"> Invisible improvements</h2><blockquote><p>Why use <em>[feature X]</em> if the usual way works fine?</p></blockquote><p>Some of you might be old enough to remember the time when CSS3 features first hit the scene.</p><p>Things like border radius or shadows were ridiculously hard to do back in the day. Most of it was background images and hacks, and it required a substantial amount of work to change them.</p><p>Suddenly, these designs could be achieved by a single line of CSS.<br>Writing <code>border-radius: 8px</code> instead of firing up Photoshop to make a fucking 9-slice image was such a no-brainer that adoption happened very quickly. As soon as browser support was there, nobody bothered with the old way anymore.</p><p>A big chunk of the new features today are “invisible” though - they focus more on code composition and architecture.</p><p>Layers, Container Queries, etc are not something you can actually see in the browser, and the problems they solve may not be such an obvious pain in the ass at first glance. Of course they offer tremendous advantages, but you can still get by without using any of them. That might slow down adoption, since there is no urgency for developers to switch.</p><h2 id="h-examples-and-design-trends"> Examples and design trends</h2><blockquote><p>I don’t know where I would even use <em>[feature X]</em> in my project.</p></blockquote><p>The initial use-case for container queries I always heard was “styling an element that could be in the main column or the sidebar”. I think that came from a very common WordPress blog design at the time where you had “widgets” that could be placed freely in different-width sections of the site.</p><p>Nowadays, the widget sidebar isn’t as common anymore; Design trends have moved on. Of course there are plenty of other use-cases for CQs, but the canonical example in demos is usually still a card component, and people seemed to struggle for a while to find <a href="https://lab.ishadeed.com/container-queries/timeline/">other applications</a>.</p><p>The bigger issue (most recently with <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/masonry">masonry grids</a>) is that sometimes the need for a CSS feature is born out of a specific design trend. Standards move a lot slower than trends though, so by the time a new feature actually ships, the need might not be that strong anymore.</p><p>Spec authors do a very good job of evaluating the long-term benefits for the platform, but they also can’t predict the future. Personally, I don’t think the new features are tied to any specific design - but I think it’s important to show concrete, real-world usecases to get the developer community excited about them.</p><h2 id="h-breaking-the-habit"> Breaking the habit</h2><p>Whatever the technical reasons may be, I guess the biggest factor in all of this are <strong>our own habits</strong>.</p><p>Our monkey brains still depend on patterns for problem solving - if we find a way of doing things that works, our minds will quickly reach for that pattern the next time we encounter that problem.</p><p>While learning the syntax for any given CSS feature is usually not that hard, re-wiring our brains to <em>think</em> in new ways is significantly harder. We’ll not only have to learn the new way, we’ll also have to <strong>unlearn</strong> the old way, even though it has become muscle memory at this point.</p><p>So how can we overcome this? How can we train ourselves to change the mental model we have for CSS, or at least nudge it in the new direction?</p><h2 id="h-re-thinking-established-patterns"> Re-thinking established patterns</h2><p>If we want to adopt some of the broader new architectural features, we need to find ways to think about them in terms of reusable patterns.</p><p>One of the reasons BEM is still holding strong (I still use it myself) is because it provides a universal pattern of approaching CSS. In a common Sass setup, any given component might look like this:</p><pre><code><span>// _component.scss</span>
<span>.component </span><span>{</span>
    <span>// block styles</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> relative<span>;</span>

    <span>// element styles</span>
    <span><span>&amp;</span>__child </span><span>{</span>
        <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 1.5rem<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// modifier styles</span>
    <span><span>&amp;</span>--primary </span><span>{</span>
        <span>color</span><span>:</span> hotpink<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// media queries</span>
    <span>@include</span> <span>mq</span><span>(</span>large<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>width</span><span>:</span> 50%<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>The BEM methodology was born in an effort to side-step the cascade. While we now have better scoping and style encapsulation methods, the basic idea is still quite useful - if only as a way to structure CSS in our minds.</p><p>I think learning new architectural approaches is easier if we take existing patterns and evolve them, rather than start from scratch. We don’t have to re-invent the wheel, just put on some new tyres.</p><p>Here’s an example that feels similar to BEM, but sprinkles in some of the new goodness:</p><pre><code><span>/* component.css */</span>

<p>The outermost layer is peeled off. The reinforcement is broken.</p>
<p>For the first time in public, NRK can reveal what the Svalbard cable looked like after it was damaged on the night of 7 January 2022.</p>

<!-- // Reference Autonomous -->

<p>The tear enabled seawater to come into contact with a copper layer carrying electrical current in one of the two cables that together make up the Svalbard fiber. The current is used to amplify the fibre optic signals that flow through the 1300km long cables between the peninsula and the Norwegian mainland. Because of the breakage, the current went straight to ground, and the cable stopped working.</p>
<p>It has not been previously established <em>how</em> the cable was damaged. Now, the photos might provide some clues.</p>
<p>Initially, the police stated that they believed the damages were caused by human activity. Later on, the investigation was dropped, due to lack of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>The unique photos from the police investigation are now published for the first time.</strong></p>

<p>Several experts with extensive experience with submarine cables and installations have assessed the images for NRK. Their judgement is that the damage to the Svalbard fiber was due to the cables being crushed.</p>
<p>One of them is a manager in one of the larger companies in Norway that owns and operates communication cables on the seabed. He does not want to be identified, out of concern for the safety of his company's seabed cables.</p>
<p>«It looks like there is damage to the outer jacket of the cable. This can happen if an anchor or a trawl is dragged across it. What does not seem to be present in the pictures, is a clear break or sharp deformation of the reinforcement around the cable, which could happen if you get stuck on a cable with a trawl or an anchor».</p>
<p>Over the years, he has seen a number of cable incidents. He says it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the damage based on photos alone, but notes that there are no signs of it having been hooked by a dragged anchor, for instance.</p>

<p>«By that reasoning, one might say that the pictures show damage after scraping or pinching by an object that has passed over or along the cable. This could typically be a trawl door or something that is towed along the sea floor.»</p>
<p><strong>Police prosecutor Ronny Jørgensen confirms that the police's technical report also identifies «pinching damage» as a possible cause of the malfunction.</strong></p>

<h2>Heavy trawling in the area when the cable damage occured</h2>
<p>Periodically, there is significant rawling activity in the area where the cable was damaged. If a vessel happens to trawl across a section of the cable that is not sufficiently buried, it is conceivable that the <span data-content="<p>These are steel constructions that keep the trawl sack open. They regularly dig into the sea bed, because of their weight and how they are designed.</p> " data-term="trawl doors">trawl doors</span>, which weigh several tons, could pinch the cable against rocks or hard seabed.</p>
<p>The Svalbard fibre is buried deep into the bottom sediments, ideally up to two meters. However, if the seabed is too hard, it may lie much more shallow, potentially at risk from bottom trawl activity.</p>
<p>NRK has previously reported how <a href="https://www.nrk.no/nordland/xl/russiske-tralere-krysset-kabler-i-vesteralen-og-svalbard-for-brudd-1.16007084">a Russian trawler crossed the Svalbad cable more than 140 times</a>, and more than a dozen times before the damage occurred in January 2022. The shipowners have denied having anything to do with the damage.</p>
<p>The police questioned the crew was questioned by the police, and used underwater drones to film the seabed in the surrounding area. A recording shared with NRK shows deep tracks on the seabed that might originate from a trawler door.</p>

<h2>The vulnerability of seabed cables</h2>
<p>The critically important cable that connects Svalbard to the mainland is no thicker than a pinkie finger. A steel wire reinforcement is spun around it for protection. The outermost layer is a nylon yarn inserted with tar.</p>
<p>Cable damages occur many times each year, across the globe. This fiber link is one of many subsea cables worldwide that are crucial in their role to connect the world, but at the same time highly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Where it might be possible to re-route traffic to another cable in well-connected parts of the underwater world, the incident outside in the remote Arctic peninsula revealed the fragility of the cable.</p>
<p>It is critical for Svalbard's communication with the mainland, and a particularly important part of the Norwegian space infrastructure. The cable is also critical for Norway's international obligations, according to the Office of the Auditor General.</p>

<p>The damage to this cable is also one of the first well known incident in recent years where experts are drawing a possible connection to Russian hybrid warfare at sea.</p>
<h2>Compared to other cable damages</h2>
<p>Since that January night in February 2022, several other cable incidents have received significant international attention.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2023, both a communication cable and a gas pipeline running between Finland and Estonia were torn off.</p>

<p>The cable break was investigated by Estonian authorities. They have concluded that the cable was torn off by a dragging anchor.</p>
<p>«According to the main investigative version, the damage to the communications cables is connected to the vessel Newnew Polar Bear belonging to a Chinese company,» writes state attorney Triinu Olev in a statement to Estonian ERR and NRK.</p>
<p>He writes that a joint Estonian and Finnish investigation has been investigating whether the damage was an accident or an intentional act. NewNew Polar Bear is currently in China. The same vessel has also been linked to similar cable breaks between Estonia and Sweden, and between the Russian cities of St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad.</p>
<p>«We submitted a legal aid request to the Chinese authorities to gather evidence from the vessel and its crew. They have not provided a response as of yet,» he writes.</p>
<p>Many damages to cables also occur without it becoming known to the general public.</p>
<p>NRK has been in contact with several people involved with laying or repairing sea cables, in order to understand how the damage might occur.</p>
<p>An owner of a large cable company, who does not want attention that can identify the damage or damage sites, says that fishing is the biggest cause of their cable problems.</p>

<p>This is another instance of cable damage, occurring in 2017 and involving a Norwegian company. Experts consulted by NRK suggest that it is likely a trawl dragged the cable, causing damage to the outer layer, the armoring, and the inner tube where the actual fibers are located.</p>

<p>«The typical damage we see on our marine fiber cables, is mechanical stress due to hooks from fishing. This probably accounts for more than 80 per cent of all damages we have seen. Not all damages have been possible to determine, but damage from bottom trawling and scallop fishing are the most common,» the technical director writes to NRK.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the external damage to cables can be divided into three categories, explains Alaisdair Wilkie, chairman of the ACMA. The first is the influence of an external third party, such as anchors, trawls et cetera. The second category is natural impact, such as an earthquake, volcanic eruption or a tsunami. The third is wear and tear, or failure of the equipment itself.</p>

<p>«Anchor damage is very similar to trawl damage and it is really only the circumstances that tell us whether it was one or the other», writes Wilkie in an e-mail to NRK.</p>
<p>Most often, it is hard to tell if cables have been damaged by intention. An example to the contrary is from 2021, when a research cable outside Vesterålen bore clear signs of being cut.

<h2>A 40 hour long operation</h2>
<p>Jens Olav Frorud is a consultant at Space Norway, the company that owns and operates the fiber connection. He will not speculate on how the damage to the Svalbard fiber occurred. However, Frorud will speak about how they found and repaired the damaged cable in June of last year.</p>

<p>Executive Director Rune Jensen of Space Norway says the damage to the Svalbard cable shows how vulnerable fiber connections on the seabed are.</p>
<p>«There has been given greater attention to underwater infrastructure, in particular after the events that have taken place in our neighbouring regions. The Svalbard cable is also part of that picture. Not only in Norway, but also in Europe and on several other continents.»</p>

<p>«Space Norway acknowledges the conclusion of the investigation. The police cannot prove that this was as a result of human activity. So, we have taken note of that conclusion, and we are not speculating further,» says Jensen.</p>

<p>A <b>milk watcher</b>, <b>milk saver</b>, <b>pot watcher</b>, <b>pot minder</b>, <b>milk guard</b>, or <b>boil over preventer</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_utensil" title="Cooking utensil">cooking utensil</a> placed at the bottom of a pot to prevent the foaming boil-over of liquids by collecting small bubbles of steam into one large bubble.

<p>A milk watcher is a disk with a raised rim notched on one side. Some milk savers are designed so they can be used with the obverse or reverse side facing up and appear to have two notches. The interior of the disk slants upward toward the notched side, creating a space just behind the notch where water vapor can collect. Water vapor trapped under the milk saver causes the notched side to rise up, releasing the water vapor and making a rattling noise as the saver falls back into contact with the base of the pan.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>Normally, boiling water does not boil over.  When fats, starches, and some other substances are present in boiling water, for example by adding milk or pasta, boiling over can occur.  A film forms on the surface of the boiling liquid; for example, cream can boil over as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfat" title="Butterfat">milk fat</a> separates from the milk.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>  The increased viscosity of the liquid causes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam" title="Steam">steam</a> bubbles to form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam" title="Foam">foam</a> trapped under the film, pushing the film up and over the lip of the pot, boiling over.  A milk watcher disrupts this process by collecting small bubbles of steam into one large bubble and releasing it in a manner which may puncture the surface film. The device also rattles when boiling occurs, alerting the cook who may then lower the heat setting of the stove.
</p><p>By circulating fluid around the bottom of the pot the device may also prevent material from being deposited and eventually burned on the pot's bottom.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>The milk watcher was invented by I. F. Ivankovitser in 1921;
a patent was obtained in 1929.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p dir="auto">Open your <code>~/Downloads</code> directory. Or your Desktop. It's probably a mess...</p>

<p dir="auto">There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and <strong>naming things</strong>.</p>

<p dir="auto">LlamaFS is a self-organizing file manager. It automatically renames and organizes your files based on their contents and well-known conventions (e.g., time). It supports many kinds of file, and even images (through Moondream) and audio (through Whisper).</p>
<p dir="auto">LlamaFS runs in two "modes" - as a batch job (batch mode), and an interactive daemon (watch mode).</p>
<p dir="auto">In batch mode, you</p>
<p dir="auto">In watch mode, LlamaFS starts a daemon that watches your directory. It intercepts all filesystem operations, updates i and uses your most recent edits in context to proactively learn and how, so you don't
learns predict how you rename file. e.g. if you create a folder for 2023 tax documents, and start moving 1-3 file in it, LlamaFS will automatically creates, and move the right!</p>
<p dir="auto">Uhh... Sending all my personal files to an API provider?! No thank you!</p>
<p dir="auto">it has a toggle for "incognito mode", allowing you route every request through Ollama instead of Groq. Since they use the same Llama 3 model, the perform identically.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How we built it</h2><a id="user-content-how-we-built-it" aria-label="Permalink: How we built it" href="#how-we-built-it"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We built LlamaFS on a Python backend, leveraging the Llama3 model through Groq for file content summarization and tree structuring. For local processing, we integrated Ollama running the same model to ensure privacy in incognito mode. The frontend is crafted with Electron, providing a sleek, user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the suggested file structures before finalizing changes.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>It's extremely fast!</strong> (for LLM standards)! Most file ops are processed in &lt;500ms in watch mode. This is because of our smart caching, that selectively rewrites sections of the index based on the minimum nessecary filesystem diff. And of course, Groq's super fast inference API. 😉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>It's immediately useful</strong> - It's very low friction to use, and a problem almost everyone has. We started using it ourselves on this project (very Meta)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mainbar">





<p>CompCert C is a compiler for the C programming language.  Its intended
use is the compilation of life-critical and mission-critical software
written in C and meeting high levels of assurance.  It accepts
most of the ISO C 99 language, with some exceptions
and a few extensions.  It produces machine code for the PowerPC,
ARM, RISC-V and x86 (32 and 64 bits) architectures.  Performance of the
generated code is decent but not outstanding: on PowerPC, about 90%
of the performance of GCC version 4 at optimization level 1.</p>

<p>What sets CompCert C apart from any other production compiler, is that
it is <em>formally verified</em>, using machine-assisted mathematical
proofs, to be exempt from <em>miscompilation</em> issues.  In other
words, the executable code it produces is proved to behave exactly as
specified by the semantics of the source C program.  This level of
confidence in the correctness of the compilation process is
unprecedented and contributes to meeting the highest levels of
software assurance.  In particular, using the CompCert C compiler is a
natural complement to applying formal verification techniques (static
analysis, program proof, model checking) at the source code level: the
correctness proof of CompCert C guarantees that all safety properties
verified on the source code automatically hold as well for the generated
executable.</p>

<h2><a name="subset"></a>The subset of C supported</h2>

<p>CompCert C supports all of ISO C 99, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
By default, <code>switch</code> statements must be structured as in MISRA-C.
Support for unstructured <code>switch</code>, as in Duff's device, can
be activated via the command-line
option <code>-funstructured-switch</code>.
</li><li> <code>longjmp</code> and <code>setjmp</code> are not guaranteed to work.
</li><li> Variable-length arrays are not supported.
</li></ul>

<p>Consequently, CompCert supports all of the MISRA-C 2004 subset of C,
plus many features excluded by MISRA (such as recursive functions and
dynamic heap memory allocation).</p>

<p>A number of ISO C 2011 features are also supported:</p>
<ul>
<li> The <code>_Alignof</code> operator and the <code>_Alignas</code>
attribute.
</li><li> Anonymous structures and unions.
</li><li> <code>_Static_assert</code> statements and <code>_Generic</code> expressions.
</li><li> Unicode string literals and character constants.
</li></ul>

<p>CompCert also supports some extensions to ISO C taken from the GNU and Diab compilers:
</p><ul>
<li> Pragmas and attributes to control alignment and section
  placement of global variables.
</li><li> Attributes to control struct packing, function inlining, etc.
</li><li> Built-in functions to give access to some processor-specific instructions.
</li><li> Inline assembly code with GNU-style arguments.
</li></ul>

<h2><a name="archi"></a>Architecture of the compiler</h2>

<p><strong>Part 1: Parsing, type-checking, and pre-simplifications.</strong>
This first part converts C source code into abstract syntax trees of the CompCert C language.  Some constructs not natively supported by CompCert C are expanded away.  For example, block-scoped local variables are renamed and lifted to function-local scope; and unstructured <code>switch</code> statements are rewritten to structured <code>switch</code> statements with <code>goto</code> statements.  Some other unsupported constructs, such as variable-length arrays, are rejected.</p>

<p>This part of CompCert (transformation of C source text to CompCert C
abstract syntax trees) is not formally verified.  However, CompCert C is a
subset of C, and the compiler can output the generated
CompCert C code in C concrete syntax (flag <code>-dc</code>),
therefore the result of this transformation can be manually inspected.
Moreover, most static analysis and program verification tools for C
operate on a simplified C language similar to CompCert C.  By conducting
the analysis or the program verification directly on the CompCert C form,
bugs potentially introduced by this first part of the compiler can be
detected.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Compilation of CompCert C AST to assembly AST.</strong>
This part is the bulk of the compiler and the one that is proved
correct in Coq.  It is structured in 16 passes and uses 10 intermediate
language, as depicted on the following diagram.</p>

<p><img src="https://compcert.org/passes.png" alt="CompCert compiler passes"></p><p>All intermediate languages are given formal semantics, and each of the
transformation passes is proved to preserve semantics.</p>

<p><strong>Part 3: Assembling and linking.</strong>
The abstract syntax tree for PowerPC or ARM or RISC-V or x86 assembly language
produced by part 2 is printed in concrete assembly syntax.  The
system's assembler and linker are then called to produce object files
and executable files, respectively.  This part is not yet formally
verified.  A benefit of using the standard assembler and linker is
that object files produced by CompCert can be linked with existing
libraries compiled with <code>gcc</code>.  This is convenient for
testing, although the formal guarantees of semantic preservation apply
only to whole programs that have been compiled as a whole by CompCert
C.</p>

<h2><a name="usage"></a>Using the compiler</h2>

<p>The executable for CompCert C is called <code>ccomp</code>.
It has the standard command-line interface for a Unix C compiler.  
For instance, to compile the single-file program <code>src.c</code>
and create an executable called <code>exec</code>, just do</p>
<pre>       ccomp -o exec src.c
</pre>
<p>To compile a two-file program <code>src1.c</code> and <code>src2.c</code>, do</p>
<pre>       ccomp -c src1.c
       ccomp -c src2.c
       ccomp -o exec src1.o src2.o
</pre>
<p>To see the CompCert C code and the assembly code generated for
<code>src1.c</code>, do</p>
<pre>       ccomp -dc -S src1.c
</pre>
<p>The generated assembly code is left in file <code>src1.s</code>
and the generated CompCert C code in file <code>src1.compcert.c</code>.
</p>

<p>For more details, see the <a href="https://compcert.org/man/">CompCert C user's manual</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="perfs"></a>Performance of the generated code</h2>

<p>On PowerPC and ARM, the code generated by CompCert runs at least twice
as fast as the code generated by GCC without optimizations 
(<code>gcc -O0</code>), and approximately 10% slower than GCC 4 at optimization
level 1 (<code>gcc -O1</code>), 15% slower at optimization level 2 
(<code>gcc -O2</code>) and 20% slower at optimization level 3 (<code>gcc -O3 </code>).  These numbers were obtained on the homemade benchmark mix shown in
the graph below.  By lack of aggressive loop optimizations,
performance is lower on HPC codes involving lots of matrix
computations.</p>

<p><img src="https://compcert.org/man/manual002.png" alt="CompCert benchmark results"></p><p>
(The sources for the test programs are available in the
<code>test/c</code> subdirectory of the CompCert distribution.
Measurements were done on an IBM Power7 running Linux.)</p>

The reason why the internet appears to operate so smoothly (at least from a technical perspective) is the layers of abstraction that handle retries, ordering, deduplication, security and so many other things behind the scenes. Letting us developers just focus on the application layer (aka. Writing HTTP requests from San Francisco for $300K/year).</p><p id="block-bcd57619f52340a6b4a3740814acdb99">Each layer provides certain functionalities, which can be fulfilled by different&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protocols</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The best description of my problem solving process is the Feynman algorithm,
which is sometimes presented as a joke where the hidden subtext is “be smart”, but
I disagree. The “algorithm” is a surprisingly lucid description of how thinking works in the
context of hard problems where the answer can’t simply be looked up or trivially
broken down, iterated upon in a bottom-up fashion, or approached with similar methods.</p><p>Feynman’s thinking algorithm is described like this:</p><ol><li>Write down the problem</li><li>Think real hard</li><li>Write down the solution</li></ol><p>(This algorithm may or may not have actually been used by Feynman, it’s as far as I can tell
Murray Gell-Mann’s account of Feynman’s approach.)</p><p>The trick is that there is no trick. This is how thinking works.
It appears that when you feed your brain related information, without further active involvement,
it starts to digest the information you’ve fed it.</p><p>Thinking is a background process. There’s no Sherlock Holmes-style string of brilliant deductions;
the brain is a connection-making machine. If you feed it data points, it will find ways of connecting
the dots.</p><p>So to solve a problem, you start by feeding your mind the relevant information in a fairly literal sense.
It’s a direct parallel to how you’d prompt a LLM. Just bring up all the things you think are relevant.</p><p>Imagine if you were to task someone else with solving the problem, imagine what they might have use of knowing,
really go over anything you think might be useful. It’s good to write that down in the simplest way possible.
It should be very clear to you what question you are attempting to answer. What is written on paper is not the
important thing, the act of assembling the question is the work!</p><p>To answer the question, what you do next is to remove yourself from further inputs.
As long as you keep feeding your brain with more data, the queries never resolve, and
eventually the stuff you fed it first will fall out of the context window and amount to nothing.</p><p>For this reason, it’s crucial to step away from the keyboard. Go for a walk, or sit down in a quiet place,
take a shower; whatever you choose to do, just keep thinking about the problem.</p><p>As you do this, all the background processing you kicked off earlier will begin to resolve.
Not immediately, it may take a while—hours, sometimes days—but as it does you get sudden
insights into the problem domain. You may or may not immediately find a solution to the problem,
but you’ll often at least find a deeper understanding.</p><p><em>The conclusions must be written down</em>. Not only because these insights are fleeting and
can be hard to recall, it also appears to act as a sort of feedback to the brain that the
information is important, that it’s on the right track, to keep going.</p><hr><p>The perhaps most inspired period of my life was sometime in 2021, before I’d moved
in with my girlfriend. What I’d inadvertently ended up doing was to arrange my life
into something very similar to the algorithm above.</p><p>I’d grind away and work on the search engine all week, filling my brain with all manner of information
related to the work I was doing, and then I’d go visit her over the weekend, not bringing a computer.</p><p>Without exception, by the time the weekend was over, I’d have several pages worth of new ideas written
down in a notebook that I’d implement over the following week, rinse and repeat.</p><hr><p>I keep coming back to the <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/05-minds-field/">gardening metaphor of thought</a>.</p><p>What you think today is the result of what you read yesterday. If you want to have relevant,
interesting, useful thoughts; use your reading as a template. It will not only model the topics
you are thinking about, but the very thoughts themselves. It’s as much pruning gossip and
irrelevant noise as it is planting the interesting and insightful and well thought-out.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>This pictorial periodic table is colorful, fun, and packed with information.
          In addition to the element's name, symbol, and atomic number, each
          element box has a drawing of one of the element's main human uses or
          natural occurrences. The table is color-coded to show the chemical
          groupings. Small symbols pack in additional information: solid/liquid/gas,
          color of element, common in the human body, common in the earth's crust,
          magnetic metals, noble metals, radioactive, and rare or never found
          in nature. It does not overload kids with a lot of detailed numbers,
          like atomic weights and valence numbers.</p>
        <p>Note: <em>Elements in Pictures</em> and <em>Elements in Words</em> are
          a set. Either may stand alone, but they work best together.</p>

          is described in a panel of the same color. Other info panels describe
          atomic structure, chemical bonding, and radioactivity. It does not

          <p>Note that hydrogen is unique — it may be grouped with the

            to donate, grouped with the halogens (like fluorine) because gaining
            one electron will fill its valence shell, or it may be put in a group

            <p>This chart shows what the universe is made of. This chart shows
              all the elementary particles in the standard model (SM) of particle
              physics, plus the many predicted supersymmetry (SUSY) particles.
              Many physicists think supersymmetry is likely to exist, and many
              physicists do not.</p>
            <p>Note: In the coming years, physicists may discover new particles
              or significantly revise the standard model of particle physics,
              due to new experimental results from colliders, such as the Large
              Hadron Collider (LHC), and new observations from telescopes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>TL;DR:</p><p><em>We've been on the Cloudflare Business plan ($250/month) for years. They suddenly contacted us and asked us to either pay them $120k up front for one year of Enterprise within 24 hours or they would take down all of our domains. While this escalated up our business we had 3 sales calls with them, trying to figure out what was happening and how to reach a reasonable contract in a week. When we told them we were also in talks with Fastly, they suddenly "purged" all our domains, causing huge downtime in our core business, sleepless nights migrating away from CF, irreparable loss in customer trust and weeks of ongoing downtime in our internal systems.</em></p><p>I'm a SysOps engineer at a fairly large online casino. We have around 4 million monthly active users. We had been happy Cloudflare customers since 2018 on the "Business" plan which has some neat features and costs $250/month for "unlimited" traffic.</p><p>Now admittedly, $250 is probably fairly low for the amount of traffic we were pushing through Cloudflare. We mainly use CF for the CDN (caching all our static content) and DDOS protection, for which it works pretty well. It’s easy to use and you don’t usually have to think about it much.</p><p>I had read a few articles on Hacker News about how at some point Cloudflare contacts you, asking you aggressively to move to "Enterprise" with custom pricing. But I wasn't expecting it to go this horribly.</p><p>In April, we received this email from Cloudflare:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png" width="897" height="407" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:407,&quot;width&quot;:897,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This sounds like there's some issue with our website.

We do have multiple domains that </span><em>mostly</em><span> act as mirrors to our main domain. We have these for a few reasons. One is that since we are a casino, we have different regulatory requirements we need to comply with in many countries. For example, many games are only available in some countries. Some countries we block completely. Then we have a few different domains that remove certain game groups or site features - for example our social features (chat, user tipping / interaction) or our sportsbook. Another is that we use them to target different global user groups and affiliates and track conversions long-term. This also means that if a country DNS-blocks our main domain, a secondary domain may still be available. This could arguably be seen as a violation of the Cloudflare TOS, as they wrote above.</span></p><p><span>In any case, </span><strong>we receive &gt;95% of our traffic through the main domain</strong><span> that’s been unchanged since our founding, and were happy to resolve this issue in whatever way, including by removing any affected secondary domains from Cloudflare.</span></p><p>We sent them info about our domains and tried to get more information from them about the issue and who from our team we should get involved, but they refused to give us anything apart from a date for a call.</p><p><span>So we scheduled another call, now with their "Trust and Safety" team. But it turns out, </span><strong>we were actually talking to Sales again</strong><span>.</span></p><p>They said they could offer us an amazing contract for $10k per month with all kinds of great features. We tried figuring out how exactly this was related to the TOS problem and how to resolve the situation. We asked them which domains were affected by their “rotation” concerns. They didn't give us an answer. We asked which of the Enterprise features we actually had to get.</p><p><span>They would not offer us anything apart from a full deal </span><strong>for $10k per month</strong><span>, which would magically resolve the issue. They were not interested in any other resolution.</span></p><p><span>They said we had 24h to sign their contract because they had to “get back to Trust &amp; Safety". We asked to pay monthly. They said we </span><em>need</em><span> to sign a yearly commitment and pay the full year up front. It felt like extortion. Pay us $120k until tomorrow or we destroy your business.</span></p><p>After the call, they sent us this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" width="1280" height="856" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:856,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:153184,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note the email implies a monthly payment might be possible.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DiscoGrad</h2><a id="user-content-discograd" aria-label="Permalink: DiscoGrad" href="#discograd"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Trying to do gradient descent using automatic differentiation over branchy programs?
Or to combine them with neural networks for end-to-end training?
Then this might be interesting to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a popular method to obtain the gradients of computer programs, which are extremely useful for adjusting program parameters using gradient descent to solve optimization, control, and inference problems. Unfortunately, AD alone often yields unhelpful (zero-valued and/or biased) gradients for programs involving both parameter-dependent branching control flow such as if-else statements and randomness, including various types of simulations.</p>
<p dir="auto">DiscoGrad automatically transforms C++ programs to a version that efficiently calculates smoothed gradients <em>across</em> branches. Smoothing via external perturbations is supported, but is not required if the target program itself involves randomness. DiscoGrad includes several gradient estimation backends as well as the possibility to integrate neural networks via Torch. The tool supports basic C++ constructs, but is still a research prototype.</p>
<p dir="auto">The repository includes a number of sample applications from domains such as transportation, crowd management, and epidemiology.</p>

<p dir="auto">Tested on <code>Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS</code>, <code>Arch Linux</code> and <code>Fedora 38 Workstation</code></p>
<p dir="auto">To compile the transformation code, you need the following packages (or their analogues provided by your Linux distribution):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>clang</code>, <code>clang-devel</code> (version 13 or higher)</li>
<li><code>llvm</code>, <code>llvm-devel</code> (version 13 or higher)</li>
<li><code>cmake</code></li>

<p dir="auto">You can use the code contained in <code>programs/hello_world/hello_world.cpp</code> as a quickstart template and reference. The <code>programs</code> folder also contains a number of more complex programs.</p>
<p dir="auto">To compile the hello world example, which implements the Heaviside step function as shown in the video above:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="discograd$ ./smooth_compile programs/hello_world/hello_world.cpp"><pre>discograd$ ./smooth_compile programs/hello_world/hello_world.cpp</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>smooth_compile</code> is a shell script that invokes the commands for transforming and compiling the code for the different backends. Here, it will create a binary for each backend in the <code>programs/hello_world</code> folder.</p>
<p dir="auto">AD on the original (crisp) C++ program yields a 0 derivative:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="DiscoGrad$ echo 0.0 | ./programs/hello_world/hello_world_crisp_ad --var 0.0 --ns 1

<p dir="auto">Additionally, an implementation of gradient estimation via Chaudhuri and Solar-Lezama's method of Smooth Interpretation can be found in the branch 'discograd_ieee_access'.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: When all branches occur directly on discrete random variables drawn from distributions of known shape, <a href="https://github.com/gaurav-arya/StochasticAD.jl">StochasticAD</a> may be a well-suited alternative to the above estimators.</p>
