<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="580" src="https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/kanban-1-1024x580.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/kanban-1-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/kanban-1-400x227.jpg 400w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/kanban-1-768x435.jpg 768w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/kanban-1-1536x870.jpg 1536w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/kanban-1-2048x1161.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When people say Kanban, they tend to think of a specific set of practices. Whiteboards &amp; sticky notes (both almost universally virtual). Tasks moving through columns that represent workflow. Every now and then, WIP limits even.</p>



<p>As often as we do it with other things, it reduces a broader principle to a set of oversimplified techniques, which, in turn, tend to underdeliver in many contexts.</p>



<h2>Kanban</h2>



<p>In its original meaning, Kanban represented a visual signal. The thing that communicated, well, something. It might have been a need, option, availability, capacity, request, etc.</p>



<p>In our Kanban systems, the actual Kanban is a sticky note.</p>



<p>It represents work, and given its closest environment (board, columns, other stickies, visual decorators), it communicates what needs, or needs not, to be done.</p>



<p>If it’s yellow, it’s a regular feature. If there’s a blocker on it, it requests focus. If there’s a long queue of neighbors, it suggests flow inefficiency. If it’s a column named “ready for…” it communicates available work and/or handoff.</p>



<p>A visual signal all the way.</p>



<h2>Visual Signals</h2>



<p>Let’s decouple ourselves from the most standard Kanban board design. Let’s forget columns, sticky notes, and all that jazz.</p>



<p>Enters Kasia, our office manager at Lunar. One of the many things Kasia takes care of is making sure we don’t run out of kitchen supplies. The tricky part is that when you don’t drink milk yourself, it becomes a pain to check the cupboard with milk reserves every now and then to ensure we’re stocked.</p>



<p>Then, one day, I found this.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/milk-kanban-1-1024x681.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/milk-kanban-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/milk-kanban-1-400x266.jpg 400w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/milk-kanban-1-768x510.jpg 768w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/milk-kanban-1-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/milk-kanban-1-2048x1361.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>A simple index card taped to the last milk carton in a row stating, “Bring me to Kasia.” That’s it.</p>



<p>In the context, it really says that:</p>



<ul>
<li>we’re running out of (specific kind of) milk</li>



<li>we want to restock soon</li>



<li>there’s enough time to make an order (we don’t drink that much of cappuccinos and macchiatos)</li>
</ul>



<p>But it’s just a visual signal. Kanban at its very core.</p>



<h2>Simplicity is the King</h2>



<p>What Kasia designed is a perfect Kanban system. It relies on visual signals, which are put in the context. Even better, unlike most Kanban boards I see across teams, the system is self-explanatory. Everything one needs to know is written on the index card.</p>



<p>That’s, by the way, another characteristic of a good Kanban system. It should be as simple as possible (but not simpler). Our workflow representations <a href="https://brodzinski.com/2011/01/kanban-board-keep-it-simple.html">tend to get more and more complex over time by themselves</a>; we don’t need to make them so from the outset.</p>



<p>It’s a safe assumption that, almost always, there’s a simpler visualization that would work just as well. We, process designers, often fall into the trap of overengineering our tools.</p>



<p>And it’s a healthy wake-up call when someone who knows close to nothing about our fancy stuff designs a system that we would unlikely think of. One that is a perfect implementation of the original spirit, even if it doesn’t follow any of the common techniques.</p>



<p>Because it’s all about <a href="https://brodzinski.com/2014/08/practices-principles-values.html">principles, not practices</a>.</p>



<p>That’s what we can learn from Milk Kanban.</p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential.
                    This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique.
                    We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $$\mathrm{DyT}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \tanh(\alpha \boldsymbol{x}),$$ as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers.
                    DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, S-shaped input-output mappings.
                    By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning.
                    We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models.
                    These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.

                            <p>Our analysis shows that layer normalization (LN) in Transformers generates input-output mappings that closely resemble scaled tanh functions. In the earlier layers, these mappings are mostly linear. However, in deeper layers, they take on distinct S-shaped curves characteristic of tanh functions.</p>

<p>You’ve got a monopoly on lemonade because you pay all the grocery stores to be the default lemonade. </p>



<p>So we’re going to force you sell your car. </p>



<p>What’s with the weird redirect? If the monopoly is directly caused by paying the grocery stores for placement, then stop <em>that part.</em> </p>



<p>We can see this exact redirect happening in the ruling in the U.S. vs Google court case.</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. </p><p>[…]</p><p>For years, Google has secured default placements through distribution contracts. It has entered into such agreements with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers, and wireless carriers.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points. </p></div>
<cite>Judge Mehta</cite></blockquote>



<p>In the document:</p>







<p>It’s spelled out quite clearly that being the default is the monopolistic part and that’s caused by paying for it (which is then self-perpetuating as the placement is so valuable, the money generated by it pays for those default placements.)</p>



<p>Fair enough! Let’s stop that. </p>



<p>Let’s stop the monopoly by telling Google they can’t pay (certain? all?) companies to be the default search engine anymore. A step further could be forcing browsers should ask users what they want their default search engine to be.</p>



<p>This would be in line with how Apple was forced to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/">allow for browser choice</a>:</p>

<p>That’s a straight line from problem to solution. </p>



<p>A weird curvy-ass line between problem and solution is this strange solution that is being relentlessly proposed that Google should be forced to <em>sell Chrome.</em></p>



<p>There is a recent round of news covering this that all point to the curvy-ass-line solution. </p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/03/11/google-sell-chrome-doj-antitrust/82277792007/">USA Today</a>: “Google&nbsp;will have to part with its dominant Chrome browser if&nbsp;the U.S. Department of Justice&nbsp;has its way.”</li>



<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-doj-still-wants-google-to-divest-chrome/">WIRED</a>: “the Department of Justice reiterated that Google should stop paying partners for search placement—and divest its dominant Chrome browser.”</li>



<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/doj-google-must-sell-chrome-android-could-be-next/">Ars Technica</a>: “the government maintains that Chrome must go if the playing field is to be made level again.”</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s true that Chrome ships with Google as the default search engine, because, ya know, they invested billions in Chrome and that’s how business works. But still, a more direct line from problem to solution is forcing default search engine choice, not a forced sale of Chrome itself. </p>



<p>Why do I care? The sale of Chrome is bad for the web.</p>



<p><a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2025/01/29/a-little-arm-chair-businessin-about-chrome/">I’ve written before</a> that Chrome is unusual in that it’s really only particularly useful to Google:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Users don’t pay for Chrome. There aren’t ads in Chrome. There is no&nbsp;<em>direct</em>&nbsp;business model for Chrome. Unlike Safari and Firefox, nobody writes checks to Chrome to make a certain search engine the default.</p>



<p>The value of Chrome is all tangential — it provides value to Google. Whoever buys it does not inherit that same tangential value, they would need to redirect what little of it they can somewhere else, likely fighting against the natural flow that has been baked into it since the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’m not saying Google shouldn’t be forced to sell Chrome just because it’s only valuable to Google. But I do think Google should be allowed to have a browser. Google is a web business, that’s their whole thing. They <em>made</em> a browser to invest in the web itself because what is good for the web is good for Google, and happens to be good for all of us. </p>



<p>Allow me to be more clear about why Chrome is good for all of us. </p>



<p>When you look at (or otherwise experience) anything on a digital device, you’re looking at an operating system. That operating system was probably made by a private company who has total control over it. They have the right to do that, but that operating system exists to serve that company only and entirely. </p>



<p>If you make a native app for mobile devices, it is at the pleasure of the companies who build mobile operating systems and you’ll do it with the technology they allow. Making an app for iOS vs Android is super different and the companies behind them and never going to shake hands and make it easier for developers. It’s largely the same making a native app for desktop computers. While there is a bit more freedom of what you can install there, making a macOS app and a Windows app is two entirely separate endeavors. </p>



<p>Not so with the web. The web is a set of protocols and languages and file formats and other technology that congeal to make digital experiences. No one company owns or controls it. It is designed to be open and it’s <em>good</em> when companies build new things and support web standards. It’s a modern miracle that we have such a thing and it’s on us to protect it. </p>



<p>If I go to a <em>website</em> on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, some Linux distro, my Samsung phone, or whatever device I have that has a web browser on it,<strong> it really is the same set of files</strong> that deliver that experience. You and I and every company in the world can build things once that go everywhere. That’s how it should be. It’s fair and efficient. It’s good for the world. It’s much better than a world where we are forced to build things only for companies proprietary operating systems.</p>



<p>Google, by virtue of having Chrome, invests heavily in <em>the web itself.</em> Not just Chrome-the-browser, but the web standards that power the web. I can’t claim to know every detail of that investment, but I personally know people employed by Google that literally just try to make the web better all day. </p>



<p>It’s not hard to poke around the W3C specs themselves and see them littered with Google employees. </p>

<p>And there are evangelists, and documentation writers, and other people who aren’t working directly on Chrome, but really the web itself. </p>



<p>Will Google continue to invest like this if they are forced to sell Chrome? It would be hard to blame them if they did not. </p>



<p>Assuming they find a buyer, that buyer will be scrambling to find a way to make that investment worth it. Will they be choosing to employ people who are just <em>abstractly making the web better?</em> I would think not. </p>



<p>The web will suffer should Google be forced to sell Chrome. I think a fair assumption that overall investment and contribution to the open web will take a dive. </p>



<p>Sure, there will be some canonical fork of Chromium that keeps the sure-to-be-shunned buyer company out of it. Sure, the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-launch-of-supporters-of-chromium-based-browsers">Linux Foundation is getting their ducks in a row</a> to have contributors ready. But I can’t see it going well. </p>



<p>It won’t happen overnight, but stagnation will set in. A stagnated web is incentive for the operating system makers of the world to invest in pulling developers toward those proprietary systems. The browser wars sucked but at least we were still making websites. Being <em>forced</em> to make proprietary apps to reach people is an expensive prospect for the rest of us companies of the world, it will probably be done poorly, and we’ll all suffer for it. Heck, those operating systems aren’t required to ship a web browser <em>at all.</em></p>



<p>Whatever way this goes is bad for Mozilla. It’s possible Google is forced to not pay them for default search engine placement anymore, but even if they aren’t, you can imagine Google’s appetite for cutting that check is severely diminished. Mozilla’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/">2020 layoffs</a> that was publicly about reducing platform development still has me thinking they aren’t entirely serious about pushing the web forward, particularly with much less help. </p>



<p>And bad things happening for Mozilla is <em>also</em> bad for the web, so another domino may fall. Diminishing investments in the web generally will keep knocking over dominos. </p>



<p>I’ve typed enough. Google does all kinds of shitty stuff. Their surely the worst offenders of user surveillance on the web. Let’s not let them off the hook on that. Let’s see the DOJ get involved in that stuff. But forcing a sale of Chrome is not the way. </p>

But Lewis Ardern on our team <a href="https://semgrep.dev/playground/r/10Uz5qo/semgrep.tj-actions-compromised">wrote a Semgrep rule to find usages of tj-actions</a>, which you can run locally (without sending code to the cloud) via: <code>semgrep --config r/10Uz5qo/semgrep.tj-actions-compromised</code>. And if we find more information about what tags &amp; commits are affected, we can update the rule over time to become more precise about whether or not you could be impacted.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-blog-post=""><h2>Introduction</h2><p>We are actively investigating a critical security incident involving the tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action. While our investigation is ongoing, we want to alert users so they can take immediate corrective actions. We will keep this post updated as we learn more. <a href="https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner" target="_blank">StepSecurity Harden-Runner</a> detected this issue through anomaly detection when an unexpected endpoint appeared in the network traffic. Based on our analysis, the incident started around 9:00 AM March 14th, 2025 Pacific Time (PT) / 4:00 PM March 14th, 2025 UTC. If you need any help investigating this issue, please contact us at support@stepsecurity.io</p><p>Update 1: Most versions of tj-actions/changed-files are compromised.</p><p>Update 2:&nbsp;We have detected multiple public repositories have leaked secrets in build logs. As these build logs are public, anyone can steal these secrets. If you maintain any public repositories that use this Action, please review the recovery steps immediately.</p><p>Update 3: GitHub has removed the tj-actions/changed-files Action. GitHub Actions workflows can no longer use this Action.</p><h2>Summary of the incident</h2><p>‍<br>The tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action, which is currently used in over 23,000 repositories, has been compromised. In this attack, the attackers modified the action’s code and retroactively updated multiple version tags to reference the malicious commit. The compromised Action prints CI/CD secrets in GitHub Actions build logs. If the workflow logs are publicly accessible (such as in public repositories), anyone could potentially read these logs and obtain exposed secrets.</p><p>Our Harden-Runner solution flagged this issue when an unexpected endpoint appeared in the workflow’s network traffic. This anomaly was caught by Harden-Runner’s behavior-monitoring capability.</p><p>The compromised Action now executes a malicious Python script that dumps CI/CD secrets from the Runner Worker process. Most of the existing Action release tags have been updated to refer to the malicious commit mentioned below. Note: All these tags now point to the same malicious commit hash:<code>0e58ed8671d6b60d0890c21b07f8835ace038e67</code>, indicating the retroactive compromise of multiple versions.”</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>$ git tag -l | </span><span>while</span><span> read -r tag ; </span><span>do</span><span> git show --format=</span><span>"$tag: %H"</span><span> --no-patch $tag ; done | sort -k2

For example, the following GitHub search URL shows all instances of this Action in the Actions GitHub organization:<br><a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aactions%20tj-actions%2Fchanged-files%20Action&amp;type=code" target="_blank">https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aactions%20tj-actions%2Fchanged-files%20Action&amp;type=code</a><br>‍<br>Please note that this GitHub search does not always return accurate results. If you have dedicated source code search solutions such as SourceGraph, they could be more effective with finding all instances of this Action in use.</p><h3>Review GitHub Actions workflow run logs</h3><p>You should review logs for the recent executions of the Action and see if it has leaked secrets. Below is an example of how leaked secrets appear in build logs.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/67d4cca074c5030ca60fd281_Screenshot%202025-03-14%20at%205.39.11%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>This step is especially important for public repositories since their logs are publicly accessible.</p><h3>For StepSecurity Enterprise Customers</h3><p>The following steps are applicable only for StepSecurity enterprise customers.

<p>If that's not enough to deter you from sharing voice recordings with Amazon, note that the company allowed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/amazon-admits-that-employees-review-small-sample-of-alexa-audio/">employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings.</a> In 2019, Bloomberg reported that Amazon employees listened to as many as 1,000 audio samples during their nine-hour shifts. Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230">says</a> it allows employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems.</p>
<p>Other reasons why people may be hesitant to trust Amazon with personal voice samples include the previous usage of Alexa voice recordings <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/amazon-must-give-up-echo-recordings-in-double-murder-case-judge-rules/">in criminal trials </a>and Amazon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-amazon-ring-workers-illegally-spied-on-users-of-home-security-cameras/">paying a settlement</a> in 2023 in relation to allegations that it allowed "thousands of employees and contractors to watch video recordings of customers' private spaces" taken from Ring cameras, per the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<h2>Save recordings or lose functionality</h2>
<p>Likely looking to get ahead of these concerns, Amazon said in its email today that by default, it will delete recordings of users’ Alexa requests after processing. However, anyone with their Echo device set to “Don’t save recordings” will see their already-purchased devices’ Voice ID feature bricked. Voice ID <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYCXKY2AB2QWZT2X">enables Alexa</a> to do things like share user-specified calendar events, reminders, music, and more. Previously, Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230">has said</a> that "if you choose not to save any voice recordings, Voice ID may not work." As of March 28, broken Voice ID is a guarantee for people who don't let Amazon store their voice recordings.</p>
<p>Amazon's email says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alexa voice requests are always encrypted in transit to Amazon’s secure cloud, which was designed with layers of security protections to keep customer information safe. Customers can continue to choose from a robust set of controls by visiting the Alexa Privacy dashboard online or navigating to More &gt; Alexa Privacy in the Alexa app.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazon is forcing Echo users to make a couple of tough decisions: Grant Amazon access to recordings of everything you say to Alexa or stop using an Echo; let Amazon save voice recordings and have employees listen to them or lose a feature set to become more advanced and central to the next generation of Alexa.</p>
<p>However, Amazon is betting big that Alexa+ can dig the voice assistant out of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/">financial pit</a>. Amazon has publicly committed to keeping the free version of Alexa around, but Alexa+ is viewed as Amazon's last hope for keeping Alexa alive and making it profitable. Anything Amazon can do to get people to pay for Alexa takes precedence over other Alexa user demands, including, it seems, privacy.</p>
