<p dir="auto">This is an early prototype of using prompting strategies to improve the LLM's reasoning capabilities through o1-like reasoning chains. This allows the LLM to "think" and solve logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models. Unlike o1, all the reasoning tokens are shown, and the app uses an open source model.</p>
<p dir="auto">g1 is experimental and being open sourced to help inspire the open source community to develop new strategies to produce o1-like reasoning. This experiment helps show the power of prompting reasoning in visualized steps, not a comparison to or full replication of o1, which uses different techniques. OpenAI's o1 is instead trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using Chain of Thought, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex PhD-level problems.</p>
<p dir="auto">g1 demonstrates the potential of prompting alone to overcome straightforward LLM logic issues like the Strawberry problem, allowing existing open source models to benefit from dynamic reasoning chains and an improved interface for exploring them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h3><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">g1 powered by Llama3.1-70b creates reasoning chains, in principle a dynamic Chain of Thought, that allows the LLM to "think" and solve some logical problems that usually otherwise stump leading models.</p>
<p dir="auto">At each step, the LLM can choose to continue to another reasoning step, or provide a final answer. Each step is titled and visible to the user. The system prompt also includes tips for the LLM. There is a full explanation under Prompt Breakdown, but a few examples are asking the model to “include exploration of alternative answers” and “use at least 3 methods to derive the answer”.</p>
<p dir="auto">The reasoning ability of the LLM is therefore improved through combining Chain-of-Thought with the requirement to try multiple methods, explore alternative answers, question previous draft solutions, and consider the LLM’s limitations. This alone, without any training, is sufficient to achieve ~70% accuracy on the Strawberry problem (n=10, "How many Rs are in strawberry?"). Without prompting, Llama-3.1-70b had 0% accuracy and ChatGPT-4o had 30% accuracy.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h3><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p><p dir="auto">g1 is not perfect, but it can perform significantly better than LLMs out-of-the-box. From initial testing, g1 accurately solves simple logic problems 60-80% of the time that usually stump LLMs. However, accuracy has yet to be formally evaluated. See examples below.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Breakdown</h4><a id="user-content-breakdown" aria-label="Permalink: Breakdown" href="#breakdown"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First, a persona is added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You are an expert AI assistant that explains your reasoning step by step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Then, instructions to describe the expected step-by-step reasoning process while titling each reasoning step. This includes the ability for the LLM to decide if another reasoning step is needed or if the final answer can be provided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer.</p>

<p dir="auto">JSON formatting is introduced with an example provided later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Respond in JSON format with 'title', 'content', and 'next_action' (either 'continue' or 'final_answer') keys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In all-caps to improve prompt compliance by emphesizing the importance of the instruction, a set of tips and best practices are included.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Use as many reasoning steps as possible. At least 3. -&gt; This ensures the LLM actually takes the time to think first, and results usually in about 5-10 steps.</li>
<li>Be aware of your limitations as an llm and what you can and cannot do. -&gt; This helps the LLM remember to use techniques which produce better results, like breaking "strawberry" down into individual letters before counting.</li>
<li>Include exploration of alternative answers. Consider you may be wrong, and if you are wrong in your reasoning, where it would be. -&gt; A large part of the gains seem to come from the LLM re-evaluating its initial response to ensure it logically aligns with the problem.</li>
<li>When you say you are re-examining, actually re-examine, and use another approach to do so. Do not just say you are re-examining. -&gt; This encourages the prevention of the LLM just saying it re-examined a problem without actually trying a new approach.</li>
<li>Use at least 3 methods to derive the answer. -&gt; This helps the LLM come to the right answer by trying multiple methods to derive it.</li>
<li>Use best practices. -&gt; This is as simple as the "Do better" prompts which improve LLM code output. By telling the LLM to use best practices, or do better, it generally performs better!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">USE AS MANY REASONING STEPS AS POSSIBLE. AT LEAST 3. BE AWARE OF YOUR LIMITATIONS AS AN LLM AND WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO.

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Finally, after the problem is added as a user message, an assistant message is loaded to provide a standardized starting point for the LLM's generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Assistant: Thank you! I will now think step by step following my instructions, starting at the beginning after decomposing the problem</p>

<p>Two days ago, tech streamer and host of Code Therapy René Rebe was streaming one of many T2 Linux (his own custom distribution) development sessions from his office in Germany when he abruptly had to remove his microphone and walk off camera due to the arrival of police officers. The officers subsequently cuffed him and took him to the station for an hour of questioning, a span of time during which the stream continued to run until he made it back.</p><p>René Rebe and fans of his work can only guess what motivated this incident. Unfortunately, the police seemingly have no idea who did it and acted based on a tip sent with an email. Finding the perpetrators could take a while, and options will be fairly limited if they don't also live in Germany.&nbsp;</p><div data-nosnippet="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The tech industry is going through challenging times: from one side, funding dried up <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp?ref=peterszasz.com">due to the end of the Zero Interest-Rate Period</a>; on the other one, <a href="https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/how-ai-disrupts-tech-investing?ref=peterszasz.com">the rapid rise of AI disrupts previously safe domains and business models</a>. These forces are <strong>pushing companies to "wartime" mode</strong>, a concept I first read about in the works of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/David-B.-Black/author/B001KJ1JI2?ref=peterszasz.com">David B. Black</a>, some of which were published in "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19497794-wartime-software?ref=peterszasz.com">Wartime Software: Building Software when Speed Matters</a>"; or the <a href="https://a16z.com/peacetime-ceo-wartime-ceo?ref=peterszasz.com">Peacetime CEO / Wartime CEO</a> article from Ben Horowitz, similarly from more than a decade ago. </p><p>These works describe "wartime" as an existential fight for survival that requires a different type of leadership compared to the relative prosperity of "peacetime". Many of the principles outlined by both Horowitz and Black are as relevant as ever for Engineering Managers leading in today's climate. For EMs, wartime means leading low-morale teams through <strong>ambiguity, hard constraints, frequently changing goals, and intense pressure to perform</strong>. It can feel like working in a house on fire. What can an EM do in this situation? </p><p>Let's get back to the basics, and look at the role of an Engineering Manager first.</p><h2 id="the-three-focus-areas-of-an-engineering-manager">The three focus areas of an Engineering Manager</h2><ol><li>Ensuring <strong>delivery</strong> that's aligned with company goals;</li><li>Building and sustaining a <strong>high-performing engineering team</strong>;</li><li>Supporting the success and <strong>personal growth</strong> of the individuals on the team.</li></ol><p>Wartime doesn't change these fundamentals, but it does require some shifts in approach and priorities. Let's go through them by focus areas.</p><h2 id="focus-area-1-ensuring-goal-aligned-delivery">Focus Area 1: Ensuring Goal-Aligned Delivery</h2><p>In wartime, you need your team <strong>laser-focused on shipping what matters most, now</strong>. Your organization might not have the luxury of years of runway, and the environment you're operating in is rapidly changing. A few key things to get right:</p><p><strong>Ruthless prioritization is essential.</strong> Narrow the team's attention to the top few goals that are critical for the company's survival and success. Communicate these repeatedly and reinforce them through your own behavior. Be ready to say no and drop anything that doesn't directly contribute. It's hard because you'll also need to say "no" to genuinely valuable, profitable things, projects you were planning to work on, just to be able to deliver the ones that are the most impactful now. Mentally you might find it easier to categorize these projects as "not now".</p><p>Next, you need to <strong>empower the team to move fast</strong>. Decentralize decision-making authority as much as possible. Remove barriers in their way, slash approval layers, attack dependencies. "Perfection is the enemy of done" and "Better to ask for forgiveness than permission" are good guidance. </p><p>To enable quick decisions, ensure you are frequently and clearly giving high-level context to the team, so they are aligned on company objectives. Set up a clear process for them to rapidly get input on critical choices and transparently communicate the decision to keep everyone aligned. <strong>Bias heavily toward action</strong> - it's better to decide and be wrong sometimes than to paralyze the team with analysis.</p><p><strong>Protect the team's focus time</strong>. The chaos and uncertainties of wartime can be incredibly distracting. Set up processes to shield the team from constant interruptions so they can have deep, creative work sessions. Remove them from low-value meetings and relieve them from monotonous administrative duties. One effective technique is to establish a rotating "firefighter" role to singlehandedly deal with any incoming requests, represent the team in meetings, and handle the necessary amount of bureaucracy, allowing the rest to stay heads-down on the critical priorities.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>get in the trenches with your team</strong>. If you're a hands-on manager, wartime is when you can put some effort into technical tasks. Stay closely involved to understand the technical context, and help out where it makes sense. This can mean doing some code reviews, participating in pair programming, handling an incident, and even pushing small commits if that's what's needed. Make sure you're not taking the spotlight from your team members, and know that your impact in management areas can be magnitudes bigger than a small code cleanup.</p><p>It's important to note that these wartime actions will probably increase<strong> tech debt</strong> in your code. With the emphasis on velocity over quality, architectural compromises and maintenance shortcuts are often taken. To mitigate this, consider techniques like:</p><ul><li>Keeping a visible, prioritized backlog of tech debt items to revisit later</li><li>Allocating a small percentage of each sprint to debt paydown</li><li>Pairing tech debt work with feature development</li><li>Conducting regular architecture reviews to spot and address emerging issues</li><li>Encouraging engineers to flag risky shortcuts during code reviews</li></ul><p>You have more chance to succeed if your tech debt strategy is backward-looking, refactoring parts of the code that are causing concrete pain for developers today – as opposed to forward-looking, dreaming up grandiose plans for new frameworks that will be ready for any unknown challenge of the future. (Recognise that these challenges are unknown by definition, so your solution for them will be a hit-and-miss.) The risk of overengineering is real and can cripple developer performance significantly in a wartime era. </p><h2 id="focus-area-2-building-and-leading-the-team">Focus Area 2: Building and Leading the Team</h2><h3 id="retaining">Retaining</h3><p>To keep your team engaged and performing at their peak, <strong>don't neglect morale and energy</strong>. Celebrate quick wins, show frequent appreciation, praise the behavior you want to see. Acknowledge that the situation is tough, but project confidence that you'll get through it together.</p><p>One major pitfall to avoid is letting an <strong>"us vs. them" mentality</strong> take hold on the team. Naturally, the stress of painful decisions can erode trust in leadership and other departments, but reinforcing a negative mindset will hurt you more than the temporary warm camaraderie you'll enjoy by joining the chorus of cynics. </p><p>Don't dismiss or avoid the negative reactions, in fact, you should actively solicit concerns and input rather than waiting for issues to erupt. You cannot choose if people will discuss stressful events, but you can <strong>choose to be a part of these discussions</strong> or not. So never skip your one-on-one meetings, hold ad-hoc Q&amp;As, and maintain these as a safe, open forum for any topics. Share the "why" behind difficult decisions, even if you can't always explain all the details – and acknowledge what you don't know transparently. Assume good intent and extend empathy, even when tension is running high. <em>(I write more about this and related topics in </em><a href="https://peterszasz.com/how-to-represent-decisions-you-disagree-with/"><em>How To Represent Decisions You Disagree With</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p><strong>Focus on the positive aspects of the job that can be taken for granted</strong>, like the opportunity to work on cutting-edge challenges, the company's still existing perks and benefits, the amazing team you have, the chance to work with a modern tech stack, or how your product is helping its users. Showing your team how you appreciate what's still good can help with morale.</p><p>At the same time, <strong>accept that you won't be able to retain everyone</strong> through a stressful wartime period. If someone does decide to leave, support their decision and work to make the transition as smooth as possible for them and the remainder of the team.</p><h3 id="hiring">Hiring</h3><p>Yes, there is still hiring in wartime, though more limited than during the growth-heavy periods of peace. If for no other reason, you might need to backfill folks due to the increased attrition. When you receive a new headcount, you need to<strong> prioritize hiring experienced, self-sufficient, autonomous engineers</strong> who can tolerate (even better, strive) in high-stress environments and are experienced enough to contribute immediately. Tighten onboarding to the bare essentials and focus on deploying code fast. You don't have months to train, the company might not exist long enough to get back the investment in juniors if you focus on the long term now. </p><p>Fortunately for you, the current job market is full of experienced developers due to mass layoffs. However, expectations are still high (especially around compensation and remote work), and AI companies are paying above market rate to the best talent. These, and the massive work necessary to go through sometimes hundreds of applications make your work harder, so you need to get creative and proactive to attract great candidates. Some ideas:</p><ul><li>Leverage your network for referrals and backdoor references;</li><li>Emphasize anything that makes your company unique: its mission, product, tech stack, learning opportunities, compensation policies, hybrid friendliness, etc. Maybe someone out there is looking for the same exact criteria. </li><li>Partner closely with recruiters or the talent acquisition team to increase the quality of the first-level filtering, and to refine and expedite the hiring process;</li><li>Move quickly and decisively when you find a strong fit, to minimize the distraction of hiring on you and the team – but due to the current job market you have more luxury now than a few years ago. Consider allowing 2-3 candidates to pass through all rounds, and choose the best fit from them. Still, don't let this grow into indecisiveness, and don't drag the team into a long period of interviewing.</li></ul><h3 id="performance-management">Performance Management</h3><p>Wartime pressure can breed <strong>negativity</strong> that you'll need to manage carefully. Understand the context that may be contributing, like uncertainty around job security or maybe some additional personal issues. However, infectious negativity and lack of engagement are performance issues, so handle them accordingly: <strong>give clear feedback on actions and their impact</strong>, separate from any judgment of the individual. Avoid public confrontation, but set firm expectations. Try to redirect negative energy productively by reframing complaints into problems to solve. <em>(I write more about this topic in </em><a href="https://peterszasz.com/how-to-deal-with-negative-behaviour/"><em>How to Deal with Negative Behavior</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p>Crucially, <strong>hold everyone to the same standards</strong>, regardless of circumstances. You can't afford to make exceptions for someone just because they have key knowledge or skills you don't want to lose. Consistent accountability is essential for team cohesion and morale – and if you forget this, you might end up with a disengaged, demoralized team, and the underperforming key developer that you wanted to save might already be interviewing anyway.</p><h2 id="focus-area-3-supporting-individuals-to-succeed">Focus Area 3: Supporting Individuals to Succeed</h2><p>When the house is on fire, it's tempting to put personal development on the back burner <em>(no pun intended)</em>. But now is the time when your team members need to feel more than ever that you're still invested in their success, to help them stay engaged and motivated. The trick is to <strong>reframe growth to fit the wartime context</strong>.</p><p>Instead of formal skills training or career pathing, focus on maximizing each person's impact by leaning into their strengths. Help them see how this challenging period is <strong>an opportunity to stretch and step up</strong> in ways that will serve them well in the future.</p><p><strong>Call out the valuable, transferrable experience they're gaining</strong> by operating in this high-stakes environment. Emphasize that they're building "career security" - capabilities and experiences that will be valued anywhere - even if short-term "job security" may feel shaky and uncertain.</p><p><strong>Identify on-the-job learning opportunities</strong>, like giving someone the chance to lead an incident response or a high-visibility project. Critical mistakes can still be catastrophic, but because of the fast-changing nature of wartime work, it's easier to process smaller errors with a healthy learning mindset. <em>(Read more about </em><a href="https://peterszasz.com/celebrating-failure/"><em>Celebrating Failure</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p>Finally, don't forget to look for <strong>opportunities to display small gestures to show you care</strong> about your team members' personal well-being despite everything that's going on. Make the few team-building occasions count, or simply send a note acknowledging a tough week. A little goes a long way.</p><h2 id="finally-take-care-of-yourself-first">Finally: Take Care of Yourself First</h2><p>Leading in wartime is incredibly demanding. You won't be able to show up for your team if you're running on empty.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/thepatwalls/status/1835041188099113179">HOW TO SUCCEED IN MRBEAST PRODUCTION (leaked PDF)</a></strong>. Whether or not you enjoy MrBeast’s format of YouTube videos (here’s <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-youtube-cover-story-interview-1334604/">a 2022 Rolling Stone profile</a> if you’re unfamiliar), this leaked onboarding document for new members of his production company is a compelling read.</p>
<p>It’s a snapshot of what it takes to run a massive scale viral YouTube operation in the 2020s, as well as a detailed description of a very specific company culture evolved to fulfill that mission.</p>
<p>It starts in the most on-brand MrBeast way possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely believe if you attently read and understand the knowledge here you will be much better set up for success. So, if you read this book and pass a quiz I’ll give you $1,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything is focused very specifically on YouTube as a format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your goal here is to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. That’s the number one goal of this production company. It’s not to make the best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MrBeast definition of A, B and C-team players is one I haven’t heard before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A-Players are obsessive, learn from mistakes, coachable, intelligent, don’t make excuses, believe in Youtube, see the value of this company, and are the best in the goddamn world at their job. B-Players are new people that need to be trained into A-Players, and C-Players are just average employees. […] They arn’t obsessive and learning. C-Players are poisonous and should be transitioned to a different company IMMEDIATELY. (It’s okay we give everyone severance, they’ll be fine).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key characteristic outlined here, if you read between the hustle-culture lines, is learning. Employees who constantly learn are valued. Employees who don’t are not.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of stuff in there about YouTube virality, starting with the Click Thru Rate (CTR) for the all-important video thumbnails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what dictates what we do for videos. “I Spent 50 Hours In My Front Yard” is lame and you wouldn’t click it. But you would hypothetically click “I Spent 50 Hours In Ketchup”. Both are relatively similar in time/effort but the ketchup one is easily 100x more viral. An image of someone sitting in ketchup in a bathtub is exponentially more interesting than someone sitting in their front yard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creative process for every video they produce starts with the title and thumbnail. These set the expectations for the viewer, and everything that follows needs to be defined with those in mind. If a viewer feels their expectations are not being matched, they’ll click away - driving down the crucial Average View Duration that informs how much the video is promoted by YouTube’s all-important mystical algorithms.</p>
<p>MrBeast videos have a strictly defined formula, outlined in detail on pages 6-10.</p>
<p>The first minute captures the viewer’s attention and demonstrates that their expectations from the thumbnail will be met. Losing 21 million viewers in the first minute after 60 million initial clicks is considered a reasonably good result! Minutes 1-3, 3-6 and 6-end all have their own clearly defined responsibilities as well.</p>
<p>Ideally, a video will feature something they call the “wow factor”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An example of the “wow factor” would be our 100 days in the circle video. We offered someone $500,000 if they could live in a circle in a field for 100 days (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzuabZUd6c">video</a>) and instead of starting with his house in the circle that he would live in, we bring it in on a crane 30 seconds into the video. Why? Because who the fuck else on Youtube can do that lol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chapter 2 (pages 10-24) is about creating content. This is crammed with insights into what it takes to produce surprising, spectacular and very expensive content for YouTube.</p>
<p>A lot of this is about coordination and intense management of your dependencies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to look them in the eyes and tell them they are the bottleneck and take it a step further and explain why they are the bottleneck so you both are on the same page. “Tyler, you are my bottleneck. I have 45 days to make this video happen and I can not begin to work on it until I know what the contents of the video is. I need you to confirm you understand this is important and we need to set a date on when the creative will be done.” […] Every single day you must check in on Tyler and make sure he is still on track to hit the target date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also introduces the concept of “critical components”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical components are the things that are essential to your video. If I want to put 100 people on an island and give it away to one of them, then securing an island is a critical component. It doesn’t matter how well planned the challenges on the island are, how good the weather is, etc. Without that island there is no video.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Critical Components can come from literally anywhere and once something you’re working on is labeled as such, you treat it like your baby. WITHOUT WHAT YOU’RE WORKING ON WE DO NOT HAVE A VIDEO! Protect it at all costs, check in on it 10x a day, obsess over it, make a backup, if it requires shipping pay someone to pick it up and drive it, don’t trust standard shipping, and speak up the second anything goes wrong. The literal second. Never coin flip a Critical Component (that means you’re coinfliping the video aka a million plus dollars)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a bunch of stuff about communication, with a strong bias towards “higher forms of communication”: in-person beats a phone call beats a text message beats an email.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for this organization, video is a highly valued tool for documenting work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is more important, that one person has a good mental grip of something or that their entire team of 10 people have a good mental grip on something? Obviously the team. And the easiest way to bring your team up to the same page is to freaken video everything and store it where they can constantly reference it. A lot of problems can be solved if we just video sets and ask for videos when ordering things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we are on the topic of communication, written communication also does not constitute communication unless they confirm they read it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this bit about the value of consultants:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consultants are literally cheat codes. Need to make the world's largest slice of cake? Start off by calling the person who made the previous world’s largest slice of cake lol. He’s already done countless tests and can save you weeks worth of work. […] In every single freakin task assigned to you, always always always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a darker note from the section “Random things you should know”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not leave consteatants waiting in the sun (ideally waiting in general) for more than 3 hours. Squid game it cost us $500,000 and boys vs girls it got a lot of people out. Ask James to know more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to finish, this note on budgeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want money spent to be shown on camera ideally. If you’re spending over $10,000 on something and it won’t be shown on camera, seriously think about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m always interested in finding management advice from unexpected sources. For example, I love <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Feb/19/eleven-laws-showrunning/">The Eleven Laws of Showrunning</a> as a case study in managing and successfully delegating for a large, creative project.</p>
<p>I don’t think this MrBeast document has as many lessons directly relevant to my own work, but as an honest peek under the hood of a weirdly shaped and absurdly ambitious enterprise it’s legitimately fascinating.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday. <a href="https://www.gq.com/newsletter/subscribe?newsletterId=249017&amp;sourcecode=articleCTA" target="_blank">Sign up here to get it in your inbox.</a></em></p><p><strong>It’s a Saturday</strong> in a well-appointed room in a luxury hotel in a major American city and a man named Richard Overum has just escorted me from the lobby to brief me on my new identity. My directive: Embody a high roller. A man capable of signing a check for millions of dollars at a moment’s notice. And, most important, a man looking to make an investment. I need to look perfect, Overum explains. Because tonight, I’ll be shadowing him on a sting.</p><p>Richard Overum is not a member of law enforcement or a government official. He’s something else: a rarefied practitioner in a line of work he’s all but created for himself. He hunts businesspeople he suspects are breaking the law—a job that by virtue of oft-overlooked sections of federal law can end up paying remarkably well. Tucked into the Dodd-Frank Act, which Congress passed in the wake of the Bernie Madoff scandal and the economic calamity of the late aughts, are provisions meant to encourage people who spot signs of potential financial wrongdoing to come to the government with information. The incentive? If the agencies take enforcement action based on a tip resulting in sanctions in excess of $1 million, the law says, one or more whistleblowers can earn an award equal to 10 to 30 percent of what’s collected.</p><p>Whistleblower programs were established at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to manage and investigate tips, and the calculus for awards depends on multiple factors, including the value of the information in making the case. But the payouts can be enormous. Recent cases have rewarded SEC whistleblowers with $29 million, $38 million, and $104 million. Last year, the SEC cut its biggest check yet, issuing a payout of $279 million to one tipster who reportedly aided in a bribery case involving the Swedish telecom Ericsson that resulted in a more-than-billion-dollar settlement.</p><p>Between the start of the program in 2011 and the end of fiscal year 2023, the SEC has levied more than $6 billion in sanctions, and paid out close to $2 billion to whistleblowers. Overum’s share? Tens of millions, he says, between funds collected and those still pending.</p><p>The evidence he passes to whistleblower programs he gathers primarily by going undercover—persuading a would-be fraudster to reveal signs of a scheme by posing as a potential investor interested in getting in on the action. That’s why Overum and I have met in this hotel tonight: so I can join him for a meeting with someone he’s investigating.</p><p>For some time now, Overum has been compiling intel on Mike King, a real estate developer whose seemingly ostentatious lifestyle and possibly deceptive business practices have raised Overum’s suspicions. And so, under an assumed name, Overum has approached King about making an investment with him—a covert attempt at soliciting more information about his assets, and maybe uncovering signs of a potential fraud. They’ve been texting and chatting about the possibility of getting into business together, and tonight have decided to continue discussions in person. Overum has permitted me to watch him work, but there’s a catch: In order to not blow his cover, I’ll need to be undercover too. I have to play one of his business partners—another potential investor.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Of course, knowing my part isn’t enough. I have to look it: For Overum, sartorial embellishment is another part of the tradecraft. In the days prior, I’d cobbled together my nicest pair of jeans, a tailored button--down shirt that was gifted to me 10 years ago, and I’d even gotten my shoes shined at the airport on the way in. But I needed something more.</p><p>“Have a seat,” Overum tells me as he unzips a black backpack and produces two high-end watches. “This is an Omega Speedmaster Dark Side of the Moon, and this one is a Zenith Defy Classic,” he says. “See which one fits.”</p><p>I slip one on. “It looks great,” Overum says. “You’ll do great.”</p><p>“Are you nervous?” he asks.</p><p>“Yes,” I admit.</p><p>But as I look at Overum, he seems self--possessed—poised, almost. It’s as if all this—meeting King under a fake identity, preparing to expound at-length upon a business opportunity he has no real intention in investing in—is just another day at the office. And that’s probably because it is.</p><p>“Okay,” he says as we prepare to leave the hotel room. “Time to go to work.”</p><hr><p><strong>I haven’t told</strong> you what Overum looks like. Or where he lives. I’m not going to tell you what kind of car he drives or what teams he roots for. That’s because I’ve agreed to withhold key identifying details. “I want to keep doing this for as long as I can, so it’s very important that certain things about me remain a secret,” he tells me. “If you try looking me up on the internet right now, you won’t find a thing.”</p><p>What I can tell you about Richard Overum is that his name is not Richard Overum—that’s the kind of alias he might use in the field. “Richard Overum is a play on ‘dick over them,’ ” he tells me. While we were together, Overum used another alias, a moniker that I can’t reveal because he’s currently using it in yet another case. But I can tell you that it’s also phallic.</p><p>“So are your aliases all dick jokes?” I ask him.</p><p>He chuckles. “That’s right.” (Though not a dick joke, “Mike King” is also a pseudonym.)</p><p>Overum’s sense of humor—often childish—helps him add levity to his day-to-day, which is otherwise earnest and sometimes dangerous. He’s been working as a professional whistleblower for over a decade now, zigzagging the country to cozy up to suspects that he charms and cajoles with cunning, lies, and manipulation in order to coax from them the blueprints for any number of white--collar scams, from Ponzi schemes to prime bank frauds. As a motivator, the cash that he might collect is never far from Overum’s mind.</p><p>Back when it was instituted, in the post-Madoff era, the whistleblower programs were meant to bolster enforcement at underresourced government agencies. Authorities at the SEC and CFTC would now have help in the form of newly incentivized citizens. And in the most general sense, the program has worked as intended: In fiscal year 2023, the SEC received over 18,000 tips, and awarded nearly $600 million to 68 individual whistleblowers.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The vast majority of people providing tips to whistleblower programs do so only once in their life. They are not—as Overum is—repeat customers. Over the course of his career, Overum says that his tips, which can include hundreds of pages of evidence, have led to various regulatory agencies, including the SEC, taking action approximately 90 times. (An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on Overum’s claim, citing agency policy to not remark on “the existence or nonexistence of a possible whistleblower submission.”)</p><p>You may be wondering why someone who has such a great thing going would risk blowing it all up to talk to a journalist for a magazine story. That is, why go to such lengths—with the aliases and fancy clothes and watches, the anonymity, all the efforts to obscure his identity in my reporting—only to talk so openly about his process? Well, Overum says, he suspects his identity could be exposed one day, and it might only be a matter of time. There might only be so many whistles to blow before Richard Overum could be forced into the light. Giving up on this line of work is a nonstarter, so he’s got other plans in that event—training up a whole new corps of whistleblowers to follow in his footsteps, to start. So talking to me is a call to arms. Everyone, he says, should know about this program. And everyone should know where to find him.</p><p>At this point, leads reach Overum in a variety of ways. He has worked with a number of lawyers who specialize in representing whistle-blowers and who often point Overum in the direction of a potential target. “Sometimes it’s employees of companies who see a problem but aren’t comfortable being a whistleblower,” he says. “Sometimes it’s from somebody who just has a bad feeling about somebody and what they’re doing.”</p><p>Overum has also created an email tip line that he operates (activistwhistleblowers@proton.me), spreading it through his network of lawyers and confidants. Lately, he’s been looking for potential targets on social media. If he sees people posing on Instagram with yachts, say, or cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, while also trying to raise money, he says, bells immediately go off. “They just seem too good to be true,” says Overum. He notes that he peruses so many accounts focused on ostentatious living that his algorithm is now flooded with images of absolutely over-the-top lifestyles—themselves worthy of further investigation. “I’ve found so many leads this way.”</p><p>Lawmakers might have been hoping to incentivize employees who stumble across signs of fraud to speak up, but they’ve also birthed a burgeoning cottage industry—professionals whose careers are built around whistleblower payouts. Supporting tipsters like Overum are private attorneys who specialize in presenting whistleblower evidence to the agencies, and making the case that they should investigate. In some instances, there are even firms who finance whistleblowers, taking a portion of awards when they’re earned. And so the nascent industrialization of whistleblowing has begun to draw criticism from some observers who wonder whether the system’s intentions have been warped—if funds originally meant to support an army of citizen whistleblowers are increasingly funneling into the pockets of a small cadre of experts.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But as long as he’s able, Overum will keep blowing the whistle, sometimes pursuing as many as a dozen cases at once. By this point, he’s got a process: Overum pores over financial and legal information; he hunts for aliases and bankruptcies and business setbacks. When investigations advance to a stage where he needs to interact with a target, Overum will often pose as a would-be investor. Selecting the right assumed identity for any given subject also takes work. Overum spends hours analyzing the subject, trawling through their social media or listening to any podcasts they might have done. “I need to build a psychological profile,” he says. “I need to find out what’s going to motivate them.”</p><p>Regardless of the choice, the character needs to feel lived-in, and Overum has to be prepared to speak with a high degree of expertise in any number of fields. “A lot of what I do is Method acting,” says Overum. “I have to understand what my profession is in order to be able to go 20 minutes deep on whatever it is I say I’m doing. And I need to study that role so that I can play that character.”</p><p>Outreach typically begins with a call: Overum is trying to pull information that might be incriminating and also build rapport. Flattery and empathy take you far, Overum notes. And one big thing he’s learned over the years is to act somewhat naive. “Not being able to understand what they’re saying has allowed me to rephrase questions over and over until I get the answer from them that I’m looking for,” he says. “The incriminating answer.”</p><p>In between calls, there are always text messages. It’s rare, Overum says, that you’ll go long without hearing from a target that turns out to be running a scam. “They always need money,” he says. “They’re always running short on cash.”</p><p>Damning information, Overum says, is surprisingly easy to tease out of a conversation. Nobody expects to meet with a would-be whistleblower. “Their guard is down because they think I’m an investor. I’m like an undercover cop in a world where undercover cops don’t exist.”</p><figure></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Over the years, he’s honed a very particular skill set that has brought him into the confidences of a litany of potential lawbreakers—brazen businesspeople who often think, at first, that they are getting one over on Richard Overum.</p><p>Generally, it’s the other way around. But slipups do happen. And even one misstep can threaten a case. A few years back, while driving his car, Overum was on the phone speaking with a subject. The man asked who had referred Overum to him; Overum dropped a name. The man on the phone responded: “That’s funny. I just hired that person. He’s never heard of you before.” Overum finished up the call and pulled over to the side of the road. He was so angry at himself that he got out of the car and smashed the burner phone he’d been using to pieces with his foot. He learned from that experience: Don’t ever say something to a possible scammer unless you’re absolutely sure that it won’t come back to bite you.</p><p>The job takes on a whole different level of danger during in-person meetings, Overum says, which are nonetheless necessary in order to “further put people at ease” and coax the most damning information out of them. In these cases, he needs to look the part, so his closet is full of custom-made suits and designer shoes. His own natural interest in watches comes in handy on a job.</p><p>So too does a certain amount of courage. Several times, Overum says, he has met with targets who were armed. Once he headed down South to meet with somebody he suspected of running a scam. The man was ex-military and arrived at their meeting at a restaurant with a pistol holstered on his waist. While they ate and spoke about an investment opportunity, the man sprinkled anecdotes of wartime exploits into the conversation in a way that unnerved Overum. He found the experience unsettling, but, over the years, he’s learned to maintain his composure. “When I was first going undercover, I would get back to my car and throw up.” These days, he relaxes by listening to metal bands (Tool and Nine Inch Nails are favorites) and playing video games like The Last of Us.</p><p>“And before I’m about to meet with a potential scammer, I’ll meditate for 30 minutes or I’ll jump on Zoom with my therapist,” he tells me. “After that, I’m in kill mode.”</p><hr><p><strong>Overum had first</strong> been tipped off on King, the real estate developer, by one of his attorneys. And because his initial research showed signs of lavish living, like opulent houses and high-end cars—perhaps a red flag, but nothing illegal—he would have to get closer.</p><p>Overum decided to approach King as a potential investor, posing as a well-heeled businessman looking to park some money. He called King to introduce his character and let him know he was interested in meeting. Not long after that, Overum visited King’s office, noticing more than one luxury automobile on the premises.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In that first meeting, King would regale Overum with stories of his experience as a developer and describe a number of different investment opportunities that, Overum thought, seemed too good to be true. Time and time again, he seemed to be telling Overum that, if these projects went as planned, he could expect a handsome return on his investment, all with apparently little associated risk.</p><p>One opportunity stuck out to Overum: land that King was preparing to develop. For the project, he had told Overum, he would need to raise millions of dollars in just a short period of time. The amount of money and the urgency of the timeline seemed odd to Overum. “Somebody with that much experience, somebody who has done all the things he’s claimed to do, shouldn’t need an investor to ensure a project goes off,” Overum told me. Something strange was going on here, Overum was pretty sure.</p><p>It would be important for Overum to continue growing the relationship, determining what additional information he could draw out by posing as a potential investor. King proposed they meet again, this time at a luxury hotel, for some fun followed by business.</p><p>When Overum agreed to let me shadow him that night, I watched him deftly channel his character, staying vigilant for all manner of speed bumps that might have spoiled the plot. The emergence of high-definition cameras on cell phones, for instance, is a major peril to undercover work. I took note of Overum ducking away at several points to avoid winding up in the background of someone’s photo.</p><p>To do this work well requires internalizing this paranoid hypervigilance, while still exhibiting a graceful self-confidence. Managing these contradictions, I quickly learned, isn’t easy. When, that night at the hotel, someone asked how Overum and I knew each other—a question I’d even been preparing to answer—I froze. Was I going to blow Overum’s cover on a simple introduction? Expertly and casually, Overum jumped in and described us as old friends, pivoting the conversation to safe territory.</p><p>Watching Overum in the white--marble-floored hotel foyer was to see someone uncommonly poised, and clearly in his element. Over the background din, I heard him speak about his supposed line of business with a level of expertise normally reserved for real industry veterans. At once, he was fully in character—but also, seemingly, fully himself.</p><p>Later that night, after leaving King behind, I asked Overum if anything King had told him might be incriminating. Overum told me that his claims will prove interesting only after he keeps digging and determines whether they’re real or not. “If he was lying to us about anything, then yes,” said Overum. “You can’t misrepresent your wealth or assets to potential investors. That’s fraud.”</p><hr><p><strong>It was more</strong> than just that financially tantalizing quirk of the federal whistleblower law that drew Overum toward this line of work. His own family had been rocked by fraud, he says. While Overum was still quite young, he explains, his father made a devastating investment. The details were always fuzzy, but the event cast a long and profound shadow. “It was a scam,” Overum says, succinctly. “My father lost everything.” He suffered too: His family moved around a lot in the wake of the incident, and Overum says he turned to alcohol and drugs as a teenager.</p><p>In his 20s, Overum began working in sales. “I learned how to read and react to people’s body language,” he says. “I learned people’s tells and how to capitalize on them.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>During this time, Overum would obsess over the impression he could make on people, even practicing his smile in front of a mirror. Like an athlete, he studied filmed interactions of himself making sales pitches, and hunted for ways to improve his performance. In some ways he never really left sales. “I’m selling this fictionalized version of myself,” he says of his work now, “and it all hinges on the story.”</p><p>Overum’s journey to becoming a professional whistleblower began in 2011, when someone he was close to told him about a problem at work. He had been hired as a contract worker but felt that he was required to perform tasks reserved for full-time employees. This offended Overum’s sense of right and wrong, and he began to strategize how he might lodge a complaint with a regulatory agency.</p><p>He says he presented a state agency with a plan to investigate: He’d pose as a job applicant. If he was offered a part-time gig with full-time requirements, he figured he’d have the evidence to support his associate’s claim. Sure enough, says Overum, the ruse led to an offer of contract work—one that he says contained stipulations around work hours, wardrobe, and travel that could legally be required only of full-time employees.</p><p>Overum says the staff at the agency told him they were impressed with his work. So much so that one employee made an interesting suggestion: Why not file his complaint with the federal government? “Do you know about this new whistleblower program?” he says that they asked. “You could make some money off this.”</p><p>He wasn’t aware of the program, but he was intrigued. He filed the case, he says, with the IRS, which also maintains its own whistleblower program. It occurred to him that “whistle-blower” didn’t have to be a one-off role—that it could be something more like a job. A calling, even. “I thought, What if I quit my job and just start filing reports on these companies?” he says. The numbers seemed to make almost too much sense. “In one of these cases, I figured the government could haul $80 million,” he says. “That means I could make more than $10 million on the reward. When I realized I could do this for a living—that I could go after the same kind of crooks that fucked up my childhood—and get paid for it? How could I say no to that?”</p><p>Overum says he used the same tactics he’d first employed—posing as somebody looking for a job—to secure evidence against about 30 more companies. But he started to recognize some of the inherent challenges in this covert line of work. First of all, he was constantly busy, often researching case law. “I’m not a lawyer, but I was spending months building out cases to support these tips,” he says. “That wore on me.” Plus, there was a cash flow problem. After around three years, his cases were still inching through the regulatory agencies. By that point, he says, he’d been paid only one award. “It could take seven to 10 years, in some cases, to get a payout,” he says. “That wasn’t sustainable.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>He stepped away, finding a job in finance—but he always found himself analyzing deals he was working on for potential fraud. “I was missing the thrill of the chase,” Overum says. “I really realized that I was an investigator at heart.” A few years passed, and one day Overum says he got a call from Washington, DC. An employee at the Federal Trade Commission, he says, wanted to discuss the ins and outs of a particular fraud scheme that Overum knew well. The conversation reignited his interest in hunting these cases. But to make it work, Overum would need to rely on a different system—and some partners.</p><p>Overum discovered the lawyer Mark Pugsley, an expert in securities law who had recently represented a whistleblower who would help to unravel a $500 million–plus tax-credit-fraud scheme. Pugsley had worked with dozens of whistleblowers, in the process becoming a magnet for leads on prospective cases. He was instantly impressed with Overum, he told me. “He has a very strong sense of what’s right and what’s wrong,” says Pugsley. “But I also saw that he’s a guy who has big balls. Somebody who could go into situations that could be potentially difficult and, because he’s a good talker, he can talk people into giving him information. He also worked in finance, so he sort of knew the language of investing.”</p><p>Since Overum connected with Pugsley, the lawyer’s firm has fed him dozens of tips and helped him with various operations, including with his part in one particularly cinematic investigation. Overum enticed marketers of what the government has alleged was a nearly $500 million Ponzi scheme to board a rented private jet loaded with surveillance equipment so that he could record their conversation and later submit it to authorities—a case that eventually made headlines when FBI agents fired shots during a raid two years ago.</p><p>To address some of his other concerns, Overum enlisted the help of a New York–based firm that specializes in financing litigation. The company could provide Overum with money up front, and, when Overum won a whistleblower award, he’d pay them back a negotiated fee. This would allow Overum to cover surveillance equipment, burner phones, and other expenses, and, most important, not have to worry about when money was coming in.</p><p>One of the firm’s managing directors told me that his organization was thrilled by the chance to get into business with Overum. “Because he had a track record of success with these cases, we believed in him and saw him as a good investment,” he says. “I was happy to give him as much money as he needed, because we’re confident we’ll see a healthy return.”</p><p>In the year since I’d met Overum, in April 2023, his work, he tells me, had resulted in various raids, arrests, asset freezes, temporary restraining orders, receiverships, and whistle-blower awards. “It goes without saying that I’ve been busy,” Overum says.</p><p>By June of this year, he felt his report on Mike King was ready to be filed. Of course, he hadn’t made any investment with the developer—Overum had been stringing him along with a variety of delay tactics. Each time the rubber met the road to cough up some cash, Overum had a new ready-made excuse as to why that wasn’t the right time for him to jump in.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>All the while, Overum was doing whatever he could to extract information. Overum says that King sent him documents that Overum believes, based on his own research, misrepresented the value of King’s assets. Overum—playing the part of a prospective investor—says that King was painting for him a deceptive financial picture of his business, as well as his track record and certifications. As their conversations had worn on, King proposed various investment opportunities to Overum—each with provisions that Overum found head-scratching.</p><p>“The numbers he was throwing out made no sense,” says Overum. “This follows [his] pattern of making grand promises that seem to fall apart once documents are provided.” Overum was convinced that he and Pugsley could make a case to the government that the developer was operating outside of the law. As of this summer, they were strategizing about the most advantageous way to file the report and how to most effectively present the evidence Overum had gathered—that is, trying to figure out how to get their hoped-for reward (to say nothing of justice) as quickly as possible.</p><p>His work on this case might not necessarily satisfy critics who worry about an industry developing around whistleblower payouts. But Overum remains focused on the bottom line. “The simple fact is that whistleblower programs work,” he says. “If whistleblowers are financially motivated, they’re going to do a better job making sure their information is correct so that they can win an award one day.”</p><p>Overum figures he’ll eventually stop receiving government payouts—but not because the government will eliminate whistleblower programs. It’s because he suspects that his identity might eventually be revealed. It’s an outcome he dreads. But he’s already developing a contingency plan that won’t require him to work in quite the same way. Instead of taking on the cases all by himself, he’s imagining a sort of school to further expand the number of trained whistle-blowers, a venture that will also require more lawyers expert in securities law. “I want to teach an army of people how to do this and send them off on stings,” he says.</p><p>But Overum is also operating with another sort of ticking clock in mind: The sooner he can find and expose a fraud, he can prevent more and more people from being preyed upon. And those who’ve already fallen victim can get an earlier start on the road to being made whole.</p><p>“In every single fraud we’ve exposed, the victims would never have seen a dime back if not for our efforts,” Overum points out. Altruism, in this world, doesn’t always come for free. “Obviously,” he says, “none of us would be in this if there wasn’t a financial incentive.”</p><p><strong>Gordy Megroz</strong> <em>is a journalist based in Colorado.</em></p><p><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the September 2024 issue of GQ with the title “How to Make a Fortune as a Professional Whistleblower”</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

I believe the main lesson from the book is:</p><p>- Don't talk to people about your ideas</p><p>- Ask people about their actual use cases and frustrations</p><p>- Figure out where they're struggling, investing effort and money. Let them talk</p><p>- Don't ask people about your idea and don't ask them if they want it or not. You're only trying to validate the problem.</p><p>Questions to ask:</p><pre><code>    What's the hardest thing about [doing this thing]?
    Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem...
    Why was that hard?
    What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem?

                  <p>I second this recommendation for early startups. We learn from tons of lean books that customer discovery is crucial to not build the wrong thing, but this book gives very practical ways to do that well. Most recent useful read for me. Still in the lean canon, a great complementary read could be lean marketing, as validating your sales channel is of an equal importance of validating your PMF.</p>

It hit me like a freight train after my first startup failed. His detailed examination of downstream consequences in other areas of the business, like sales and marketing, are just uncannily accurate to how they played out in my business.</p><p>Validate, validate, validate. "That's really cool" is not validation from a customer. "That's really cool. I want it.

The most basic skill of any business is to "Sell what people want to buy", as Paul Graham puts it.</p><p>If you just sit and think about that, it encapsulates almost everything that is important about a business: To sell, people need to know about the product/business (marketing), you have to build it (development) and you have to sell it (sales). But you put good people in those roles and they will do their jobs but still not make much money. Why? People need to want to buy it and the main driver for that is a balance of a Customer-focussed Product Manager as well as a DNA of what the company is about and what it is offering. You want to make things customers want but they don't always know what they want and you might be selling something different, in which case your marketing message might be off.</p><p>The books might say "Always be closing" or "Marketing is everything" or "Deliver junk and iterate" and these are all partial truths but they can also come at a cost to other more effective parts of the business.</p><p>As the CEO, your job is to supervise those various levers/teams/departments so you need to know enough about them to understand if they are working, if the person running them is the right person and whether the changes you need to make are big and small!</p><p>p.s.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fuck MVP - if I wanted to create a glorified prototype, I’d just build LEGO.</p>

<p>Fuck SEO - if you need a formula to be found, maybe you’re not that interesting.</p>

<p>Fuck changing the world - I can't fucking figure out why my new vacuum cleaner needs to connect to my wifi.</p>

<p>Fuck market research - My cat is more often right than fucking McKinsey.</p>

<p>Fuck user onboarding - if they can't figure it out you are fucked anyways.</p>

<p>Fuck productivity - if I wanted to be efficient, I’d be a robot.</p>

<p>Fuck saas gurus - seriously, these guys read one book and suddenly they’re Yoda.</p>

<p>Fuck analytics - I don't need numbers to know that no one gives a shit.</p>

<p>Fuck shit posts on LinkedIn/Twitter/Reddit - where the blind lead the blind off a cliff.</p>

<p>Fuck cohort analysis - if every cohort’s leaving, does it matter who left first?"</p>

<p>Fuck "contact us for pricing" - your pricing’s probably like my ex: complicated and unpredictable. Fuck that.</p>

<p>Fuck listening to podcasts for ideas - you're just procrastinating at this point.</p>

<p>Fuck get users before you build anything - why? So you can disappoint them sooner?</p>

<p>Just fucking build whatever the fuck you want to build and however the fuck you want to build it. Don’t let some Silicon Valley dude-bros tell you how to run your shit. Your way is <em>your</em> way. Me? I work in "fuck off mode." It’s not for everyone, but I swear to fuck, life gets better the moment you start saying "fuck off" to more things instead of piling more shit onto your plate.</p>

<p>Everyone and their mother has something to say to a SaaS founder. "Oh, you don’t have a TikTok strategy?" Fuck off. "Have you integrated Segment, Posthog, and Mixpanel?" Fuck off. "Have you done market research to figure out your pricing?" Fuck the fuck off. Meanwhile, Reddit’s full of these clowns debating freemium vs. free trial like it’s life or death. Just pick one and stop shitting your pants over it. Seriously, stop adding shit to your plate. Learn to say "fuck off"—a lot. You’re a startup. You’re a founder. Fucking act like it. Grow some fucking balls and stop getting jerked around by the latest hot take from some LinkedIn thought-leader who counts the likes on his posts on LinkedIn to keep his fucking pride intact.</p>

<p>Here’s the deal: you’re not some mega-corp that has to do all the "big gun" things. Big companies are bloated because they <em>have</em> to be but you’ve got a choice. You got a fucking choice. Are you listening to me. Nah. You are so fucking distracted that this post is too fucking long for you and you want your fucking AI to give you a summary. Fuck you and fuck your AI gizmo.</p>

<p>Yet what do I see founders doing? Voluntarily giving up that choice. They add to their plate every bullshit trend. Fuck that. Go lean, and toss the fucking startup playbook in the trash.</p>

<p>And while we’re at it, fuck this whole notion that you have to build something <em>innovative</em> and <em>magical</em>. Silicon Valley keeps telling us to build innovative products. Fuck that shit.  One guy innovated—<em>one fucking guy</em>. Henry Ford. He built the damn assembly line. Today, we’ve got a hundred car companies out there. Some innovating, some just straight-up copying, and guess what? They’re all doing just fine. Toyota copied Ford, Samsung copied Apple, and now they’re printing fucking money. You don’t have to be the next Nikola Tesla or Richard Feynman to make a buck. Straight up copy shit which is not copyrighted or is patented. And Most of the stuff is not.</p>

<p>And speaking of bullshit mantras, fuck the whole "raise your prices until God whispers in your ear that you’ve hit the local maxima" nonsense. Just stop and think for a second. You’re a fucking startup. Your software’s full of bugs. The server password is known by exactly two people: your co-founder, who’s halfway out the door, and your engineer, who forgot it three months ago. And you want to price yourself alongside the big boys? Fuck that. Even I’d rather just pay the big guys. Make your shit affordable.</p>

<p>Remember Walmart. They have a fucking tagline - Always low prices. If low price is good enough for fucking Walmart you don't have to be embarrassed about your low price.</p>

<p>Folks we have a reason why we let patents expire. Big pharma companies spend billions of dollars on research and they build a medicine. They get patent and they get to make money. And then we let patent expire. So that boring companies can copy it and make it available to the fucking people. That boring business itself is worth billions of dollars. If you go by Silicon valley mantra then everyone has to be fucking big pharma. Fuck that shit. That's too hard. Too risky. Requires too much money. You will be begging VCs.</p>

<p>Instead build something for which patent has expired. The products I'm building are not innovative at all. The innovative work has already been done by the category leaders and all category leaders - zendesk, intercom, calendly, asana, loom are big company. They have rightly benefited from their innovation.</p>

<p>Now many years later I think the metaphorical patent has expired. I'm going to challenge them on price. Will I succeed? May be or may be not. Who fucking cares. It's my money. I've bootstrapped it from the consulting work I've been doing for the last 14 years. If my products win then that's good. If I loose all the money then I'm loosing  because of my fucking stupidity. Atleast I gave it a fucking shot.</p>

<p>Oh, and while we’re on the subject of fucking things up, let’s fuck this "all in" bullshit. "All in" means you dump your girlfriend, ditch your friends, eat instant noodles for three meals a day, and guzzle shitty coffee until you’re broke, single, and burned out, only to watch your company crash and burn at the end. And what do you get for it? A shitpost on Twitter about how you went "all in" and got fucked. Is that some kind of badge of honor. Fuck that shit.</p>

<p>You don’t need to go "all in." You need fucking cushion—backups on backups. You know who had backups? Amundsen. His team <em>gained weight</em> after coming back from the South Pole. My cushion is my consulting gig. Even if all my products tank, I’ll be fine. I’m not going "all in"—that’s too risky. And if Silicon Valley doesn’t like it? Fuck ‘em. They say that if you are not all in then how will you succeed. Fuck that. It's a trap. Once you are "all in" then you have no choice. It's like Alexander's strategy. He will fight bigger fights. Now his soldiers are fucked. They have no choice but to fight with all their might. Fuck that shit. I don't want to be in that position. I want to enjoy my weekends. I'm not "all in". No fucking way.</p>

<p>I built <a href="https://neeto.com/cal">NeetoCal</a>, <a href="https://neeto.com/record">NeetoRecord</a>, and more—powered by 100% "fuck off mode" energy. You should too. You effort to please all SaaS overlords is killing you.</p>

<p>Our innovation is not in what we are building. We are building fucking clones. Our innovation is on building just good enough product at a very low cost. Am I trying to be Apple. No fucking way. What I'm trying to do is provide 60% of the category leader(intercom, zendesk, calendly, loom, asana) feature at 1/10th the price.</p>

<p>Low cost is important. That's what we are fighting off. Does it mean Neeto will never be as feature rich as category. yes you got it right.</p>

<p>Oh so you are building a clone and you are not even cloning that properly. First of all fuck you. I see the sarcasm. Secondly yes we are cloning and there also we are not cloning all the way. Let me fucking elaborate for you.</p>

<p>Let's take the example of Intercom. They are more than 10 years old now. They have more than 1k employees and they have raise more then $200M. Now 10 years later what do you think their engineers shipped last week. I'll tell you what.</p>

<p>Nothing that you or I need. After ten years they have built whatever they needed for plebeians. Now they are building for fucking fortune 500 companies. I don't blame them. They got money. Go after them.</p>

<p>I'm not building for fortune 500 companies. So why would I copy the enterprise features. I'm building the feature that small businesses will need. That's why I said I will copy but only upto 60-70% and then I'll move on to the next product. I don't want my engineers to keep working on same shit year after year making things more complicated and adding more bugs. As I said we want to build a good enough product at a rock bottom price.</p>

<p>I know I know all business books say that don't compete on price. Don't make commodity. Well I'm breaking both the norms. I'm building a commodity. I'm building a fucking clone. It's a commodity. This is another fucking annoying things I see on Product Hunt all the time. All founders think that they are building something innovative. Fuck that shit. Whom are you deceiving. You don't even have fucking guts to say that I'm building fucking docusign clone. Say just it.</p>

<p>I'm saying that I'm building fucking commodity products. Commodity products by default are sold at low price. A side note do you know how much money dollar stores make in USA. Let me give you a hint - fucking a lot.</p>

<p>Have a fucking good time building whatever the fuck you are building. I'm saying this in a loving fucking way. The important thing is to enjoy the journey because even if you have built a unicorn the journey never ends. So might as well fucking enjoy it. Hopefully in the process of building you learn to say "fuck off" more. You need it. Your sanity needs it.</p>

<p>Good luck. And fuck you. See I'm a nice fucking guy :-)</p>

<p>Edit 1: Mackos commented  <a href="https://youtu.be/qisTEy-vDyA?si=w1rDrLuswEN5sLc3">25th hour with Edward Norton</a>&nbsp;and it's so fucking awesome.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Another founder mode post is on the front page of hacker news. <a href="https://capture.dropbox.com/M3MqgvwGySXQoBtE">https://capture.dropbox.com/M3MqgvwGySXQoBtE</a> Fuck this fucking shit about founder mode. WTF.</p>

<h2>Why? Because These Are Problems Programmers Have Already Solved.</h2>
</p>
<div>
<p>With the explosion of 3D printing, designing 3D objects has become an even more important problem. And it's a complicated one. We need to design complicated objects that precisely interface with each other. And often we don't want to just design a single object, but classes of objects, parameterized by variables. And we need to do this in collaboration.</p>
<p>There are trivial cases, like a screw driver of varying length or the width of a table. Traditional geometric constraints can suffice here. But what if we want a key based of a list of numbers describing the heights of a lock's pins? Now we need programming.</p>
<p>But that's only the beginning. We can abstract away the stupid work humans do in designing objects. We can build DSLs. We can unit test objects and put them on github.</p>
<p>ImplicitCAD is a project dedicated to using the power of math and computer science to get stupid design problems out of the way of the 3D printing revolution.</p>
