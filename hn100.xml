            <p>MP 90: Building a complete Django project from a single file.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>This is the first post in a </em><a href="https://www.mostlypython.com/django-from-first-principles-2/" rel="noreferrer"><em>series</em></a><em> about building a full Django project, starting with a single file. This series will be free to everyone, as soon as each post comes out.</em> <a href="#footnote-1" rel="noreferrer"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>For a long time, Django has seemed more complex than other web frameworks such as Flask. This reputation is largely based on a somewhat unfair comparison between the "simplest" Django project and the "simplest" Flask project. That comparison often lands in favor of Flask, because Flask's documentation starts off with a single-file project consisting of just five lines of code.</p><p>In this project we'll build a Django project, but we'll take an approach that's much different from most Django tutorials. We'll start with a single file, just like the Flask example, and the single-file demos we see from other frameworks. As we build out the project, we'll add pieces one at a time, only as they're needed. By the time we're finished, we'll have a standard Django project built from the ground up.</p><h2 id="the-source-of-djangos-initial-complexity">The source of Django's (initial) complexity</h2><p>Django's initial complexity stems from the fact that most tutorials tell people to start with these two commands:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<pre data-caption="" data-hl-lines="[]" data-language="sh"><span></span><span>$ </span>django-admin<span> </span>startproject<span> </span>&lt;project-name&gt;<span> </span>.
<span>$ </span>python<span> </span>manage.py<span> </span>startapp<span> </span>&lt;app-name&gt;</pre>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>After running these two commands, there are twelve files you'll need to make sense of! If you're an experienced Django developer, that automatically-generated project structure is a big help. But if you're new to Django, it's not obvious at all how all these parts fit together.</p><h2 id="an-alternative-approach">An alternative approach</h2><p>Rather than starting with these commands, we'll start with just one file that serves our project's home page. We'll look at all the parts of the file, so the purpose of every aspect of the project is clear from the start. As we progress in building out the project, we'll only expand out into additional files and directories when they're needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.mostlypython.com/content/images/2024/03/standard_vs_single_django-2-1.png" alt="Output of `tree` for a standard Django project, and a single-file version of the same project." loading="lazy" width="1720" height="1057" srcset="https://www.mostlypython.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/standard_vs_single_django-2-1.png 600w, https://www.mostlypython.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/standard_vs_single_django-2-1.png 1000w, https://www.mostlypython.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/03/standard_vs_single_django-2-1.png 1600w, https://www.mostlypython.com/content/images/2024/03/standard_vs_single_django-2-1.png 1720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A standard Django project on the left, before writing any of your own code. There are 12 files that people new to Django need to make sense of. It's possible to start a Django project with just a single file, as shown on the right.</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="where-well-end-up">Where we'll end up</h2><p>When the project is fully developed, we'll end up with a project structure that's almost identical to what you'd get using the <code>startproject</code> and <code>startapp</code> commands. You probably won't ever use the ground-up approach shown in this series again, but you'll come away from it with a much better understanding of the structure of a typical Django project.</p><h2 id="a-simple-but-nontrivial-project">A simple but nontrivial project</h2><p>A good project for a tutorial series is simple, but nontrivial. This means it should use a database, incorporate user accounts, and feature styling that requires the use of static files.<a href="#footnote-2" rel="noreferrer"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>In this series we'll build a project called <em>BlogMaker Lite</em>. It's my go-to project for Django discussions, because it ticks all the requirements for a simple but nontrivial project. We'll also deploy the project when we're finished, to prove that the final version of the project would work in production.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>Django <em>is</em> more complex than some other web frameworks, because it includes a lot more out of the box than minimalist frameworks. By the time you've built out everything your real-world project needs, a typical Django project isn't much more complex than a fully-built project using a different framework.</p><p>While <code>startproject</code> and <code>startapp</code> give experienced Django developers a nice starting point for new projects, people learning about Django don't need to start with the complexity that those two commands introduce. Instead, we can start from a single file that's easier to understand, and build out each new piece as it's needed.</p><p>If you're new to Django, hopefully this series will be a helpful way to see the framework for the first time. If you've been using Django for a while, you'll probably come away with a better understanding of the structure you've already been seeing in your projects. And if you're really experienced with Django, maybe you'll see the framework from a newcomer's eyes once again.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.mostlypython.com/django-from-first-principles-part-2/" rel="noreferrer">next post</a>, we'll start by writing a single file that serves the project's home page.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I'd love feedback throughout this series. If you have any thoughts or reactions, please leave a comment or reach out in </em><a href="https://www.mostlypython.com/contact/" rel="noreferrer"><em>whatever way</em></a><em> works best for you.</em></p>

<p>Usually, new series on <em>Mostly Python</em> are only available to paid subscribers for a period of six weeks. This series will be free to everyone as soon as each post comes out. I'm still finishing up the migration from Substack, and it's a little easier to only publish free posts for a little while longer.</p><p>More importantly, I want this series to be available to people in the Django community as soon as each post is published. This series builds on work that people have been sharing at a number of recent DjangoCons, where people have been challenging each other to come up with the shortest working single-file Django project possible.</p><p>If you're curious about some of this prior work, start by watching Carlton Gibson's Djang0Con US 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9cYEovduWI&amp;ref=mostlypython.com" rel="noreferrer">talk</a>, <em>Using Django as a Micro-Framework</em>. Then take a look at Will Vincent's <a href="https://github.com/wsvincent/django-microframework?ref=mostlypython.com" rel="noreferrer">django-microframework</a> repository; Will has done a nice job of collecting a few different single-file examples. Then check out Paolo Melchiorre's <a href="https://github.com/pauloxnet/uDjango?ref=mostlypython.com" rel="noreferrer">μDjango</a> project, which he demonstrated at DjangoCon US 2023. Andrew Mshar wrote an interesting blog post called <em>Moving from Django Microframework to Django</em>, following up on Paolo's work. Most recently, Andrew Godwin shared his <a href="https://github.com/andrewgodwin/django-singlefile?ref=mostlypython.com" rel="noreferrer">django-singlefile</a> project. This is the first example that seems to be meant for <a href="https://fosstodon.org/deck/@andrew@aeracode.org/112180445225617864?ref=mostlypython.com" rel="noreferrer">real-world use</a>, and I'm curious to see where people go with it.</p><p>While these been interesting exercises, it can quickly turn into a game of code golf. Someone might come up with slightly shorter single-file projects, but many of these are just as hard for newer people to understand as a standard Django project generated from <code>startproject</code> and <code>startapp</code>. I've been thinking for a while that one of the most interesting directions to take this work is building out a full project from one of these single-file examples. This series is my response to seeing everyone else's single-file projects; I hope the people who shared those projects like what they see here. :)</p>

<p>It frustrates me to no end seeing hosting platforms use overly simplistic Django projects in their examples. Heroku once pushed a broken build process because the sample project they used for testing didn't even use a database.</p>

<p>Realistic is not necessarily the most convincing. Audio designers know that well and use frozen leeks and watermelons to create sounds of breaking bones and tearing flesh. Chalk shot from slingshot was safer alternative for actual firearms in old westerns. Fake doesn’t have to mean worse, especially when it is hard to tell the difference. With that in mind I will try to create complex flow without using computational fluid dynamics.</p>







<h2>New, Better Jupiter</h2>



<p>Jupiter’s is undeniably beautiful, but it’s safest to admire it from a distance. Characteristic patterns observed on the surface are, in fact, massive storms and Earth-sized cyclones. Jovian winds can reach speeds of hundreds of kilometers per hour, although they may appear quaint from orbit.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/JupiterJuno.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-746&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterJuno-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterJuno-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterJuno-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterJuno-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterJuno-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterJuno-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I plan to feature a Jupiter-like planet as part of the skybox. While not a unique concept and often seen in the sci-fi genre, I want to take it a step further by animating it. In reality, the motion of the atmosphere is too slow to be noticed. However, I will speed it up substantially to make the movement obvious. This should capture players’ attention and remind them that the action is taking place on a distant, alien world.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/JupiterConcept.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-372&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JupiterConcept-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JupiterConcept-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JupiterConcept-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JupiterConcept-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JupiterConcept-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JupiterConcept-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Flow</h2>



<p>While I don’t want to create a carbon copy of Jupiter, there is a set of features that immediately come to mind when thinking about gas planet. Hopefully, by recreating these, I will get the visuals reminiscent of Jupiter.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/JupiterFlow.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-625&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:840px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterFlow-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterFlow-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterFlow-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterFlow-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterFlow-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JupiterFlow-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>There are three distinct flow patterns I want to replicate :</p>



<ul>
<li>Cyclones: A couple of large, easily identifiable vortices, much like Jupiter’s ‘Great Red Spot.’ Typically elongated, they are often accompanied by a ‘wake’ – a trail of secondary vortices.</li>



<li>Jets: These are linear currents that run parallel to the equator, with easily visible turbulent transition layers.</li>



<li>Storms: Smaller, more volatile, and less defined flow structures that contribute to the texture of the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Animating Fluids</h2>



<p>Recreating water or any other sort of fluid in games is challenging. Computational fluid dynamics is demanding in terms of memory and processing power, but that hasn’t prevented game developers from including water in their games. With a set of clever hacks and workarounds, there is no need for expensive simulation.</p>



<h3>Color Cycling</h3>



<p>Color cycling is a technique with a long history, dating back to systems like the NES. It’s akin to painting by numbers, where colors representing different numbers change each frame. Despite its simplicity, when applied to well-prepared input sprites, it can produce eye-catching effects.</p>

<h3>Frame-by-Frame Animation</h3>



<p>For a while, the frame-by-frame approach was the standard solution. Each frame was stored as a separate sprite, which demanded a lot of memory. As a result, this method was typically reserved for short animation loops consisting of only a few frames.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/FrameByFrame.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-324&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FrameByFrame-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FrameByFrame-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FrameByFrame-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FrameByFrame-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FrameByFrame-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FrameByFrame-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Limited number of animation frames leads to a ‘choppy’ motion, typical of 90s shooters.</p>







<h3>Texture Scrolling</h3>



<p>As soon as games moved into fully textured 3D environments, texture scrolling became a viable option for creating rivers. This method involves incrementing one of the UV components over time to create the illusion of moving texture. When combined with appropriate geometry and shaders, texture scrolling can yield impressive results and remains a popular choice.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/TexturePanning.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-317&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TexturePanning-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TexturePanning-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TexturePanning-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TexturePanning-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TexturePanning-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TexturePanning-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>While versatile this technique is limited to laminar flow – it is non-trivial to add vortices or any other complex flow patterns.</p>







<h3>Quake UV Distortion</h3>



<p>Id Software, the developer behind Quake, is renowned for its innovations. The water distortion they created is rarely listed among them, but is still worth looking into. This simple formula lends Quake’s lava, water, and portals their distinctive appearance.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/QuakeLava-2.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-352&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/QuakeLava-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/QuakeLava-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/QuakeLava-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/QuakeLava-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/QuakeLava-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/QuakeLava-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Although it’s straightforward to replicate using shaders, the original effect was made without them, relying instead on software rendering.</p>







<h3>Unreal WaterPaint</h3>



<p>WaterPaint is one of the most intriguing methods for simulating fluids in games, yet it’s also one of the most challenging to understand. It appears to generate the surface of the liquid and subsequently uses this information to distort a texture. The system’s complexity borders on overengineering, particularly given that the resulting effect is often overlooked in a fast-paced shooter.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/Waterpaint-2.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-311&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Waterpaint-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Waterpaint-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Waterpaint-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Waterpaint-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Waterpaint-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Waterpaint-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Similarly to Quake this technique also predates shaders. Texture pixels are manipulated by CPU and then sampled just like in the case of normal texture. </p>







<p>The methods mentioned are decades old and, on their own, may not hold up well today. However, they still have value as components within larger, more complex systems.</p>



<h2>Velocity Texture</h2>



<p>Let’s create a “universal” flow shader capable of representing any motion of the fluid. Intuitively, we’ll need two textures: one representing the color of the flowing substance, and another one storing the velocity field. This velocity field texture will be a 2-component 2D texture, with the red component representing the x component of the normalized velocity and the green component representing the y component.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VelocityFieldPacking-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VelocityFieldPacking-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VelocityFieldPacking-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VelocityFieldPacking-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VelocityFieldPacking-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VelocityFieldPacking-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The velocity field is then used to incrementally modify the texture coordinates of the color texture, in the same manner like in the ‘Texture Scrolling’ described previously. However, in this case, the velocity values vary for each pixel.</p>







<p>The result, while interesting, is rather disappointing as it doesn’t accurately simulate fluid motion. Instead, it is an animated distortion that gradually bends the color texture over time. </p>



<p>The formula worked for simple scrolling because in that case the motion was linear and constant. At each point, the velocity was the same. However, here the velocity is more complex – it is defined per pixel. The correct approach would be to use integration.</p>



<h2>Euler Method</h2>



<p>Let’s simplify the problem. Imagine we have a tiny speck of dust sitting on the surface of water that’s moving. We describe the water’s movement using a texture that shows its velocity. Now, we want to figure out the path this speck of dust would take.</p>



<p>The first solution that comes to mind is to take a small step forward, check and update the velocity, then take another step using the updated velocity, and repeat this process. This is called Explicit Euler Method:</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ExplicitEulerMethod.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-362&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ExplicitEulerMethod-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ExplicitEulerMethod-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ExplicitEulerMethod-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ExplicitEulerMethod-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ExplicitEulerMethod-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ExplicitEulerMethod-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The Explicit or Forward Euler method is often seen as the most basic and least accurate numerical integration method. The larger the integration step, denoted as “h,” the greater the error, and these errors accumulate over time. Even in the example shown, the integrated path represented by the orange arrows deviates significantly from the particle’s true path, depicted by the gray line. Fortunately this inaccuracy won’t be noticeable in the animation.</p>



<p>The problem is, it’s not easy to transform Euler Method directly into a shader. We need to keep track of the particle’s position after each step, and this is something shader alone cannot do. Position, in form of a deformed color texture, has to be stored in a texture.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/EulerTextureAndShader-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-367&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/EulerTextureAndShader-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/EulerTextureAndShader-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/EulerTextureAndShader-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/EulerTextureAndShader-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/EulerTextureAndShader-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/EulerTextureAndShader-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The shader reads the texture storing the color of the fluid and deforms it slightly based on the velocity texture. The resulting deformation is then written back into the color texture. This operation is performed every frame of the animation.</p>



<p>To complicate the problem further, it’s generally not possible to read from and write to the same texture in a fragment shader. Unreal Engine solves this problem with Canvas.</p>



<h2>Canvas Node Setup</h2>



<p>Canvas enables the use of a flow shader (Material) to be drawn into a Render Target texture. What sets Canvas apart is its capability to use the same Render Target in both the input and output of the flow shader, forming a feedback loop. To make this process work, several components are necessary:</p>



<ul>
<li>Render Target Texture: This image stores the state of the flow, or the color of the fluid in our case. It must be created before the animation begins and initial color has to be set.</li>



<li>Rendering Event: The process of updating the animation has to be performed every frame, or at least every frame the animated object is visible.</li>



<li>Flow Material Instance: An instance of the Flow Material is necessary, and it has to be supplied with its own Render Target Texture.</li>
</ul>



<p>Once all these elements are in place, the Rendering Event, which corresponds to one step of fluid simulation, can be achieved using just 3 nodes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Begin Draw Canvas to Render Target</li>



<li>Draw Material</li>



<li>End Draw </li>
</ul>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/CanvasNodeSetup.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-394&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CanvasNodeSetup-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CanvasNodeSetup-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CanvasNodeSetup-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CanvasNodeSetup-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CanvasNodeSetup-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CanvasNodeSetup-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>With everything set up, the resulting animation should look like this:</p>







<p>The initial image is shifted in a more fluid manner, with each pixel moving more continuously. However, it still falls short of resembling the motion of a liquid.</p>



<h2>Improving Velocity Field</h2>



<p>Up until now, we’ve relied on basic smoothed 2D vector noise. While sufficient for testing basic functionality, it not enough to realistically representing fluid flow. Liquids tend to swirl around, forming vortices and other complex patterns, which simple noise cannot approximate effectively.</p>



<p>Fortunately, a mathematical operator, the curl, can be particularly useful here. By applying it to scalar noise, we transform it into a velocity field full of vortices. </p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/GrayscaleToCurl.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-431&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GrayscaleToCurl-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GrayscaleToCurl-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GrayscaleToCurl-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GrayscaleToCurl-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GrayscaleToCurl-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GrayscaleToCurl-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>To describe curl in the simplest way possible – in 2D case curl will create a clockwise flow around areas brighter than the surrounding, and counterclockwise flow around darker areas. I describe curl in more detail in <a href="https://emildziewanowski.com/curl-noise/" data-type="post" data-id="19">Dissecting Curl Noise</a> article.</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to calculate curl. DDX and DDY operators are useful in Shadertoy, where the input is not a static texture but a procedural noise. For more traditional applications like Unreal and Unity, it’s probably better to generate it using image generation software like Substance Designer or Photoshop. Any software capable of generating a normal map from a grayscale image will be helpful here, as converting a normal map to curl is simply a matter of swizzling and inverting channels.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/FlowfieldAuthoring.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-426&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlowfieldAuthoring-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlowfieldAuthoring-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlowfieldAuthoring-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlowfieldAuthoring-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlowfieldAuthoring-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlowfieldAuthoring-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The addition of swirly motion adds a fluid-like quality to the animation, although it still appears somewhat static.</p>







<p>The stationary vortices are the reason behind the artificial appearance. This can be addressed by distorting velocity field using the same function that manipulated lava in Quake.</p>







<p>The flow still lacks the complexity needed to resemble natural motion, but this can be remedied with a more detailed velocity field.</p>



<h2>Mixing</h2>



<p>When the algorithm runs for too long, another problem becomes apparent: mixing. While it’s a desired feature, after a while, it turns the flow colors into a solid mass, devoid of any visual interest. </p>







<p>To remedy that, color can be reintroduced by sampling the initial color texture and blending it with the Render Target texture. This process involves using a point grid mask to mimic pigment dissolving in the fluid.</p>







<p>That solves the issue of mixing, but the pattern of points remains too noticeable. By using a noise texture and applying Quake distortion to it, the effect becomes less conspicuous and more natural.</p>







<p>Jupiter’s appearance is attributed to its water-ammonia clouds, which have a range of compositions and colors. These clouds undergo atmospheric circulation, occasionally pushing layers from below to the surface. This phenomenon results in changes in surface colors and structure over time.</p>

<p>I’ll artificially limit cloud compositions to 3 and assign a texture channel to each. Then, to simulate shifts in composition, I’ll utilize color cycling. In shader terms, the initial color, before being sampled and mixed with the render target, will undergo slight modifications over time. The result may look psychedelic, but ultimately, it will replaced by more natural set of colors. Right now those rainbow patterns serve as an useful placeholder.</p>







<p>The left side displays the initial color, while the right side shows the flow.</p>



<h2>Sharpening</h2>



<p>Another side effect of mixing is the blurring of the texture. As the image becomes progressively smoother, the details are lost, causing the texture to appear low-resolution, which is certainly an undesirable outcome.</p>



<p>The obvious solution is to use sharpening – an operation opposite to blurring. In its simplest form, it samples five pixels – the original one and its four neighbors – and returns their weighted sum. The layout of the pixels with their respective weights is called a kernel.</p>



<p>I will use a slightly different formula, one that isolates the ‘delta’ or change in color. This delta is then multiplied by the strength of sharpening. This approach gives me more control over the effect.</p>

<p>The material graph representation might seem daunting at first glance, but it’s essentially the result of repeating the same sampling operation multiple times with different parameters.</p>

<p>Sharpen is a separate Canvas rendering operation that follows the animation step.</p>

<p>Sharpening enhances the details but also introduces stripe artifacts.</p>







<p>This occurs because it is part of the feedback loop. It amplifies the difference between pixels, and the next sharpening step further magnifies the difference. This continues until the color values reach their maximum or minimum value.</p>



<p>The solution to that problem is far from elegant but very effective – clamping the calculated difference. This way, the difference doesn’t increase exponentially and the artifacts have no chance to form.</p>

<p>Sharpening with clamping:</p>







<p>With that in place, we can consider the whole system complete – we have a set of tools that allow for recreating a wide array of flow types in real-time. Now, to make further improvements, we need to enhance the input data – specifically, the velocity field.</p>



<h2>Flow Patterns</h2>



<p>There are 3 flow patterns that can be easily identified on Jupiter:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cyclones</li>



<li>Jets</li>



<li>Storms</li>
</ul>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/MainCurrentsAndVortices.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-resized&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-626&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:&quot;width:840px;height:auto&quot;,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MainCurrentsAndVortices-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MainCurrentsAndVortices-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MainCurrentsAndVortices-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MainCurrentsAndVortices-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MainCurrentsAndVortices-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MainCurrentsAndVortices-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This list is by no means exhaustive. While there are numerous smaller and less noticeable flow details, many of them can be replicated using the same techniques employed for the main three patterns. </p>



<p>I will attempt to translate these patterns into corresponding velocity fields. This way, the complex flow on Jupiter can be broken down into individual flow components. These components could then be rearranged later to create a new, unique gas giant.</p>



<h2>Creating Flowfields</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, in a real-game scenario like Unreal or Unity, it’s not practical to generate the velocity field from scratch. It’s more efficient to generate most of the components in Substance Designer or Photoshop and then combine them in the shader to achieve the desired result. This approach allows us to create complex patterns with no additional costs.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/SubstanceVectorfield.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-621&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SubstanceVectorfield-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SubstanceVectorfield-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SubstanceVectorfield-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SubstanceVectorfield-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SubstanceVectorfield-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SubstanceVectorfield-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I chose to create velocity textures in Substance Designer due to its flexibility and non-destructive workflow.</p>



<h3>Cyclones</h3>



<p>A cyclone is essentially a large vortex. Creating one involves generating a large blurred black or white dot and passing it through the curl operator. To add more complexity, the result can be combined with another operator – the gradient. This allows the cyclone to either suck in or expel matter, making it more dynamic.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/AnticycloneComponents.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-429&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AnticycloneComponents-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AnticycloneComponents-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AnticycloneComponents-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AnticycloneComponents-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AnticycloneComponents-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AnticycloneComponents-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Relation between <a href="https://emildziewanowski.com/curl-noise/#GradientAndCurlOverlayed" data-type="post" data-id="19">curl and gradient is explained here</a> in more detail.</p>



<p>The velocity field is generated by blending a mixture of curl and gradient operators over the previously created flow pattern.</p>







<p>Substance Designer enables the creation of more complex and detailed velocity fields. In this case, the cyclone flowfield was slightly deformed and elongated, featuring a non-linear speed distribution. Unlike a flowfield generated in a shader from scratch, all these details incur no additional cost – everything is baked into the texture.</p>

<h3>Jets</h3>



<p>The bands around Jupiter are known as belts and zones. Belts consist of darker, warmer clouds, while zones are characterized by brighter clouds made of ice. Strong currents form at the transitions between these bands. These currents, known as jets, run parallel to the equator and alternate in direction. Where two jets meet, the flow becomes turbulent, creating chains of vortices.</p>



<p>Replicating that is relatively simple: blurred stripes represent the laminar flow of the jets, while a curl applied to a series of dots creates vortices. It’s worth noticing the color of the dots; the spin of resulting vortices has to match the direction of the surrounding jets.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/BeltComponents.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-434&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BeltComponents-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BeltComponents-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BeltComponents-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BeltComponents-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BeltComponents-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BeltComponents-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Once again, the flowfield generated in Designer exhibits more detail. Transition vortices are more scattered and vary in size. Additionally, jets are slightly disturbed to create a more wavy flow.</p>

<h3>Storms</h3>



<p>“Storms” is the term I used to encompass all the smaller vortices and turbulent streams that accompany the main currents. They are essentially noise, and I will approach creating them in the same way I would create noise.</p>



<p>Noise is typically comprised of multiple layers called octaves. Each subsequent octave contains smaller details and has a diminishing influence. In the case of a velocity field, each layer also has to be animated separately.</p>



<p>Those layers are then blended together to form complex, turbulent motion.</p>

<p>Substance Designer features storms gathered into clusters. Two versions of that texture are packed into a single texture and blended using moving masks to simulate quickly shifting currents.</p>

<p>It’s a different approach that results in patches of turbulent flow, as opposed to the uniformly distributed storms generated in Shadertoy. These patches resemble what can be observed on Jupiter more closely.</p>



<h3>Combined</h3>



<p>The division into cyclones, jets, and storms was artificial but proved quite useful for illustrating some of the techniques that can be used to mimic real flowfields. Each flow pattern can be achieved in many different ways, with no single approach that can be described as the “right” one.</p>



<p>To merge all these components together, a simple addition would suffice, but using alpha blending allows for accentuating some features like cyclones and toning down turbulence in certain areas.</p>



<p>At this stage, when all the components are ready, blending them together is more a matter of artistic choice than mathematics. After all, none of the presented techniques have solid grounding in physics – they are just approximations of natural phenomena.</p>







<h2>2010: The Year We Make Contact</h2>



<p>When I started working on the animation of the gas giant, I was really excited about the idea because I naively thought that this was going to be something novel, never tried before. Obviously, I was wrong. Films like ‘Outland’, ‘2010: The Year We Make Contact’, and ‘Contact’ all featured animated Jupiter.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/JupiterInMovies.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-836&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterInMovies-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterInMovies-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterInMovies-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterInMovies-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterInMovies-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterInMovies-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The most interesting portrayal here is the rendition created by Digital Productions for ‘2010: The Year We Make Contact’. The technology behind it is a marvel of CGI, even though it looks like a perfectly executed practical effect.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/JupiterBreakdown.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large is-style-default&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-837&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterBreakdown-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterBreakdown-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterBreakdown-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterBreakdown-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterBreakdown-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JupiterBreakdown-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The basic idea remains largely the same: utilizing a flowfield to deform the initial image. However, the execution differs significantly. While I used Substance Designer to generate flow textures, the team at Digital Productions utilized actual fluid mechanics to simulate the flow. My solution to the problem of mixing was to artificially reintroduce the color, whereas they sidestepped the problem entirely by converting the image into particles.</p>



<p>Remarkably, all of this was accomplished without the aid of modern CGI software or computing power. Instead, it relied on the ingenuity of a team of brilliant engineers and artists, supported by the CRAY X-MP.</p>



<p>The work of Larry Yaeger and Craig Upson is described in greater detail in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/15922.15895" data-type="link" data-id="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/15922.15895">Siggraph</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/CineFex_1985" data-type="link" data-id="https://archive.org/details/CineFex_1985">Cinefex</a> articles. Additionally, there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/5wuClV-i9r4?si=9uxfC098nNyDezOI" data-type="link" data-id="https://youtu.be/5wuClV-i9r4?si=9uxfC098nNyDezOI">documentary available on YouTube</a>.</p>



<h2>Further Developement</h2>



<p>The presented methods should be sufficient to create convincing-looking flow, but not necessarily a visually appealing planet. Achieving that requires several additional steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Colors: Currently, the R, G, and B channels represent different substances. Ultimately they will be replaced with a color texture.</li>



<li>UV Mapping: Currently, the texture is just a square; it needs to be wrapped around a sphere. However, I plan to use the method described in <a href="https://emildziewanowski.com/flat-planets/" data-type="post" data-id="108">Flat Planets</a> and apply it to a flat disc.</li>



<li>Shading: Atmosphere is lit differently than a solid, opaque object. A specialized shading model has to be created to complete the effect.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="Conclusions">Conclusions</h2>



<p>The initial setup required some effort, both in Unreal and in Substance Designer, but once in place, it allowed for easy tweaking and modifications. Since it does not rely on computational fluid dynamics, the motion can be handcrafted, which is both a strength and a challenge. It offers total freedom to create any flow imaginable, but requires the artist to have a basic understanding of fluid dynamics.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Most importantly, it can compete with actual fluid simulations while using only a fraction of resources. A full planet with a 1024×1024 texture takes less than 0.5ms to render, which is a modest price for such VFX. </p>

        <p>The Russian republic of Chechnya has announced a ban on music that’s either too fast or too slow. As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/09/chechnya-bans-dance-music-either-too-fast-slow"><em>Guardian</em></a>’s Philip Oltermann reports, officials hope to eradicate the “polluting” Western influence in the region.</p>

<p>“From now on, all musical, vocal and choreographic works must correspond to the tempo of 80 to 116 beats per minute,” wrote the Chechen Ministry of Culture in a translated <a href="https://mk-chr.ru/novosti/soveshchanie-s-rukovoditelyami-tvorcheskikh-gosudarstvennykh-i-munitsipalnykh-kollektivov-chechensko/">statement</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>The new rule—approved by the republic’s leader,&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/chechnyas-boss-and-putins-foot-soldier-how-ramzan-kadyrov-became-such-a-feared-figure-in-russia-216418">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>—will ensure that all Chechen music and dance productions conform to “Chechen mentality and musical rhythm.” According to the <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/04/05/prigozhin-monument-unveiled-in-southern-russias-krasnodar-region-a84753"><em>Moscow Times</em></a>, artists have until June 1 to rewrite songs that don’t align with the new ban. After that deadline, they will no longer be able to play those songs in public.</p>

<p>“Borrowing musical culture from other peoples is inadmissible,” said Musa Dadayevhe, the culture minister, at a meeting on April 5, according to Russian media reports translated by the <em>Guardian</em>. “We must bring to the people and to the future of our children the cultural heritage of the Chechen people.”</p>

<p>With a population of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18188085">1.5 million</a>, Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim republic located in southwestern Russia between the Black and Caspian seas. Since Kadyrov came to power in 2007, he’s been “Chechnya’s boss and Putin’s foot soldier,” as scholars <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/anya-free">Anya Free</a> and <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/marat-iliyasov">Marat Iliyasov</a> wrote for the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/chechnyas-boss-and-putins-foot-soldier-how-ramzan-kadyrov-became-such-a-feared-figure-in-russia-216418"><em>Conversation</em></a><em> </em>last year. The leader regularly uses religion to “galvanize supporters and demonstrate his political power.”</p>

<p>The new music ban is the latest in a series of restrictions—including a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/03/10/you-dress-according-their-rules/enforcement-islamic-dress-code-women-chechnya">strict dress code</a>—that Kadyrov has imposed on his people. As <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/europe/chechnya-music-ban-scli-intl/index.html">CNN</a>’s Jack Guy and Anna Chernova write, Kadyrov has gone to great lengths to “stifle any form of dissent.” The regime has been accused of numerous <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/02/1032641">human rights</a> <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/public-designation-of-russian-national-ramzan-kadyrov-due-to-involvement-in-gross-violations-of-human-rights/">violations</a>, particularly against gay men.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/09/1243632570/chechnya-music-ban-bpm">NPR</a>’s Rachel Treisman writes that the new ban criminalizes the majority of dance music that’s played in clubs worldwide, such as dubstep, techno and house music, which often have over 116 beats per minute.</p>

<p>“Some hip-hop and rap, which is typically played at speeds between 60 and 140 beats per minute, would in theory still qualify for the traditional Chechen ‘sense of rhythm’” that officials are trying to promote, as the <em>Guardian </em>writes.</p>

<p>Examples of now-banned tunes are <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/swiftposium-scholars-analyze-taylor-swift-astonishing-influence-180983780/">Taylor Swift</a>’s “Shake It Off” and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/little-rock-nine-and-paul-mccartney-react-to-beyonces-blackbird-cover-180984105/">Beyoncé</a>’s “Single Ladies,” which are too fast, and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-beatles-release-their-last-song-now-and-then-ai-john-lennon-180983188/">the Beatles</a>’ “Hey Jude,” which is too slow, per&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taylor-swift-beyonce-beatles-chechnya-ban-pop-music-tempo-limits-rcna146960">NBC News</a>’ Yuliya Talmazan.</p>

<p>As the independent Russian news website <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2024/04/05/v-chechne-razreshili-muzyku-tolko-ot-80-do-116-udarov-v-minutu-pod-zapretom-tehno-trans-vals-da-voobsche-pochti-vse"><em>Meduza</em></a><em> </em>notes, Russia’s national anthem—which is 76 beats per minute—falls outside the culture ministry’s range.</p>

<p>WebGPU is a powerful GPU-API for the web, providing support for advanced low-overhead rendering pipelines and GPU compute pipelines. WebGPU’s support for GPU compute shaders and storage buffers are a key distinction from WebGL, which lacks these features, and make it possible to bring powerful GPU-parallel applications to run entirely in the browser. These applications can range from GPGPU (e.g., simulations, data processing/analysis, machine learning, etc.) to GPU compute driven rendering pipelines, and applications across the spectrum.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll evaluate WebGPU compute performance against native Vulkan by implementing the classic Marching Cubes algorithm in WebGPU. Marching Cubes is a nearly embarrassingly parallel algorithm, with two global reduction steps that must take place to synchronize work items and thread output locations. This makes it a great first GPU-parallel algorithm to try out on a new platform, as it has enough complexity to stress the API in a few different ways beyond simple parallel kernel dispatches but isn’t so complex as to take an substantial amount of time to implement or be bottlenecked by CPU performance.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-marching-cubes">Introduction to Marching Cubes</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">Marching Cubes</a> is a classic algorithm in computer graphics for 3D surface reconstruction that was first introduced in 1987 by Lorensen and Cline. Given a scalar field defined over a 3D grid, Marching Cubes can be used to compute a triangle mesh of the surface at a given scalar value. The initial motivation for Marching Cubes was medical visualization, where given a 3D volume from a CT or MRI scan, the algorithm was used to compute surfaces representing bone or tissue for display. Marching Cubes and its follow-on algorithms are widely used in scientific visualization to compute surfaces on simulation data sets and medical imaging volumes; and can also be applied to rendering mathematical implicit surfaces defined over a 3D grid domain.</p>

<p>The algorithm is a bit easier to first understand in 2D, where it turns into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares">Marching Squares</a> algorithm.
Given a grid with values defined in each cell, we want to compute contour lines on the grid placed at a given value.
For example, on a map we may want to draw elevation lines at a certain elevation.
The Marching Squares algorithm proceeds as shown in the figure below.
Marching Cubes can be seen as generalization of Marching Squares into 3D, although the Marching Cubes algorithm was actually published first
and Marching Squares was a simplification of it into 2D.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.willusher.io/img/2024-04-22-wgpu-mc-marching-squares.png">
    
    <figcaption><b>Figure 1:</b>
    <i>
Given the cell-centered grid (a), we shift to the Dual Grid (b, in blue), where values are defined at the vertices instead of the cell centers.
Within a cell (c) we can now classify it into a contour case based on the values at its vertices (d). We compute a bitmask of 4 bits (one per vertex),
where the bit is set if the vertex value is below the contour value, and 0 if it's above or equal to it. This bitmask is then
used as an index value into a case table that defines the edges that the contour crosses of the cell (e).
  </i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Although we’ll focus on a standard GPU-parallel implementation of Marching Cubes here, we need some understanding of how the algorithm processes the data and interdependencies in the algorithm (if any) to see how it can be parallelized. For a more thorough discussion of Marching Cubes in a scalar execution context, see <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/">Paul Bourke’s excellent write-up</a>. Another cool write up that explains the basics of Marching Cubes starting from 2D <a href="https://blog.42yeah.is/algorithm/2023/07/15/marching-cubes.html">is this write up by 42yeah</a>.</p>

<p>To construct the triangle mesh representing the entire surface, Marching Cubes breaks the problem down to the task of computing the individual pieces of the surface that pass through each voxel. There are a number of possibilities for how the surface may pass through a voxel: it could be that the surface cuts the cell in half, clips a corner of it, passes through at some angle, or does not pass through at all. Each voxel has 8 vertices, each of which can be either inside or outside the surface, giving us a total of 2^8 = 256 possible configurations for a voxel. For each voxel we compute an 8-bit mask, where a 1 is marked for vertices below the desired surface value. The voxel bit mask is used to index into a triangulation case table that stores the list of edges that are intersected by each triangle in the voxel’s local surface. Each voxel’s surface can contain up to 5 triangles, following from the triangulation cases defined in the original Marching Cubes paper.</p>

<figure>

	<figcaption><b>Figure 2:</b>
	<i>
    Case 1 in the Marching Cubes triangle table: The isosurface crosses edges 
    0, 3, and 8, defining a single triangle within the cell. The case index
    is a bitmask where each bit marks 1 if the vertex's value is below the
    isovalue and 0 otherwise. This produces an index into the case table,
    which stores a triangulation for each case as the list of edges where
    the triangle's vertices should be placed.
    </i>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A serial version of the algorithm can be implemented with the following pseudo-code</p>

<h2 id="working-on-the-dual-grid">Working on the Dual Grid</h2>

<p>Marching Cubes requires each voxel’s values to be defined at its vertices, i.e. that the grid is “vertex-centered”. However, when we think about images or volumes (essentially 3D images), we typically think of them as cell-centered, where the values are defined at the center of each pixel or voxel. In order to run Marching Cubes on a cell-centered grid, we shift on to its “Dual Grid”. The Dual Grid places vertices at the cell centers of the cell-centered grid, producing a vertex-centered grid that is 1 cell smaller along each axis, and shifted up by half a cell:</p>

    Cell-centered grids are widely used in simulation and data scanning systems;
    however, Marching Cubes requires values defined at the vertices.
    For regular grids we can simply shift computation on to the Dual Grid,
    which is defined by placing a vertex at each cell's center in the cell-centered
    grid. The resulting Dual Grid has 1 fewer cells on each axis and is shifted
    up spatially by 0.5 on each axis.

<h2 id="gpu-parallel-marching-cubes">GPU-Parallel Marching Cubes</h2>

<p>From the pseudo-code above, we can see that Marching Cubes is well-suited to parallel execution, as each voxel can be processed independently. However, there is one array that is written by all voxels and which will be a write conflict without some care: the <code>output_vertices</code> array. Each voxel can output a varying number of vertices depending on its vertex values. We know that each voxel can output at most 5 triangles, so we could conservatively allocate space for 5 triangles per voxel and fill unused entries with degenerate triangles; however, this would require a prohibitive amount of memory for large surfaces and impact rendering performance. Instead, we would like to output a compact buffer containing just the valid output triangles.</p>

<p>To write a compact vertex buffer while preventing voxels from trampling each other’s output, we will split up the triangulation process into two kernels, and leverage the classic parallel primitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum">“Prefix Sum”</a> (also known as Exclusive Scan). First, we compute the number of vertices that each voxel will output, then we use an exclusive scan to turn this list into a sequence of output offsets for each voxel. Finally, we run a second kernel that writes each voxel’s triangles to its assigned subregion of the array using the offset computed by the exclusive scan.</p>

<p>We’ll also apply another optimization that requires a global synchronization step to filter down the list of voxels that we run the vertex count and computation kernels over. This optimization is similar to the early out in the pseudo-code. In a GPU-parallel context we will do this by computing a list of active voxel IDs. Our subsequent vertex computation kernels then only operate on the active voxels. The main benefit of this step is to increase GPU utilization and coherence for our vertex computation kernels. Rather than dispatching thousands of threads that immediately early-exit due to their voxel not containing triangles, we can efficiently filter them out ahead of time so that our vertex computation kernels only operate on a much smaller list of active voxels. Isosurfaces are typically very sparse, with just 4.5%-45% of the voxels may be active (<a href="https://www.willusher.io/publications/teraweb">check out my paper for some stats</a>).</p>

<h2 id="exclusive-scan">Exclusive Scan</h2>

<p>We’ll use a classic work-efficient parallel scan implementation, described for CUDA by  Harris et al. in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-39-parallel-prefix-sum-scan-cuda">GPU Gems 3</a>. Harris et al.’s write-up is excellent, and the translation of it to WebGPU and WGSL is a direct translation of the CUDA code, so here I’ll just cover some details of how scan works to see why it’s useful in a GPU parallel Marching Cubes implementation.</p>

<p>Exclusive (and inclusive) scans form a common building block of data-parallel algorithms, one common use for it is computing memory offsets for outputting data in parallel, as we need to do for Marching Cubes. This works by first outputting a counts buffer that records how many outputs each input will have. For example, after computing the number of triangles to be output by each voxel we could have a buffer like below:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>counts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we know how many triangles each voxel will output, but we don’t know where to write them in the output buffer without trampling outputs from other voxels. Exclusive scan to the rescue! The exclusive scan computes the output <code>y</code> sum over the input <code>x</code> as:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>y_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>y_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>x_0</span>
<span>y_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>x_0</span> <span>+</span> <span>x_1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Applying this to our <code>counts</code> buffer would produce:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>out</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To get the total number of outputs we can make our output buffer 1 element larger, resulting in:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>out</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>14</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Given our counts buffer, we’ve now been able to compute that we have 14 total output triangles that we need to allocate room for, and the output addresses for each voxel that will output triangles. Voxel 1 will write to offset 0, voxel 2 will write to offset 3, voxel 5 to offset 5, and voxel 6 to offset 10.</p>

<p>The full implementation for this project can be found in: <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/exclusive_scan.ts">exclusive_scan.ts</a>, and the shaders: <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/exclusive_scan_prefix_sum.wgsl">exclusive_scan_prefix_sum.wgsl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/exclusive_scan_prefix_sum_blocks.wgsl">exclusive_scan_prefix_sum_blocks.wgsl</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/exclusive_scan_add_block_sums.wgsl">exclusive_scan_add_block_sums.wgsl</a>. The implementation must chunk up dispatches to fit within the WebGPU max compute dispatch size limit, and makes use of bind group dynamic buffer offsets to have shaders access the right subregion of the input buffer when scanning through it in blocks.</p>

<h2 id="stream-compaction">Stream Compaction</h2>

<p>The operation we stated simply when describing the parallel algorithm, to just run the triangle count and computation kernels on the active voxels, requires a stream compaction operation to be implemented to run in a data parallel context. Similar to how we need to compute a buffer of the addresses to write each voxel’s outputs to, we need to compute a compact list of the voxel IDs that may contain the isosurface. This operation is typically called “stream compaction”, where we have a set of elements as input along with an array of masks specifying if we want to keep or discard an element. The output will either be the elements themselves, or in our case, the indices of the elements. Fortunately, we can perform this compaction by re-using the exclusive scan operation we just discussed above.</p>

<p>Our masks buffer will have the form:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>masks</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And computing an exclusive scan on the masks will produce a list of offsets to write the compacted results out to, along with the total number of items (again offsets is 1 element bigger than the masks array)</p>

<div><pre><code><span>offsets</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, all that’s left to do is write a kernel that runs over each input element and writes its index to the specified offset if its mask value was 1!</p>

<p>A more memory efficient implementation is also possible by running the scan in place on the masks buffer and checking if an element is active by checking if:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>offset</span><span>[</span><span>current</span><span>]</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>offset</span><span>[</span><span>current</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If this is true, it means the current element was active, as it caused the output offset for elements following it to be increased to make room for its output.</p>

<p>The implementation of the stream compaction that compacts the active voxel IDs down based on the offsets buffer is in: <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/stream_compact_ids.ts">stream_compact_ids.ts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/stream_compact_ids.wgsl">stream_compact_ids.wgsl</a>. The implementation is exactly as described here, with some additional handling to deal with chunking up the scan kernel dispatches when we exceed the max dispatch size.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together-in-webgpu">Putting it all Together in WebGPU</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve implemented our data-parallel primitives: exclusive scan and stream compaction, we’re ready to fill in the Marching Cubes specific parts of the computation to implement our parallel algorithm. There are three stages to the algorithm:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compute active voxel IDs</li>
  <li>Compute vertex output offsets</li>
  <li>Compute vertices</li>
</ol>

<p>After which we can render the computed surface.</p>

<h2 id="compute-active-voxel-ids">Compute Active Voxel IDs</h2>

<p>Computing the list of active voxel IDs consists of three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We run a kernel to mark the active voxels, producing the mask buffer</li>
  <li>Exclusive Scan the mask buffer to produce output offsets for active voxels</li>
  <li>Compact the active voxel IDs down using the offsets via Stream Compaction</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve implemented the primitives for steps 2 and 3, so the last thing to write is a kernel to run over the dual grid that computes if a voxel is active or not. The kernel is a direct translation of the first bit of the pseudocode we saw above performing the early out, except that instead of calling continue it writes a 0 or 1 to the mask buffer.</p>

<p>The full kernel code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/mark_active_voxel.wgsl">mark_active_voxel.wgsl</a>, and is written below in a briefer psuedo-shader form. This kernel is run for every voxel in the Dual Grid to produce the mask buffer in parallel.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>values</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>compute_voxel_values</span><span>(</span><span>voxel_id</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="compute-vertex-output-offsets-and-count">Compute Vertex Output Offsets and Count</h2>

<p>Now that we have a list of all the voxels that may output triangles, we can compute how many triangles each one will output to determine the output offsets and total triangle count. This is done using a kernel <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/compute_num_verts.wgsl">compute_num_verts.wgsl</a>, that is run in parallel over the active voxel IDs and outputs the number of vertices that voxel will output. Since we’re not using indexed rendering, every 3 vertices forms a triangle.</p>

<p>The compute num verts kernel computes the number of output vertices for a voxel using the <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/mc_case_table.ts">Marching Cube case table</a>. As we saw in the first sketch showing the calculation for a single voxel, the case table defines the edges of the voxel that the triangle’s vertices lie on, and marks the end of the sequence with a -1. Thus, our kernel can load the voxel’s values, compute the case index, and then loop through the case table values for that case to compute the number of vertices that will be output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>values</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>compute_voxel_values</span><span>(</span><span>voxel_id</span><span>);</span>
<span>uint</span> <span>case_index</span> <span>=</span> <span>compute_case_index</span><span>(</span><span>values</span><span>,</span> <span>isovalue</span><span>);</span>
<span>int</span> <span>triangulation</span><span>[</span><span>16</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>case_table</span><span>[</span><span>case_index</span><span>];</span>
<span>uint</span> <span>num_verts</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>uint</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>16</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>triangulation</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>++</span><span>num_verts</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>voxel_num_verts</span><span>[</span><span>work_item</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>num_verts</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We then perform an exclusive scan on the <code>voxel_num_verts</code> output buffer to compute the output offsets for each voxel and the total number of vertices to be output.</p>

<h2 id="compute-vertices">Compute Vertices</h2>

<p>With the output offsets ready and the output vertex buffer allocated, all that’s left to do is actually compute and output the vertices! This is done by the kernel <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-marching-cubes/blob/main/src/compute_vertices.wgsl">compute_vertices.wgsl</a>. It takes the list of active voxel IDs and the output offsets computed previously and computes the vertices for each voxel and writes them to the output. This kernel is run in parallel over all active voxels.</p>

<p>The vertices for each voxel are computed by looping through the triangulation for its case and lerp’ing between the vertices at the end of each edge by the field value to compute the position where the isosurface intersects the edge. The vertex is first computed in the unit voxel, then offset by the voxel’s position in the volume grid and the 0.5 offset of the Dual Grid. This is written below in pseudo-shader code, see the kernel code on Github for the full code.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>float</span> <span>values</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>compute_voxel_values</span><span>(</span><span>voxel_id</span><span>);</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="render-surface">Render Surface</h2>

<p>Computing the surface took a bit of work and quite a few compute passes across all our kernels! Fortunately, rendering it is very simple. The output of our compute vertices pass is a triangle soup with all the vertices for all voxels written out as an unindexed list of triangles that we can simply draw as a “triangle-list” topology geometry without an index buffer.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-webgpu-performance-vs-vulkan">Conclusion: WebGPU Performance vs. Vulkan</h2>

<p>With our implementation done, it’s time to see how it stacks up against a native Vulkan implementation! I’ve implemented the exact same code in Vulkan, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/vulkan-marching-cubes">here on Github</a>. For these tests we’ll use a few small datasets from <a href="https://klacansky.com/open-scivis-datasets/index.html">OpenScivisDatasets</a>, the Skull, Bonsai, Foot and Aneurysm. Each dataset is 256x256x256 for a total of 16.77M cells (the dual grid has 16.58M cells).</p>

<p>In both methods I ran a sweep up the isovalue from 30 to 110, covering isosurfaces of interest to a typical user (i.e., not too much noise, not too small). The performance results are shown in the table below on a MBP with an M2 Max, and an RTX 3080. The RTX 3080 is used for the WebGPU vs. Vulkan performance comparisons, where we find that performance on average is very close to the native Vulkan version!</p>

<p>Having access to a modern low-overhead GPU API in the browser is really exciting, and opens up a ton of new possibilities for games, content creation tools, scientific applications and more to run in the browser with near native performance. Currently this application will only run in Chrome, but Safari and Firefox are working hard on WebGPU development. I’m looking forward to the day that WebGPU support is widespread across vendors!</p>

<h2 id="live-demo-and-code">Live Demo and Code</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/noncompete-rule.pdf">issued a final rule</a> to promote competition by banning noncompetes nationwide, protecting the fundamental freedom of workers to change jobs, increasing innovation, and fostering new business formation.</p><p>“Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once noncompetes are banned,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The FTC’s final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.”</p><p>The FTC estimates that the final rule banning noncompetes will lead to new business formation growing by 2.7% per year, resulting in more than 8,500 additional new businesses created each year. The final rule is expected to result in higher earnings for workers, with estimated earnings increasing for the average worker by an additional $524 per year, and it is expected to lower health care costs by up to $194 billion over the next decade. In addition, the final rule is expected to help drive innovation, leading to an estimated average increase of 17,000 to 29,000 more patents each year for the next 10 years under the final rule.</p>
<article>
  </article><p>Noncompetes are a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business. Noncompetes often force workers to either stay in a job they want to leave or bear other significant harms and costs, such as being forced to switch to a lower-paying field, being forced to relocate, being forced to leave the workforce altogether, or being forced to defend against expensive litigation. An estimated 30 million workers—nearly one in five Americans—are subject to a noncompete.</p><p>Under the FTC’s new rule, existing noncompetes for the vast majority of workers will no longer be enforceable after the rule’s effective date.&nbsp;Existing noncompetes for senior executives - who represent less than 0.75% of workers - can remain in force under the FTC’s final rule, but employers are banned from entering into or attempting to enforce any new noncompetes, even if they involve senior executives.&nbsp;Employers will be required to provide notice to workers other than senior executives who are bound by an existing noncompete that they will not be enforcing any noncompetes against them.</p><p>In January 2023, the FTC issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-which-hurt-workers-harm-competition">proposed rule</a> which was subject to a 90-day public comment period. The FTC received more than 26,000 comments on the proposed rule, with over 25,000 comments in support of the FTC’s proposed ban on noncompetes. The comments informed the FTC’s final rulemaking process, with the FTC carefully reviewing each comment and making changes to the proposed rule in response to the public’s feedback.</p><p>In the final rule, the Commission has determined that it is an unfair method of competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, for employers to enter into noncompetes with workers and to enforce certain noncompetes.</p><p>The Commission found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect competitive conditions in labor markets by inhibiting efficient matching between workers and employers. The Commission also found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect competitive conditions in product and service markets, inhibiting new business formation and innovation. There is also evidence that noncompetes lead to increased market concentration and higher prices for consumers.</p><h2>Alternatives to Noncompetes</h2><p>The Commission found that employers have several alternatives to noncompetes that still enable firms to protect their investments without having to enforce a noncompete.</p><p>Trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) both provide employers with well-established means to protect proprietary and other sensitive information. Researchers estimate that over 95% of workers with a noncompete already have an NDA.</p><p>The Commission also finds that instead of using noncompetes to lock in workers, employers that wish to retain employees can compete on the merits for the worker’s labor services by improving wages and working conditions.</p><h2>Changes from the NPRM</h2><p>Under the final rule, existing noncompetes for senior executives can remain in force. Employers, however, are prohibited from entering into or enforcing new noncompetes with senior executives. The final rule defines senior executives as workers earning more than $151,164 annually and who are in policy-making positions.</p><p>Additionally, the Commission has eliminated a provision in the proposed rule that would have required employers to legally modify existing noncompetes by formally rescinding them. That change will help to streamline compliance.</p><p>Instead, under the final rule, employers will simply have to provide notice to workers bound to an existing noncompete that the noncompete agreement will not be enforced against them in the future. To aid employers’ compliance with this requirement, the Commission has included<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/noncompete-rule"> model language</a> in the final rule that employers can use to communicate to workers.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commission vote to approve the issuance of the final rule was 3-2 with Commissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew N. Ferguson voting no. Commissioners’ written statements will follow at a later date.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;final rule will become effective 120 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p><p>Once the rule is effective, market participants can report information about a suspected violation of the rule to the Bureau of Competition by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:noncompete@ftc.gov">noncompete@ftc.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/rabbitscam/rabbitr1/blob/main/rabbit.tech">rabbit.tech</a> has been making waves with its highly publicized release of the Rabbit R1 device, claiming it can perform tasks on your behalf and liberate you from app-based interactions. But let's call a spade a spade – <strong>this is a blatant lie</strong>. And we're about to expose it with the first partial release of the source code for its so-called "large action model".</p>
<p dir="auto">For those with a technical background, it's painfully clear that there's <strong>no artificial intelligence or large action model in sight</strong>. In reality, they're simply relying on several <strong>Playwright</strong> automation scripts to do the job for you, which is why they only support four apps: Spotify, Midjourney, Doordash, and UberEats.</p>
<p dir="auto">What's even more alarming is that they ask you to login through their web portal, which is just a virtual machine connected via <strong>NoVNC</strong>. They also expect you to <strong>fill in your private passwords on their VMs</strong>. To make matters worse, they <strong>store the user sessions on their machines</strong> without any additional layers of security. This is both a blatant disregard for user privacy and a hilariously bad engineering practice.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sadly, this shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who's done minimal due diligence on the team. After all, they were still hawking NFTs just two years ago.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Drivers love CarPlay. Apple's WWDC 22 keynote revealed that <span><span><span>79% of drivers only consider a car if it has CarPlay.</span><span></span></span></span> And it's easy to see why. Even compared to the best native infotainment systems, CarPlay does several things way better.</p>
<h2>Best Services</h2>
<p>I use only three apps when driving: Google Maps for navigation, Spotify for music, and Castro for podcasts. The number of cars on sale today with these three apps available is zero.</p>
<p>This is a little unfair because Castro is a small, iOS-only app. There are a couple of carmakers that use Android Automotive with Google's services, which means they natively support Google Maps and Spotify. But it does mean that if I want to listen to podcasts in these cars, I have to change my podcast app to one available in the Play Store.</p>
<h2>Seamless Experience</h2>
<p>Continuing with the above example, let's imagine I just downloaded a new podcast app on my phone (one that is also available in the automotive Play Store). The next day I have to go on a long drive and I want to listen to a podcast episode I downloaded on my phone. When I enter my car, I have to go to the Play Store, find the app, download it, log in, and then download the episode. When I use CarPlay, I only have to connect my phone. No matter how many services are available inside the car, there is no match for seamlessly transferring the phone's state to the car.</p>
<h2>Familiar Design</h2>
<p>Cars have too many features and most are designed differently. Even functions like climate controls can vary greatly between car brands. It's reassuring to know that no matter which car I drive, the most complicated part of the interior works exactly like my iPhone, and is set in the right language, with my preferences, and my favorite apps.</p>
<h2>Longevity</h2>
<p>Entering an 8-year-old car and having access to the latest CarPlay version is amazing. By untying the fastest aging part from the rest of the interior, it can remain relevant longer. Especially given that the car industry is switching to running third-party Android apps with no history of long-term support.</p>

  </figure></span></p><h2>The Next Version of CarPlay</h2>
<p>The first version of CarPlay has been available since 2016 and has been a major success. For car industry standards, it was adopted quickly and by almost every carmaker. But since then, the car industry has been changing while the design and functionality of CarPlay have mostly stayed the same.</p>
<p>With lower hardware cost and an increased focus on software, carmakers have invested more in their interiors to set themselves apart. Google jumped on this opportunity by releasing Android Automotive. Unlike Android Auto, Google's equivalent to Apple CarPlay, Android Automotive runs natively inside the car and any carmaker is free to use it. Google monetizes it by licensing its 'Google Automotive Services' to carmakers. This gives carmakers access to Google's services like Google Maps, Waze, the Play Store, and Google Assistant.</p>

<p>Today, CarPlay is a standard that carmakers can use to pass a video signal from the phone to the head unit and return input events. There's only a limited connection with the vehicle. This is changing with CarPlay 2 which has a deeper integration with the vehicle.</p>

    <figcaption>The concept Apple used to introduce CarPlay 2</figcaption>
  </figure></span></p><p>Thanks to a deep integration with the software stack of the vehicle, CarPlay 2 can control most infotainment functions. It can therefore take over the entire infotainment display, the instrument cluster, and any passenger displays. For customers, it will appear like CarPlay works exactly in the same way but underneath, a lot of custom work is necessary by the carmaker and Apple to integrate. For example, even though most of the computing power still comes from the iPhone, there will be some software engineering necessary on the carmakers' hardware to ensure that safety-critical information like speed doesn't disappear when the iPhone crashes.</p>
<p>Apple is fully dependent on the carmaker's willingness to work with them to implement this. This is why the WWDC keynote was clearly a pitch aimed at carmakers, not consumers. But so far, on the surface, it seems like carmakers have not been eager to implement the new version.</p>
<p>Mercedes was supposedly on board according to Apple's WWDC slide, <span><span><span>but its CEO seemed less enthusiastic in reality.</span><span></span></span></span> Apple also announced it would show the first brands in 2023 and barely made that deadline by announcing Porsche and Aston Martin only two weeks before the end of the year.</p>

    <figcaption>The concepts from Porsche and Aston Martin</figcaption>
  </figure></span></p><h2>Why Are Some Carmakers Hesitant to Integrate CarPlay 2</h2>
<p>There are two camps among carmakers. There are brands like Porsche <span><span><span>and Volvo</span><span></span></span></span> who recognize they can't compete with Apple and Google in infotainment and want to work with them, while other carmakers see them as a threat.</p>
<p>The first group of carmakers has likely already been working with Apple to integrate CarPlay 2. One reason why it has been mostly silent around it is that it can take years to release something that touches complicated software and hardware, requires a collaboration between Apple and the carmaker, and all in the long development times of the car industry. That is why I'm sure we will see more brands announced soon.</p>
<p>However, some carmakers aren't jumping to work with Apple. The reason for this mostly comes down to who owns the in-car experience, and here is why.</p>
<h2>Brand Differentiation</h2>
<p>There used to be a big difference in driving characteristics and technology between premium and budget brands. Compared to a Volkswagen, a BMW used to have a more powerful engine, better handling, and comfort features like seat-heating and cruise control. However, a Volkswagen Golf now has similar tech as a BMW and with the transition to EVs, drivetrains and handling won't be the same differentiator as before.</p>
<p>Now, the focus has moved to the interior. Infotainment systems have become a central part of that, so carmakers are coming up with unusual concepts to set them apart, both in hardware and software. CarPlay 2 is going exactly in the opposite direction, more towards standardizing the in-car software.</p>

    <figcaption>Carmakers want to differentiate through unusual interior concepts</figcaption>
  </figure></span></p><p>A lot of the concerns around branding focus on the instrument cluster as it's one of the most recognizable parts of an interior. If you look at the CarPlay concept for Porsche and remove the steering wheel, there is no way you can tell it's a Porsche. I'm sure many brands took notice of this.</p>

  </figure></span></p><h2>Lack of Design Control</h2>
<p>With many traditional differentiators being democratized, design is a good way to stand out. An EV drivetrain may not be that different between cars, but it comes with the added burden of charging and route planning. Premium brands can offer a better experience than budget brands.</p>
<p>For example, Tesla's route planning is a major unique selling point. No other EV brand offers the ease of entering a car, planning a route, and setting off without worrying about the charging experience. Tesla could only have done this by creating their own routing algorithm. It would have been impossible if it had relied on Google and Apple.</p>
<p>In some way, brands using a native Android infotainment system with Google's services have a similar challenge. But these brands also happen to be the ones that are eager to work with Apple.</p>
<h2>Monetization</h2>
<p>Carmakers are envious of big tech's app store and services revenue. With their own software platforms, they are desperately trying to find recurring revenue streams, whether it's a subscription for seat heating or driver assistance systems. But it won't be possible to sell a subscription for a feature when all is controlled by Apple CarPlay.</p>

  </figure></span></p><h2>Integration Cost vs. Value</h2>
<p>Most carmakers offer the current CarPlay version. It doesn't require much effort as they only have to implement the CarPlay standard and have the hardware certified. CarPlay 2 requires a lot more work but does it offer significantly more value? As mentioned above, the core benefit of CarPlay is access to your favorite apps in a familiar design. CarPlay 2 offers more features and a nicer experience but will customers choose a car because it has CarPlay 2 over a one with CarPlay 1? Many carmakers think not and are happy to wait and see where the market is going.</p>
<p>CarPlay 2 is also not a full substitute for an infotainment system and not all new car customers are iPhone users. Carmakers spend millions making their infotainment systems, so why would they spend even more to work with Apple on something that is an add-on, and not for all customers?</p>
<h2>Apple's Risky Strategy</h2>
<p>Unlike Android, which carmakers can customize extensively, Apple avoids turning CarPlay into a full native infotainment system. The reasons are clear: carmakers vary widely in display layout, features, and safety-critical software. Apple would have to give up control over the software and design to carmakers, or invest massively in adapting to each brand itself.</p>
<p>Consequently, Apple tries to take over as much of the in-car experience with a software and hardware platform that they totally control. This means that any customization requires investment from Apple's side. From a business perspective, Apple must find the sweet spot between offering enough customization to satisfy carmakers while keeping investment at a minimum. Especially considering that, even though it indirectly boosts app store, services, and iPhone revenue, CarPlay is free for carmakers.</p>
<p>Apple’s long-term goal is likely to find ways to directly monetize CarPlay. It could license CarPlay to carmakers at some point. But with the entire global car market amounting to only around 70 million cars per year and the car industry’s slim profit margins (ranging from 5% to 15%), it must reach a high market share to get significant revenue from it. However, carmakers may be hesitant to invest in what they see as a competing product.</p>
<h2>What Can Apple Do to Convince Hesitant Carmakers?</h2>
<p>Apple can do two things to accelerate the adoption of CarPlay 2: tailor more to the wishes of carmakers and turn CarPlay 2 into a major purchasing reason for consumers, forcing carmakers to adopt it. Apple has many opportunities to explore to achieve that.</p>
<h3>More UI Customization</h3>
<p>It's very difficult for Apple to find a balance between creating a UI that is clearly 'Apple', that is at the same time custom enough to the carmaker, allows drivers to personalize it, and requires minimum design and development cost.</p>
<p>From carmakers' perspective, current concepts are leaning too much towards Apple in that balance. But there are ways to improve this. One great example is the collaboration between Nike and Apple for the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Nike offers different watch faces with custom fonts that bring branding from Nike into a design that is still unquestionably Apple.</p>

<p>Apple won't let carmakers alter the operating system, but they can provide a way for carmakers to add custom features through third-party integrations. For example, Porsche could create a track-driving app that can display a widget in the instrument cluster, or Land Rover could create a widget for displaying specific off-road-related information.&nbsp;It will allow carmakers to offer unique features while staying inside the CarPlay environment.</p>

<p>Passenger entertainment will be a big focus in the coming years. With cheaper display prices and changing customer expectations, we will see more cars with screens for passengers. So far, they have been quite useless and carmakers are struggling to improve the experience. Apple owns this domain with Apple TV and Airplay. A mix between CarPlay and Apple TV would create the perfect passenger experience. As carmakers will continue to struggle to provide all the popular services inside the car, it's a real selling point for CarPlay.</p>
<h3>Revenue-sharing</h3>
<p>Missing out on potential service revenue is one reason why carmakers are hesitant to adopt CarPlay 2. Apple could implement several ways for revenue sharing. For carmakers, offering their services inside the Apple ecosystem has benefits because it is a trusted platform and everybody has accounts and payments set up already which means they reach a wider audience. Apple could create a way for carmakers to offer upgrades and subscriptions through CarPlay, the App Store, or other channels, and share revenue with them.</p>
<h3>Create the Best Navigation Experience</h3>
<p>Carmakers hesitate with CarPlay because they think they can compete with tech giants by building their own navigation services, payments platform, and app store. However, so far, only a few of the existing services are actually good enough.</p>
<p>Most drivers prefer Google Maps but even that leaves a lot of room for improvement. There isn't really a navigation app that sticks head and shoulders above the rest. Apple has an opportunity with Maps to turn it into the ultimate navigation and route-planning app. I'd love to be able to plan a route, reserve a charger, and pay for parking inside one app. If Apple Maps and other Apple services are the preferred ones by drivers, they may be more likely to choose a brand with a deep CarPlay integration, pushing carmakers to adopt it.</p>

<p>Carmakers see their cars as the center of the universe, but in reality, a car is more part of an ecosystem. Apple is the best at creating a holistic experience across all my devices and cars can be a part of that. I want to control the cabin temperature from the Apple Home app, see my battery status in the Apple Maps app, use my iPhone to unlock my car, and remotely customize the instrument cluster. These are the kind of features that carmakers will forever struggle with and show the real benefit of CarPlay.</p>
<hr>
<p>Apple is going in a different direction than Google in the automotive industry. While maintaining full control over software and hardware is a smart move, it demands significant investment to integrate and adapt to each carmaker. For Apple to remain dominant in the car industry and explore future monetization opportunities, it must convince most car manufacturers to come on board.</p>
<p>It's not possible to say how many brands are currently working with Apple to implement it. Due to long development times and some public comments by carmaker executives, it may appear like Apple is struggling to get carmakers to adopt it but I wouldn't be surprised if most brands that Apple presented during WWDC 2022 are currently implementing it. However, it's also true that CarPlay competes directly with carmakers' own systems which makes some hesitant to integrate CarPlay in its current form. To convince those carmakers, Apple has many opportunities to adapt CarPlay should it need to.</p>
<p>Once the first cars with CarPlay 2 are in the showrooms, it will be interesting to see whether it will influence purchasing decisions. I'm a big fan of the CarPlay approach of extending the phone to the car and standardizing the design to some extent across the industry. I will be rooting for CarPlay 2 and I can't wait to try it when the first cars hit the road!</p><div><p>New post notification</p><p for="email">Receive an email when I post a new article</p><p for="email">Don't worry, I won't spam you with anything else</p></div><div><p><h4>Recent posts</h4></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The main configuration file is <code>fallout.cfg</code>. There are several important settings you might need to adjust for your installation. Depending on your Fallout distribution main game assets <code>master.dat</code>, <code>critter.dat</code>, and <code>data</code> folder might be either all lowercased, or all uppercased. You can either update <code>master_dat</code>, <code>critter_dat</code>, <code>master_patches</code> and <code>critter_patches</code> settings to match your file names, or rename files to match entries in your <code>fallout.cfg</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>sound</code> folder (with <code>music</code> folder inside) might be located either in <code>data</code> folder, or be in the Fallout folder. Update <code>music_path1</code> setting to match your hierarchy, usually it's <code>data/sound/music/</code> or <code>sound/music/</code>. Make sure it match your path exactly (so it might be <code>SOUND/MUSIC/</code> if you've installed Fallout from CD). Music files themselves (with <code>ACM</code> extension) should be all uppercased, regardless of <code>sound</code> and <code>music</code> folders.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second configuration file is <code>f1_res.ini</code>. Use it to change game window size and enable/disable fullscreen mode.</p>

<p dir="auto">Recommendations:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Desktops</strong>: Use any size you see fit.</li>
<li><strong>Tablets</strong>: Set these values to logical resolution of your device, for example iPad Pro 11 is 1668x2388 (pixels), but it's logical resolution is 834x1194 (points).</li>
<li><strong>Mobile phones</strong>: Set height to 480, calculate width according to your device screen (aspect) ratio, for example Samsung S21 is 20:9 device, so the width should be 480 * 20 / 9 = 1067.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In time this stuff will receive in-game interface, right now you have to do it manually.</p>

<p dir="auto">Here is a couple of current goals. Open up an issue if you have suggestion or feature request.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Update to v1.2</strong>. This project is based on Reference Edition which implements v1.1 released in November 1997. There is a newer v1.2 released in March 1998 which at least contains important multilingual support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Backport some Fallout 2 features</strong>. Fallout 2 (with some Sfall additions) added many great improvements and quality of life enhancements to the original Fallout engine. Many deserve to be backported to Fallout 1. Keep in mind this is a different game, with slightly different gameplay balance (which is a fragile thing on its own).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This is the story of how Google Search died, and the people responsible for killing it.</p><p>The story begins on February 5th 2019, when Ben Gomes, Google’s head of search, had a problem. Jerry Dischler, then the VP and General Manager of Ads at Google, and Shiv Venkataraman, then the VP of Engineering, Search and Ads on Google properties, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usdoj-media/atr/media/1322631/dl?inline=&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>had called a “code yellow” for search revenue</u></a> due to, and I quote, “steady weakness in the daily numbers” and a likeliness that it would end the quarter significantly behind.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with Google’s internal scientology-esque jargon, let me explain. A “code yellow” isn’t, as you might think, a crisis of moderate severity. The yellow, according to Steven Levy’s tell-all book about Google, refers to — and I promise that I’m not making this up — the <a href="https://markcarrigan.net/2016/01/10/googles-war-against-latency/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>color of a tank top that former VP of Engineering Wayne Rosling used to wear during his time at the company</u></a>. It’s essentially the equivalent of DEFCON 1 and activates, as Levy explained, a war room-like situation where workers are pulled from their desks and into a conference room where they tackle the problem as a top priority. Any other projects or concerns are sidelined.</p><p>In emails released as part of the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google, Dischler laid out several contributing factors — search query growth was “significantly behind forecast,” the “timing” of revenue launches was significantly behind, and a vague worry that “several advertiser-specific and sector weaknesses” existed in search.</p><blockquote>I should note that I’ve previously — and erroneously — referred to the “code yellow” as something that Gomes raised as a means of calling attention to the proximity of Google’s ads side getting too close to search. The truth is much grimmer — the Code Yellow was the rumble of the Rot Economy, with Google’s revenue arm sounding the alarm that its golden goose wasn’t laying enough eggs. Gomes, a Googler of 19 years that built the foundation of modern search engines, should go down as one of the few people in tech that actually fought for a real principle, destroyed by and replaced with Prabhakar Raghavan, a computer scientist class traitor that sided with the management consultancy sect. More confusingly, one of the problems was that there was insufficient growth in “queries,” as in the amount of things people were asking Google. It’s a bit like if Ford decided that things were going poorly because drivers weren’t putting enough miles on their trucks.</blockquote><p>Anyway, a few days beforehand on February 1 2019, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417581.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Kristen Gil, then Google’s VP Business Finance Officer, had emailed Shashi Thakur, then Google’s VP of Engineering, Search and Discover, saying that the ads team had been considering a “code yellow” to “close the search gap [it was] seeing,”</u></a> vaguely referring to how critical that growth was to an unnamed “company plan.” To be clear, this email was in response to Thakur stating that there is “nothing” that the search team could do to operate at the fidelity of growth that ads had demanded.</p><blockquote><strong><em>(Editor’s note: If you read those emails, start from the bottom and work your way up).</em></strong></blockquote><p>Shashi forwarded the email to Gomes, asking if there was any way to discuss this with Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, and declaring that there was no way he’d sign up to a “high fidelity” business metric for daily active users on search. Thakur also said something that I’ve been thinking about constantly since I read these emails: that there was a good reason that Google’s founders separated search from ads.</p><p>On February 2, 2019, just one day later, Thakur and Gomes shared their anxieties with Nick Fox, a Vice President of Search and Google Assistant, entering a multiple-day-long debate about Google’s sudden lust for growth. The thread is a dark window into the world of growth-focused tech, where Thakur listed the multiple points of disconnection between the ads and search teams, discussing how the search team wasn’t able to finely optimize engagement on Google without “hacking engagement,” a term that means effectively tricking users into spending more time on a site, and that doing so would lead them to “abandon work on efficient journeys.” In one email, Fox adds that there was a “pretty big disconnect between what finance and ads want” and what search was doing.</p><p>When Gomes pushed back on the multiple requests for growth, Fox added that all three of them were responsible for search, that search was “the revenue engine of the company,” and that bartering with the ads and finance teams was potentially “the new reality of their jobs.”&nbsp;</p><p>On February 6th 2019, Gomes said that he believed that search was “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417581.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>getting too close to the money</u></a>,” and ended his email by saying that he was “concerned that growth is all that Google was thinking about.”&nbsp;</p><p>On March 22 2019, Google VP of Product Management Darshan Kantak would declare the end of the code yellow. The thread mostly consisted of congratulatory emails until Gomes responded congratulating the team, saying that the plans architected as part of the code would do well throughout the year.</p><p>Prabhakar Raghavan, then Google’s Head of Ads and the true mastermind behind the code yellow, would respond curtly, saying that the current revenue targets were addressed “by heroic RPM engineering” and that “core query softness continued without mitigation” — a very clunky way of saying that despite these changes, query growth wasn’t happening.&nbsp;</p><p>A day later, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417557.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Gomes emailed Fox and Thakur an email he intended to send to Raghavan</u></a>. He led by saying he was “annoyed both personally and on behalf of the search team.” in a long email, he explained how one might increase engagement with Google Search, but specifically added that they could “increase queries quite easily in the short term in user negative ways,” like turning off spell correction, turning off ranking improvements, or placing refinements — effectively labels — all over the page, adding that it was “possible that there are trade offs here between different kinds of user negativity caused by engagement hacking,” and that he was “deeply deeply uncomfortable with this.” He also added that this was the reason he didn’t believe that queries were a good metric to measure search and that the best defense about the weakness of queries was to create “compelling user experiences that make users want to come back.”</p><p>In the March 2019 core update to search, which happened about a week before the end of the code yellow, was expected to be “one of the largest updates to search in a very long time. Yet when it launched, many found that the update <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/florida-update-2-insights/298365/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>mostly rolled back changes</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.webmasterworld.com/google/4938447-2-50.htm?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=(gmt%200)-,Traffic%20on%20several%20sites%20that%20were%20abused%20by%20Penquin%20have%20rebounded%20significantly.,-nettulf"><u>traffic was increasing to sites that had previously been suppressed</u></a> by <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/glossary/google-penguin-update/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google Search’s “Penguin” update from 2012</u></a> that specifically targeted spammy search results, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/early-data-on-google-march-2019-core-update-show-an-interesting-pattern-314089?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>as well as those hit by an update from an August 1, 2018</u></a>, a few months after Gomes became Head of Search.</p><p>While I’m guessing, the timing of the March 2019 core update, along with the traffic increases to previously-suppressed sites, heavily suggests that Google’s response to the Code Yellow was to roll back changes that were made to maintain the quality of search results.</p><p>A few months later in May 2019, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google would roll out a redesign of how ads are shown on the platform</u></a> on Google’s mobile search, replacing the bright green “ad” label and URL color on ads with a tiny little bolded black note that said “ad,” with the link looking otherwise identical to a regular search link. I guess that's how it started hitting their numbers following the code yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/1/23/21078343/google-ad-desktop-design-change-favicon-icon-ftc-guidelines?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google would bring this change to the desktop</u></a>, which The Verge’s Jon Porter would suggest made “Google’s ads look just like search results now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Five months later, a little over a year after the Code Yellow debacle, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-promotes-prabhakar-raghavan-to-lead-search-replacing-ben-gomes-335561?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google would make Prabhakar Raghavan the head of Google Search</u></a>, with Jerry Dischler taking his place as head of ads. After nearly 20 years of building Google Search, Gomes would be relegated to SVP of Education at Google. Gomes, who was a critical part of the original team that made Google Search work, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2010/08/19/when-you-google-think-ben-gomes/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>who has been credited with establishing the culture of the world’s largest and most important search engine</u></a>, was chased out by a growth-hungry managerial types led by Prabhakar Raghavan, a management consultant wearing an engineer costume.&nbsp;</p><p>A quick note: I used “management consultant” there as a pejorative. While he exhibits all the same bean-counting, morally-unguided behaviors of a management consultant, from what I can tell Raghavan has never actually worked in that particular sector of the economy.&nbsp;</p><p>But do you know who has? Sundar Pichai, who previously worked at McKinsey — arguably the most morally abhorrent company that has ever existed, having played roles both in the 2008 financial crisis (where it <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/mckinsey-how-does-it-always-get-away-with-it-9113484.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>encouraged banks to load up on debt and flawed mortgage-backed securities</u></a>) and the ongoing opioid crisis, where it effectively <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/ag-shapiro-puts-a-stop-to-mckinseys-proliferation-of-the-opioid-crisis/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>advised Purdue Pharma on how to “growth hack” sales of Oxycontin</u></a>. McKinsey has paid nearly $1bn over several settlements due to its work with Purdue. I’m getting sidetracked, but one last point. McKinsey is actively anti-labor. When a company brings in a McKinsey consultant, they’re often there to advise on how to “cut costs,” which <a href="http://rchive/2020/02/how-mckinsey-destroyed-middle-class/605878/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>inevitably means layoffs and outsourcing</u></a>. McKinsey is to the middle class what flesh-eating bacteria is to healthy tissue.&nbsp;</p><p>These emails are a stark example of the monstrous growth-at-all-costs mindset that dominates the tech ecosystem, and if you take one thing away from this newsletter, I want it to be the name Prabhakar Raghavan, and an understanding that there are people responsible for the current state of technology.&nbsp;</p><p>These emails — which I encourage you to look up — tell a dramatic story about how Google’s finance and advertising teams, led by Raghavan with the blessing of CEO Sundar Pichai, actively worked to make Google worse to make the company more money. This is what I mean when I talk about the Rot Economy — the illogical, product-destroying mindset that turns the products you love into torturous, frustrating quasi-tools that require you to fight the company’s intentions to get the service you want.</p><h2 id="heroes-and-villains">Heroes and Villains</h2><p>Ben Gomes is a hero. He was instrumental in making search work, both as a product and a business, joining the company in 1999 — a time long before Google established dominance in the field, and the same year when Larry Page and Sergey Brin tried to sell the company to Excite for $1m, only to walk away after Vinod Khosla (an Excite investor and the co-founder of Sun Microsystems) lowballed the pair with a $750,000 offer.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241011/this-man-has-helped-shape-google-search-almost-from-the-start?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>an interview with FastCompany’s Harry McCracken from 2018</u></a>, Gomes framed Google’s challenge as “taking [the PageRank algorithm] from one machine to a whole bunch of machines, and they weren’t very good machines at the time.” Despite his impact and tenure, Gomes had only been made Head of Search in the middle of 2018 after John Giannandrea moved to Apple to work on its machine learning and AI strategy. Gomes had been described as Google’s “search czar,” beloved for his ability to communicate across departments.&nbsp;</p><p>Every single article I’ve read about Gomes’ tenure at Google spoke of a man deeply ingrained in the foundation of one of the most important technologies ever made, who had dedicated decades to maintaining a product with a — to quote Gomes himself — “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241011/this-man-has-helped-shape-google-search-almost-from-the-start?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=To%20me%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20guiding%20light%20of%20serving%20the%20user%20and%20using%20technology%20to%20do%20that" rel="noreferrer">guiding light of serving the user and using technology to do that</a>.”&nbsp;And when finally given the keys to the kingdom — the ability to elevate Google Search even further — he was ratfucked by a series of rotten careerists trying to please Wall Street, led by Prabhakar Raghavan.</p><p>Do you want to know what Prabhakar Raghavan’s old job was? What Prabhakar Raghavan, the new head of Google Search, the guy that has run Google Search into the ground, the guy who is currently destroying search, did before his job at Google?</p><p><strong><em>He was the head of search for Yahoo from 2005 through 2012</em></strong> — a tumultuous period that cemented its terminal decline, and effectively saw the company bow out of the search market altogether.&nbsp;His responsibilities? Research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. </p><p>When Raghavan joined the company, Yahoo <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/search-engine-market-shares-in-june-2005-google-36-9-yahoo-30-4-msn-15-7/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>held a 30.4 percent market share</u></a> — not far from Google’s 36.9%, and miles ahead of the 15.7% of MSN Search. By May 2012, Yahoo was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/yahoos-search-market-share-drops-for-the-ninth-straight-month-2012-6?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>down to just 13.4 percent and had shrunk for the previous nine consecutive months, and was being beaten even by the newly-released Bing</u></a>. That same year, Yahoo had the largest layoffs in its corporate history, shedding nearly 2,000 employees — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/04/yahoo-confirms-layoff-2000-employees?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>or 14% of its overall workforce</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The man who deposed Ben Gomes — someone who worked on Google Search from the very beginning — was so shit at his job that in 2009 Yahoo effectively threw in the towel on its own search technology, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/07/29/technology/microsoft_yahoo/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>instead choosing to license Bing’s engine</u></a> in a ten-year deal. If we take a long view of things, this likely precipitated the overall decline of the company, which went from being worth $125bn at the peak of the Dot Com bubble to being sold to Verizon for $4.8bn in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>With search no longer a priority — and making less money for the company — Yahoo decided to pivot into web 2.0 and original content, making some bets that paid off, but far, far too many that didn’t. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/13/tumblr-once-sold-billion-owner-wordpress-just-bought-site-fraction-that/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>It spent $1.1bn on Tumblr in 2013, only for Verizon to sell it for just $3m in 2019</u></a>. It bought Zimbra in 2007, ostensibly to compete with the new Google Apps productivity suite, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/yahoo-sells-zimbra-to-vmware/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>only to sell it (for a reported fraction of the original purchase price) to VMware a few years later</u></a>. Yahoo was a company without a mission, purpose, or objective. Nobody — and, I’ll speculate, even those leading the company — really knew what it was, or what it did.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/yahoos-new-search-master/1674?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In an interview with ZDNet’s Dan Farber from 2005</u></a>, Raghavan spoke of his intent to “align the commercial incentives of a billion content providers with social good intent” while at Yahoo, and his eagerness to “inspire the audience to give more data. Before that, it’s hard to find out exactly what Raghavan did — according to ZDNet, he spent “14 years doing search and data-mining research at IBM.”</p><p>In April 2011, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/apr/26/yahoo-ibm-google-prabhakar-raghavan?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the Guardian ran an interview with Raghavan</u></a> that called him “Yahoo’s secret weapon,” describing his plan to make “rigorous scientific research and practice… to inform Yahoo's business from email to advertising,” and how under then-CEO Carol Bartz, “the focus has shifted to the direct development of new products.” It speaks of Raghavan’s “scientific approach” and his “steady, process-based logic to innovation that is very different to the common perception that ideas and development are more about luck and spontaneity,” a sentence I am only sharing with you because I need you to see how stupid it is, and how specious the tech press’ accolades used to be. This entire article is ridiculous, so utterly vacuous that I’m actually astonished. What about Raghavan’s career made this feel right? How has nobody connected these dots before and said something? Am I insane?</p><p>To be clear, this was something written several years after Yahoo had licensed its search engine to Microsoft in a financial deal that Marisa Mayer, who replaced Bartz, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/microsoft-search-deal-hasnt-worked-out-as-mayer-hoped/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>was still angry about for years</u></a>. Raghavan’s reign as the “<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/yahoos-new-search-master/1674?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>search master</u></a>” was one so successful that it ended up being replaced by a search engine that not a single person in the world enjoys saying out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>This Guardian article ran exactly one year before dramatic layoffs at Yahoo that involved firing entire divisions-worth of people, and four months before Carol Bartz would be fired by telephone by then-Chairman Roy Bostock. Her replacement — Scott Thompson, who previously served as President of PayPal — would last only five months in the role before he too was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18053577?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>replaced by former Google executive Marissa Mayer</u></a>, in part because <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/yahoo-ceo-accused-of-padding-resume-probe-launched/2012/05/04/gIQAHEUI1T_story.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>it emerged he lied on his resume about having a Computer Science degree</u></a>.</p><p>Bartz joined Yahoo in 2009 in the aftermath of its previous CEO Jerry Yang refusing to sell the company to Microsoft for $45 billion. In her first year, she laid off hundreds of people and struck a deal to power Yahoo’s search using Microsoft’s Bing search engine tech, with <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/07/29/technology/microsoft_yahoo/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Microsoft paying Yahoo 88% of the revenue it gained from searches</u></a> — a deal that made Yahoo a couple hundred million dollars for handing over the keys to its most high-traffic platform.&nbsp;</p><p>As I have previously stated, when Prabhakar Ragahavan, Yahoo’s secret weapon, was doing his work, Yahoo Search was so valuable it was replaced with Bing. The company’s sole value, in many ways, was entirely driven by nostalgia and the association with the days before he worked there.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a-near-anonymous-villain">A Near-Anonymous Villain</h2><p>It’s very, very difficult to find much on Raghavan’s history — it took me hours of digging through Google results to find the three or four articles that went into any depth about him — but from what I’ve gleaned, his expertise lies primarily in “failing up,” ascending through the ranks of technology on the momentum from the explosions he caused. In a WIRED interview from 2021, Steven Levy said Raghavan “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prabhakar-raghavan-isnt-ceo-of-google-he-just-runs-the-place/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>isn’t CEO of Google— he just runs the place</u></a>,” and described his addition to the company as “a move from research to management.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Levy calls him a “world-class computer scientist who has authored definitive texts in the field,” he also describes Raghavan as “choosing a management track,” which definitely tracks with everything I’ve found about him. Raghavan proudly declares that “Google’s third-party ad tech plays a critical role in keeping journalism alive” at a time when he was aggressively incentivizing search engine optimized content, and a year after he’d deposed someone who actually gave a shit about search.</p><p>Under Raghavan, Google has become less reliable, less transparent, and is dominated by search engine optimized aggregators, advertising, and outright spam.&nbsp;</p><p>As I’ve argued previously, we — with good reason — continually complain about the state of Twitter under Elon Musk, but I’d argue Raghavan (and, by extension, Google CEO Sundar Pichai) deserve as much criticism, if not more, for the damage they’ve done to society.&nbsp;Because Google is the ultimate essential piece of online infrastructure, just like power lines and water mains are in the physical realm.</p><p>Raghavan and his cronies worked to oust Ben Gomes, a man who dedicated a good portion of his life to making the world’s information more accessible, in the process burning the Library of Alexandria to the ground so that Pichai could make more than 200 million dollars a year.</p><p>And Raghavan — a manager, hired by Sundar Pichai, a former McKinsey man and a manager by trade — is an example of everything wrong with the tech industry. Despite his history as a true computer scientist with actual academic credentials, Raghavan chose to bulldoze actual workers and replace them with toadies that would make Google more profitable and less useful to the world at large.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Prabhakar took the reins in 2020, Google Search has dramatically declined, with the numerous “core” search updates allegedly made to improve the quality of results having an adverse effect, increasing the prevalence of spammy, search engine optimized content.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s because the people running the tech industry are no longer those that built it. Larry Page and Sergey Brin left Google in December 2019 (the same year as the Code Yellow fiasco), and while they remain as controlling shareholders, they clearly don’t give a shit about what “Google” means anymore. Prabhakar Raghavan is a manager, and his career, from what I can tell, is mostly made up of “did some stuff at IBM, failed to make Yahoo anything of note, and fucked up Google so badly that every news outlet has run a story about how bad it is.”</p><p>This is the result of taking technology out of the hands of real builders and handing it to managers at a time when “management” is synonymous with “staying as far away from actual work as possible.” And when you’re a do-nothing looking to profit as much as possible, you only care about growth. You’re not a user, you’re a parasite, and it’s these parasites that have dominated and are draining the tech industry of its value.</p><p>Raghavan’s story is unique, insofar as the damage he’s managed to inflict (or, if we’re being exceptionally charitable, failed to avoid in the case of Yahoo) on two industry-defining companies, and the fact that he did it without being a CEO or founder.&nbsp;Perhaps more remarkable, he’s achieved this while maintaining a certain degree of anonymity. Everyone knows who Musk and Zuckerberg are, but Raghavan’s known only in his corner of the Internet. Or at least he was.</p><p>Now Raghavan has told those working on search that their "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/google-search-boss-raghavan-warns-employees-of-new-operating-reality.html?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">new operating reality</a>" is one with less resources and less time to deliver things. Rot Master Raghavan is here to squeeze as much as he can from the corpse of a product he beat to death with his bare hands.</p><p>Raghavan is a hall-of-fame rot economist, and one of the many managerial types that have caused immeasurable damage to the Internet in the name of growth and “shareholder value." And I believe these uber-managers - these ultra-pencil-pushers and growth-hounds - are the forces destroying tech's ability to innovate.</p><p>And in my next newsletter, I'm going to walk you through how a very specific kind of managerial mindset has poisoned Silicon Valley, making career failures unfathomably rich while your favorite tech products decay.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main components="[object Object]"><p>When I tell people around the world that I've been living in Japan for over a decade, many look both impressed and mystified at once. The place has a good reputation. Some folks are in awe at the temples and the gardens, others at the nature or the food. The extreme tidiness and civility of the local culture are the target of universal admiration. But many of those same people see the local language as an almost impenetrable barrier, a world of pain that one must go through in order to be allowed to live here. I must be so patient and smart, they think. But I (begrudgingly) have to tell them that it's not entirely true.</p>
<p>The thing is (I tell those people) the language is part of the wonders of the place. It was the biggest charm for me in the first place. It's complex, yes, but it's rich and quirky and different. In particular, a whole realm of consciousness exists in the sphere of Japanese speakers that's perhaps <em>truly unique</em> in the world, more so than the sushi and the nature and decorum. It even allows for new literary techniques that are unimaginable in any other language.</p>
<p>Usually this is the point when I lose my interlocutor. I might as well be speaking Japanese to them.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to explain that realm, to show what a strange and mind-bending world is accessed by learning Japanese. It feels almost impossible. In this rather long and winding post, I'll try anyway. I'll do my best to convey something that's damn near untranslatable. Whether this is a rabbit hole you want to tumble down with me, that's up to you.</p>
<h2>The Things I'm Not Talking About</h2>
<p>Unless you've studied the language for a good while, you might only be aware of one or more of the following strange-sounding facets of Japanese:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses <em>kanji</em> characters for writing (more on this later), and it uses a whole lot of them. Depending on who you ask, there are four, five or more <em>thousand</em> characters in use, and you can't read a newspaper if you don't know at least 2,000 of the more common ones.</li>
<li>There are also two syllabic scripts (syllable-based alphabets) in use, called <em>hiragana</em> and <em>katakana</em>. These two, plus <em>kanji</em>, are used all together, sometimes but not always interchangeably.</li>
<li>There are lots of "untranslatable" words in Japanese, like the salutation お疲れ様 (<em>otsukare-sama</em>), roughly meaning "I appreciate the hard work you've been doing", and もったいない (<em>mottainai</em>) for "it would be a pity not to enjoy that to its fullest value".</li>
<li>Exotic-sounding grammar features like the subject-object-verb sentence structure (i.e. "anteater ant eat") and the lack of important-sounding grammatical elements like articles ("the", "a"), any singular-plural distinction, and most verb tenses familiar to English/Romance language speakers.</li>
<li>It's very vague and context dependent.</li>
</ol>
<p>These aspects give the language an arcane and difficult-sounding aura, but none of them is truly unique to Japanese. Chinese, for instance, uses way more characters and has an even more bare-bones grammar. All languages have untranslatable terms. And several other cultures routinely employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphia" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multiple writing systems</a>. These aren't the things I mean by "a truly unique realm", and they're not the topic of this post.</p>
<p>What's usually not known are the subtle effects of the strange history of the Japanese tongue. These effects are, I believe, absolutely unique to this language, with no parallel anywhere else in the world. On top of that, native Japanese speakers are usually so accustomed to these quirks that they never give them a second thought. So no one—except, I guess, some linguists—ever talks or thinks about these fascinating aspects of Japanese. I write about them here because, well, that's <em>mottainai</em>.</p>
<p>It took me a while to put my finger on it, but now I know what the source of that uniqueness is: it's the unstoppable, wonderful <em>dissociation</em> between what's written and what is spoken in Japanese. To see how that could have happened, we need to take a step back.</p>

<h2>Dissociated from Birth: a History</h2>
<p>The Japanese language existed in purely oral form for centuries, until mainland scholars brought Chinese characters to the Japanese islands. That happened in the 5th century C.E. These characters are, unlike the western alphabets, "logograms", that is, each character is associated with a specific meaning.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/01_mountain_blood.webp" alt="" title="A three-stroke character corresponds to the meaning of 'mountain', a different character with six strokes corresponds to 'blood'."></figure>
<p>Chinese and Japanese are enormously different spoken languages. Except for a large number of words imported directly into Japanese (but evolved to sound quite unlike the originals), the two languages have essentially nothing in common. The pronunciation, the grammar, everything is 180° different. A consequence of this is that those Chinese characters, evolved over millennia to fit the Chinese language like a glove, were a bad match for the way the islanders spoke.</p>
<p>Imagine those poor scholars of the Yamato court in Western Japan in the 7th century. They must have been intrigued by this revolutionary technology called "writing", where you could freeze your words onto a stone or the blade of a sword so that others may understand it later. Why leave it to the Chinese immigrants? Why not master it for their own native language?</p>
<p>Except it must have been excruciatingly difficult. The characters were meant to be used as modular building blocks—a kind of modularity that Japanese just didn't have.</p>
<hr><figure id="floating-1"><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/haniwa.webp" alt="Not many depictions of scholars from the Kofun period survive (they must have been too busy wrangling the kanji), but warrior statues abound. So here is a warrior."><figcaption>Not many depictions of scholars from the Kofun period survive (they must have been too busy wrangling the kanji), but warrior statues abound. So here is a warrior.</figcaption></figure>
<p>While Chinese uses fixed "plug-and-play" markers to indicate tenses and and grammatical functions, on this front Japanese is more similar to English, because it modifies the very shape of words for those things. So in Chinese you say "chī" for "eat" and "chī<em>le</em>" for "ate". The "<em>le</em>" part indicates an action that has completed, and it can be strapped onto any verb to turn it into a past tense. So those two spoken words can be neatly segregated into written logograms: 吃 ("chī") for the present tense, and 吃了 ("chī" + "le") for the past.</p>
<p>Compare that to English where we transform "eat" into "ate", and the equivalent Japanese modification of "tabe<em>ru</em>" into "tabe<em>ta</em>". In both cases we're not adding or removing blocks but changing part of the word to convey the difference. In techie terms, the Chinese script doesn't support the structure of languages like English and Japanese. It doesn't have what it takes.</p>
<p>The only solution for those early Japanese scribes, then, was to do a lot of shoehorning. And boy, did they shoehorn.</p>
<p>The Japanese scholars-aristocrats began repurposing the Chinese characters, which they called <em>kanji</em> (for, well, "Chinese characters"). Sometimes, instead of using them for their meaning, they used them for (gasp!) their pronunciation. By ignoring the original content of a <em>kanji</em>, they could string them together to form almost any sound.</p>
<p>To a Chinese reader, such words would have looked utterly random, devoid of any coherence or structure. But to a trained Japanese, they translated into familiar words.</p>
<p>Over the centuries those "sound-only" <em>kanji</em>, called <em>man'yougana</em>, evolved into something else entirely. They became simpler, more streamlined, and more standardized. Where the symbols were originally composed of many short strokes, they gradually lost detail and complexity. Where the scribes could choose between a slew of different <em>kanji</em> for any given sound (for instance, the sound <em>pa</em> could be represented by any of 20 characters), later the number of options dwindled and eventually settled to two.</p>
<p>That's how the two syllable-based alphabets in use today, <em>hiragana</em> and <em>katakana</em>, came about (collectively <em>kana</em>). For example, this is how the sound for "i" (pronounced "ee") evolved from two separate <em>kanji</em> into respective <em>kana</em> pronounced exactly the same.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/02_kana.webp" alt="" title="Two Chinese characters that were pronounce 'i' were eventually simplified into phonetic characters for hiragana and katakana."></figure>
<p>With this new sound-based tool invented by the islanders, finally the Japanese language had a suitably flexible way to write anything one could pronounce. Today full-blown <em>kanji</em> are used for their meaning, while hiragana and katakana are used for sound-based writing and grammar stuff.</p>
<p>(By the way, the application of Chinese characters to other languages happened in several other places, like Korea and Vietnam, but only Japanese still retains the writing system today, making it a unique case among contemporary languages.)</p>
<p>And so, thanks to this grafting of one language's way of writing into a vastly different tongue, a dissociation was born. Japanese is a language where the spoken and the written co-evolved in directions never seen elsewhere. The differences in grammatical structure are only part of the story. Let's start with the basics.</p>
<h2>Anomaly 1: One Way to Write It, Many Ways to Read It</h2>
<p>Like most language pairs, there was rarely a one-to-one correspondence between Chinese and Japanese words. Often a single Chinese word or character could merely approximate the meaning of several spoken Japanese words. Each of those local words might have been related to the others, but it carried a different nuance. Even so, for lack of a better solution, often the same <em>kanji</em> was used for all the various meanings.</p>
<p>This had two major effects. First, while in any Chinese language each character is associated with a single way to speak it, in Japanese every <em>kanji</em> can be pronounced in multiple, very different ways. This part is perhaps the biggest bane of Japanese students.</p>
<p>Extreme cases have <strong>15+</strong> different pronunciations (readings) for a single <em>kanji</em>! For example, the <em>kanji</em> for "life":</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/03_life.webp" alt="" title="The same character, meaning generically 'life', is pronounced 'shēng' in Mandarin, while in Japanese it can be pronounced as 'sei', 'shou', 'ikasu', 'ikiru', 'ikeru', 'u', 'umare', 'umareru', 'umu', 'ou', 'ki', 'nasu', 'naru', 'nama', 'haeru', 'hayasu', 'musu', ..."></figure>
<p>Some of these pronunciations are common, others quite rare, but you need to know and be able to discriminate most of them in order to correctly read and write modern Japanese.</p>
<p>The second effect of the imperfect match between the written word and the meanings it is associated with is a kind of "chronic looseness" in the conversion of language to and from writing. A Japanese reader isn't expected to correctly pronounce everything. New, unfamiliar words will be opaque to them. In a sense, this is similar to English, only much worse.</p>
<p>In English, the question is usually about the right way to pronounce a vowel or two. As is clear from the example just above, in Japanese, sometimes you don't know if the <em>kanji</em> for life has to be read as "nasu" or "shou". Add to that the huge number of <em>kanji</em> in circulation, and in many cases you have absolutely <em>nothing</em> to work with. If you haven't seen the <em>kanji</em> before, you have zero hints about the right sounds to make.</p>
<p>Japanese has a trick up her sleeve to solve this problem, called <em>furigana</em>. These are tiny <em>kana</em> characters showing you how to pronounce a difficult <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/furigana.webp" alt="A sign in a train station.

<p>Kids keep on learning new fundamental <em>kanji</em> until the end of high school, so they wouldn't be able to read without extensive application of <em>furigana</em>. Adults are able to survive with less <em>furigana</em>, but you'll still find them on the rarer words that people might not have encountered before (or for which they might have forgotten the reading). For example, this is a page I opened at random from a Haruki Murakami non-fiction book.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/murakami-a.webp" alt="" title="A page in vertical Japanese script, from a Murakami book. Two tiny hiragana characters are highlighted between the lines of normal-sized text."></figure>
<p>In the whole page, only one <em>kanji</em> word (a somewhat rare way to say "mock") has the pronunciation spelled out with <em>furigana</em> (those two tiny squiggles between the lines).</p>
<p>Remember this part about <em>furigana</em>, because they'll come up again in the following sections.</p>
<p>Now for a practical consequence: people need to get creative just to teach others how to write their names.</p>
<h2>Anomaly 2: Spelling Bee, but Creative</h2>
<p>There is one problem that arises because of how <em>kanji</em> work: how do you explain which character you're talking about without writing it down?</p>
<p>This happens all the time with people's names. The Japanese like to choose nice and distinctive <em>kanji</em> for their names, even when using common name pronunciations (another instance of dissociation: common name readings on unheard-of <em>kanji</em> choices are all the rage this century). This means that, just by hearing what someone is called, you're usually unable to write it down.</p>
<p>So people have to explain the <em>kanji</em> to you, and they do it by telling you which other well-known words each <em>kanji</em> appears in, or how it is built from simpler components.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/deathnote.webp" alt="Perhaps the most famous scene showing the hoops you have to jump through just to explain your name's spelling. It's from the manga &quot;Death Note&quot;. Here the woman is giving a fake name, but soon afterwards Raito finds out her real name and uses it to kill her real quick."><figcaption>Perhaps the most famous scene showing the hoops you have to jump through just to explain your name's spelling. It's from the manga "Death Note". Here the woman is giving a fake name, but soon afterwards Raito finds out her real name and uses it to kill her real quick.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Anomaly 3: Breaking Out of the Box</h2>
<p>Reading is made more difficult by the frequent use of <em>jukujikun</em>, words where the pronunciation is not the combination of the normal readings of the individual <em>kanji</em> contained. In these cases there isn't any correspondence between parts of the spoken word and the <em>kanji</em> that represent it.</p>
<p>Japanese has a lot of compound words of Chinese origin, where two or more <em>kanji</em> appear as a set. These compounds are usually very straightforward sequences of <em>kanji</em> readings. So 美術 (<em>bijutsu</em>), meaning art, is the combination of 美 ("bi", beauty) and 術 (<em>jutsu</em>, skill). If you're confident about the individual sounds, you just have to say them one after the other. Finally something simple!</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/04_bijutu.webp" alt="" title="The word for art, 'bijutsu' is the simple composition of 'bi' for beauty and 'jutsu' for skill. Similarly, the word for science, which is pronounced 'kagaku', is the summ of 'ka' for subject and 'gaku' for study."></figure>
<p>But no, you can't let your guard down. The shoehorning work of the ancients has left deformations that survive in the modern language.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the word for "adult". It's pronounced <em>otona</em> and written 大人, the <em>kanji</em> for "big" and "person" respectively. Following the usual method, you might wonder, is <em>oto</em> a pronunciation of the first <em>kanji</em>, and <em>na</em> of the second? Or is it <em>o</em> and <em>tona</em>?</p>
<p>Well, neither. There is no way to split them. The two-<em>kanji</em> word exists as a single block, and looking up each <em>kanji</em> separately won't yield even a bit of this word's true reading. There are many examples like that.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/05_kyou.webp" alt="" title="Unlike most kanji compounds in Japanese and all words in Chinese, jukujikun like the word for today ('kyou') and tomorrow ('ashita') cannot be seen as the composition of sub-parts corresponding to the kanji."></figure>

Source: Alpsdake, Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0)."><figcaption>A bull-headed shrike. Source: Alpsdake, Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0).</figcaption></figure>
<p>In some cases, the number of <em>kanji</em> is longer than the number of syllables in the word! Try splitting <em>that</em> up.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/06_mozu.webp" alt="" title="The name for the bird called 'bull-headed shrike' is pronounced mozu, with two syllables, but it's written with three kanji."></figure>
<h2>Anomaly 4: Two Words in a Trench Coat</h2>
<p>But, despite all of its difficulties, this dissociation of writing and speaking opens up some interesting opportunities.</p>
<p>For example, there is a category of verbs that I find fascinating. As far as I know, it has no official academic name, and I've never heard anyone else even mention this. I would describe them as "two words in a trench coat". In each case, you can see how two simpler verbs were chained and wrapped with a single <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the verb 司る (<em>tsukasadoru</em>), meaning "to be in charge" seems pretty innocent at first. It's one <em>kanji</em> plus its <em>hiragana</em> ending indicating the tense, like all other verbs. But look up the etymology, and you'll find that it used to be two words: 官 (<em>tsukasa</em>) for "position of authority" and 取る (<em>toru</em>) for "take". Each of these two words has its own <em>kanji</em> and independent meaning. But over the years, their combined form became so routine that someone decided to give it its own different <em>kanji</em>, probably for no other reason than convenience. Here are a couple more cases:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/07_kokorozasu.webp" alt="" title="The verb 'kokorozasu', which means to aspire, is written with a single kanji but can be seen as the fusion of the separate words 'kokoro', for heart, and 'sasu', for to point, each with their different kanji. Similarly for the verb 'mitomeru' (to confirm), a combination of the verbs 'mite' (see) and 'tomeru' (retain)."></figure>
<p>These fusions are like language fossils. It shows that <em>kanji</em> are only an after-the-fact addition to a pre-existing vocabulary. But at a practical level, they're a way to exploit the looseness of Japanese writing to make writing more convenient (notice how short the final written words are compared to the original).</p>
<h2>Anomaly 5: Make the <em>kanji</em> Work for You</h2>
<p>In Anomaly 1 I said that one <em>kanji</em> can be ambiguous in terms of its <em>pronunciation</em>. But the flip side of the same phenomenon is that <em>kanji</em> can help reduce ambiguity in <em>meaning</em>, increasing the precision of the written word.</p>
<p>Spoken Japanese is actually rather poor in vocabulary. A lot of its verbs are reused in very different contexts with different meanings that are only related in a very abstract way. Thanks to the unique slap-it-on-and-you're-ready-to-go mindset of Japanese writing, however, the vagueness can be pared down a lot.</p>
<p>There is a surprising number of verbs that have exactly the same pronunciation, but are written with different <em>kanji</em> in different contexts. For example:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/08_yomu.webp" alt="" title="The verb pronounced 'yomu' can be written with two different kanji depending on whether it means to read or to compose a poem. The verb pronounced 'okuru' has different kanji for the meaning of sending and gifting. And the verb 'toru' has at least 7 different kanji forms, for the following meanings: to take, to take a picture, to harvest, to capture, to ingest a substance, to steal, and to record."></figure>
<p>The cool thing here is that these are all different meanings, but if you squint you can see how they must have originated from the same primordial word. They started with a generic, blunt verb (e.g. <em>toru</em>, to take), and later applied to it different <em>kanji</em> to distinguish its nuances. Handy!</p>
<p>There are also non-verbs examples of this trick. My favorite are all the versions of the word "cousins" meant in a reciprocal sense, as in "she and I are cousins (of each other)". In spoken language, you just say <em>itoko</em> in all cases, and that's it. In written language, you use the appropriate combinations of the <em>kanji</em> 兄 (<em>ani</em>, older brother), 弟 (<em>otouto</em>, younger brother), 姉 (<em>ane</em>, older sister), and 妹 (<em>imouto</em>, younger sister), preceded by the <em>kanji</em> 従 (<em>shitagau</em>, accompany), to specify the exact genders in the relationship. (These are also <em>jukujikun</em>, come to think of it.)</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/09_itoko.webp" alt="" title="The same noun 'itoko', meaning cousins, is written in four different combinations of kanji: one for cousins who are both male, one for cousins who are both female, one where the older cousin is male and the younger is female, and one that's the other way around."></figure>
<p>You can use <em>kanji</em>, then, to add a layer of meaning that doesn't exist in the spoken language. Which brings us to the last and, in my opinion, most interesting point.</p>
<h2>Anomaly 6: Dissociation as Canvas</h2>
<p>Finally we come to <em>gikun</em>, the most exquisite (ab)use of the rift between written and spoken Japanese. It's based on the clever use of <em>furigana</em>, the little pronunciation marks explained above. Ninety-nine percent of the time, people use <em>furigana</em> as you would expect—plainly indicating the correct dictionary reading of each word. But once you have a tool, who can resist playing with it?</p>
<p><em>Gikun</em> is the replacement of a <em>kanji</em>'s or word's normal pronunciation with something else through <em>furigana</em>. Novelists and <em>manga-ka</em> use it to inject an almost subliminal layer of meaning beyond what is afforded by the words and <em>kanji</em>. It achieves an effect similar to a textual voice over, <em>at the same time as the actual text you're reading</em>.</p>
<p>You see it a lot in manga: the actual <em>kanji</em> say something, but the <em>furigana</em>, instead of giving you the true pronunciation of the word, give you something else entirely. Sometimes it's a synonym of the word with a more pungent nuance. For example:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/hidari-atsu-todoroki-boku-no-hero-ch28.webp" alt="Source: Boku no Hero Academia, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)"><figcaption>Source: Boku no Hero Academia, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The author of the excellent <a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/12/gikun.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>gikun</em> explanaton on japanesewithanime.com</a> clarifies the context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Todoroki Shouto 轟焦凍 has both cold and heat abilities, which come from the sides of his body: from the right comes cold, from the left comes heat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Shouto, the protagonist, is telling the flame-y man "during combat, I won't use my <strong>heat</strong> power for any reason at all." Being a kids' comic, all <em>kanji</em> have <em>furigana</em>. But the <em>kanji</em> for "heat" (highlighted in red) comes with an unexpected reading. Instead of the official <em>netsu</em>, the <em>furigana</em> reads <em>hidari</em>, which means "left".</p>
<p>So the reader gets two messages at the same time: the character says "I won't use <strong>the left</strong>", but the text is saying "I won't use <strong>heat</strong>".</p>
<p>Sometimes, authors use <em>gikun</em> for the luxury of introducing cool foreign-sounding words while simultaneously providing the meaning for it through <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/gikun-automail-fullmetal-alchemist-ch04.webp" alt="Source: Full-Metal Alchemist, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)"><figcaption>Source: Full-Metal Alchemist, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And the context from <a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/12/gikun.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">japanesewithanime.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good guy with mechanical arm fights bad guy with mechanical arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blond guy says, "Oh, an <strong>automail</strong> colleague?" to say that they both have mechanical arms. But "automail" isn't a real word, and the Japanese reader may not guess the etymology of "automatic" + "mail (armor)". So the meaning is provided by the <em>kanji</em> (literally "mechanical armor"), and the word "automail" comes as <em>furigana</em> above that. Again, you get two things in one swoop: a neologism and its meaning.</p>
<p>Other times it's simply a clarification of the word in that specific context.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/koko-deictic-gikun-noragami-ch02.webp" alt="Source: Noragami, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)"><figcaption>Source: Noragami, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yato 夜ト, who is a God fighting spiritual beings related to human's negative feelings, goes to the hospital make [sic] a visit to someone...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The off-screen speaker is saying, "Tonight will be rough too. <strong>This place</strong> is their nest. Now that the regalia aren't with us, we shouldn't stay long." (I assume the "regalia" are some kind of warrior.) In this case the words "this place" appear as <em>furigana</em> for the word "hospital". The <em>kanji</em> say "<strong>hospital</strong>", the reading says "<strong>here/this place</strong>". Through <em>gikun</em>, the author is avoiding confusion on the current location of the characters.</p>
<p>Some novelists use this dissociation for artistic effect, too. Horror-mystery writer Natsuhiko Kyogoku, who loves to create the Japanese version of a Gothic atmosphere, constantly uses archaic, long-forgotten <em>kanji</em> in his brick-sized novels. You, as the average Japanese reader, probably have never seen most of those <em>kanji</em> before, but you're able to follow without problems thanks to his <em>gikun</em>. The <em>furigana</em> expose the modern, recognizable readings that you can recognize, even though they are not the real readings of those obsolete <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<p>Kyogoku's <em>gikun</em> shenanigans are a bit too much at times. Someone who uses them more sparingly and subtly is Haruki Murakami.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/murakami-b.webp" alt="" title="Another page in vertical Japanese script, from a Murakami book. Again, tiny furigana characters between the lines are highlighted."></figure>
<p>This is a page from his novel Norwegian Wood. Jay Rubin, the novel's English translator, worded the highlighted sentence like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the word "limbo" (pointed by the arrow) in the original is actually a <em>gikun</em>. The Japanese reader sees two things at once: the <em>kanji</em> with the meaning of "a remote region"—normally pronounced <em>hendo</em>—and the <em>katakana</em> pronunciation of the foreign word "limbo" as <em>furigana</em> next to it.</p>
<p>The Japanese language does have more accurate words for "limbo", words with a stronger link to the original catholic meaning of the word, but Murakami decided not to use them.</p>
<p>This little choice, seen by the reader in a fleeting instant as they devour the pages, and likely not even noticed consciously, is doing a lot of work. It's indulging in the mystical-sounding foreign word "limbo", but it's also clarifying the general meaning of liminal space for the readers unfamiliar with it. It's making the metaphor of an actual hidden place within oneself stronger, while avoiding overly religious undertones. In short, this <em>gikun</em> alters the flavor of the word a tiny bit, just enough to achieve the thematic and stylistic goals of the sentence. Like a pinch of nutmeg in your butter cake.</p>
<p>How is one to translate that?</p>
<p>It's difficult to convey what it feels like to read in this way. For me, back when I started reading in Japanese some 16 years ago, it was a totally new experience, something that I never thought would be possible with text. It's like reading in stereo, where sometimes the same message is conveyed to you in two different formats on separate channels, and sometimes two messages blend together as something new.</p>
<p>Because of the unique dissociation between the written word and the way it is pronounced, Japanese is not only harder to learn, but it's also more malleable and richer in a way that cannot be imitated. It's an extra dimension of language and a happy historical accident. ●</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in the 1990s, Mrowka and Kronheimer investigated what happens when you excise a two-dimensional surface from a four-dimensional manifold. If the manifold itself is simply connected, what conditions must surfaces meet to guarantee that their complements must also be simply connected?</p>
<p>Kronheimer and Mrowka knew that some kinds of surfaces could have complements that weren’t simply connected. But their work seemed to indicate that another broad class of surfaces must always have simply connected complements.</p>
<p>For nearly three decades, nobody could find an example of a surface in that class whose complement was not simply connected. But in the fall of 2023, after coming across the problem, Ruberman thought he could. Instead of starting with a four-dimensional manifold and cutting out a surface, he began with a two-dimensional surface that had the necessary properties and built a manifold around it.</p>

<p>First, he fattened the surface into a four-dimensional blob. This four-dimensional blob had a three-dimensional boundary, just as a three-dimensional object like a ball has a two-dimensional boundary. Ruberman wanted to attach a carefully chosen four-dimensional manifold to the other side of the boundary, which would serve as the surface’s complement. If the gambit worked, then this manifold would have a complicated fundamental group, yet the fundamental group of everything taken together would be trivial. The newly constructed four-dimensional manifold would therefore be simply connected.</p>
<p>But to be able to glue everything together in the right way, he had to show that the fundamental group of the new addition satisfied all sorts of properties. “I had no idea how to do that,” Ruberman said.</p>
<p>Then in January, Hughes — a group theorist —&nbsp;gave a talk at Brandeis. Ruberman was in the audience. He recognized that Hughes might have the missing piece he was looking for. The two met up the following day, and within a few hours, they’d worked out the main ideas they needed. What Ruberman was missing “is something group theorists have been computing for 70, 80 years at this point,” Hughes said. “We’ve been at this forever.” By the end of the week, they had a completed proof.</p>
<p>“I knew some things, and he knew some things, and between the two of us, we knew enough to just do it,” Ruberman said.</p>
<p>Because of the way group theory gets used in the proof, “it’s a little bit unusual,” said <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mhm799/">Maggie Miller</a> of the University of Texas, Austin. “It’s written a little bit different than most four-dimensional topologists would be comfortable with.”</p>

<p>The result is yet another example of how complicated four-dimensional topology can get. “There are more interesting embeddings of surfaces than we thought,” Hughes said. This makes it more difficult to classify manifolds, and harder to prove other kinds of results about them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in March, <a href="https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/directory/faculty/r-inanc-baykur">İnanç Baykur</a> of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who organized last year’s list-making conference with Ruberman, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14586">announced the solution</a> to another problem involving simply connected four-dimensional manifolds from the 1997 list.</p>
<p>It seems the topologists are cleaning house.</p>

But for abstract mathematics the “street cred” follows three rules: you get more cred based on,</p><p>• the wimpier the building blocks look</p><p>• the larger and more complex the structures you can build with them</p><p>• the more memorable or intuitive the blocks are (so like marketing... SK-calculus is the same as lambda calculus but lambda can say “I am the abstract mathematics of template substitution!” while SK-calculus can't, directly.)</p><p>All a way to say that the field is full of “fun little toys” and the key about criterion (2) is that we have figured out how to build structures of arbitrary complexity in Life, because we have discovered it is Turing-complete. It therefore is also NP-hard and a lot of other good stuff. Really revitalized work into cellular automata by giving some good marketing, which led to Stephen Wolfram's success etc etc.

Carter Bays did some investigations and published papers back in the 1980's:<pre><code>  https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Three-dimensional_cellular_automaton
</code></pre>
There's been a little bit of revived interest lately, when newer versions of Golly ( <a href="https://golly.sourceforge.io/" rel="nofollow">https://golly.sourceforge.io/</a> ) started to include at least some support for 3D rules. Other programs have been showing up recently, though some of them are more ways of visualizing the history of a 2-dimensional rule in three dimensions.<p>There are a couple of big difficulties that seem to prevent 3D rules from getting a lot of attention.  It's just plain a lot more computationally intensive to emulate 3D rules.  Also it's a lot harder to see what's going on in the middle of an active 3D pattern -- a lot of the detail tends to get hidden.

                  <p><span>Heh, I think I can find answers for "surprising" a lot more easily than for "useful". The main practical use for Conway's Life is as a teaching tool, giving a  nice explorable example of layers upon layers of incredible complexity that can arise from very simple rules. So I suppose that people who can benefit from that kind of insight might find Conway's Life "useful", in a way -- engineers, mathematicians, and just anyone who is curious about the universe we live in and the physical laws that seem to underly its behavior.<p>The big surprise that I've been spending the most time on lately is the utterly strange result that if you can build something by colliding gliders together -- no matter now many gliders and no matter how big the final pattern is -- then you can also build it by starting with exactly fifteen gliders in an otherwise empty Life universe:</p><pre><code>  https://biggieblog.com/building-arbitrary-life-patterns-in-15-gliders/
</code></pre>
It's a mind-bending result -- partly just a mathematical trick, since you end up encoding a whole lot of information in the space between the gliders -- but it's just really amazing that all the details have actually been figured out to make the trick work, and that it's possible to simulate the whole process on a personal computer.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p>In 1937, Quine proposed a set theory called “New Foundations”, and since 2010, Randall Holmes has claimed to have a proof of its consistency.
In this repository, we use the interactive theorem prover Lean to verify the difficult part of his proof, thus proving that New Foundations is indeed consistent.
The proof is now complete, and the theorem statements can be found in <code>ConNF/Model/Result.lean</code> (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/con-nf/blob/main/ConNF/Model/Result.lean">source</a>, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/Model/Result.html">docs</a>).</p>

<p>See <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/">our website</a> for more information, the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/">documentation of our Lean code</a>, and the <a href="https://zeramorphic.github.io/con-nf-paper/main.l.pdf">deformalisation paper</a> that translates the Lean definitions into English.</p>

<p>To run our code locally, install <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/elan">elan</a>, clone the repository, and run the following command in a terminal in the repository’s root directory.</p>

<p>The code can then be viewed in an editor such as Visual Studio Code, or compiled directly from the command-line using <code>lake build</code>.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>It is known that New Foundations is consistent if and only if a theory called Tangled Type Theory (TTT) is consistent (see theorem 1 <a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Papers/tangled.pdf">here</a>).
We have formally constructed a model of TTT in Lean, thus proving (on paper) that New Foundations is consistent, or in short, Con(NF).
We are working from various versions of the paper proof by Holmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/untangled.pdf">untangled.pdf</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/retangled.pdf">retangled.pdf</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/newnfdoc.pdf">newnfdoc.pdf</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/maybedetangled.pdf">maybedetangled.pdf</a>,</li>
</ul>

<p>but many alterations and additions have been made to make the proof compatible with Lean’s type theory.</p>

<p>This project depends on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4">mathlib</a>, the community mathematical library written in Lean.
This allows us to use familiar results about things like cardinals and groups without having to prove them ourselves.</p>

<p>Every definition and theorem in mathlib and this project have been checked by Lean’s trusted kernel, which computationally verifies that the proofs we have constructed are indeed correct.
However, Lean cannot check that the statements of the definitions and theorems match their intended English equivalents, so when drawing conclusions from the code in this project, translation to and from English must be done with care.</p>

<h2 id="tangled-type-theory">Tangled type theory</h2>

<p>TTT is a many-sorted set theory with equality “=” and the membership relation “∈”.
The sorts are indexed by a limit ordinal λ, and elements of λ are called type indices.
A formula “x = y” is well-formed if x and y have the same type, and a formula “x ∈ y” is well-formed if x has any type less than y.</p>

<p>One of the axioms of tangled type theory is extensionality, which stipulates that a set of type α is uniquely determined by its elements of <em>any</em> type β &lt; α.
This is strange: for example, if two sets of type α differ, they have different type β elements for <em>every</em> β &lt; α.
This property makes it difficult to construct models of TTT.</p>

<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>Our construction of the model uses the following rough strategy.</p>

<h3 id="construction-of-the-base-type">Construction of the base type</h3>

<p>Let λ be a limit ordinal, κ &gt; λ be a regular ordinal, and μ &gt; κ be a strong limit cardinal with cofinality at least κ.
Sets of size less than κ are called <em>small</em>.</p>

<p>We first construct an auxiliary type at level -1, called the <em>base type</em>, below all types that will eventually become part of the model.
Elements of this type are called atoms (although they are not atoms in the ZFU or NFU sense, for instance).
There are μ atoms, partitioned into <em>litters</em> of size κ.</p>

<h3 id="constructing-each-type">Constructing each type</h3>

<p>At each type level α, we will produce a collection of model elements for our intended model of TTT, which we will sometimes call <em>t-sets</em>.
We also produce a group of permutations, called <em>allowable permutations</em>, which act on the t-sets.
The membership relation is preserved under the action of allowable permutations.
Each t-set is stipulated to have a <em>support</em> under the action of allowable permutations; this is a small set of objects called <em>addresses</em>, such that whenever an allowable permutation fixes all elements of a support, it also fixes the t-set.</p>

<p>Each t-set at level α will be given a preferred extension of some type β &lt; α, and we can recover from a t-set’s elements which extension it prefers.
The extensions of such a t-set in other lower types can be deduced from its β-extension.
This allows us to satisfy TTT’s extensionality axiom.</p>

<h3 id="controlling-the-size-of-each-type">Controlling the size of each type</h3>

<p>Each type α can only be constructed under the assumption that all types β &lt; α are of size exactly μ (among other hypotheses).
It is easy to prove that the collection of t-sets at level α has cardinality at least μ, so we need to show that there are at most μ elements of this set.
We do this by showing that there are not that many fundamentally different descriptions of tangles under the action of allowable permutations.
This requires the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/FOA/Result.html#ConNF.StructApprox.freedom_of_action">freedom of action theorem</a>, which is a technical lemma that allows us to construct allowable permutations.
The main result of this section is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/Counting/Conclusions.html#ConNF.mk_tSet">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-the-induction">Finishing the induction</h3>

<p>We can then run the above process recursively to produce the types of tangles at all type levels α.
This is an easy step to perform in set theory, but requires a lot of work in type theory because of the interconnectedness of the various inductive hypotheses we need.
We then check that our construction indeed produces a model of TTT by checking that it satisfies a finite axiomatisation of the theory.
We have chosen to convert Hailperin’s finite axiomatisation of NF’s comprehension scheme into a finite axiomatisation of TTT, which we present in our <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/Model/Result.html">results file</a>.
Note, however, that this choice is arbitrary, and any other finite axiomatisation can be easily proven with the infrastructure already in place.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We show that Claude 3 Opus, a large language model (LLM) released by Anthropic in March 2024, exhibits stronger machine translation competence than other LLMs. Though we find evidence of data contamination with Claude on FLORES-200, we curate new benchmarks that corroborate the effectiveness of Claude for low-resource machine translation into English. We find that Claude has remarkable \textit{resource efficiency} -- the degree to which the quality of the translation model depends on a language pair's resource level. Finally, we show that advancements in LLM translation can be compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using Claude to generate synthetic data, we demonstrate that knowledge distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation, meeting or surpassing strong baselines like NLLB-54B and Google Translate.

            <div>
                <menu><menuitem></menu>                
                <p>If you’ve been making websites for years, you know how frustrating it was to lay out a web page with CSS floats. Managing sizes and placement was tedious and time consuming. Being creative was often impossible. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout">CSS Grid</a> greatly eased that pain with Grid Level 1 in <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">2017</a>, and <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">now</a> with Grid Level 2, aka <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid">Subgrid</a>. But even with the powerful CSS of today, not every layout imaged by designers is possible. In fact, when CSS Grid shipped, one of the most commonly asked questions was: “how do I write CSS to accomplish a masonry layout?” Sadly, for the last seven years the answer has been — you can’t.</p>
<h2><a name="what-is-masonry-layout"></a>What is masonry layout?</h2>
<p>What do we mean by the term “masonry layout”? Basically it’s the pattern seen in the following image — where content packs together like a brick or stone wall. That’s where it gets the name “masonry”. It’s also frequently called “<a href="https://github.com/topics/waterfall-layout">waterfall layout</a>”, as a metaphor for how content flows down the page like a waterfall.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image1-masonry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image1-masonry-light.png" alt="Two dozen photos of different aspect ratios laid out using a &quot;masonry&quot; pattern"></picture></figure>
<p>This layout is popular because it solves a few problems that other layouts do not.</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows for content of different aspect ratios, and avoids the need to crop or truncate content in order to turn everything into uniform rectangles.</li>
<li>It distributes content across the page (instead of flowing down each column, one by one). This follows the natural reading order as you scroll the page. And it lets the website lazy-load additional content at the bottom without moving existing content around.</li>
</ol>
<p>This layout creates uniformly-sized columns, without any rows. It’s quite possible that because this layout has required JavaScript, anything more creative or complex has been too hard to pull off — and we’ve been left with an expectation that masonry layout should only ever be a simple pattern with uniformly-sized columns. Let’s see what’s possible if we build it into CSS instead.</p>
<h2><a name="inventing-masonry"></a>Inventing masonry</h2>
<p>A mechanism in CSS for “masonry layout” was first proposed by Mozilla in January 2020 as an extension of CSS Grid, and <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">implemented</a> as an experiment behind a flag in Firefox Nightly. In 2022, Apple started implementing this <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/">CSS Grid Level 3</a> proposal in Safari Technology Preview (where it’s currently on by default), and we’ve been helping to move the web standard along to reach maturity.</p>
<p>However, there are big questions still being asked about how CSS should handle masonry-style layouts. Some people remain skeptical that this capability should be part of CSS Grid, and want it to instead be its own separate <code>display</code> type. Others are questioning whether or not this kind of layout is needed on the web at all — they aren’t sure that well-known websites will use it. With such fundamental disagreements at play, no browser can ship. We must first come to consensus in the CSS Working Group.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help. We’d like real-world web designers and developers to weigh into the discussion, and express what it is that you want. Your input really can make a difference.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll walk through how the CSS Grid Level 3 proposal works, and how you can use its new capabilities. We’ll show you why we believe these features should be part of CSS Grid, and explain what the alternative would be if the CSS Working Group creates <code>display: masonry</code> instead. And then, we’ll ask you to join the debate to help move us forward. Please do read to the end.</p>
<h2><a name="four-demos"></a>Four demos</h2>
<p>To show why we at Apple believe this capability should be part of CSS Grid, we created four demonstrations. If you’d like, try them yourself at <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/">webkit.org/demos/grid3</a>.

<h2><a name="creating-a-classic-masonry-waterfall-layout"></a>Creating a classic masonry / waterfall layout</h2>
<p>First, let’s take a look at how to build a classic masonry/waterfall layout. In this gallery of photos, each image is wrapped with a <code>figure</code> element, and the figures are direct children of a <code>main</code> element.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-1.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-2.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-3.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We start by applying <code>display: grid</code> to the main element to create the Grid container. Then we can define <code>grid-template-columns</code> however we’d like.</p>
<p>In this case, let’s use <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(14rem, 1fr))</code> to ask the browser to repeat a looped definition to create a set of flexible columns that are each of a minimum of 14rem. This results in uniformly-sized columns, typical of the classic masonry/waterfall layout. The <code>gap: 1rem;</code> rule creates a 1rem-wide space between the items — both between the columns, and horizontally between items.</p>
<p>And then, we’ll define the “rows” with the <code>masonry</code> value. (It’s likely the name of this value will change before this ships in browsers — more on that at the end of this article. For now, <code>masonry</code> is what works.)</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>14</span><span>rem</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>1</span><span>rem</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>grid-template-rows: masonry</code> rule tells the browser: “Please do <em>not</em> create rows. Instead pack the content into a masonry/waterfall-like pattern.”</p>
<p>That’s it! In four lines of CSS, with zero media queries or container queries, we’ve created a flexible layout that works on screens of all sizes. And there’s no need to crop content to force everything into same-sized boxes.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-masonrywider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-masonrywider-light.png" alt="masonry layout of photos"></picture></figure>
<p>In graphic design, a layout that has uniformly-sized columns and no rows is often called a “symmetrical columnar grid”. For centuries, columnar grids were the dominant type of grid used in page design.</p>
<h2><a name="leveraging-grid%e2%80%99s-full-power-to-define-columns"></a>Leveraging Grid’s full power to define columns</h2>
<p>Now let’s dive into the advantages of combining the full power of CSS Grid with masonry/waterfall packing. CSS Grid provides many options for defining grid our columns. Using <code>fr</code> units to create a symmetrical grid is only one option of many.</p>
<p>How could these possibilities be used for a masonry/waterfall-style layout? Let’s try mixing fixed-sized columns with flexible columns. We could make the first and last column fixed-sized, while the middle columns are flexible, changing in both size and number.</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1920" height="1018"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video1-firstlastsmaller-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video1-firstlastsmaller-light.m4v" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>Specifically, the first and last columns are exactly 14 characters wide, while the middle columns are flexible (at least 28 characters wide) and change in number to fill the available space.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>14</span><span>ch</span> <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>28</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>)) <span>14</span><span>ch</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>gap</span>: <span>1</span><span>rem</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is just one of many, many possibilities.</p>
<p>CSS Grid allows for a lot of creativity with its options for defining grid tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed sizes defined in any unit (px, em, rem, cqi, lh, ch, ic, cap, vw, svh, and many <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units#numeric_data_types">more</a>)</li>
<li><code>max-content</code> and <code>min-content</code></li>
<li>the full power of <code>fr</code> units</li>
<li><code>minmax()</code> functions</li>
<li><code>%</code>-sized </li>
<li>auto </li>
</ul>
<p>These options in CSS Grid allow you to create something much more dynamic and flexible in interesting ways. You can create two stages of flexibility, because the <code>fr</code>-unit sized columns grow and shrink in a separate stage from the <code>minmax()</code>-sized columns. The <code>max-content</code> and  <code>min-content</code> values let you size the columns based on the content size, rather than sizing the content based on the column size. The <code>fr</code> units can easily be used to create compound or asymmetrical grids, where the columns are different sizes. The options are endless.</p>
<p>By adding the ability to pack content in a masonry/waterfall pattern to CSS Grid, we maintain the full power of Grid for defining our columns in whichever manner we like.</p>
<p>For example, let’s use <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(8rem, 1fr) minmax(16rem, 2fr)) minmax(8rem, 1fr)</code> to create a pattern of alternating narrow and wider columns, where all the columns are flexible. More columns are added when there’s space. And there’s always an odd number of columns, ending with a narrow one.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image5-alternatingmontage-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image5-alternatingmontage-light.png" alt="three web browser windows next to each other, showing how the layout adjusts for narrow, medium and wider windows"></picture></figure>
<p>Even when we define columns using only the simple <code>fr</code> unit, the full power provided in CSS Grid means different columns can be set to different sizes. For fun, let’s use <code>fr</code> units to define a set of columns sized to inject the vibes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a> by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci sequence</a> in <code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 2fr 3fr 5fr 8fr;</code></p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image6-fibonacci-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image6-fibonacci-light.png" alt="layout of photos where the columns on the left are very narrow, getting bigger and bigger as them move to the right, in a fibonacci sequence"></picture></figure>
<p>In a more practical example, let’s use <code>max-content</code> when defining our columns. Content-based sizing is an incredibly power feature of CSS Grid. This demo of a mega menu layout uses <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(max-content, 30ch));</code> to ensure that every column is big enough to fit every link without wrapping text.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image7-megamenu-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image7-megamenu-light.png" alt="a menu with a ton of links, like in a website footer, laid out with Grid Level 3"></picture></figure>
<p>Mega menus have been hard to code, especially across multiple screen sizes. With CSS Grid Level 3, it becomes incredibly easy. A few lines of code creates a dynamic layout which adds and removes columns one at a time as space allows — without any media/container queries, and with wrapping prevention.</p>
<p>Many of these examples could never be created with masonry as a separate display type. The discussion of <code>display: masonry</code> is to only allow symmetrical columns (columns that are the same size as each other), much like multicolumn layout does today.</p>
<h2><a name="leveraging-grid%e2%80%99s-ability-to-let-content-span-columns"></a>Leveraging Grid’s ability to let content span columns</h2>
<p>CSS Grid also lets us span items across multiple columns. Let’s use that capability to see what interesting options might emerge. How about making every 5th image span two grid columns, while the rest of the images are span one column.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image8-5thwider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image8-5thwider-light.png" alt="same photo layout, now with random photos being bigger"></picture></figure>
<p>What if instead, we put a <code>wider</code> class on specifically on images that have a wider aspect-ratio, to make those images span multiple columns. We can also change the styling a bit, making the corners square instead of round, and reducing the grid gap to zero. This gives us a different way to pack photos of different aspect ratios together.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image9-wideriswider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image9-wideriswider-light.png" alt="another layout of image, this time where wider images are wider"></picture></figure>
<p>We also experimented with combining the classic masonry/waterfall layout of photos with View Transitions. When a user  clicks/taps on any photo, it grows to span multiple columns. The browser automagically animates the transition. (This demo requires Safari Technology Preview 192 or later.)</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1488" height="1080"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video2-viewtransitions-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video2-viewtransitions-light.m4v" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>These variations of the Photos and Mega Menu demos are just a small taste of all of the many possibilities you get when leveraging the full power of CSS Grid in the column direction, while simultaneously turning off rows.</p>
<h2><a name="columnar-vs-modular-grids"></a>Columnar vs. Modular Grids</h2>
<p>What happens when we keep experimenting? Let’s let go of thinking about “masonry”, and start imagining Grid Level 3 purely as an expansion of Grid. At its core, CSS Grid Level 3 provides a mechanism for turning off rows. It lets us create a <strong>columnar grid</strong> — a grid that’s made up of columns alone.</p>
<p>By contrast, a <strong>modular grid</strong> is a grid where everything is lined up in both columns and rows. They became popular in the 20th century during the dominance of modernism in graphic design. CSS Grid Level 1 is really good at making modular grids… that’s what it wants to do. In fact, float-based layouts also encouraged the creation of modular grids on the web, since you had to make all your content the same height to get your floats to clear. Images need to be the same aspect ratio. Text has to be the same length. This is often accomplished on the back-end with policies enforced by the content management system, or on the front-end by CSS that truncates/crops the content.</p>
<p>It’s incredible common for websites to do some variation of this sort of modular grid, laid out here with CSS Grid Level 1.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image10-textgrid1-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image10-textgrid1-light.png" alt="layout of text, in ridged sets of boxes, row after row, all the same height"></picture></figure>
<p>Of course, this example is overly simplistic. The article ledes look bare with no teaser images. The uniformity is so strict and formal, the design lacks life. Real websites find other ways to breathe life back into the design.</p>
<p>But what if the layout itself could also provide some vitality and interest? What will happen if we use CSS Grid to create a columnar grid as easily as it creates a modular grid? What if we don’t truncate content, and instead let it be the size that it wants to be — and get the layout to work for the content, rather than forcing the content to work for the layout?</p>
<p>A classic masonry/waterfall layout with various lengths of text looks like this, which is already more engaging since a user can read more about each article:</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image11-textmasonry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image11-textmasonry-light.png" alt="same article teaser text, this time laid out in columns set with masonry"></picture></figure>
<p>Although, that’s still a bit visually repetitive. Symmetrical columnar grids often are. We need the rest of the power of CSS Grid to do something more interesting. Let’s make the latest article much bigger, and have it span four columns. A handful of other recent articles can be medium-sized and span two columns. While the older content is smaller, spanning one column.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image12-textgrid3-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image12-textgrid3-light.png" alt="same text, this time laid out with much more dynamic use of 'masonry-style layout plus spanning columns"></picture></figure>
<p>Now this otherwise visually boring text is starting to look fairly lively. If we were to add images to each of these articles, it would be it even more dynamic.</p>
<p>Let’s experiment with mixing images and text together on a webpage for a museum. The first grid item is a header that introduces the museum, and provides navigation to other resources. The rest of the content consists of pieces of artwork and their information: title, artist, year, medium, catalog number and location.</p>
<p>Because the paintings are gorgeous, the content looks pretty great in a classic masonry/waterfall layout.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image13-museummasonry.png" alt="layout of cards, each with a painting and text"></figure>
<p>Let’s see what else we can do by utilizing two more powerful features of CSS Grid — subgrid and explicit placement.</p>
<h2><a name="using-subgrid-and-explicit-placement"></a>Using subgrid and explicit placement</h2>
<p>The functionality provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid">subgrid</a> in CSS Grid Level 2 is incredible, and it’s <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">finally supported</a> in most browsers.</p>
<p>Instead of listing the painting’s metadata in a single left-aligned column, let’s see how we might better use the available space. By using <code>subgrid</code>, we can put the year and catalog number on the right of each card — and line up this data for one painting with the same data for the other paintings.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image14-museumsubgridintooling.png" alt="close-up of this layout, with the Grid Inspector showing, with lines marking columns showing how subgrid works"></figure>
<p>By adding this new functionality to CSS Grid Level 3, we get the benefit of existing developer tools. You can use the Grid Inspector in Safari Technology Preview today as you try out <code>grid-template-rows: masonry</code>.</p>
<p>If masonry is its own display type, and not part of CSS Grid, it will not get the benefit of subgrid.</p>
<p>We can also use the power of CSS Grid Level 1 to explicitly place the header into the last two columns, moving it to the top right corner of the page with <code>grid-column: -3 / -1</code>.</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1670" height="1080"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video3-museum-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video3-museum-light.m4v"></video></figure>
<p>In just a few lines of layout code, we are using the full power of CSS Grid Levels 1, 2, and 3 to create flexible columns that change in number to accommodate the available size — without using any media queries or container queries.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can see the advantages of fully combining a mechanism for masonry/waterfall layouts with CSS Grid — providing many more creative possibilities than masonry alone.</p>
<h2><a name="the-debate"></a>The Debate</h2>
<p>So let’s get into the debate that’s been blocking the CSS Working Group from moving forward. Our hope is that web designers and developers chime in (post to social media, write blog posts) with your thoughts about which direction CSS should take.</p>
<p>Some people, including those of us at Apple, like having “Masonry” be part of CSS Grid. We believe this functionality is a mechanism to expand CSS Grid — allowing it to finally create columnar grids as well as modular grids. And we want this functionality to be mixed with all the other features of Grid, including the powerful options for defining a columns, track spanning, explicit placement, and subgrid.</p>
<p>Other people instead believe Masonry should be its own separate display type. At first glance, defining Masonry with a new display type might make a lot of sense. You do get a tidy separation between layout types.</p>
<pre><code><span>display</span>: <span>block</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>inline</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>flexbox</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The CSS Working Group has not discussed how the syntax for a separate Masonry display type would work, but perhaps it would be patterned after <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout">Multicolumn layout</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>columns</span>: <span>28</span><span>ch</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or perhaps the syntax would be patterned after Grid, <em>but with significant limitations</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>masonry-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>5</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>28</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>)); 
                   <span>/* where only one repeating width is allowed */</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Either way, it’s clear that advocates of this option want Masonry to be limited to a symmetrical grid — where all the columns are the same size as each other. None of the rest of CSS Grid’s track sizing capabilities would be allowed.</p>
<p>Making masonry a simple and separate layout type would avoid the work necessary to keep Grid and Masonry working together in combination — both now and in the long term. Doing this would simplify the layout model, make it easier to implement in browsers, reduce the potential for performance traps, and allow the feature sets of Grid and Masonry to diverge.</p>
<p>Conversely, we believe the effort needed to add this capability to CSS Grid is worth the many benefits to be had. The <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/">CSS Grid Level 3 specification</a> has already been written, and implemented in <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">two browser engines</a>. And yes, while making CSS Grid more complex will make it harder to extend in the future, we believe there’s an advantage to having these two types of grid layouts intertwined. This way the CSS Working Group will always define all new additions for both modular and columnar grids. There won’t be something added to <code>display: grid</code> that will be left out of <code>display: masonry</code>, or vice versa. For example, many developers want CSS Grid Level 4 to provide a mechanism for styling grid areas and grid lines — perhaps a way to add a background color to a track, or create a rule line in a gap. It’d be great to ensure that will work for both modular and columnar grids from Day 1.</p>
<p>Another argument made by advocates of <code>display: masonry</code> is that that masonry is conceptually a fundamentally different layout type from CSS Grid, and therefore should have its own display type. They often describe CSS Grid as inherently being about “lining things up in two-dimensions”, and since masonry only lines things up in one dimension, “it’s not a grid”. (In fact, some have advocated that Masonry is more like Flexbox, since “both line things up in one direction”.)</p>
<p>In many ways, your perspective on this question might depends on what you imagine a grid is.</p>
<h2><a name="what-is-a-grid"></a>What is a grid?</h2>
<p>Grids are an incredibly important aspect of graphic design. Grids are used to line up text, images and other content in a regular pattern. They help readability and usability by making things predictable.</p>
<p>You can trace their use through thousands of years of history.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the 20th century that European and American modernists started promoting the idea that “proper” graphic design grids should line content up in both directions — in rows as well as columns.</p>

<p>Even today, there is a lot of debate about which type of grid is the best grid or the only legitimate grid. Many designers claim a 12 column grid is the only correct way to design a web page — or 12 columns for “desktop”, 8 columns for “tablet”, and 4 columns for “phones”. At times designers have gotten quite religious about their ideas of what a “proper grid” looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/five-simple-steps-to-designing-grid-systems-part-1/">Mark Boulton</a> argued for years that symmetrical columnar grids are incredibly formulaic and boring. He promoted the use of asymmetrical compound grids in design for the web. Today, luckily CSS Grid Level 1 makes it incredibly easy to create both asymmetrical grids and compound grids, giving designers the freedom to create what they want. But only if they also want all their grids to be a modular grids.</p>
<p>Both modular and columnar grids are in fact grids. And CSS Grid deserves the ability to also create columnar grids.</p>

<p>We believe there’s an opportunity for CSS to enable a rich history of design grids to come to the web — and would be greatly disappointed to see the new masonry feature limited to only allowing symmetrical columnar grids.</p>

<p>The WebKit team has been working on Masonry for a year and a half. It was first enabled by default in <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13839/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-163/">Safari Technology Preview 163</a> in February 2023. There’s a bit more polish needed, and details to work out (naming being one). But we would like to ship this feature soon. To do so, these fundamental questions need to be resolved.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
<h2><a name="p-s-about-the-name%e2%80%a6"></a>P.S. About the name…</h2>
<p>It’s likely <code>masonry</code> is not the best name for this new value. Names in CSS are usually simple words that directly describe the result they create — like <code>center</code>, <code>under</code>, <code>contain</code>, <code>clip</code>, <code>revert</code>, <code>ltr</code>, <code>always</code>, <code>break-word</code>, <code>hidden</code>, <code>allow-end</code>, <code>scale-down</code>, <code>wrap</code>, <code>smooth</code>.</p>
<p>The word “masonry” is more of a metaphor, where the meaning has to be explained with a backstory. Such a term is harder to remember for developers who do not speak English. And arguably, the syntax could just as easily be <code>grid-template-rows: waterfall</code> instead, since that’s the dominant word for this layout used in certain regions, not masonry.</p>
<p>Plus, once you start to write a lot of code using this feature, it’s likely you’ll come to the realization that we did — this really isn’t about the layout used by Pinterest or other similar sites. This is a mechanism for telling the browser, “please create a grid, but <em>without any rows.</em>”</p>
<p>Perhaps the best syntax could be <code>grid-template-rows: none;</code> to convey “please do not give me any rows”. Sadly, it’s too late to use this name, because <code>none</code> is the default value for <code>grid-template-*</code> and means “please give me only implicit rows, no explicit ones”.</p>
<p>Instead we could use the name <code>off</code> to convey “please turn off the grid in the row direction, and give me only columns”.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>14</span><span>rem</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>off</span>; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The CSSWG is debating this name in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9733">this issue</a>. If you have ideas or preferences for a name, please join that discussion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <code>masonry</code> is the value that is currently implemented in Safari Technology Preview, since that’s what the Editor’s Draft currently uses. And so that’s what we used in our demos above, and what you should use in yours. But do expect the name of this value to change in the future. And perhaps prepare for a future where we call this “columnar grid” or “Grid Level 3” instead of “Masonry”.</p>
