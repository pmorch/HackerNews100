        <span>}</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre><p>It seemed the Google-wide block user functionality was based on an obfuscated Gaia ID as well as a display name for that blocked user. The obfuscated Gaia ID is just a Google account identifier.<br>‎</p>
<p>That seemed perfectly fine until I remembered <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6388749#zippy=%2Cuse-youtube-to-block-an-account">this support page</a>:<br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/use_youtube_to_block.png"></p>
<p>‎</p>
<p>So, if you block someone on YouTube, you can leak their Google account identifier? I tested it out. I went to a random livestream, blocked a user and sure enough, it showed up in <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/blocklist">https://myaccount.google.com/blocklist</a><br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/blocked_user.png"></p>
<p>The fallback name was set as their channel name <strong>Mega Prime</strong> and the profile ID was their obfuscated Gaia ID <strong>107183641464576740691</strong><br>‎</p>
<p>This was super strange to me because YouTube should never leak the underlying Google account of a YouTube channel. In the past, there's been several bugs to <a href="https://sector035.nl/articles/2022-35">resolve these to an email address</a>, so I was confident there was still a Gaia ID to Email in some old obscure Google product.</p>

              Escalating this to 4 billion YouTube channels

              The missing puzzle piece: Pixel Recorder
            </h3><p>I told my friend <a href="https://schizo.org/">nathan</a> about the YouTube Gaia ID leak and we started looking into old forgotten Google products since they probably contained some bug or logic flaw to resolve a Gaia ID to an email. <a href="https://recorder.google.com/">Pixel Recorder</a> was one of them.

              A small problem: preventing notification to the target
            </h3><p>It seems that whenever we share a recording with a victim, they receive an email that looks like this:<br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/recorder_victim.png"><br>‎</p>
<p>This is <strong>really bad</strong>, and it would lower the impact of the bug quite a lot. On the share pop-up, there didn't seem to be any option to disable notifications.</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/share_recording.png"></p>
<p>I tried leaking the full request proto via my tool <a href="https://github.com/ddd/googleapi_tools/tree/main/req2proto">req2proto</a>, but there was nothing about disabling the email notification:</p>

}</code></pre><p>Even trying to add and remove the user at the same time didn't work, the email was still sent. But that's when we realized - if it's including our recording title in the email subject, perhaps it wouldn't be able to send an email if our recording title was too long.<br>‎</p>
<p>We hacked together a quick python script to test this out:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66431436/pushing-to-github-after-a-shallow-clone-is-horribly-slow">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66431436/pushing-to-github-after-a-shallow-clone-is-horribly-slow</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023283">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>TL;DR: use <code>--depth 2</code>.  Read on for why.</p>
<p>Shallow clones (<em>can</em>, but not necessarily <em>must</em>) defeat an important optimization.  In your case this happens for the first push, but not for subsequent pushes.  Other defeating cases can occur so other pushes might also be slow.</p>
<p>We start with the fact that Git is really all about commits,<sup>1</sup> which are shaped into a Directed Acyclic Graph.  The graph has vertices or nodes—whichever term you prefer—that are numbered, by commit hash IDs.  Relatively immaterial here, but helpful for concreteness, is the fact that the edges / arcs between the nodes are stored as part of the nodes themselves, rather than being kept separately.  Each node stores the hash IDs of its predecessor nodes.</p>
<p>A repository is, at heart, a database of these commit objects.  A complete—non-shallow—repository has the entire graph, from every root to every tip commit.  A <em>single-branch</em> clone potentially drops some part of the graph, but never has any "gaps" in the graph.  For instance, given:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>we can drop either tip and the nodes on that row, but not the nodes and root on the middle row.  In all of these cases, then, we can—as Git always does—start at the tip and work backwards and eventually arrive at the root.</p>
<p>Now, there are two properties of each node that are important here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>number</em> is <em>unique</em>.  It's a universally unique ID.  <em>No</em> node in <em>any</em> other Git repository (that we'll meet anyway) can re-use that ID.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>data</em> in the node are strictly read-only.  That includes the outgoing edge links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What this means is that if we have a <em>gap-free</em> repository—one that's either totally complete, or at least as complete as required for the tip commits it contains—on each side of a sender-to-receiver operation, we can have the <em>sending</em> repository simply enumerate for us some set of commits, by their numbers.  If we, the receiving repository, lack that commit, we ask the sender to send it and also to tell us the numbers of its parent commit(s).  The sender does that, and we see if we have those commits.  For any that we lack, we ask the sender to send those and also tell us the numbers of their parent commits, and so on.</p>
<p>This means that if <em>we</em> have:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>and <em>they</em> have:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1--new
          /
root--node
</code></pre>
<p>then <em>they</em> will announce to use the hash ID of commit <code>new</code>.  We don't have that one, so they should add it to a pile of commits to send, and announce to us the hash ID of commit <code>tip1</code> as well.  We <em>do</em> have <code>tip1</code> so we just tell them: <em>We already have <code>tip1</code>: you do not need to send it.</em></p>
<p>Here's the optimization: <em>We just told them about <strong>every commit we have</strong> from <code>tip1</code> all the way back to <code>root</code>.</em>  Our <em>no thanks, we have that one</em> offer to their reply to <em>I can send you <code>tip1</code></em> tells them about not just the one commit and its files, but also every predecessor commit and all of <em>their</em> files as well.</p>
<p><strong>They now know that when they send us commit <code>new</code>, they need only send tree and blob ("file") objects that do not appear in predecessor commits.</strong>  Moreover, they can compress these tree and blob objects against tree and blob objects in any <em>previous</em> commit, from <code>tip1</code> all the way back to <code>root</code>.  So the sender can send <em>far</em> less data than would otherwise be required to send the entire commit, with its full snapshot of every file.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tree objects and blob objects are primarily found <em>via</em> commits.  Annotated tag objects add one small wrinkle to the picture, and having an annotated tag that points directly to a tree or blob adds another, but neither defeats the standard optimization.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Compare to when the sender is a shallow repository</h3>
<p>A <em>shallow repository</em> is one in which some commit(s) are marked-up artificially as being root commits.  The commit object actually has the right parent hash IDs, but the Git in which this commit object lives has a file<sup>2</sup> that says: <em>We don't know anything about the parents of commit <code>tip1</code>.  Don't try to look for any: pretend, instead, that <code>tip1</code> is a root commit, with no parents.</em></p>
<p>This means the sending Git, instead of having:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
</code></pre>
<p>has just:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1
</code></pre>
<p>In this repository, we add our new commit:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1--new
</code></pre>
<p>and now we have our Git call up their Git and offer it new commits.  First we offer <code>new</code>.  They say <em>I don't have that one, what else can you send?</em>  We would offer <code>slightly-mangled-tip1</code>, but <strong>we can't do that</strong> because when we read it in, we mangle it.  So we say: <em>Sorry, that's all we have for you.</em></p>
<p>They say: <em>Okay then, send us commit <code>new</code>.</em></p>
<p>On our end, then, we look at commit <code>new</code>.  It has a full snapshot of <em>every file</em>.  We don't know if they have <em>any</em> of these files.  So we pack up the entire thing and send <em>all</em> of it.</p>
<p>They receive it all, unpack it, find that we've duplicated 99% of what they already have, ignore the extra copies, and take the new commit and put it in their repository:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1--new
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>The next time we run <code>git push</code>, we have this:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1--new--new2
</code></pre>
<p>We offer them <code>new2</code>; they say <em>I don't have that one, what's its parent</em> and we say <code>new</code> and they say <em>oh I have that one, don't bother sending it</em>.  This time, we see that they have almost every file already, and don't bother sending all those tree and blob objects <em>and</em> can compress any <em>new</em> tree and blob objects based on what's in commit <code>new</code>.  (We still can't use the slightly-manged tip1 commit, nor of course any of the missing previous commits, but just being able to eliminate all unchanged files is huge.)</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>2</sup>Or other mechanism, but currently, it is a file named <code>.git/shallow</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What you can do about this</h3>
<p>Given that you intend to run <code>git push</code>, you'll get a lot of mileage out of having one un-mangled commit "between" the shallow graft point and a branch tip.  So do your <code>git clone</code> with <code>--depth 2</code>.  You'll get a slightly bigger client Git repository, but that first <code>git push</code> will go much faster.</p>
<p>That is, you'll start with:</p>
<pre><code>slightly-mangled-node--tip1
</code></pre>
<p>on the client.  The first <em>new</em> commit will result in:</p>
<pre><code>slightly-mangled-node--tip1--new
</code></pre>
<p>and this time your Git will be able to offer <code>tip1</code> to their Git during the first push, which will trigger the optimization.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



	<p>Unfortunately, there are going to be some more changes around here. Our founder explains why.</p>

<h2>The coming end of Webb-site<br>
<span>12 February 2025</span></h2>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/editor200608.asp">disclosed</a> my metastatic prostate cancer in Jun-2020, I didn't 
expect to live as long as I now have - the
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-prognosis" target="_blank">
5-year survival</a> (which I am now approaching) is about 30%. However, after exhausting 4 lines of therapy and 
resorting to experimental treatments that are only available overseas, I have now reached the point where outcomes are 
measured in months rather than years and my symptoms and side-effects are making it harder to function. I hope to reach 
60 in August and all I want for my birthday is another one, but before I become more dysfunctional, I need to make plans 
for the orderly conclusion of this pro bono, loss-making work rather than leave managing it as a burden for my family. 
One of the few benefits of knowing that you're dying is being able to plan the end on your own terms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub">Webb-site Database</a> has grown over the years to include an enormous amount of material. 
Much of it is collected by automated methods - I kept up my coding skills from the 1980s when I wrote books and games 
for the first generation of home computers. But even in the dawning era of artificial intelligence, there are some 
datasets which (so far) can only be accurately maintained by human judgment, for example, carefully parsing corporate 
announcements to determine which individual has been appointed to a board, as many individuals share the same name and 
no ID numbers are disclosed. Similarly, we track the membership of over 800 HK <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/cat.asp?c=3">statutory</a> 
and <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/cat.asp?c=7">advisory</a> bodies - everything from the Executive and Legislative Councils down to 
the Dogs and Cats Classification Board.</p>
<p>So a loyal assistant whom I have employed for 22 years has been maintaining anything that I can't automate. All-in, 
I've spent over HK$10m since 2003 building and operating the database, not counting the considerable opportunity cost of 
my own time. I know that the database has been useful to journalists, regulators, researchers and of course investors, 
as they have often told me so.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since my cancer diagnosis, which came just after HK quarantined its borders for COVID. Since then, 
I deciphered the pseudo-disclosure on who received over HK$90bn of hand-outs under the so-called
<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/esstop.asp">Employment Support Scheme</a>, draining a substantial portion of HK's fiscal reserves. I 
also tracked <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/vax.asp">vaccination rates</a>, <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/hkpax.asp">immigration data</a> and
<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/HKflightscan.asp">airport flight statistics</a>, which we contine to collect. I've also been 
collecting data on <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/jail.asp">HK prisoners</a>, a record 39% of whom (at 30-Sep-2024) are unconvicted 
and on remand - presumed innocent under law. And I've built a complete history of the <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/govac.asp">HKSAR 
Government Accounts</a> from Apr-1998 to Mar-2024, with thousands of line items. Of course, I've also made more time for 
family, and managed to visit numerous places after the borders reopened. The bucket list is still long, but time is 
short. </p>
<p>In 2020, I did explore moving the Webb-site Database to the University of Hong Kong (our oldest university), where a 
fully-staffed "Webb Centre for Public Transparency" could build a much larger database around it, including datasets 
from PhD researchers on social, economic, health and legal matters in the Asia region. The Centre would have been 
apolitical, expressing no opinion other than to advocate accessibility of public data, and would have included 
representation from other HK universities to encourage collaboration. I and other donors would have made substantial 
contributions to the endowment needed to launch it. The relevant faculty heads were all in favour, but in a 
post-National Security Law environment, the detailed proposal was rejected by the university's "Senior Management Team". 
You can draw your own conclusions about why that might be.</p>
<p>In 2024, I <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/paybase.asp">launched</a> a pilot project to crowd-source data collection on HK 
directors' pay from annual reports stretching back to 2005. After an initial flurry of interest, a handful of diligent 
volunteers continue with this work, but it is clear to me that this is not a viable way to expand the data collection 
effort to other datasets that we manually maintain. Even if it were, someone would have to maintain the server and 
software and arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>So that leaves me out of options and nearly out of time. Accordingly, I plan the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>All manual data collection by my assistant on <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/#hkboards">directors</a> and supervisors of HK-listed 
	companies and their <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/roles.asp">advisers</a> (bankers, lawyers, auditors, financial advisors etc) 
	will cease, effective 31-Mar-2025.</li>
	<li>The directors' pay database project will continue for financial year-ends up to 31-Dec-2024 (the Listing Rules 
	deadline for publishing the annual reports is 30-Apr-2025). I ask the volunteers to focus on completing and 
	verifying the dataset from 2005 to 2024. I will then make the full dataset available for download.</li>
	<li>Automated data collection (for example, the <a href="https://webb-site.com/ccass/bigchanges.asp">CCASS Analysis System</a>,
	<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/SFClicount.asp">SFC licensees</a>, <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/hksolfirms.asp">HK law firms</a>) will 
	continue until the first annual expiry date (31-Oct) for the Webb-site server (in New York State) after my death, 
	but individual datasets may cease earlier if the collection software breaks and I am either dead or too ill to 
	update it.</li>
	<li>When the server shuts down, Webb-site (including all the <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/">editorial content</a> since 
	foundation in 1998) will disappear, but most of our articles can be found in the
	<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/Webb-site.com" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>, which will 
	hopefully keep running for much longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Webb-site and I have, in my judgment, achieved a lot of what I set out to do when I founded it in 1998, but much remains 
unresolved and new economic problems have arisen in HK since then, particularly arising from excessive central planning, 
intervention and government spending in what was once a very free market economy, but also ongoing protection of vested 
interests which inhibits reforms that would benefit the economy and the people of HK. Much of this is in the <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/">
subject archive</a>, but I'll try to leave behind some thoughts on this with a few more articles before I check out, 
health permitting.</p>
<p><em>Carpe diem, and Ga Yau!</em></p>

<p>Tesla’s sales have dropped nearly 60% in January in Germany compared to the same period last year. The same thing is happening throughout Europe.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, we reported that <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/03/tesla-tsla-sales-are-dropping-like-a-rock-in-europe-but-its-not-just-because-of-elon-musk/">Tesla’s sales crashed throughout all European markets in January</a>.</p>



<p>The two main reasons are believed to be the introduction of the new Model Y and the disapproval of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his meddling in politics, which is especially not appreciated in Europe.</p>



<p>At the time, we didn’t have the number from Germany, but now we do.</p>	
	



<p>Reuters reported that Tesla’s sales were down 59.5% in January:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>German road traffic agency KBA’s website on Wednesday showed the number of newly registered Tesla cars fell 59.5% to 1,277 in January, while the overall German market was down just 2.8% at slightly more than 207,000 vehicles during the month.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is undoubtedly a Tesla problem because the German auto market was down just 2.8% in January, and the battery-electric market was up 53.5% during the period.</p>



<p>These are now Tesla’s sales in Europe in 2025 compared to 2024:</p>

<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This is pretty nuts. Obviously, Tesla will use the Model Y transition as an excuse, and there’s some truth to it. However, Tesla was transitioning the Model 3 around the same time last year, which also negatively affected 2024 sales.</p>




	<p>Now, it’s true that Model Y is more impactful than Model 3, but I think it’s also clear that the Musk effect is at play too, it’s just impossible to tell by how much.</p>



<p>But I do think it will be quite disastrous, especially considering the Model Y refresh is not significant enough to convince people who are on the fence.</p>



<p>It feels like the negative sentiment toward Tesla is still gaining momentum rather than slowing down.</p>



<p>That’s not good for the EV industry. At least they have more options in Europe. It will hit even harder if we start seeing a similar impact on Tesla in the US.</p>

                                        <p>BEIJING (AP) — Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father’s panicked voice: The brakes don’t work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.</p><p>Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-tesla-investigations-doge-crashes-f0c49a8fdf900d72eac541e4f699c5ac">Tesla</a></span> sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car’s brakes — and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.</p><p>Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described “ <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1499976967105433600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free speech absolutist</a></span>.” Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. </p><p>The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang’s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.</p>
    

<p>It is not common practice for automakers — in China or elsewhere — to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China’s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The AP review of Tesla’s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump’s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-tesla-investigations-doge-crashes-f0c49a8fdf900d72eac541e4f699c5ac">concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla</a></span> and his other companies. </p><p>In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.</p><p>Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Tesla’s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts — which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party — are, by design, somewhat intertwined.</p><p>Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker. </p><p>Tesla’s windfall has extended to the courts — and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.</p><p>“The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,” said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. “That’s why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.”</p><p>One of those desperate customers was Zhang.</p><h2>Burning with anger</h2><p>The February 2021 crash in central China’s Henan province sent Zhang’s mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang — who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece — wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?</p><div data-align-center="">

Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.</p><p>“Tesla’s employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,” Zhang said in an interview. “I was burning with anger.”</p>
    

<p>After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming “Tesla brake failure” in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 200 km (124 miles) from her home. She sat on the Tesla’s roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: “Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,” she said. “A family of four almost died.” The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail — Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

<p>Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend — who had also had a problem with her Tesla — donned matching T-shirts with the phrase “Brakes fail” and headed for Tesla’s booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker’s officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn’t get anyone to hear them out.</p><p>Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, “Tesla brakes fail!”</p><p>Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.</p><p>“Things escalated,” said Zhang.</p><p>The moment — captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers — went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out, and she was detained for five days.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>Some observers speculated that Zhang’s protest had been orchestrated -- perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn’t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she “had someone behind her” and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.</p><p>Zhang insisted she acted on her own — and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive’s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company’s own shortcomings. </p><p>And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.</p>
    

<h2>The odds are against you</h2><p>Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.</p><p>The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.</p><p>Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang’s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.</p><p>Zhang’s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.</p><p>Tesla had finally given Zhang what she’d been asking for, but they’d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn’t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she’d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.</p><p>Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.</p><p>Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang’s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world’s most valuable car company.</p><p>Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.</p><p>“I refuse to accept it,” Zhang told the Associated Press, “As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.”</p><p>Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it’s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.</p><p>An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.</p><p>In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People’s Court said that judgments are the result of a “fair trial” based on “the objective facts of the case.” </p><p>“It cannot be assumed that the party has received ‘special protection’ or ‘special treatment’ because of their victory,” the court wrote.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>While some auto industry experts in China say it’s generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it’s remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.</p><p>“For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,” said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. “The odds are stacked against you. It’s like going to the casino and winning every hand.”</p>
    

<h2>The power of patronage</h2><p>Tesla’s commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China’s premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China’s financial capital.</p><div data-align-center="">

China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.</p><p>In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-67705113fb4f895bd051a1bee1d23518">annual profit for the first time in its history</a></span> that year, and Musk was declared the world’s richest person in January 2021.</p><p>China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla’s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China’s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world’s largest EV-battery maker. China’s BYD is now the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.</p><p>“Tesla had a large part to play in that,” said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk’s factory was critical. “It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they’re rolling cars off the line,” he said. “I don’t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China’s government ministries, went unanswered.</p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-tesla-elon-musk-c3777d00c183bc88408407e30bb75b1f">Musk still swings by to meet Li</a></span> when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk’s overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Trump’s inner circle.</p><p>Musk’s “greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,” said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. “He’s done a good job of it in China and he’s done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.”</p><h2>A chilling effect</h2><p>Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk’s proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.</p><p>In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.</p><p>Tesla has not publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that “maybe it is time” to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla’s brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.</p><p>Tesla has already successfully done that in China.</p><p>Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.</p><p>“We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,” a tech reporter told AP.</p>
    

<p>Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk’s company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest’s report that claimed Tesla’s Shanghai factory was a “sweatshop.” The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla’s ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.</p><p>Tesla is not the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.</p><p>Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors — in going after car owners who suffered crashes.</p><p>“Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,” said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla’s alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. “Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.”</p><p>Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 30 centimeters (12 inches) of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.</p><p>Tesla maintained the accident was Chen’s fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.</p><p>“Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,” Chen said in a court statement reviewed by AP. “I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.”</p><hr><div data-align-center="">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/blog/2023-05-29-i-wrote-a-static-web-page">https://localfirstweb.dev/blog/2023-05-29-i-wrote-a-static-web-page</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021677">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The flap of a butterfly’s wings on one continent, so the story goes, can cause a tornado a year later in another. Here’s my story of how something like that can happen on the web too.</p><h2 id="im-on-a-boat">I’m on a boat</h2><p>First, the back story. Last year, after a wonderful ten years at Facebook (and then Meta), I left my position as Engineering Director, and, with my wife Jayne, moved onboard our sailing boat, <a href="https://scoutsailing.com/">Scout</a>. We quickly got accustomed to a life of going wherever or whenever the weather wanted to take us.</p><p>But there’s a lot of downtime on a boat. Me? I’ve been using this opportunity to grow and maintain an open source project called <a href="https://tinybase.org/">TinyBase</a>, a way to store structured data in a browser and react to its changes.</p><p>As I got TinyBase going last year, there were two tweets that really got my attention. The first was from Cory House who drew attention to “<a href="https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1492203985335373825">a new collaborative software architecture</a>” (and as follow up gave the project a well-needed and generous <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1492859757941637126">shout out</a>!). The second was from Geoffrey Litt, who, with colleagues, published <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1499083601387864069">an excellent essay</a> about running relational, reactive databases on the client.</p><p>Both referred to the phrase “Local-First”, and I wanted to know more. Over a decade ago, I’d been swept up in the “<a href="https://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp">Mobile-First</a>” movement, and this second “First” sounded just as intriguing - especially given my new maritime circumstances.</p><h2 id="but-what-is-this-local-first-you-speak-of">But what is this Local-First you speak of?</h2><p>You see, connectivity is generally good on a boat - wifi, cell coverage, and satellite options abound - so we survive. But when it isn’t good, it <em>really</em> isn’t good. And then suddenly, it dawns on you just how much of your life is beholden to the cloud. Your documents don’t load. Your photos don’t sync. Your messages don’t send. Without necessarily consciously realizing it, we have all moved most of our online existence to <a href="https://www.chriswatterston.com/article/success-of-my-there-is-no-cloud-sticker">other people’s computers</a>!</p><p>Now, of course, there are many advantages to this shift: collaboration, backups, multi-device access, and so on. But it’s a trade! In exchange, we’ve lost the ability to work offline, user experience and performance, and indeed true dominion over our own data.</p><p>I was fascinated by this shift, but also surprised by how much we all - both users and developers - have taken this for granted. It’s almost heretical to build a web-based application that <em>doesn’t</em> have the cloud as the source of truth for data, and the client as merely a dumb display of a cached copy of it. I wondered why.</p><p>As I disappeared down this rabbit-hole, I quickly stumbled on the canonical essay on the topic, “<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">Local-first software: you own your data, in spite of the cloud</a>”, by research lab Ink &amp; Switch. In summary, they identify seven principles for local-first applications:</p><ul><li>No spinners: your work at your fingertips</li><li>Your work is not trapped on one device\</li><li>The network is optional</li><li>Seamless collaboration with your colleagues</li><li>Your work should continue to be accessible indefinitely</li><li>Security and privacy by default</li><li>You retain ultimate ownership and control</li></ul><p>Now we’re talking!</p><p>But I was equally surprised by how little this was being discussed, or (as far as I could tell) practiced in the real world. While there seemed to be endless threads on Twitter about server-side React (to get the UI generation closer to the data), no-one was talking about the opposite: moving the <em>data</em> to be closer to the UI, and onto the client!</p><p>Nevertheless, I realized that TinyBase could theoretically fit nicely into this picture: a way to have a structured store of data on the client side (with a close-by binding to the user interface), and took the slightly cheeky opportunity to update the project’s strap line: “The reactive data store for local-first apps”.</p><p>Still, I wasn’t exactly sure that people knew what “local-first” meant. What could I do about that?</p><h2 id="a-butterfly-flaps-the-creation-of-localfirstwebdev">A butterfly flaps: the creation of localfirstweb.dev</h2><p>In a previous life, I had worked with some excellent developer relations teams, and if there’s one thing I remembered from then, it was that one of the ingredients of raising awareness around a topic is to have a good landing page. And it didn’t seem like such a thing existed for local-first.</p><p>The Ink &amp; Switch article was a great start, but as I explored, I came across many projects from people trying to build the scaffolding for a local-first future - databases, synchronization techniques, best practices. But they were scattered around and I could see a lot of value in curating a list of the activity that was happening in this space.</p><p>So, one free day on the boat, I rolled up my sleeves, dusted down some old Jekyll skills, and got started. I didn’t really have much more of a plan than to take my ‘local first’ browser bookmark folder and put all the items onto the page: basically a web directory just like it was 1994!</p><p>A few hours later, I had the skeleton of <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/">localfirstweb.dev</a> up and running - my first .dev domain too! - and published with GitHub Pages. Add in a quick <a href="https://twitter.com/jamespearce/status/1623773053447729152">launch tweet</a>, some mentions to some of the projects on the page, and it was done. I didn’t really expect to hear much more.</p><p>Time passed. But not very much!</p><p>Well of course, the likes started coming. And then the retweets. And then the pull requests. Within <em>literally</em> an hour, I could see the site getting traction. And, rather humbly, it was extremely surprising. After all, it was just a list of links! But apparently the concept struck a chord, and perhaps a lot of latent interest in the idea suddenly had a focus.</p><h2 id="enter-yonatan">Enter Yonatan</h2><p>Evidently that interest was quickly going to outgrow my static web page. And as if to make sure I got that point, I got a message from Yonatan (<a href="https://twitter.com/founderYonz">@founderYonz</a>), a Harvard Business School graduate who started using TinyBase after discovering my <a href="https://tripleodeon.com/2022/11/closing-the-gap-between-your-users-and-their-data">local-first talk</a> @JavaScriptCon. The two of us had been chatting about creating a local-first world. He spotted that it needed to become more of a human community with people buying into the movement - especially if the goal was to raise awareness of the local-first architecture across the industry as a whole.</p><p>And within a day, he leapt to action, and set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/lfwdev">Discord server</a> with the new logo, added a link to it from the top of the site, and was busy welcoming and introducing all the new members as they joined. He had people building apps, people building frameworks, people who just wanted to hang out and chat about CRDTs and the like. The start of a community!</p><p>Yonatan’s energy was infectious, and within just days, the ideas started flowing. What about swag? What about a newsletter? What about a conference? We agreed that the first step would be giving people a chance to get together, at least online, and the first meetup was scheduled for February 28th.</p><p>The first meetup, held in February, exceeded everyone’s expectations. Honored to be joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/pvh">Peter van Hardenberg</a> from Ink &amp; Switch - ‘the father of local-first’ - and other speakers, the community heard kick-off keynotes, deep dives into sync technologies, and a lengthy and rich Q&amp;A session.</p><p>Since that first meetup, there have been three further blockbuster meetups, five paper reading group sessions and ~700 members building, discussing and sharing their passion for local-first. (In a follow on post, Yonatan will dig into the work behind the LoFi community!)</p><p>But here’s my chance to say something very important. It doesn’t take on that life of its own <em>on its own</em>. While my personal involvement has stayed lightweight, the lion’s share of the community curation and leadership has been squarely on Yonatan’s shoulders. While on one hand I am surprised at how quickly things have grown, on the other, I shouldn’t be, knowing that it’s in his safe and motivated hands. In case I don’t say it enough, I want to recognize how awesome he has been in driving #lfw.dev forward.</p><h2 id="onwards-and-upwards">Onwards and upwards</h2><p>Local-first as a movement still seems to be young. The principles are solid, the enthusiasm is strong, and examples of it in use are appearing.</p><p>But there is a long way to go! There are still not as many local-first apps in production as you might think, perhaps because they are still a little harder to build - and the infrastructure to make that task easier is still being built out.</p><p>But the demand is clearly there, both for applications that meet these ideals, and certainly for this community of builders who want to make this happen. These are people who are willing to question some of the assumptions of the current status quo of web development, and who want to help shape a future of something a little different.</p><p>And as for me? I’m proud of the fact that I built a web page that catalyzed hundreds of people to come together to work on a shared vision. But it was just a web page! And really the credit for where this community is today rests squarely with other giants upon whose shoulders I merely wrote some HTML - and to Yonatan in particular who has shown ceaseless energy and commitment in getting things going.</p><p>Again, I’m reminded of Lorenz’s assertion about butterflies and tornados when I think back on this series of extraordinary events from the last few months. A web page flapped its wings, and, as others took the initiative and ran with it, the resulting community tornado was a wonder to watch. Here’s to a local-first future!</p><p>–</p><p>Want to know more and get involved? What better time to get involved than our next meetup? We’ll see you there!</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/cVYugNvT?event=1102927548079423518" target="_blank"><img src="https://localfirstweb.dev/assets/images/meetup4.png"> </a></p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021515">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is a powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" rel="nofollow">version control system</a>
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you're new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the <em>storage systems</em> used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" rel="nofollow">Mercurial</a> or
<a href="https://www.breezy-vcs.org/" rel="nofollow">Breezy</a>, or hybrid systems like Google's cloud-based design, <a href="https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645" rel="nofollow">Piper/CitC</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it <strong>compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!</strong>
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.</p>
<p dir="auto">We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Git</strong>: We make an effort to <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49/hovercard">be fast</a>—with a snappy UX, efficient
algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for "physical
storage", for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Mercurial &amp; Sapling</strong>: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
the <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/" rel="nofollow">revset</a> language to select commits. There is <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index" rel="nofollow">no explicit index</a>
or staging area. Branches are "anonymous" like Mercurial, so you don't need
to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
that can be configured by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Darcs</strong>: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/" rel="nofollow">first-class
objects</a> in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Working-copy-as-a-commit</strong>: Changes to files are <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/" rel="nofollow">recorded automatically</a>
as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This "snapshot"
design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
Git's stashes or the index/staging-area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Operation log &amp; undo</strong>: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
"what just happened?" or "how did I end up here?" easier, <em>especially</em> when
you're helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
with ease. Version control has finally entered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History" rel="nofollow">the 1960s</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Automatic rebase and conflict resolution</strong>: When you modify a commit, every
descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
makes "patch-based" workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
the <em>resolution</em> of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of <code>git rebase --update-refs</code> combined with <code>git rerere</code>, supported by design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Warning</p><p dir="auto">The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!</p>
</div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Safe, concurrent replication</strong>: Have you ever wanted to store your version
controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!</p>
<p dir="auto">The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
like <code>rsync</code> on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
on <em>local filesystem operations</em> being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
with respect to other reads and writes—which is <em>not</em> true when operating on
distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
backup) happen while lock files are being held.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is instead designed to be <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/" rel="nofollow">safe under concurrent scenarios</a>;
simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
should never result in a repository in a <em>corrupt state</em>. The worst that
<em>should</em> happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
state, leaving you to resolve them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The command-line tool is called <code>jj</code> for now because it's easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called "Jujutsu" because it matches
"jj".</p>

<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, it features two <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend" rel="nofollow">backends</a>—one of them uses a Git repository for storage,
while the other is a native storage backend<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-native-backend-cc1951e102a1d6fc899c5083849f5937" id="user-content-fnref-native-backend-cc1951e102a1d6fc899c5083849f5937" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. The Git backend
uses the <a href="https://libgit2.org/" rel="nofollow">libgit2</a> C library and the
<a href="https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide">gitoxide</a> Rust library.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with <code>jj</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/git_compat.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/git_compat.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can even have a <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility#co-located-jujutsugit-repos" rel="nofollow">"co-located" local
repository</a>
where you can use both <code>jj</code> and <code>git</code> commands interchangeably.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The working copy is automatically committed</h3><a id="user-content-the-working-copy-is-automatically-committed" aria-label="Permalink: The working copy is automatically committed" href="#the-working-copy-is-automatically-committed"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu uses a real commit to represent the working copy. Checking out a commit
results a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit. Almost all
commands automatically amend the working-copy commit.</p>
<p dir="auto">The working-copy being a commit means that commands never fail because the
working copy is dirty (no "error: Your local changes to the following
files..."), and there is no need for <code>git stash</code>. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you're done with the
changes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/working_copy.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/working_copy.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The repo is the source of truth</h3><a id="user-content-the-repo-is-the-source-of-truth" aria-label="Permalink: The repo is the source of truth" href="#the-repo-is-the-source-of-truth"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, <code>jj restore</code> (similar to <code>git restore</code>) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and <code>jj describe</code> can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Entire repo is under version control</h3><a id="user-content-entire-repo-is-under-version-control" aria-label="Permalink: Entire repo is under version control" href="#entire-repo-is-under-version-control"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/operation_log.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/operation_log.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conflicts can be recorded in commits</h3><a id="user-content-conflicts-can-be-recorded-in-commits" aria-label="Permalink: Conflicts can be recorded in commits" href="#conflicts-can-be-recorded-in-commits"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If an operation results in
<a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict" rel="nofollow">conflicts</a>,
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there's no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).</p>
<p dir="auto">Basic conflict resolution:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/resolve_conflicts.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/resolve_conflicts.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Juggling conflicts:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/juggle_conflicts.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/juggle_conflicts.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Automatic rebase</h3><a id="user-content-automatic-rebase" aria-label="Permalink: Automatic rebase" href="#automatic-rebase"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comprehensive support for rewriting history</h3><a id="user-content-comprehensive-support-for-rewriting-history" aria-label="Permalink: Comprehensive support for rewriting history" href="#comprehensive-support-for-rewriting-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Besides the usual rebase command, there's <code>jj describe</code> for editing the

<p dir="auto">The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It's likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, all core developers use <code>jj</code> to work on <code>jj</code>. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used <code>jj</code> to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven't had to re-clone from source (I don't think I've even had
to restore from backup).</p>
<p dir="auto">There <em>will</em> be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary's name may change (i.e.
away from <code>jj</code>). For any format changes, we'll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we've done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							        
									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Do not obey in advance.</strong></p>
<p><em>Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Anticipatory obedience is a political tragedy. Perhaps rulers did not initially know that citizens were willing to compromise this value or that principle. Perhaps a new regime did not at first have the direct means of influencing citizens one way or another. After the German elections of 1932, which permitted Adolf Hitler to form a government, or the Czechoslovak elections of 1946, where communists were victorious, the next crucial step was anticipatory obedience. Because enough people in both cases voluntarily extended their services to the new leaders, Nazis and communists alike realized that they could move quickly toward a full regime change. The first heedless acts of conformity could not then be reversed.</p>
<p>In early 1938, Adolf Hitler, by then securely in power in Germany, was threatening to annex neighboring Austria. After the Austrian chancellor conceded, it was the Austrians’ anticipatory obedience that decided the fate of Austrian Jews. Local Austrian Nazis captured Jews and forced them to scrub the streets to remove symbols of independent Austria. Crucially, people who were not Nazis looked on with interest and amusement. Nazis who had kept lists of Jewish property stole what they could. Crucially, others who were not Nazis joined in the theft. As the political theorist Hannah Arendt remembered, “when German troops invaded the country and Gentile neighbors started riots at Jewish homes, Austrian Jews began to commit suicide.”</p>
<p>The anticipatory obedience of Austrians in March 1938 taught the high Nazi leadership what was possible. It was in Vienna that August that Adolf Eichmann established the Central Office for Jewish Emigration. In November 1938, following the Austrian example of March, German Nazis organized the national pogrom known as <em>Kristallnacht.</em></p>
<p>In 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the SS took the initiative to devise the methods of mass killing without orders to do so. They&nbsp; guessed&nbsp; what their superiors wanted and demonstrated what was possible. It was far more than Hitler had thought.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, anticipatory obedience means adapting instinctively, without reflecting, to a new situation. Do only Germans do such things? The Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, contemplating Nazi atrocities, wanted to show that there was a particular authoritarian personality that explained why Germans behaved as they had. He devised an experiment to test the proposition, but failed to get permission to carry it out in Germany. So he undertook it instead in a Yale University building in 1961—at around the same time that Adolf Eichmann was being tried in Jerusalem for his part in the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews.</p>
<p>Milgram told his subjects (some Yale students, some New Haven residents) that they would be applying an electrical shock to other participants in an experiment about learning. In fact, the people attached to the wires on the other side of a window were in on the scheme with Milgram, and only pretended to be shocked. As the subjects (thought they) shocked the (people they thought were) participants in a learning experiment, they saw a horrible sight. People whom they did not know, and against whom they had no grievance, seemed to be suffering greatly—pounding the glass and complaining of heart pain. Even so, most subjects followed Milgram’s instructions and continued to apply (what they thought were) ever greater shocks until the victims appeared to die. Even those who did not proceed all the way to the (apparent) killing of their fellow human beings left without inquiring about the health of the other participants.</p>
<p>Milgram grasped that people are remarkably receptive to new rules in a new setting. They are surprisingly willing to harm and&nbsp; kill others&nbsp; in the service of some new purpose if they are so instructed by a new authority. “I found so much obedience,” Milgram remembered, “that I hardly saw the need for taking the experiment to Germany.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Forty was both the most destructive and most generative year of my life</strong><span>. Cells in my husband Jake’s body divided, killing him. Cells in my body divided, giving our daughter Athena life.</span></p><p>I didn’t survive.</p><p>The “I” that I used to be—someone who didn’t know what it was like to watch the man she loved dismantled ruthlessly by cancer—died with Jake on August 8th. What was left of her died in childbirth.</p><p><span>Grief and Motherhood have changed the structure of my brain. My hippocampus, vital to memory and emotion, now restricts access to short-and long-term memories</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-1-156832468" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. I’m forgetful. Anxious. There’s a new sense of paralysis. When Jake was alive, I felt capable. I monitored clinical trials, kept up to date on head and neck cancer research, and oversaw his medical care. I wrote and podcasted. I managed IVF, pregnancy, and bursts of full-time work. </span></p><p><span>My mind and body were fueled by adrenaline and cortisol; there was so little time to do and say everything we wanted. While </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/21/i-know-what-happens-to-me-after-i-die-but-what-about-those-left-behind/" rel="">nothing remained unsaid between us</a><span>, there’s so much that remains unfinished. In a letter Jake left for me to read when I went into labor with Athena, he wrote:</span></p><p><em>“Now the future is here, and, if I were next to you, I’d be absurdly excited. But you’re the person who has to make the future actually happen.”</em></p><p>Making it happen feels Sisyphean. The simplest tasks, which barely required a second thought when Jake was alive now feel insurmountable, if I can even remember what it was I meant to complete. I’m becoming an unlikely Zen master. Grief demands my brain sit in the pain of right now.</p><p><span>The assault on my hippocampus has continued in new motherhood. Surging hormones triggered further pruning of my grey matter, sharpening the areas responsible for emotion and theory of mind</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-2-156832468" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. It makes biological sense. Being able to better imagine the perspective of a tiny, nonverbal (though loudly screaming) human being will improve my bond with my infant daughter.</span></p><p>These simultaneous, structural changes caused by death and birth augment each another in upsetting ways. A porousness now exists between my feelings towards Athena and Jake. I’m unable to remember if I’ve checked on Athena, or checked on her thoroughly enough, peeking to watch the soft rise and fall of her ribs throughout the night, the way I used to compulsively check on Jake to make sure he was still breathing. In the silent calm of breastfeeding my mind wanders to Jake’s last hours, sliding into vivid, waking dreams of what he might have been thinking and feeling.</p><p><strong>Friends have told me that they’re relieved I seem “like myself”</strong><span> even after everything that’s happened. I don’t understand how that’s possible when I frequently don’t feel like I have a self to be. Jake and I became so entangled in these last few years that it still seems like many of my thoughts belong to both of us. And in a way, they do. The Default Mode Network, a part of the brain largely responsible for self-perception, has expanded its connections in response to birth and death, destroying the illusion of individuality to include Jake and Athena in my sense of “I." </span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-3-156832468" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>Even my body is a chimera. Fetal cells can be found within a mother decades after birth</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-4-156832468" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>. It’s a comfort to think parts of Athena, parts that also carry Jake’s genetic code, might be forever held inside me. These cells are often found coalescing in areas of pain and hurt. These cells —their cells—must be everywhere.</span></p><p>I don’t feel like myself because I’m not only myself. I’m Jake. I’m Athena.</p><p><span>I’m also a new widow, a new mother. I’m only just starting to understand what it means to be those things as I develop my relationships within those identities. Jake wrote that </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/10/16/how-do-you-say-goodbye/" rel="">we live for other people</a><span>, but we also know ourselves in relation to them. Heidegger philosophized that we develop our sense of self along with “others,” or those from whom one cannot distinguish themselves.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-5-156832468" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Walt Whitman put it more succinctly: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-6-156832468" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> </span></p><p>There is no “I” in relation to nothing else or no one else, except as a description of death. Who I become will be largely dependent on who I become it with.</p><p><strong>Grief and Motherhood have also transformed me in visible ways.</strong></p><p>In photos taken during the last months of Jake’s life, I look like I’m clenching my entire body to keep everything from falling apart. I’m braced for impact. There’s an intensity to my face as I look at Jake as if I’m willing him to live using the power of my mind; it was a face that still believed he might.</p><p>Pregnancy was a more obvious transmutation. A revolution of flesh. The skin on my chest browned, as did a thin strip of skin from my belly button to my pubis. My gums bled. Everything grew—my breasts, my hips, my hair, my feet—as the internal upheaval I felt was progressively presented to the world. </p><p>Athena asserted the duality of my body by furiously thrashing. The placenta, an organ we grew together and shared, had implanted on the posterior wall of my uterus, so it was easy to see her hands, feet and knees as they punched and kicked outwards.</p><p>My belly, a shockingly hard swell of muscle, matched the tension I held in my face. By the ninth month, the skin on my abdomen felt so tight I thought I might split like an overripe peach.</p><p><strong>Now, I’ve been emptied. Jake is dead. Athena’s been born.</strong><span> All those unfilled spaces within me are on display. There’s a softness, a slack, not only to my belly, but to my entire body. My jaw has unclenched, letting my lips part in a subtle “o” of shock. The area under my eyes has hollowed; my gaze is unfocused, dazed from sleep deprivation and frank confusion at what my life has become.</span></p><p>In a culture obsessed with snapping back there’s little warning that the body is a fragile garment, an easily overstretched sweater that never returns to its original shape. I’ve unraveled.</p><p>When I look in the mirror now, I notice all the places where my body reveals what I’ve been through. And I wonder, in a way that I wouldn’t if Jake were still alive, how this new body appears to others who don’t view it through a lens of love.</p><p><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/23/seeing-as-a-doctor-seeing-as-a-wife/" rel="">I’ve written:</a></p><blockquote><p><span>No one will ever see me the way Jake can, again. When Jake looks at me, he sees me at 25, showing up to our first date in a grey mini-dress, black boots and red lipstick. He sees me at 29 in a striped bra and panty set in our 35th story Seattle hotel room, pressing me against the cold glass. And he also sees me as I am now. I’m all these ages at once, as he is to me. Love isn’t blind only to ugliness, but to decay. Look at two 80-year-olds gazing at each other like teenagers and you’ll know what I mean. When I lose Jake, I’ll lose someone ever seeing me throughout all my ages again. I’ve said that </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/24/what-its-like-to-be-married-to-a-dying-man/" rel="">parts of me will die with him</a><span>, and mean more than the parts of my heart and the parts of my personality that act in relation to his. I mean entire eras of my life, all the views he was privy to, and therefore, much of my youth, goes as well. No one—even if I find love again one day, as Jake has urged me to do—will ever look at me and see me at 32, skinny dipping on a trip to Gunnison nude beach in New Jersey with a group of friends, laughing at how cold the water is under the sun of a hot summer day.</span></p></blockquote><p>Jake used to tickle the hair at the nape of my neck and whisper teasingly that he’d found new grey hairs. If I acted self-consciously, he’d tell me,“You look beautiful,” and I’d believe him. Before chemo took his hair, I’d let Jake’s dark curls wrap around my finger and count each of his greys like tiny victories. He was beautiful, too.</p><p>I used to feel like we were getting older together. Now I just feel like I'm getting old. I hadn't realized how different those two feelings are.</p><p>Imperfections that Jake loved about me, or would love about me if he were alive to see them, seem like liabilities now. I’m awkward, unsure how to display myself to the world. There’s a pubertal quality to grief and motherhood in midlife. Even calling it midlife, which suggests continuity, feels wrong. This is a new life. A new mind. A new body.</p><p><strong>Forty was a year of want: </strong><span>I wanted Jake to live. I wanted to keep feeling his body beside me in bed at night. I wanted to help him build a meaningful future even as life as we knew it fell apart. I wanted him to meet our daughter. I wanted to watch him rock her when she cried. I wanted to keep writing with Jake. I wanted to finish our book together. I wanted to read with him on the couch every afternoon and go on walks through the neighborhood at night. I wanted (and thought we almost had) a miracle cure. I wanted to successfully manage his medical care. I wanted him to start breathing again, for his heart to start beating again. I wanted him to walk through the front door again. I wanted him to hold my hand when my contractions started. I wanted him to tell me I was beautiful the first time I held our daughter in my arms. I wanted miracles.</span></p><p>I didn’t get miracles.</p><p>Today I turn forty-one.</p><p><span>My heart still beats with </span><em>I want, I want, I want</em><span>. Only now I don’t know what I want.</span></p><p>But my heart still beats.</p><p>The average life expectancy of a woman in the United States is 77.32 years old. My grandmother lived to be 98. I might have 40, 50, or even 60 years to fill depending on improvements in medical technology. Fifty years is a lot of time. It’s also no time at all.</p><p><strong>Last night, at midnight, I texted Jake's phone</strong><span>, which I haven’t been able to bring myself to disconnect.</span></p><p><em>“How is this our life?”</em></p><p>It isn’t our life.

        <section>
            <p>In the year 2030, no one will remember Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="portability">Portability</h2><p>Containers solved a lot of important problems in software development. We had VMs before containers, but they were not as ergonomic to use. The experience of containers was, by comparison, a true delight. Fast(er) builds, near-instant startup, no virtualization, etc.</p><p>Now we're in an era where containers are annoying to work with. The promise of DevOps has been eroded by complicated tooling and tight coupling of program-container-linux. In my experience, developers want to write code and ship features to hit their quarterly goals. Learning how to use Docker is a distraction. No one has a goal to "improve Docker build times" unless you're part of the new PlatformOps (formerly DevOps (formerly Ops)) team.</p><p>My money is on WebAssembly (WASM) to replace containers. It already has in some places. WebAssembly is a true write-once-run-anywhere experience. (Anywhere that can spin up a V8 engine, which is a lot of places these days.) You can compile several languages into WebAssembly already. <a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython">Languages</a> that can't be compiled will eventually have their own interpreters compiled to WebAssembly. The main thing holding back wider adoption is a lack of system interfaces. File access, networking, etc. But it's just a matter of time before these features get integrated.</p><p>A very obvious argument against WASM succeeding is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's almost exactly the same promise: write once, run anywhere. After all, over 3 billion devices run Java. There are many languages that run on the JVM: Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, Jython, etc. The biggest limitation is that JVM bytecode cannot run in a web browser (RIP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java Applets</a>). Web browsers are a crucial target for app development. Anyone that wants to share code between platforms will avoid the JVM. There is an interesting, slow-moving trend away from the JVM and towards statically compiled binaries. See: GraalVM, Kotlin Native, Scala Native, Jank.</p><h2 id="microservices">Microservices</h2><p>In a microservice architecture, you communicate with other services through HTTP or RPC calls, or using a message broker. This decoupling has important tradeoffs. The success of the model suggests most companies find the benefits outweigh the costs. Importantly, it creates strict boundaries between parts of your system. Conway's Law, etc. You don't <em>need</em> network boundaries to create good encapsulation, but it sure helps when you have a lot of developers.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest downside is the cost associated with having many small services communicating over a network. Not only do you pay for the bandwidth and resource overhead, but you have to engineer solutions to improve the reliability of each system in the face of network partitions.</p><p>With the advent of "serverless" platforms like AWS Lambda, you can take microservices to the extreme: just deploy single functions in the cloud. My favorite serverless model is Cloudflare Workers. If you have one Worker call another Worker, there is no actual network request. Instead, it just calls the Worker code in the same V8 runtime. Meaning you don't pay the cost of a network roundtrip.</p><p>Importantly, Cloudflare Workers all run in V8 sandboxes. There are no containers. You have the option of writing your worker in JavaScript/TypeScript, or compiled WASM. A container cannot call another container in the same process. But V8 can. In other words: by deploying WASM in V8 sandboxes, you get all of the developer benefits of microservices with all of the runtime benefits of monoliths. Cloudflare is not the only provider doing this. Wasmer is trying to build a solution in this space as well.</p><h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2><p>WebAssembly is still a young technology. But it's rapidly developing, and support seems to be growing. Maybe it doesn't work for you <em>yet</em>, but keep an eye on it. Try developing on Cloudflare to see what the future looks like. (TV infomercial voice): if you or a loved one are building Docker images, you may be entitled to a better experience.</p><p>If you primarily develop in languages like Python, Ruby, or PHP, be patient. I recommend adding a compiled language like Go or Rust to your <a href="https://charity.wtf/2018/12/02/software-sprawl-the-golden-path-and-scaling-teams-with-agency/">Golden Path</a> so you can be prepared when the WASM reckoning is upon us.</p>

<h2>
JJ Cheat Sheet
</h2>
<p>Have a <a href="https://justinpombrio.net/src/jj-cheat-sheet.pdf">cheat sheet for Jujutsu</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’ve been learning <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/">Jujutsu</a> a.k.a. <code>jj</code>, a version control
system that’s compatible with <code>git</code> repos. It’s clicked for me in a way that <code>git</code> hasn’t even after
many years of use.</p>

<p>The best way to learn something is to teach it, so I wrote a <em>reference</em> and <em>cheat sheet</em> for <code>jj</code>
with the help of <a href="https://lark.gay/">a friend</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>reference</em> describes the state space of a <code>jj</code> repository and how it changes when you
<code>fetch</code> and <code>push</code>.</li>
  <li>The <em>cheat sheet</em> visually shows what all of the common editing operations do to the repo state.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there have been several excellent tutorials on Jujutsu, I haven’t seen anything that quite
fills these roles. And importantly, they each fit on a page, so it’s possible to print it out
double sided and keep it on your desk while learning <code>jj</code>!</p>

<p>While you can of course approach <code>jj</code> any way you please, if you’re truly new to it I would suggest
first reading a tutorial first to grok some of the basics.
<a href="https://steveklabnik.github.io/jujutsu-tutorial/introduction/introduction.html">Steve Klabnik’s tutorial</a>,
and <a href="https://kubamartin.com/posts/introduction-to-the-jujutsu-vcs">Kuba Martin’s introduction</a>
are both excellent.</p>

<p>(A word about <em>why</em> you should read a tutorial first. If you’re coming from <code>git</code>, you may think of a
repo as a collection of branches, or a merge conflict as part of an operation. These intuitions will
stand in the way of you learning <code>jj</code>, and a tutorial is a better way to unlearn them than a
reference.)</p>

<p>Without further ado, here’s the <a href="https://justinpombrio.net/src/jj-cheat-sheet.pdf">reference and cheat sheet</a>.
It’s written in <a href="https://typst.app/docs">Typst</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/justinpombrio/jj-notes">source</a> is on Github.</p>

										<h4> <p>The Chinese EV giant’s move to introduce self-driving to its cheapest EV models — priced as low as just $9,555 — far undercuts rivals such as Tesla</p>
</h4>

<p>China’s biggest carmaker BYD has shaken up the electric vehicle industry yet again this week after announcing it will offer cutting-edge self-driving systems on all its vehicles — including its cheapest Seagull model — for free.</p>
<p>The carmaker put 21 models equipped with its “God’s Eye” advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) on sale on Monday.</p>
<p>“[We are] starting an era where autonomous driving is for everyone,” BYD’s founder Wang Chuanfu said at a livestreamed launch event.</p>

<h3>Also on AF: <a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/more-concern-on-deepseeks-data-policies-after-bytedance-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Concern on DeepSeek’s Data Policies After ByteDance Link</a></h3>

<p>The technology is “no longer an unattainable luxury, but an essential tool . . . like safety belts and airbags”, Wang was quoted as saying <strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef36aff7-6be4-4cb5-9928-33beabf6c443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by The Financial Times</a></strong>.</p>
<p>BYD has deployed three different versions of the “God’s Eye” ADAS across its line-up. All three offer automated parking and lane-keeping features, with the basic version – available on models costing up to 219,800 yuan ($30,078.69) – enabling autonomous driving on highways. The driver must keep their hands on the wheel and take control when necessary.</p>
<p>Two higher-end versions will be installed on more expensive BYD-branded cars and its premium Denza and Yangwang brands. These will enable a car to drive autonomously — though also under human supervision — in more complex urban traffic.</p>
<p>BYD’s move to introduce self-driving to its cheapest EV models — priced as low as just $9,555 — far undercuts its rivals.</p>
<p>Analysts say it could start a new price war in an already hyper-competitive market, comparing it to how China’s DeepSeek recently <strong><a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/tech-selloff-extends-to-japan-as-deepseek-puts-focus-on-ai-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roiled the global AI sector</a></strong> with its low prices.</p>
<p>The “era of smart driving popularisation has come,” Nomura analysts wrote in a note on BYD’s announcement.</p>
<p>Shares in Chinese automakers Xpeng and Geely Auto tumbled on Tuesday on concern they will struggle to compete against BYD’s move.</p>

<h2>Fresh struggles for Musk’s Tesla</h2>
<p>BYD’s market-breaking move is also likely to deliver a deep blow to its closest rival Tesla at a time when the Elon Musk-led carmaker is already struggling to shore up sales.</p>
<p>Tesla has these ADAS features available in China in its EVs priced from $32,000. It&nbsp;charges $8,000&nbsp;for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistant software in the United States, or $99 a month on a subscription basis. FSD is not yet available in China.</p>
<p>Tesla share prices tumbled 3.8% on Tuesday [1621 GMT], against a smaller 0.1% fall on the broader Nasdaq Composite index.</p>
<p>The carmaker is already struggling with a sharp slump in sales as consumers <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-effect-tesla-sales-slump-five-european-markets-january-2025-02-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow increasingly wary of Musk’s divisive politics</a></strong>. Tesla stock is down more than 11% in the past five trading sessions.</p>
<p>In contrast, BYD’s shares are up nearly 17% over the past five trading sessions.</p>

<h2>The European challenge</h2>
<p>BYD’s offerings could also weigh on Tesla’s sales in Europe, where <strong><a href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/1064131/tesla-shame-in-europe-over-musk-s-pay-package-and-meddling-in-politics-1064131.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a phenomenon dubbed as “Tesla shame”</a></strong> has led potential buyers and existing owners to steer clear of the once pioneer EV-maker.</p>
<p>BYD already enjoys steep price margins in European markets, compared to its local rivals, despite facing an additional 17% tariffs on its shipments to the bloc.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, however, how much of BYD’s ADAS technology will be available in Europe, where autonomous driving regulations are stricter than in the US. Tesla’s FSD tech is only partially available in the region so far.</p>
<p>For now, BYD has listed its Dolphin compact electric car — which it also sells in Europe — on the list of models that will be equipped with ‘God’s Eye.’</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>When a hurricane or tornado starts to form, your local weather forecasters can quickly pull up maps tracking its movement and showing where it’s headed. But have you ever wondered where they get all that information?</em></p>

<p><em>The forecasts can seem effortless, but behind the scenes, a vast network of satellites, airplanes, radar, computer models and weather analysts are providing access to the latest data – and warnings when necessary. This data comes from analysts at the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/weather">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, known as NOAA, and its National Weather Service.</em></p>

<p><em>Atmospheric scientists <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eFsAAoAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Christine Wiedinmyer</a> and <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/people/kari-bowen">Kari Bowen</a>, who is a former National Weather Service forecaster, explained NOAA’s central role in most U.S. weather forecasts.</em></p>

<h2>When people see a weather report on TV, what went on at NOAA to make that forecast possible?</h2>

<p>A lot of the weather information Americans rely on starts with real-time data collected by NOAA <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying">satellites</a>, <a href="https://www.omao.noaa.gov/aircraft-operations">airplanes</a>, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/chs/upperair">weather balloons</a>, <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/radar">radar</a> and <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">maritime buoys</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lmk/observation_networks">weather stations</a> around the world.</p>

<p>All of that information goes <a href="https://www.weather.gov/about/forecast-process">into the agency’s computers</a>, which process the data to begin defining what’s going on in different parts of the atmosphere. </p>

<p>NOAA forecasters use computer models that simulate physics and the behavior of the atmosphere, along with their own experience and local knowledge, to start to paint a picture of the weather – what’s coming in a few minutes or hours or days. They also use that data to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hun/climateforecast">project seasonal conditions</a> out over weeks or months.</p>

<p>All of this analysis happens before the information reaches private weather apps and TV stations.</p>

<p>No matter who you are, you can freely access that data and the analyses. In fact, a large number of private companies use NOAA data to create fancy maps and other weather products that they sell.</p>

<p>It would be extremely difficult to do all of that without NOAA.</p>

<p>The agency operates a <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying">fleet of 18 satellites</a> that are packed with instruments dedicated to observing weather phenomena essential to predicting the weather, from how hot the land surface is to the water content of the atmosphere. Some are <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying/geostationary-satellites">geostationary satellites</a> which sit high above different parts of the U.S. measuring weather conditions 24/7. Others orbit the planet. Many of these are operated as part of partnerships with NASA or the Air Force.</p>

<p>Some private companies are starting to invest in satellites, but it would take an enormous <a href="https://spacesecurity.wse.jhu.edu/2024/06/23/next-generation-goes-satellites-to-be-developed-by-lockheed-martin">amount of money</a> to replicate the <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying/geostationary-satellites/goes-r-series-spacecraft-instruments">range of instrumentation</a> and coverage that NOAA has in place. Satellites only last so long and take time to build, so NOAA is continually <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/future-programs/geostationary-extended-observations-geoxo">planning for the future</a>, and using its technical expertise to develop new instruments and computer algorithms to interpret the data.</p>

<p>Maritime buoys are another measuring system that would be difficult to replicate. <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">Over 1,300 buoys</a> across oceans around the world measure water temperature, wind and wave height – all of which are essential for coastal warnings, as well as long-term forecasts.</p>

<p>Weather observation has been around a long time. President Ulysses S. Grant created the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/timeline/">first national weather service</a> in the War Department in 1870. It became a civilian service in 1880 under the Department of Agriculture and is now in the Commerce Department. The information its scientists and technologists produce is essential for safety and also benefits people and industries in a lot of ways. </p>

<h2>Could a private company create forecasts on its own without NOAA data?</h2>

<p>It would be difficult for one company to provide comprehensive weather data in a reliable way that is also accessible to the entire public.</p>

<p>Some companies might be able to launch their own satellite, but one satellite only gives you part of the picture. NOAA’s weather observation network has been around for a long time and collects data from points <a href="https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?obs=true&amp;wfo=lox">all over the U.S.</a> and <a href="https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">the oceans</a>. Without that robust data, computer models and the broad network of forecasters and developers, forecasting also becomes less reliable.</p>

<p>Analyzing that data is also complex. You’re not going to be able to take satellite data, run a model on a standard laptop and suddenly have a forecast. </p>

<p>And there’s a question of whether a private company would want to <a href="https://youtu.be/-FQ3TOpkHhU?feature=shared">take on the legal risk</a> of being responsible for the nation’s forecasts and severe weather warnings. </p>

<figure>
            <p><iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-FQ3TOpkHhU?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></p>
            <figcaption><span>Neil Jacobs, nominated to oversee NOAA, explains why the agency is essential for accurate national weather forecasting, and why private companies might not want to take on the legal risk on their own.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>NOAA is <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48157">taxpayer-funded</a>, so it is a public good – its services provide safety and security for everyone, not just those who can pay for it.</p>

<p>If weather data was only available at a price, one town might be able to afford the weather information necessary to protect its residents, while a smaller town or a rural area across the state might not. If you’re in a tornado-prone area or coastal zone, that information can be the difference between life or death.</p>

<h2>Is climate data and research into the changing climate important for forecasts?</h2>

<p>The Earth’s systems – its land, water and the atmosphere – are changing, and we have to be able to assess how those changes will impact weather tomorrow, in two weeks and far into the future.</p>

<p>Rising global temperatures <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-water-cycle-is-intensifying-as-the-climate-warms-ipcc-report-warns-that-means-more-intense-storms-and-flooding-165590">affect weather patterns</a>. Dryness can <a href="https://theconversation.com/southern-california-is-extremely-dry-and-thats-fueling-fires-maps-show-just-how-dry-246983">fuel wildfires</a>. Forecasts have to take the changing climate into account to be accurate, no matter who is creating the forecast.</p>

<p>Drought is an example. The dryness of the Earth controls how much water gets exchanged with the atmosphere to form clouds and rainfall. To have an accurate weather prediction, we need to know <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">how dry things are</a> at the surface and how that has changed over time. That requires long-term climate information.</p>

<h2>NOAA doesn’t do all of this by itself – who else is involved?</h2>

<p>NOAA partners with private sector, academia, nonprofits and many others around the world to ensure that everyone has the best information to produce the most robust weather forecasts. Private weather companies and media also play important roles in getting those forecasts and alerts out more widely to the public.</p>

<p>A lot of businesses rely on accuracy from NOAA’s weather data and forecasts: aviation, energy companies, insurance, even modern tractors’ <a href="https://geoawesome.com/eo-hub/how-satellite-data-is-transforming-agriculture/">precision farming</a> equipment. The agency’s long-range forecasts are essential for managing state reservoirs to ensure enough water is saved and to avoid flooding.</p>

<p>The government agency can be <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12667">held accountable</a> in a way private businesses are not because it answers to Congress. So, the data is trustworthy, accessible and developed with the goal to protect public safety and property for everyone. Could the same be said if only for-profit companies were producing that data?</p>

In the complaint, Thomson Reuters claimed the AI firm reproduced materials from its legal research firm Westlaw. Today, a judge ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor, finding that the company’s copyright was indeed infringed by Ross Intelligence’s actions.</p><p>“None of Ross’s possible defenses holds water. I reject them all,” wrote US District Court of Delaware judge Stephanos Bibas, in a summary judgement.</p><p>Thomson Reuters and Ross Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The generative AI boom has led to a spate of additional <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/matthew-butterick-ai-copyright-lawsuits-openai-meta/">legal fights</a> about how AI companies can use copyrighted material, as many major AI tools were developed by training on copyrighted works including books, films, visual artwork, and websites. Right now, there are several dozen lawsuits currently winding through the US court system, as well as international challenges in China, Canada, the UK, and other countries.</p><p>Notably, Judge Bibas ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor on the question of fair use. The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/andy-warhol-fair-use-prince-generative-ai/">fair use doctrine</a> is a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/battle-over-books3/">key component</a> of how AI companies are seeking to defend themselves against claims that they used copyrighted materials illegally. The idea underpinning fair use is that sometimes it’s legally permissible to use copyrighted works without permission—for example, to create parody works, or in noncommercial research or news production. When determining whether fair use applies, courts use a four-factor test, looking at the reason behind the work, the nature of the work (whether it’s poetry, nonfiction, private letters, et cetera), the amount of copyrighted work used, and how the use impacts the market value of the original. Thomson Reuters prevailed on two of the four factors, but Bibas described the fourth as the most important, and ruled that Ross “meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute.”</p><p>Thomson Reuters spokesperson Jeffrey McCoy applauded the ruling in a statement emailed to WIRED. “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”</p><p>Even before this ruling, Ross Intelligence had already felt the impact of the court battle: The startup <a data-offer-url="https://www.lawnext.com/2020/12/legal-research-company-ross-to-shut-down-under-pressure-of-thomson-reuters-lawsuit.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.lawnext.com/2020/12/legal-research-company-ross-to-shut-down-under-pressure-of-thomson-reuters-lawsuit.html&quot;}" href="https://www.lawnext.com/2020/12/legal-research-company-ross-to-shut-down-under-pressure-of-thomson-reuters-lawsuit.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shut down</a> in 2021, citing the cost of litigation. In contrast, many of the AI companies still duking it out in court, like OpenAI and Google, are financially equipped to weather prolonged legal fights.</p><p>Still, this ruling is a blow to AI companies, according to Cornell University professor of digital and internet law James Grimmelmann: “If this decision is followed elsewhere, it's really bad for the generative AI companies.” Grimmelmann believes that Bibas’ judgement suggests that much of the case law that generative AI companies are citing to argue fair use is “irrelevant.”</p><p>Chris Mammen, a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson who focuses on intellectual property law, concurs that this will complicate AI companies’ fair use arguments, although it could vary from plaintiff to plaintiff. “It puts a finger on the scale towards holding that fair use doesn’t apply,” he says.</p><p><em>Update 2/11/25 5:09 ET: This story has been updated to include additional comment from Thomson Reuters.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

While it’s true that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-updates-zen-5-ryzen-9000-benchmark-comparisons-to-intel-chips-details-admin-mode-boosts-chipset-driver-fix" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-updates-zen-5-ryzen-9000-benchmark-comparisons-to-intel-chips-details-admin-mode-boosts-chipset-driver-fix">AMD Ryzen 9000 series</a> (except for the new X3D chips) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-launches-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-big-gains-in-productivity-and-power-efficiency-but-not-in-gaming" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-launches-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-big-gains-in-productivity-and-power-efficiency-but-not-in-gaming">Intel Arrow Lake Core Ultra 200S</a> processors were a disappointment for many enthusiasts, these should have at least delivered a modest increase in performance, particularly in productivity applications.</p><p>Passmark itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1889070672883941789?s=31" data-url="https://x.com/PassMarkInc/status/1889070672883941789?s=31" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">mused on X (formerly Twitter)</a> that it could be that people are switching to more affordable machines that deliver lower power and performance.

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Today the Go team is excited to release Go 1.24,
which you can get by visiting the <a href="https://go.dev/dl/">download page</a>.</p>
<p>Go 1.24 comes with many improvements over Go 1.23. Here are some of the notable
changes; for the full list, refer to the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="language-changes">Language changes</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 now fully supports <a href="https://go.dev/issue/46477">generic type aliases</a>: a type alias
may be parameterized like a defined type.
See the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/spec#Alias_declarations">language spec</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h2>
<p>Several performance improvements in the runtime have decreased CPU overhead
by 2–3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks. These
improvements include a new builtin <code>map</code> implementation based on
<a href="https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Swiss Tables</a>, more efficient
memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
implementation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>go</code> command now provides a mechanism for tracking tool dependencies for a
module. Use <code>go get -tool</code> to add a <code>tool</code> directive to the current module. Use
<code>go tool [tool name]</code> to run the tools declared with the <code>tool</code> directive.
Read more on the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#go-command">go command</a> in the release notes.</li>
<li>The new <code>test</code> analyzer in <code>go vet</code> subcommand reports common mistakes in
declarations of tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples in test packages.
Read more on <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#vet">vet</a> in the release notes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standard-library-additions">Standard library additions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The standard library now includes <a href="https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140">a new set of mechanisms to facilitate
FIPS 140-3 compliance</a>. Applications require no source code
changes to use the new mechanisms for approved algorithms. Read more
on <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#fips140">FIPS 140-3 compliance</a> in the release notes.
Apart from FIPS 140, several packages that were previously in the
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/golang.org/x/crypto">x/crypto</a> module are now available in the
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#crypto-mlkem">standard library</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benchmarks may now use the faster and less error-prone
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/testing#B.Loop"><code>testing.B.Loop</code></a> method to perform benchmark iterations
like <code>for b.Loop() { ... }</code> in place of the typical loop structures involving
<code>b.N</code> like <code>for range b.N</code>. Read more on
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#new-benchmark-function">the new benchmark function</a> in the
release notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a> type provides the ability to perform
filesystem operations isolated under a specific directory. Read more on
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#directory-limited-filesystem-access">filesystem access</a> in the
release notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The runtime provides a new finalization mechanism,
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#AddCleanup"><code>runtime.AddCleanup</code></a>, that is more flexible,
more efficient, and less error-prone than
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime#SetFinalizer"><code>runtime.SetFinalizer</code></a>. Read more on
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24#improved-finalizers">cleanups</a> in the release notes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improved-webassembly-support">Improved WebAssembly support</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 adds a new <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive for Go programs to export
functions to the WebAssembly host, and supports building a Go program as a WASI
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/63a46f61052a21bfab75a76558485cf097c0dbba/legacy/application-abi.md#current-unstable-abi" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">reactor/library</a>.

<p>Please read the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.24">Go 1.24 release notes</a> for the complete and
detailed information. Don’t forget to watch for follow-up blog posts that
will go in more depth on some of the topics mentioned here!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release by writing code and
documentation, reporting bugs, sharing feedback, and testing the release
candidates. Your efforts helped to ensure that Go 1.24 is as stable as possible.

<p>A <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/tesla-news" target="_blank">Tesla</a> Cybertruck owner is praising the automaker for the performance of his electric pickup after its Full Self-Driving system drove it into a utility pole in Reno, Nevada. According to the driver, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-tesla-cybertruck-review" target="_blank">Cybertruck</a> ignored the fact that its travel lane was ending and plowed straight into a pedestrian crossing, which was fortunately empty. Then, the owner (going by <a href="https://x.com/MrChallinger" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@MrChallinger</a>) took to Elon Musk’s X to praise Tesla for the vehicle’s performance in the crash, which did not cause him any injuries.</p>



<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Soooooo my <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">@Tesla

</a> for engineering the best passive safety in the world. I walked away without a scratch. </p><p>It failed to merge out of a lane that was ending (there was no one on my left) and made… <a href="https://t.co/vpT4AGz8jZ" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/vpT4AGz8jZ</a></p></div>— Jonathan Challinger (@MrChallinger) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrChallinger/status/1888546351572726230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">February
 9, 2025</a></blockquote> 



<p>“It failed to merge out of a lane that was ending (there was no one on my left) and made no attempt to slow down or turn until it had already hit the curb. Big fail on my part, obviously,” he said.</p>



<p>It’s a far bigger failure on the part of a “Full” Self-Driving system, we’d argue. Per one of the user’s replies, the incident occurred on Stead Boulevard near the Sierra Sage Golf Course in northwest Reno. The Cybertruck was headed northbound in the far right lane, which merges into the center lane to make way for a signaled crosswalk. The Cybertruck failed to merge and simply drove up onto the curb island, striking the pole.</p>



<p>“Don’t make the same mistake I did. Pay attention. It can happen. I follow Tesla and FSD pretty closely and haven’t heard of any accident on V13 at all before this happened. It is easy to get complacent now – don’t,” he said. </p>







<p>So, to recap, this AI-based system failed to perform a basic merge while driving straight along a multi-lane road with no other traffic, and managed to hit the only two solid objects anywhere in its path—both of which were built on a separate curb island engineered to isolate pedestrians from vehicular traffic. And all of that happened without any intervention from the Cybertruck’s suite of active safety systems.</p>



<p>And rather than being upset with Tesla for selling him a smart dumpster on wheels, the driver <em>took blame</em> for the incident, saying he should have been paying attention. Maybe the average Cybertruck owner is too young to remember, but we’ve seen something like this before…</p>

<p>Why? Well, MrChallinger is on team Tesla, and you gotta protect the team, right? (Emphasis added)</p>



<p>“@Tesla_AI how do I make sure you have the data you need from this incident? Service center etc has been less than responsive on this. I do have the dashcam footage. I want to get it out there as a PSA that it can happen, even on v13, <strong>but I’m hesitant because I don’t want the attention and I don’t want to give the bears/haters any material</strong>.”</p>



<p>Per the owner, the Tesla had Full Self-Driving build v13.2.4 installed when the crash happened. MrChallinger praised the company for “engineering the best passive safety in the world,” but what is truly impressive here is just how efficiently Tesla has molded its owner base into an unpaid PR firm. Please, won’t <em>somebody </em>think of the investors?</p>

For example, between 2016 and 2018, UK research councils awarded 30% more grants to interdisciplinary investigators than they had a decade earlier, with 44% of funded projects in 2018 spanning at least two research subjects<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. A similar move has been made in the United States: between 2015 and 2020, university departments that submitted some interdisciplinary grant proposals received almost five times more funding — in terms of total and individual awards — from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) than did those that submitted in only one discipline<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00403-w" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50617232.jpg"><p>‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap</p></a></article><p>Alas, this isn’t the case in Japan.

Specialists who evaluate these grant proposals <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03290-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03290-1" data-track-category="body text link">tend to favour work in fields that they are familiar with</a> over interdisciplinary studies they do not understand well.</p><p>This narrow approach is leading to substantial underfunding of interdisciplinary research in Japan. It also means that the nation is missing out on breakthroughs. Japan’s natural resources are limited, and its economy has long relied on science and technology. The decline in its research and innovation is unmistakable, as indicated by the country’s share of the world’s top 10% of most-cited research articles, which has dropped from 6% to 2% over the past two decades or so.</p><p>As scientists and engineers based in Japanese research institutions, we urge the government and funding agencies to do more to support interdisciplinary research — or risk eroding the country’s global standing in science and its economy. Here we highlight five directions to foster such a shift.</p><h2><b>Fund people, not projects</b></h2><p>We argue that Japanese funding agencies should pivot from funding projects to supporting talented researchers. Such a model has proven to be effective in leading institutions worldwide. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s (HHMI) Investigator Program provides outstanding scientists with flexible, long-term funding to pursue high-impact biomedical research — some US$11 million over a seven-year term, which can be renewed. This approach has led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the mechanistic understanding of circadian rhythms, the computational prediction of protein folding and the discovery of RNA interference.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03290-1" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_26968274.jpg"><p>Japanese research is no longer world class — here’s why</p></a></article><p>Similarly, in Germany, the Max Planck Society prioritizes curiosity-driven research that has long-term objectives over immediate applications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and providing institute directors with generous internal funding, free from the continual need to secure external grants, this strategy has enabled breakthroughs including the development of CRISPR–Cas9 as a gene-editing tool and structural insights into ribosomes.</p><p>Japan does have some programmes to support talented researchers, but these are too timid. The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), for example, dedicate some funds to basic science and some to curiosity-driven research. But the JST adopts a top-down approach, which often favours research on trending topics and can miss more-original ideas or projects . And the annual budget for the JSPS’s main grant programme, the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), has remained stagnant for the past decade. Adjusted for inflation and the weakening yen, the average funding per project has halved since 2013.</p><p>However, one Japanese institution has adopted researcher-focused funding with great success: the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). Unlike national universities, which are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, OIST is a private university that is funded by Japan’s Cabinet Office. Launched in 2011, it has a horizontal organizational structure and a strong commitment to diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration (see ‘Steps to success’). OIST is now ranked as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-021-00382-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-021-00382-2" data-track-category="body text link">Japan’s leading research institute</a> by the Nature Index, and around 20% of its publications involve contributions across more than one discipline. More Japanese institutions should follow its lead.</p><div><h3>Steps to success</h3><div><p>At the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), faculty members receive core funding for five years — with flexibility in what to do with it. Unlike many other universities, in which laboratories must cover the costs of core facilities and technical staff, access to these resources at OIST is provided free of charge. This fosters collaboration and enables high-risk, high-reward projects. A review of each faculty member every five years ensures accountability, with continued support granted only to those who demonstrate significant achievements.</p><p>OIST also operates without conventional departments, helping scientists from different fields to collaborate. The buildings host open spaces, lounges, shared kitchens and open desk areas that encourage casual interactions. PhD students must also rotate through multiple labs during their first year to widen their horizons. These rotations facilitate the exchange of ideas and technologies, embedding interdisciplinary collaboration into the fabric of the institution.</p><p>Although further progress is needed, including in terms of gender and disability, OIST fosters a greater diversity in its community than do other Japanese institutions. This is partly because it attracts scholars from around the world. In 2024, more than 60% of faculty members and 80% of students at OIST were not Japanese citizens, bringing a dynamic mix of perspectives and expertise.</p></div></div><h2><b>Embrace high-stakes projects</b></h2><p>Interdisciplinary research is often perceived as riskier than more conventional, single-discipline work. This might be because it can be hard to learn concepts and methods, and even communicate efficiently, across disciplines. And priorities between fields can conflict.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, Japanese funding agencies should consider adopting a ‘high risk, high impact’ funding model, similar to that of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which anticipates a success rate of just 50%. They should recognize that even ‘unsuccessful’ high-risk projects can generate valuable knowledge, contributing to broader scientific and technological advancements. The DARPA funding model has inspired others, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), launched in the NIH to drive biomedical breakthroughs<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02449-8" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_27487864.jpg"><p>How to improve assessments of publication integrity</p></a></article><p>Another example is the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in California, which supports interdisciplinary teams comprising biologists, engineers and data scientists to work on ambitious goals, such as the eradication of infectious diseases. It <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21440" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21440" data-track-category="body text link">provides substantial funding over several years</a> to enable teams to pivot research directions in response to emerging challenges. Success is assessed through regular milestone-based evaluations. Projects that show limited potential are promptly terminated, ensuring that resources can be reallocated to more-promising endeavours.</p><p>In Japan, we are not advocating for existing funds to be redistributed. Rather, Japanese policymakers should allocate money to high-risk, high-reward projects from a separate pot, managed through dedicated DARPA-like programmes.</p><h2><b>Expand grant panels</b></h2><p>Initiatives such as the JST’s Diversity and Inclusiveness programme aim to lessen the homogeneity of the research workforce — for example, through awards and networking opportunities for women in science and by providing support or extensions for life events as well as for childcare and caregiving commitments — which tend to fall mostly on women (see page 295). This is laudable, but these efforts should be more widespread: they should be extended across genders and also include funding agency officers, programme managers and reviewers.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50602814.jpg?as=webp 767w, https://media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50602814.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"><img alt="The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology lifts a research submersible onto a ship." loading="lazy" src="https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00394-8/d41586-025-00394-8_50602814.jpg"><figcaption><p><span>The crewed research submersible <i>Shinkai 6500</i> has conducted more than 1,700 dives.</span><span>Credit: Associated Press/Alamy</span></p></figcaption></picture></figure><p>Japan’s funding agencies should also ensure that their own decision makers are less homogeneous in terms of their discipline, background, gender, age, nationality and culture. This would help to favour interdisciplinary research, which by nature weaves different approaches together and can benefit from being planned, conducted and assessed by a diverse community.</p><p>The role of immigration in boosting diversity should also be recognized.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                        </div>
            <p>Imagine, a dusty basement full of machinery in Manhattan, or a whole second floor of a warehouse in Queens where students once learned how to mill the parts that made America move.</p><p>Now many are empty — except for the bones.</p><p>Dempsey says that when you go into places like that, you can imagine what they once were. “You can see the kids” and hear the hum of industrial education, he said. “Now, most of them have closed down.”</p><p>It’s all part of the sharp decline in vocational education — shop class — in this nation that began in the 1980s as blue collars became unfashionable and the emphasis shifted to a college education.</p><p>Remember when most schools had vocational education classes, teaching kids who were antsy or not sharp with studies how to be tradespeople?</p><p>Most schools don’t anymore.</p><p>So Dempsey goes in these buildings alone with come-alongs, railroad jacks, chain falls and, with sheer force of will, drags the machines into the trailer of his trusty 1986 cab-over Peterbilt big rig.</p><p>He brings them back to Richmond, checks them out and repairs them if needed, then sells them for pennies on the dollar.</p><p>This guy is famous among machinists, and so tough and hard a cat couldn’t scratch him.</p><p>One slip and you get a hand or foot bitten off. A jack slipped once and smashed the side of his jaw, requiring $20,000 in dental surgery. “I kept working that day, though.”</p><p>Check out this 70-year-old metal lathe made by Heidenreich and Harbeck of Hamburg, Germany. “Probably, Mr. Hitler made it.”</p><p>It works like new and was once worth $60,000. He just sold it for $2,500.</p><p>That sweet, hydraulic DoAll contour machine (band saw) from 1963 once had a price tag of $150,000.</p><p>“We’ll probably sell it for $2,000.”</p><p>Theses are the machines that can make anything, including other machines.</p><p>Virtually everything you touch or drive was machined in some way, from the parts themselves or the machine that mass-produced them.</p><p>Who makes that stuff, and who repairs it?</p><p>“You go to Walmart and it says ‘made in China,’” Dempsey said. “When I was a kid, it said ‘made in New York.’”</p><p>Indeed, China has shot past the U.S. in terms of industry. And our manufacturing growth is a fraction of that in other countries like South Korea, Russia, India, Brazil and Indonesia. Even Mexico, with a comparatively paltry 5 percent in manufacturing expansion, basically doubles our growth rate.</p><p>And much of our heavy-duty stuff is made overseas. (Did you see those giant beer tanks shipped by barge to Stone Brewery in Richmond this week? Made in Germany.)</p><p>“If we have to go to war, we’re in a mess,” Dempsey said.</p><p>Most of his customers are his age — 68 — or older.</p><p>“My oldest customer is 91, Bill Hargrove. He went to the Henry Ford school for machinists,” he said. It worries him that only a few of his customers — less than 1 percent, he figures — are under 30.</p><p>It’s scary to think of a country that can’t make its own moving parts.</p><p>Industrial might as part of national strength and security is why this nation began emphasizing vocational education in the early 1900s.</p><p>As educational pioneer Ellwood Cubberley wrote back then, “The great battles of the future will be commercial, not military.”</p><p>We’ve seen how lapses in our vocational education have led to masses of immigrants coming in to do our blue-collar jobs, many of them paying as much or more than nice, clean service or tech jobs.</p><p>The pressing need to shift back to vocational education (now called CTE — career and technical education) is ringing across that land.</p><p>North Carolina educators and lawmakers decided to place equal emphasis on vocational education and college prep. This year, students have two paths — college or a skilled job — which is similar to the educational choices in many European countries.</p><p>U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., co-chairman of the Senate’s Career and Technical Education Caucus, is among those pushing for funding to recruit CTE instructors to ramp up our vocational educational system.</p><p>“There’s a huge need for people in CTE fields,” Kaine told me Friday. “The old stigma about CTE, or vocational education, that’s really disappearing and there’s kind of a renaissance going on.”</p><p>You know, I’m more proud of being a journeyman bricklayer than being a college biology graduate. To know how to work with your hands is a great gift, good for your body and your heart.</p><p>Look at Noel Dempsey, still built like a teenager at 68 with plenty of fire left in his belly to make things.</p><p>He’s planning to stop picking at our old industrial bones next year to focus on a couple of his energy-saving inventions, including a buoy that uses magnetism and wave action to light it up.</p><p>“I think many of us want to see America great again,” he said. “People are starting to realize they can.”</p><p>But that’s going to take some new, industrial-strength bones to grow on, and a bunch of tough people who don’t mind getting their hands a little dirty.</p>

Moving freely in beautifully drawn environments or driving a car you'll never be able to own—those are definitely fun experiences too. But lately, there are just too many of those types of games, and I think it has become boring. Games these days are also really complicated. There are lots of buttons, and there are a lot of items to keep track of. I'm just tired of all those complications. To hold a controller in your hand and control the action displayed on the screen is a minor thing nowadays, but I still think it's a little miracle. There's no need to add a lot of extra stuff to make it more difficult.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt57766830145a6ee5/6765f0a02aabff74ae94ebf8/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_6.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt57766830145a6ee5/6765f0a02aabff74ae94ebf8/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_6.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="" title=""></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Katamari team.

Researching scale">1. Researching scale</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a stage in the game where your katamari starts at 1m, and the ultimate goal is to grow the katamari to more than 500m in diameter. In about the seventh or eighth month into development, we were able to show this growth in one sequence. I really let out a sigh of relief when that all came together. Before we began, I had carefully considered the map design and object placement to work together in the game, but until we finally executed it, I was very nervous.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I constantly had questions in my mind, such as what objects should be available for the player to roll up, would the objects fit into the memory, and how long, in minutes, would someone have to play to get to the target size. The final game came together pretty well, and we were able to effectively express a great change in scale through the various objects collected, and the feeling of enormity. In the end we just had to implement objects and roll them up to see if they would work or not. We made adjustments using a trial-and-error method, rather than trying to figure everything out in our minds.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. No powerups">2. No powerups</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I decided from the beginning of development that we would not use any power-up items or similar devices in the game. We didn't even consider implementing special power-up objects that would make the katamari bigger for a limited time, or items that would allow the katamari to roll up objects more easily. I think this allowed us to stay simple, allowed us to create a game where you just "roll stuff and make it bigger." It was great to be reminded that a game can be fun without such complicated items.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We thought about giving the player a specific level objective, in addition to just making the katamari bigger, such as rolling up a particularly large object to complete the game, so the player would have a clear mission. However, if we did this, rolling up this particular object could become the main objective of the game, and increasing the katamari's size might have been reduced to just a mere process of reaching this goal. So, in the end, we decided not to use this idea.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blta052e7f9a419e145/6765f0f295b07ffb4c54bb5e/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_5.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blta052e7f9a419e145/6765f0f295b07ffb4c54bb5e/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_5.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="" title=""></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How to roll a house, Katamari style.

Controlling the rolling</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think we were able to express the sense of rolling really well. Subtle elements of the game, such as the sound effects generated when you roll something into the katamari, and the vibration from the controller, had a very big effect in adding to the overall feeling of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also made adjustments to the game design, so it really reflected the uniqueness of rolling the katamari. For example, this game actually does have some combo elements. In fighting games, the combo is usually expressed by a number, but in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Katamari Damacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, if you roll up multiple objects in a row, you will see fireworks, confetti, or twinkling stars around the Prince shown in the bottom right area of the screen.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Peaceful, easy feeling">4. Peaceful, easy feeling</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The overall peaceful ambiance of the entire game is really great. This includes many individual elements, such as the graphic style, the color, the sound and music, the movies and cut-scenes, the giant space mushroom, and the overall theme of recreating the night sky.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am influenced by what's going on in reality, and it often shows in what I create. I am sure the terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq, which started just as we began development, affected me to some degree. Of course, I didn't really create this game with a direct reference to the concept of peace, but there are some things that I consciously chose to do here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a lot of aggressiveness and violence in games nowadays. I do not denounce this violence completely, because it is a part of human instinct and is a very straightforward thing to express. What I tried to do was not only bring peaceful feelings to the game, but also create something totally different, which would be more exciting than just being peaceful. I wanted to stimulate human instinct on a different level.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of the uniqueness of the game, it was natural that the movies, sounds, and interface all carry this similar, unique tone.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Audible excellence">5. Audible excellence</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The music/soundtrack of the game came out really well. Games and music have a lot in common. I have really had enough of the standard "the boss battle has music with tension" approach, however. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Katamari Damacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there is no boss and there are no enemies, so we created a soundtrack that's original to the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'll let Yu Miyake, our sound director, tell you about the music he created in his own words:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Takahashi, the director, allowed me to direct the music any way I wanted. I would never have been given that kind of creative freedom working for an ordinary director. My goal was to have the music appeal to everyone, and so I tried many different methods of directing and creating tunes in order to have that appeal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I often record melodies that I have in my head using my cellular phone or PC by humming. My workspace is not completely private, and my co-workers make fun of me if they hear me humming, so I always record my humming secretly. I decided to insert this humming in the title sequence of the test version of the game because I thought it would be funny and a bit kooky. It was just a joke at first, but then people started to like it, so I decided to keep it—and that's why you hear some weirdo humming when you first load the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the humming differentiates </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Katamari Damacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from other titles and fits the gameplay perfectly. This humming is also included in the opening theme music. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that singing is the best instrument we humans have.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Collaborating with outside musicians is now very popular in the game industry, so we decided to hire 10 somewhat well-known vocalists. As you know, this game is very unique, and we weren't really sure which age group it would appeal to, so we decided to hire 10 in order to get a range of talent to appeal to everyone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"After selecting the vocalists, our next step was to figure out how we could enhance the mood of the game through the music. We actually used a somewhat backward process in that we created the music after selecting the vocalists, instead of before, so that we could use the vocalists talents most effectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were very serious when creating the music. Most game music nowadays is pretty forgettable. I wanted to create a soundtrack that would stick in players' heads, sort of like an evil curse. I also wanted to avoid using a single musical genre. Everything from the selection of the vocalists to the selection of the song lyrics, was carefully considered.”</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt230f514709805bcb/6765f16bc5e375e65f55f1e4/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_4.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt230f514709805bcb/6765f16bc5e375e65f55f1e4/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_4.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="" title=""></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A 741m katamari rolls up clouds, volcanoes, and a giant squid.

Tipping the scale">1. Tipping the scale</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This game is all about "getting bigger," but sometimes I wasn't able to truly feel that we had accomplished this feat. Again, this is my personal opinion, but when you become big, you instantly forget about when you were small. Even if you come back with a big katamari to the map where you initially played with a small katamari, you've forgotten about the experience so you don't feel like you've gotten really big. I wish we could have engendered the feeling of "Wow, I've gotten so big," a bit more effectively during gameplay.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Falling apart">2. Falling apart</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I thought it would be fun to include a feature that would make the katamari reduce in size and crumble. My idea was that when the katamari comes across something it can't roll over, or bumps into a large object; the objects that it had rolled over previously should fall off, and the katamari shrinks a little. Basically, a katamari that has grown to 300m in diameter can become as small as 2m in diameter by bumping into something and thus crumbling, so in the game you don't just grow bigger, but you also can become smaller. I hoped this would make the overall gameplay experience feel really free, but there were various issues, and it turned out to be impossible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Minor crumbling was implemented, but we decided not to fully implement this feature because we couldn't really figure out natural solutions to some issues. For example, objects rolled up by the katamari are absorbed into it in order to reduce the load on the CPU, so when they are no longer visible, the memory of the object is deleted. We were not sure how to deal with objects that are absorbed and then have to reappear and then disappear again when a katamari crumbles down to nothing. As a result, the whole crumbling feature became vague and wasn't very effective in the end at all.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt8a526dff206cca11/6765f1e479a039c7d9510f75/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_2.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt8a526dff206cca11/6765f1e479a039c7d9510f75/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_2.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="" title=""></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rolling, rolling, rolling.

The camera and the queasy</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The camera control didn't go as well as I thought it would. Thinking back on it, we could have used the camera to add scale for the overall "gigantic" feeling, but we simply didn't have enough time. I wish we had more. Honestly, I'm still not sure what camera angle would have been best for this game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would have also tried to prevent some of the 3D movement nausea that some people experience while playing. Previously, I thought I needed to show how the katamari grew in size during the game, so we made the camera zoom out automatically when the katamari grows so big that it occupies the entire screen. But maybe it would have been good enough to allow players to look at the katamari simply from the Prince's point of view. It may have added more sense of scale if we had the tip of a katamari blurred, or had some clouds over it as it grows and becomes gigantic.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Not getting the oblong">4. Not getting the oblong</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I felt strongly that the katamari should roll the way it would if it actually picked up a new object. For instance, if you pick up a long stick-like object, such as a pencil, the pencil sticks out of the katamari.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the real world, it's impossible to roll something like that grouped into a single object, but in this game, we've ignored the rules of physics and allowed for any large object to stick out. The katamari will still roll, but in a large arc. This arc-like movement will then adversely affect gameplay—the control becomes unwieldy, and causes you to lose time. Of course, we didn't just add this movement in order to adversely affect the roll of the katamari—it is also a fun addition to enjoy a weird rolling experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Truthfully, it actually doesn't look that fun, so I don't think it's executed well, but I was hoping to create a game in which a negative effect could become a positive experience. Also, the various objects scattered all over the stages are just components that help you make your katamari bigger—but that's boring. Every object has a shape, and all the unevenness that's created by rolling up the various objects gives the katamari a real "existence."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In choosing the objects players could gather, I wasn't consciously trying to choose unique objects. I just added what I thought players would want to roll up—though I'm not really sure about the giant mushroom and giant daruma statues. I couldn't come up with any really large objects, so I just put "giant" in front of the names of the objects that are normally not that big.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt832d74eb6f64c3c6/6765f22259974fb4908572ad/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_3.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt832d74eb6f64c3c6/6765f22259974fb4908572ad/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_3.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="" title=""></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Game Developer Magazine, December 2004.</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Time limits">5. Time limits</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Originally, I wanted to eliminate the time limit and let the player simply roll the katamari to make it bigger. But, I couldn't figure out how to make the game fun without a time limit, so I gave up on that idea at an early stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I still think that game developers are bound by too many rules, and the time limit is one of them. Some of the missions don't have time limits. This is a small remnant of my original intentions.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gather no moss">Gather no moss</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game itself does not rely on words, and you can play the original version even if you don't speak Japanese. So I guess it is natural for the game to be available in South Korea and North America, but we still think this is a minor miracle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not many games use totally original IP and game design, as most of the best sellers in Japan are established franchises. Original games don't typically sell well, so I think it's a miracle that Namco decided to take a chance on an oddball title like this. It is even more encouraging that they decided to release it overseas. It really is quite a miracle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Katamari</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I learned that at a game studio, we don't need partitions or instant messengers. The most important thing is to talk directly to each other as a team. By doing so we were able to develop a game exactly as we wanted. I think that really shows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I worked on the basic concept on my own. I found that if I started to listen to others, the concept tended to become diluted and unfocused. However, once the basic concept was decided, it was helpful to have open discussions with the team. There were many more ideas that were not used in the game, but I still got something out of all the different ideas that were brought up even if I didn't use them as they were presented.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had several goals when making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Katamari</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We wanted to make a game that would appeal to people who have become disillusioned with recent games and rekindle their passion. We wanted to do away with the current stereotype that has become the norm in the industry where both the developers and the players have come to accept a set of arbitrary rules as standard, despite the fact that video games are still a very new media. Most importantly, we wanted people to have fun and enjoy their gameplay experience.</span></p><p><img data-testid="content-image" data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltb7a770db13179fd0/6765f28dc5e3759abb55f1ec/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_1.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/bltb7a770db13179fd0/6765f28dc5e3759abb55f1ec/Katamari_Damacy_Postmortem_Visual_1.png?width=700&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="" title=""></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The King of All Cosmos commands it!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi HN — we’re Seth and Ayo and we’re building a0.dev (<a href="https://a0.dev/">https://a0.dev</a>). a0.dev is a platform built to cut down React Native development time from weeks to just a few hours.</p><p>We’ve been building mobile apps together for seven years and have had several successes. One thing that’s always bothered us though is how much harder it is to build a mobile app than a website. If you’ve built an app with React Native before you’re familiar with the pains of working with both Xcode and Android Studio, writing tons of boilerplate before you can even start making the app, setting up state management, and of course going through the dreaded app review. We decided to build a platform that would make the app development process faster.</p><p>We’ve seen the success of new code-gen platforms like v0 and wanted something for React Native that goes further. We built an AI app generator that takes a user's prompt and creates a custom React Native app with an instant live preview.</p><p>Here’s a 5min demo where we recreated the Hacker News UI: <a href="https://youtu.be/f3lzBRBUous" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/f3lzBRBUous</a></p><p>a0.dev is great for quickly prototyping components and screens in React Native and users are able to copy the code from our generator into their preferred development environment. Our landing page has a couple of example prompts, but we encourage you to get creative when trying it out. We’ve had success generating not only functional screens like an Instagram Feed but also 2d games like Minesweeper or Flappy Bird.</p><p>Our chat has a “UI Expert” and “Advanced Logic” model users can switch between depending on the task at hand. Users can upgrade from working on a single screen to creating a full app by clicking on the “Need a Full App” button in the top right of the page. This changes the scope from a standalone chat with a single file to a full project that can include multiple chats and files. We launched an IOS app that users can download in order to preview the app on a physical device. We find that many apps look and feel better on a physical device so we recommend trying it out.</p><p>Our goal is to continue to improve the app generator while adding more features to help developers get their apps to the app store and make money from those apps. The main features on our roadmap right now are a Supabase integration and a “one click submit” button to let developers publish their app to the App Store.</p><p>There are a few limitations to note. We’re working on releasing our Android app, but Android users should be able to preview their app using the Expo Go App. The app is running React Native Web in the browser so any dependencies that don’t support web won’t work with the web preview but should work on the phone. There are also some dependencies that our system can’t handle because they require native modules that aren’t packaged into our app currently.</p><p>We hope you guys will check it out and try making an app with a0.dev. We’re available on Discord around the clock to help developers with any problems they may face and want to guide people to actually releasing their app on the App Store. Let us know what features you’d like to see and any problems you’ve faced building apps, we’d love to hear about your experience.</p><p>Here’s the link again to check it out: (<a href="https://a0.dev/">https://a0.dev</a>)</p><p>We dropped the need to sign up for the first message so you can just jump in and try it out.</p><p>Looking forward to your thoughts!</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We present an outcome-driven fine-tuning framework that enhances the forecasting capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without relying on human-curated reasoning samples. Our method leverages model self-play to generate pairs of diverse reasoning trajectories and probabilistic forecasts for a set of diverse questions that resolve after the models' knowledge cutoff date. We then rank pairs of these reasoning traces by their distance to the actual outcomes before fine-tuning the model via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). On a separate test set, our approach increases prediction accuracy of Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B by between 7--10\% over a base model and a DPO fine-tuned control model with randomized labels, bringing them on par with forecasting capabilities of much larger frontier models like GPT-4o.

But if you thought that this color ePaper was limited to handheld devices, think again. E Ink has now shown off 75-inch outdoor displays.</p><p>E Ink partnered with four companies for an ISE 2025 showcase of the Kaleido 3 Outdoor technology – <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-showcases-color-e-paper-and-ai-signage-solutions-at-ise-2025" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.lg-informationdisplay.com/ise2025" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">LG Information Display</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOHAght_5vw" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">DynaScan</a> and <a href="https://agiledisplaysolutions.com/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Agile Display Solutions</a>.</p><p>"As more countries look to reduce their carbon footprint and increase the sustainability of their communities, the benefits of an E Ink display, with its low power consumption and non-light pollution characteristics, can bring real change to indoor and outdoor Digital Out-of-Home signage," said Dr. F.Y. Gan, President of E Ink. "Our largest E Ink Kaleido display to date offers a compelling solution to address the need for a dynamic display that also provides environmental solutions."</p><p>That ePaper technology here is dubbed Kaleido Outdoor 3 and makes use of a RGB color filter array atop a monochrome E Ink film to produce 4,096 colors along with crisp, clear text. As the name suggests, this version has been designed for outdoor digital signage applications, and can operate in temperatures ranging from -15 °C to 65 °C ( 5 °F to 149 °F).</p><div data-align-center="">

E Ink reckons that could see signage at a bus stop, for example, run on solar panels – meaning that "it can replace energy-hungry digital signage and conform to the new restrictions." The ePaper technology is eye-friendly too, of course, and doesn't cause light pollution (unless some sort of back/front lighting is used). It's the first display tech to be certified by the International Dark-Sky Association.</p><p>Samsung's Color E-Paper flavor is being offered in sizes ranging from 13 inches (at 1,600 x 1,200 pixels) right up to 75 inches (for 5,120 x 2,880 pixels). Included with the display package are a 5,000-mAh battery, USB-C ports, 8 GB of onboard storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. A dedicated mobile app caters for remote management, while a special algorithm has the job of optimizing content visibility.</p><p>We've been unable to find any info on LG's version, but DynaScan has integrated the Kaleido Outdoor 3 technology into its DK Series Kiosks – which are also available in LED, LCD and lightbox options.

It doesn’t try to compete with AMD or Nvidia’s high end cards. While it’s not as flashy as Nvidia’s RTX 4090 or AMD’s RX 7900 XTX, midrange GPUs account for a much larger share of the discrete GPU market, thanks to their lower prices. Unfortunately, today’s midrange cards like the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 only come with 8 GB of VRAM, and are poor value. Intel takes advantage of this by launching the Arc B580 at $250, undercutting both competitors while offering 12 GB of VRAM.</p><p>For B580 to be successful, its new Battlemage architecture has to execute well across a variety of graphics workloads. Intel has made numerous improvements over Alchemist, aiming to achieve better performance with less compute power and less memory bandwidth. I’ll be looking at the Arc B580, with comparison data from the A770 and A750, as well as scattered data I have lying around.</p><p>Battlemage is organized much like its predecessor. Xe Cores continue to act as a basic building block. Four Xe Cores are grouped into a Render Slice, which also contains render backends, a rasterizer, and associated caches for those fixed function units. The entire GPU shares an 18 MB L2 cache.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png" width="1456" height="851" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:851,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:389547,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb437e0-8218-4919-a3ca-a5ab7c3be9ac_1520x888.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Block diagram of Intel’s Arc B580.

Alchemist had a 96 KB instruction cache, and Battlemage almost certainly has an instruction cache at least as large. Instructions on Intel GPUs are generally 16 bytes long, with a 8 byte compacted form in some cases. A 96 KB instruction cache therefore has a nominal capacity of 6-12K instructions.</p><p>XVEs form the smallest partition in Intel GPUs. Each XVE tracks up to eight threads, switching between them to hide latency and keep its execution units fed. A 64 KB register file stores thread state, giving each thread up to 8 KB of registers while maintaining maximum occupancy. Giving a register count for Intel GPUs doesn’t really work, because Intel GPU instructions can address the register file with far more flexibility than Nvidia or AMD architectures. Each instruction can specify a vector width, and access a register as small as a single scalar element.</p><p><span>For most math instructions, Battlemage sticks with 16-wide or 32-wide vectors, dropping the SIMD8 mode that could show up with Alchemist. Vector execution reduces instruction control overhead because a single operation gets applied across all lanes in the vector. However, that results in lost throughput if some lanes take a different branch direction. On paper, Battlemage’s longer native vector lengths would make it more prone to suffering such divergence penalties. But Alchemist awkwardly shared control logic between XVE pairs, making SIMD8 act like SIMD16, and SIMD16 act a lot like SIMD64 aside from a funny corner case (see the </span><a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/p/intels-ambitious-meteor-lake-igpu" rel="">Meteor Lake article</a><span> for more on that).</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png" width="1336" height="680" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:680,&quot;width&quot;:1336,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:119096,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b6bc6bd-5a8f-459c-ae20-bbaab86418a2_1336x680.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Battlemage’s divergence behavior by comparison is intuitive and straightforward.

Maybe not. I’m not sure</figcaption></figure></div><p>Like Alchemist, Battlemage executes most math operations down two ports (ALU0, ALU1). ALU0 handles basic FP32 and FP16 operations, while ALU1 handles integer math and less common instructions. Intel’s port layout has parallels to Nvidia’s Turing, which also splits dispatch bandwidth between 16-wide FP32 and INT32 units. A key difference is that Turing uses fixed 32-wide vectors, and keeps both units occupied by feeding them on alternate cycles. Intel can issue instructions of the same type back-to-back, and can select multiple instructions to issue per cycle to different ports.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg" width="688" height="388" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:388,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dc7aecd-d6fe-40df-9180-8c3e4b7196b2_688x388.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In another similarity to Turing, Battlemage carries forward Alchemist’s “XMX” matrix multiplication units.

XVEs access the memory hierarchy by sending a message to the appropriate shared functional unit. At one point, the entire iGPU was basically the equivalent of a Xe Core, with XVE equivalents acting as basic building blocks. XVEs would access the iGPU’s texture units, caches, and work distribution hardware over a messaging fabric. Intel has since built larger subdivisions, but the terminology remains.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png" width="993" height="562" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:562,&quot;width&quot;:993,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:97381,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa07a5a41-b1b0-4ba1-b0c8-963e6d0d324a_993x562.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Each Xe Core has eight TMUs, or texture samplers in Intel terminology.

Intel does not have separate scalar instructions like AMD. But Intel’s GPU ISA lets each instruction specify its SIMD width, and SIMD1 instructions are possible.

Each thread targets a different address across an array, aiming to avoid contention.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png" width="853" height="487" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:487,&quot;width&quot;:853,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:43470,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1702a6a8-8df1-4620-a778-cdd153c70ac8_853x487.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Alchemist and Battlemage both appear to have 32 atomic ALUs attached to each Xe Core’s SLM unit, much like AMD’s RDNA and Nvidia’s Pascal. Meteor Lake’s Xe-LPG architecture may have half as many atomic ALUs per Xe Core.</p><p>Battlemage has a two level cache hierarchy like its predecessor and Nvidia’s current GPUs. B580’s 18 MB L2 is slightly larger than A770’s 16 MB L2. A770 divided its L2 into 32 banks, each capable of handling a 64 byte access every cycle. At 2.4 GHz, that’s good for nearly 5 TB/s of bandwidth.</p><p>Intel didn’t disclose B580’s L2 topology, but a reasonable assumption is that Intel increased bank size from 512 to 768 KB, keeping 4 L2 banks tied to each memory controller. If so, B580’s L2 would have 24 banks and 4.3 TB/s of theoretical bandwidth at 2.85 GHz. Microbenchmarking using Nemes’s Vulkan test gets a decent proportion of that bandwidth. Efficiency is much lower on the older A750, which gets approximately as much bandwidth as B580 despite probably having more theoretical L2 bandwidth on tap.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png" width="724" height="440" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:440,&quot;width&quot;:724,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:52255,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F315873c9-03fb-4cb8-9854-c5f37ce6f630_724x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Besides insulating the execution units from slow VRAM, the L2 can act as a point of coherency across the GPU.

Even when VRAM bandwidth demands are high, the 18 MB L2 is able to catch enough traffic to avoid pushing GDDR6 bandwidth limits. If Intel hypothetically used a smaller GDDR6 memory subsystem like Nvidia’s RTX 4060, B580 would need a larger cache to avoid reaching VRAM bandwidth limits.</p><p>Probably as a cost cutting measure, B580 has a narrower PCIe link than its predecessor. Still, a x8 Gen 4 link provides as much theoretical bandwidth as a x16 Gen 3 one. Testing with OpenCL doesn’t get close to theoretical bandwidth, but B580 is at a disadvantage compared to A750.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png" width="571" height="338" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:338,&quot;width&quot;:571,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:35563,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd95b9ef-0bc9-47f2-af97-89fbd2fc9bfd_571x338.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>PCIe link bandwidth </span><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-pci-express-scaling/28.html" rel="">often has minimal impact on gaming performance</a><span>, as long as you have enough VRAM.

Intel’s compiler often prefers SIMD32, a mode that AMD often chooses for compute code or vertex shaders, and one that Nvidia exclusively uses. SIMD1 optimizations create parallels to AMD’s scalar unit or Nvidia’s uniform datapath. Battlemage’s memory subsystem emphasizes caching more than its predecessor, while relying less on high VRAM bandwidth. AMD’s RDNA 2 and Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace made similar moves with their memory subsystems.</p><p>Of course Battlemage is still a very different animal from its discrete GPU competitors. Even with larger XVEs, Battlemage still uses smaller execution unit partitions than AMD or Nvidia. With SIMD16 support, Intel continues to support shorter vector widths than the competition. Generating SIMD1 instructions gives Intel some degree of scalar optimization, but stops short of having a full-out scalar/uniform datapath like AMD or post-Turing Nvidia. And 18 MB of cache is still less than the 24 or 32 MB in Nvidia and AMD’s midrange cards.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg" width="688" height="458" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:458,&quot;width&quot;:688,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62f51acd-d131-49f8-9830-d0d60a964a00_688x458.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Differences from AMD and Nvidia aside, Battlemage is a worthy step on Intel’s journey to take on the midrange graphics market.

A third player in the high end dGPU market would be very welcome as many folks are still on Pascal or GCN due to folks feeling as if there is not a reasonable upgrade yet. Intel’s Arc B580 addresses some of that pent-up demand, at least when it’s not out-of-stock. I look forward to seeing Intel’s future GPU efforts.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.
