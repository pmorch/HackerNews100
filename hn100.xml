Been loving this project, this website for years. The sounds, the stories, the community. &lt;3 This particular "noise" for me is a real lifesaver. It always helps me with (tension-) headaches. Thank you so much.</span></p><p>

I couldn't think for two days straight; it was so bad and kept getting worse. This quieted the constant chatter and noise down to a mild hum.</span></p><p>

Neural Hack sounds so funny, that one time I laughed so hard at night listening to this, that my mom came upstairs and whooped me. All jokes aside, if anyone has trouble managing their tinnitus, then this is the one for you! 8.7 out of 10.</span></p><p>

Stéphane and Steve have created a nearly magical tinnitus solution. Whenever my tinnitus starts acting up, I pop on these settings for a few minutes, and when I take the headphones off... Silence. Absolute silence. I have no idea how this works, but it's genius!</span></p><p>

You wouldn't think such an exotic, high-pitched, and beepy sound generator would be calming, but when you find the right spot and let it go for a few minutes, then pause the audio, it's so much quieter—not gone, but still a relief compared to before. Even just letting it play and noticing your ear ringing contributing to the music instead of being a distracting annoyance is calming.</span></p><p>

Once properly calibrated, after a few minutes of listening, it helps reduce the perception of tinnitus—and even after removing the headphones, the sensation almost seems to vanish. myNoise is a great tool to use when needed.</span></p><p>

I've been using this neuromodulator on a daily basis for many weeks and this is by far the best help I could ever find to release my tinnitus 24/7 head drill. It doesn’t get rid of it completely, but it tones it down massively - just leaves a soft background hum that lets you live your life. Honestly, it feels like magic. No idea how it works this well. Huge thanks to the creators - you guys rock!</span></p><p>

I use the tinnitus neuromodulator when things get rough. It doesn't just mask the tinnitus, it transports me into a space where I can focus again. For a while, I feel clear. What gets me is this: when I take off the headphones, the tinnitus is gone. Not reduced—gone. Then, slowly, it creeps back. That minute of silence is everything.</span></p><p>

If you have basic audio knowledge, this website is a much better option than commercial tinnitus therapies based on overpriced hearing aids. Thanks to this website, I’m reconfiguring my relationship with tinnitus in a much more organic and spontaneous way.</span></p><p>

I don't have tinnitus, but I love the strangeness of this generator. It sounds really fascinating and seems to help me focus. By the way, I guess this is what an aural representation (a strange tone poem?) of a ketamine trip would sound like :D</span></p><p>

This doesn't so much drown out my tinnitus as blend with it, but it's still a fantastic change from the usual! I've had tinnitus my entire life, and as a kid, I never understood why people liked silence so much since it was so loud! Weird alien beep-boops is the new silence.</span></p><p>

This is crazy, it actually works. Thankfully my tinnitus is not constant, but very annoying when it's present. It actually makes it disappear, even after I've closed the sound generator, for quite some time.</span></p><p>

This is the first time in a while that I've been able to just sit and be content without that infernal ringing hijacking my thoughts. Definitely not something I'd be able to listen to for longer periods, but it's amazing how well my tinnitus just blends in and becomes a part of the experience.</span></p><p>

I was using this to help me focus because I have really bad tinnitus, and it makes it so hard to focus! As soon as it started playing, it drowned out my tinnitus and made me able to think way better!

Against all odds, it apparently works. I have tested it a couple of times today by playing the audio on headphones for 5-10 minutes, and there is a significant relief in my tinnitus for shorter periods of time. I will try running the audio for a longer time to see if I can have a longer-lasting effect.</span></p><p>

I needed this sound every day in 2022 when I was having major mental issues and anxiety, which created a feedback loop for my tinnitus (tinnitus increased anxiety, anxiety increased tinnitus.) with the help of this sound generator I managed to reduce my anxiety and tinnitus to the point where it's nothing more than a passing thought every now and then, that I come back here to get rid of.

I don't have tinnitus; I have MS. Certain sounds have started to bother me a lot, even waking me up. I can't sleep for longer than 2 hours some nights. It's not fun. I usually have to turn some white noise on loud enough to mask the sounds but that hurts sometimes, and is hard to sleep with. This sound however is pretty weird. I don't have to crank it up loud, and it works. I'm actually sleepy.</span></p><p>

My form of tinnitus is masked by many of your noise generators. I prefer natural sounds, but this did remarkably let me forget the constant, piercing ring in my right ear rather than just mask it.</span></p><p>

Dude thank you, I've had musical ear syndrome since I was a kid, and a life of listening to heavy metal and rock and roll at high volume on headphones and going to shows has made tinnitus worse. Now I get musical ear syndrome all the time, it can be distracting as well a bit concerning but this soundscape cured it instantly. Thank you! This saved me from a mental breakdown.</span></p><p>

Relief from tinnitus, for the first time in years!  I can't handle listening to it for much longer than twenty minutes (because I'm bored by generated noise after a while), but when I take my headphones off, my tinnitus is so massively diminished I can hardly believe it.

Suffering from tinitus for many years, this is helping me tremendously. My tinitus sounds resemble the high pitch noise you get from old TV sets.

I started using MyNoise's ocean sounds years ago to help me sleep due to severe misophonia, it blocks the noise from the street and I don't need to sleep with earplugs or headphones anymore. Recently a covid infection damaged my ear nerves and caused intolerable sound sensitivity accompanied of tinnitus and hyperacusis. If it wasn't for these sound generators I would have lost my sanity.</span></p><p>

I have autism and difficulty focusing. I've never liked listening to things like this generator, but for the first time I quite like this! I love the way that I can hear the sounds travel from each side of my brain. It's pretty awesome to listen to when you've got synesthesia. </span></p><p>

For a few years I've used myNoise to block out the sounds of busy city life and to get to sleep.
More recently in late 2022 I contracted covid which unfortunately left me with hearing damage and significant tinnitus in one ear.
The only thing that has been able to relieve the horrible ringing so far are some of the neuromodulator tracks here, and for that I am grateful. </span></p><p>

As an autistic person with pretty debilitating hyperacusis (I pretty much can't function without ear plugs) the onset of some mild tinnitus was distressing to say the least. White noise is usually the recommended go-to for tinnitus but it's painful to me. High pitched fuzzy or low constant humming sounds are literal agony. This is varied enough to ease and accommodate both issues. Miraculous!</span></p><p>

Well it just works. I get into music stuff lately after a long session of mixing, mastering or drum take your ear just start to deafen sometimes with headaches. I used this as a tool to "reset" my ear by listening to it at a barely heard loudness and turning it down even more after I can hear it clearly, just rinse and repeat!</span></p><p>

Just wanted to add my comment to say that yes, in my experience (loud ~9kHz in left ear) this is more than a placebo effect re: tinnitus relief. HOW exciting. Cheers! Breathing deeper and slower too.</span></p><p>

When getting the automation right, it takes ages for piano or guitar sounds to get repetitive, sounds of nature and human voices (radio chatter etc) sound completely natural, organic, and at home here without feeling repetitive at all. And sci-fi sounds, and drone like instruments can pretty much do their thing forever and play well off of each other while they do it.</span></p><p>

Suffering since 11 months from tinnitus. I destressed my life, did different types of therapy but nothing came close to the effect this neural symphony has. It actually gives me seconds or minutes as close to silence as I wasn't for 11 months. THANK YOU!</span></p><p>

Amazing, always helps when silence is a bit too noisy. My uncle who has bad tinnitus commented that it helped even after a few minutes without headphones... Amazingly helpful in this era of being used to hearing fans, fridges, pinging tech and then ringing noises when it's supposed to be quiet.</span></p><p>

I developed a high pitched whistling tinnitus  10 years ago when I was 14 and I thought I lost the sound of silence forever, but listening to this for 20 minutes on shuffle makes my tinnitus disappear completely!

I can't say if this will work for everyone's tinnitus, but it does for mine! After listening for 20 minutes or so, my tinnitus is much reduced and stays that way for up to two hours afterward. I am interested to see if there is any long-term effect from using this generator daily.</span></p><p>

Thank you so much! My tinnitus began after a concussion 6 years ago. I have no hearing problems, just issues caused by my brain. I found your website, turned on my computer speakers &amp; immediately my neck &amp; shoulders relaxed as the tinnitus decreased significantly. Initially I listened for about 1/2 hour &amp; when I walked away it was much lower volume than before. Best for me on the default setting.</span></p><p>

This generator is completely amazing, if for no other reason it detracts attention away from my tinnitus, which is now chronic for years and years. The Neural Symphony functions are easy to use and adjust. I have discovered that for me I drop all pulses and warble to zero, and then use the automated slider animation. Wide range of high frequencies, ever changing. Bliss.</span></p><p>

This is certainly promising, and I did notice an affect pretty quickly. However, ACRN should be tunable to the frequency of of your tinnitus. The Steve Sequence is kind of all over the place, and mostly tuned lower than my own (6kHz, and pretty common). Would be nice to see something where the frequency can be tuned, and maybe change the waveform (sine, sawtooth, fuzz, etc). [Note from editor : try the Tape Speed Control feature]</span></p><p>

Holy Crap! I was experiencing on of my usual Tinnitus spikes (and you know how annoying this can be). I tried this custom noise take from one of the testimonials and my tinnitus just went down from 10 to 4! Thanks!</span></p><p>

Brilliant site I could spend hours here.  I have tinnitus  a different high pitched frequency in each ear.Slightly spacey space-station? A little dreamy but a little sedating as well and kills the tinnitus.</span></p><p>

This is a very strange soundscape, but in an enjoyable way. I personally do not have tinnitus, but I think this is still fun to listen to. You just have to find the right sliders to make sense of this one, hahaha.</span></p><p>

I have Tinnitus. I also have perfect hearing and from years of being a musician one would anticipate hearing loss. None. I am also a Director for an electric and water utility and I have a lot of concentrating work (reports, analysis, etc). When My Tinnitus is in full flight, it is impossible to concentrate. This is a life saver. I can work all day and feel the calming of the tones. Amazing! </span></p><p>

May be my imagination, listened for about 15 min,  then when taking my speakers away from my ears, my pulsating tinnitus was quieter.</span></p><p>

First I found myself heaving a relieved sigh, and then started crying when I found the custom noise that masked my tinnitus. It has been five months of unrelenting high pitched whine, yet I refused to allow myself a pity party, concluding, "It is what it is; suck it up, girl, there is little you can do." But to have this respite is a great blessing. Thank you! </span></p><p>

Kudos to all who put this wonderful chaotic neural symphony together!  As a tinnitus sufferer I found the sounds had a very soothing effect on me.   I will be using this selection again for sure.</span></p><p>

I noticed listening to  music with different frequencies helps soften my Tinnitus. I have a constant 24/7 14,000hz sawtooth sound in my head for the two years.  This program is amazing!   </span></p><p>

Not for me. Sounds more like star wars. What really helps me is a soft noise plug. Stick in the ear canal and when the sounds starts bothering switch to other ear. This is the only thing that helps me.</span></p><p>

I have been listening to music with MY Tinnitus frequency embedded into the music. I understand this works for some, not me. After over 6 months, no change. The past two days have been horrible... I am a musician and although I have been playing rock music for over 40 years, I have no hearing damage at all... 20 minutes on customizing my own pattern, I can actually concentrate on my work!</span></p><p>

Thank you so much for this incredible site!  I'm quite happy to make a donation to you out of simple gratitude for all your efforts putting these sounds online for us, and keeping the site (and your iOS app, myNoise) working.  I've experienced persistent tinnitus for a couple decades, now, with almost no respite except after one minutes or so of "Neural Hack" or "Neural Symphony!" Amazing!</span></p><p>

I'm a fairly new comer to myNoise having serendipitously discovered the site only three weeks ago and a very long sufferer of Tinnitus. I have only discovered this particular generator only moments ago and jumped right in to listen. Ironically, I've been having episodes all week so I'll absolutely write the results of my experience after one week and again at two weeks. Today is 8 June '16 </span></p><p>

Something very weird happens if I listen to this for 15-20 minutes: in addition to the tinnitus masking, my mind actually "quiets down". The parts of my brain that would normally be wandering seem to be occupied chasing down the bells and warbles, allowing the rest of my attention to focus entirely on the task at hand. Awesome brain hack.</span></p><p>

I don't have tinnitus, but I find myself enjoying the bizarre dreamlike discord that using the animation sliders can provide. It's a rather lovely chiming chaos... that is weirdly calming to me. I'm not sure what that says :)</span></p><p>

I guess I am fortunate that I only get ringing in my ears when I take certain prescription medications  I can't believe my luck that a few hours after I took the medication I started to get the ringing and came here to find some rain sounds and discovered this new generator.  What a gift this is!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Luxury goods are special: they are scarce and expensive, and they earn us status with some folks because it shows that we paid more than we needed to.</p>



<p>Luxury isn’t about quality, suitability or performance. Luxury isn’t a more accurate watch or a faster processor. Luxury is a marker that we can afford to do something others might consider wasteful.</p>



<p>A Birkin bag is a luxury good, and so is reading an entire non-fiction book, listening to a public radio broadcast or attending a concert when we could stay at home and listen for free.</p>



<p>By ‘wasting’ our attention on nuance, narrative, experiences and everything except the checkbox takeaway, we’re sending a message to ourselves and others. A message about allocating our time to something beyond optimized performance or survival.</p>



<p>If you’ve signed up to offer an attention-luxury good, you undermine it when you also try to make it quick and convenient.</p>

<p>ripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,<br>
some minor performance improvements and minor new features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search<br>
tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.<br>
By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip<br>
hidden files/directories and binary files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes<br>
a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent<br>
directories.</li>
<li>A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been<br>
fixed.</li>
<li><code>rg -vf file</code>, where <code>file</code> is empty, now matches everything.</li>
<li>The <code>-r/--replace</code> flag now works with <code>--json</code>.</li>
<li>A subset of Jujutsu (<code>jj</code>) repositories are now treated as if they were git<br>
repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect <code>jj</code>'s gitignores.</li>
<li>Globs can now use nested curly braces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Platform support:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aarch64</code> for Windows now has release artifacts.</li>
<li><code>powerpc64</code> no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI<br>
release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to<br>
debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it<br>
back.</li>
<li>ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice<br>
small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary<br>
size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance improvements:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Today, I will be talking about some of the common and high impact SQL anti-patterns I have seen from experience that can make queries and pipelines difficult to maintain, or have slower than expected performance. These issues can compound, causing erosion in trust in data, and slower query development in general.</p><p>When working with larger enterprise software, it is common to have large CASE WHEN statements translating application status codes into plain English. For example, status code 1 could mean the item is out of stock. Now imagine there are hundreds of status codes that need to be categorized after talking to a stakeholder who requested a dashboard to track item statuses in your warehouse.</p><p>Because you need to get this dashboard developed quickly, you decide to place this large CASE WHEN logic only within a view for that specific dashboard. This is an anti-pattern because now other developers will either have to copy and paste your logic or skip it entirely and use the raw status codes. Over time, this creates a huge mess. I know because I have seen it happen.</p><p>When handling large CASE WHEN statements, it is better to create a dimension table or view, ideally sourced from the landed table where the original status column is populated. This way, the logic is accessible and consistent for everyone.</p><p>In SQL server especially, it’s pretty easy to work against the index if you are not careful. </p><p>For example: WHERE UPPER(name) = ‘ABC’</p><p>Instead you should:</p><ul><li><p>query WHERE name = ‘abc’</p></li><li><p>create an indexed UPPER(name) column</p></li></ul><p>This allows the database to leverage indexes properly and prevents unnecessary full table scans.</p><p>When developing views, it is tempting to slap a SELECT * at the very end and call it a day. This is not ideal because:</p><ul><li><p>Schema evolution can break your view, which can have downstream effects</p></li><li><p>You are bringing in unnecessary columns potentially </p></li></ul><p>One of the most common mistakes I’ve seen is developers using SELECT DISTINCT as a quick way to eliminate duplicates that appear after a bad join. It’s an easy fix, but it hides a deeper problem. Usually, the duplicates exist because the join condition is incomplete or the relationship between tables isn’t truly one-to-one. Using DISTINCT might make the results look right temporarily, but it masks the root cause. This becomes a nightmare when someone later builds metrics off the same dataset and gets inconsistent counts. The correct approach is to fix the join logic itself, ensuring each relationship is properly defined before aggregation or reporting.</p><p>In larger data environments, it’s easy to fall into the trap of layering views on top of views. At first, this seems modular and organized. But over time, as more teams build their own transformations on top of existing views, the dependency chain becomes unmanageable. Performance slows down because the database has to expand multiple layers of logic each time, and debugging turns into an archaeological dig through nested queries. The fix is to flatten transformations periodically and materialize heavy logic into clean, well-defined base views or tables.</p><p>Nested subqueries are useful when you need to isolate logic or filter data when starting out on a query, but they can quickly turn into an anti-pattern when overused or deeply nested. I’ve seen queries with three or four layers of subqueries, each one filtering or aggregating the results of the previous one, totaling over 5000 lines of code. As you can imagine, this makes debugging queries pretty difficult. You should consider using CTEs instead, as they tend to be more readable.</p><p>SQL is one of those languages that looks simple on the surface but grows in complexity as teams and systems scale. Most anti-patterns don’t start as bad ideas. They come from speed, deadlines, or small shortcuts that accumulate over time. The best teams treat SQL like production code: shared, versioned, reviewed, and optimized. A few minutes spent designing for clarity upfront can save hours of rework and confusion later.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I grew up learning to program in the late 1980s / early 1990s. Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.</p><p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today—yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.</p><p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on “bloat”. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.</p><p>In the 1990s, almost every DOS program you ran had a full-screen Text User Interface (TUI) which sported text-based windows, drop shadows, colors, and mouse support.

However, they were all so similar in how they looked like—80x25 characters didn’t leave much room for uniqueness—and how they worked that the differences didn’t really get in the way of usability and discoverability. Once you learned that the Alt key opened the menus and that Tab moved across input fields and buttons, you could navigate almost any program with ease.</p><p><span>But let’s talk about editors. MS-DOS shipped with a TUI text editor since version 5 (1991), which </span><a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows" rel="">I previously covered in a recent article</a><span> and is shown above. This editor “worked”, but it was really inconvenient for coding: you needed to exit the editor to compile and run your code, and when you re-ran the editor, you’d have to navigate back to where you were before.</span></p><p><span>“In my house”, we used something called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Sidekick" rel="">SideKick Plus</a><span> (1984), which wasn’t really a code editor: it was more of a Personal Information Management (PIM) system with a built-in notepad. The cool thing about it, however, was that it was a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program, which meant that it loaded in the background and you could bring it up at any time by pressing Ctrl+Alt.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png" width="1264" height="948" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:948,&quot;width&quot;:1264,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:65113,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qruF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e3c2211-437b-4e17-b24f-8ebbc7eb53eb_1264x948.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>SideKick Plus' main screen after pressing Ctrl+Alt to bring it up.

Turbo Pascal 1.0 (1983) shows the beginning of an integrated experience, although it did not feature its iconic TUI yet. QuickBASIC 2.0 (1986) shows more of a “traditional” TUI (the same as </span><code>EDIT.COM</code><span>, because they are the same editor), and MS-DOS 5 came with QBasic, a reduced version of QuickBASIC that didn’t allow compiling to native code but that had the same look.</span></p><p>The crown jewel of IDEs, in my opinion, were the later Borland Turbo series, which included Turbo C++ (1990), Turbo Assembler and Turbo Pascal. These IDEs were language specific, but they had full-screen TUIs and were extremely powerful.</p><p>Here, take a look at what we had.

printf.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Remember: all of this in the early 1990s—a little over 30 years ago at the time of this writing.</p><p><span>I was an avid user of Turbo C++, with which I learned a lot. I remember using their </span><code>conio.h</code><span> libraries to implement TUIs of my own, and then their builtin </span><code>graphics.h</code><span> libraries to play with implementing GUIs. And note: this was </span><em>without the Internet</em><span>. There was no option for many to just “look up how things worked” in Stack Overflow: the IDE had to be discoverable right away (which it was) and self-contained to offer you a complete development experience.</span></p><p>Now take a moment to compare this scene with Linux in the early 1990s.</p><p><span>In Linux, almost every program was </span><em>also</em><span> text based, but those programs did not come with a full-screen TUI. It just wasn’t “the Unix way”. I remember watching the X11 configuration tool (</span><code>XF86Setup</code><span>) or the OpenBSD installer and feeling shocked by how simplistic those were: me, a young teenager with barely any “real” coding experience, had written better-looking programs already.</span></p><p><span>In any case, this didn’t stop me from my quest to </span><em>not</em><span> use Windows. I continued to learn the ways of Linux and soon faced the “best” editors recommended by every book and community online: Vim and Emacs. And I could not understand why they were praised. Using these was like stepping back into the past. They were full-screen programs indeed, but they seemed pretty arcane. Vim did have syntax highlighting but it was far from being an IDE. Emacs could be configured to integrate with some code assisting features and the like, but it was far from being “fire and forget” like the Turbo family of IDEs.</span></p><p><span>Just look at the default Emacs configuration </span><em>today</em><span>, which hasn’t changed much (if at all) since then. It does have windows, but they aren’t decorated. It didn’t have colors (and now barely has), because why? It didn’t use to have mouse support. It </span><em>does</em><span> have a menu bar though, but it is just a gimmick? If you press M-` as the instructions tell you, you face a truly strange interface to navigate the menu—which makes one wonder why they even bothered to waste a full line of screen real state to show a menu bar that does nothing.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png" width="973" height="650" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:650,&quot;width&quot;:973,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:127463,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wWzZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7d6424f-498d-4ded-94d6-76cd5205d563_973x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A fresh installation of Emacs in the console, with the standard welcome screen in the background and the "menu" open after pressing M-`.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now try giving this to anyone with little coding experience and getting them to create, compile, and debug a program.

In fact, it feels like during these 30 years, we regressed in many ways, and only now are reaching feature parity with some of the features we used to have.</span></p><p><span>It is natural that TUIs diminished in popularity once graphical OSes gained traction, and it is somewhat interesting that they are making a comeback just now. As for why, I think we have to thank the invention of </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="">LSP</a><span> for most of the recent progress in this area. TUI editors were “on hold” for many years because building IDE features for them was a lot of effort and their small maintainer base could not afford to implement them. LSP unlocked access to existing language-specific integrations and reinfused interest in the old-and-trusty Vim and Emacs. Hopefully, the upcoming </span><a href="https://build-server-protocol.github.io/" rel="">BSP</a><span> will do even more to make these TUIs more IDE-like.</span></p><p>It is fair to ask “Who cares? Every desktop and laptop runs a graphical OS now!”</p><p><span>And it’s a good question. In general, you probably </span><em>don’t</em><span> want a TUI IDE. If VSCode is your jam, its remoting abilities are superb and VSCode has a reasonably good graphical interface without being a full-blown IDE. But there are a few things that VSCode doesn’t give us.</span></p><p><span>The first is that a TUI IDE is excellent for work on remote machines—even better than VSCode. You can SSH into </span><em>any</em><span> machine with ease and launch the IDE. </span><a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html" rel="">Combine it with tmux and you get “full” multitasking.</a><span> Yes, you could instead use a remote desktop client instead of SSH, but I’ve always found them clunky due to lag and the improper integration with the local desktop shortcuts.</span></p><p><span>The second is that </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">VSCode’s remote extensions are </a><em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">not</a></em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel=""> open source</a><span>, which isn’t a major problem… except for the fact that they don’t work on, say, FreeBSD and there is no way to fix them. So this makes it impossible for me to remote into my primary development server with VSCode.</span></p><p>And the third is… reduced resource consumption.</p><p>I can’t leave without ranting about “bloat” for a little bit. Borland Turbo C++, with all its bells and whistles (the UI, the C++ toolchain, the integrated manuals…), is less than 9 MB after installation and ran within 640kb of RAM.</p><p>For comparison, Helix is 16 MB on disk, which is pretty impressive (and honestly unexpected), but Doom Emacs is about 500 MBs and consumes many MBs of RAM. Note, however, that none of these numbers account for the language toolchains or help systems, and toolchains nowadays rank in the GBs of disk space.</p><p>To get “real” IDEs, we have to jump to graphical programs like IntelliJ or VSCode. VSCode, for example, is about 350 MBs on disk (surprisingly less than Doom Emacs) but it will eat your computer for lunch: it’s Electron after all. I have noticed very significant savings in laptop battery life by dropping VSCode and moving to Doom Emacs.</p><p><span>So the question I want to part with is: have we advanced </span><em>much</em><span> in 30 years? Modern IDEs have some better refactoring tools, better features, and support more languages, but fundamentally… they haven’t changed much. The only major difference that we are </span><em>starting</em><span> to see might be AI-assisted coding, but this is a feature mostly provided by a remote service, not even by the installed code!</span></p><p><span>And that’s all for today. On my side, I’ll happily continue using </span><em>all of</em><span> Doom Emacs, Vim, VSCode, and IntelliJ depending on the situation. Merry Christmas if this is your thing!</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This repository contains an Arduino-Library to create a StageConnect device (subordinated node-device as well as controlling main-device) using AnalogDevices AD242x-ICs like the AD2428.</p>
<p dir="auto">StageConnect is based on the automotive A²B and is used to connect the Behringer WING to the Midas DP48, for instance. Analog Devices <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/solutions/a2b-audio-bus.html" rel="nofollow">A²B audio</a> bus is used as the technology basis and uses simple XLR connectors between two devices to transmit 32 channels of uncompressed 48kHz 32bit audio.</p>
<p dir="auto">A StageConnect/A2B main-device uses a virtual I2C-connection through the A2B-link that is routed via the AD242x-IC to the Arduino microcontroller.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Include the main-library as well as the I2C-Wrapper-Class, instantiate both classes and setup the Wire-library:</p>

<p dir="auto">stageConnect.update() should be then called every 100ms.</p>
<p dir="auto">Have a look into the example-sketch to learn how to use the callbacks and the mailbox-system to receive channel-names from the host-device.</p>
<p dir="auto">For electrical connection have a look at the following picture showing the connection with the AD2428MINI evaluation board:

<p dir="auto">Analog Devices suggests cable-length of up to 15 meters, while Behringer allows longer cables. The filter-network of the AD242x-chips is quite tricky and needs caution on adjusting the hardware-parameters. Use the schematics of the AD2428MINI as a reference.</p>
<p dir="auto">Read the files in the folder "Documentation" for more information about the configuration-options and technical details regarding the brand- and product-ID as well as the specific commands for the mailbox-system.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please use brand-IDs above 0x80 to prevent interference with other products.</p>

This is an APU designed to be a true all-in-one mobile processor, able to handle high end CPU and GPU workloads without compromise. Offering a TDP range of 55W to 120W, the chip targets a far higher power envelope compared to standard Strix Point, but eschews the need for dedicated graphics.</p><p>To get y’all all caught up on the history and specifications of this APU, AMD first announced Strix Halo at CES 2025 earlier this year to much fanfare. Strix Halo is AMD’s first chiplet APU in the consumer market with AMD using Strix Halo as a bit of a show piece for what both CPU and GPU performance can look like with a sufficiently large APU.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png" width="393" height="330" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:330,&quot;width&quot;:393,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-bvE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9060b1d-2fda-47a7-8bb8-2fd447f602d0_393x330.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>AMD’s Strix Halo can be equipped with dual 8 core Zen 5 CCDs for a total of 16 cores that feature the same 512b FPU as the desktop parts. This is a change from the more mainstream and monolithic Strix Point APU which has “double-pumped” 256b FPUs similar to Zen 4 for use with AVX512 code. What is similar to the more mainstream Strix Point is the same 5.1GHz max boost clock which is a 600MHz deficit compared to the desktop flagship Zen 5 CPU, the Ryzen 9 9950X.</p><p>Moving to the 3rd die on a Strix Halo package, a RDNA 3.5 iGPU takes up the majority of the SoC die with 40 compute units, 32MB of Infinity Cache, and a boost clock of up to 2.9GHz placing raw compute capability somewhere between the RX 7600 XT and RX 7700.</p><p>To feed this chip, AMD has equipped Strix Halo with a 256b LPDDR5X-8000 memory bus, which provides up to 256GB/s shared between all of the components. This is slightly lower than the 288GB/s available to the RX 7600 XT but is much higher than any other APU we have tested.</p><p><span>A massive thank you to both </span><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">Asus</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/zbook-ultra.html" rel="">HP</a><span> for sending over a </span><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">ROG Flow Z13 (2025)</a><span> and a </span><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/zbook-ultra.html" rel="">ZBook Ultra G1a 14”</a><span> for testing which were both equipped with an </span><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html" rel="">AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395</a><span>.

However, as you can see the CPU does not have access to the 32MB of Infinity Cache on the IO die.

with reads being no slouch at 124GB/s across both CCDs.</p><p>However, looking at the bandwidth of a single CCD and just like the desktop CPUs a single Strix-Halo CCD only has a 32 byte per cycle read link to the IO die. And just like the desktop chips, the chip to chip link runs at ~2000MHz, which caps out the single CCD read at 64GB/s. Unlike the desktop chips, the write link is 32 bytes per cycle and we are seeing about 43GB/s for the write bandwidth. That brings the total theoretical single CCD bandwidth to 128GB/s and the observed bandwidth is just over 103GB/s.</p><p>The performance of Strix Halo’s CPU packs quite a bit more of a punch than Strix Point’s CPU.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png" width="702" height="466" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:466,&quot;width&quot;:702,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z6Dv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69ab58b0-4d2e-4427-a4f7-8bd2ade7f177_702x466.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Strix Halo’s CPU can match a last generation desktop flagship CPU, the 7950X, in Integer performance despite a 11.7% clock speed delta.

Overall the two provide a comparable experience in Cyberpunk 2077, with changes in settings or power limits adjusting the lead between the two. This is a seriously impressive turnaround for an iGPU working against dedicated graphics, and demonstrates the versatility of the chip in workloads like gaming, where iGPU’s have traditionally struggled.</p><p>Strix Halo follows in the footsteps of many other companies in the goal of designing an SoC for desktop and laptop usage that is truly all encompassing. The CPU and GPU performance is truly a class above standard low power laptop chips, and is even able to compete with larger systems boasting dedicated graphics. CPU performance is especially impressive with a comparable showing to the desktop Zen 5 CPUs. GPU performance is comparable to mid range dedicated graphics, while still offering the efficiency and integration of an iGPU. High end dedicated graphics still have a place above Strix Halo, but the versatility of this design for smaller form factor devices is class leading.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png" width="1456" height="917" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:917,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SrML!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff3e47456-dd28-42b7-90b6-4d2415364c5e_1600x1008.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/" rel="">Asus ROG Flow Z13 2025</a><span> which is a very similar form factor to the Microsoft Surface but has a Strix Halo inside of it instead of a lower power Intel chip.

I was hoping to have a section dedicated to the ML performance of Strix Halo in this article, however AMD only just released preview support for Strix Halo in the ROCm 7.0.2 release which came out about a week ago from time of publication. As a result of the long delay between the launch of Strix Halo and the release of ROCm 7.0.2, the ML performance will have to wait until a future article.</p><p>However, putting aside ROCm, Strix Halo is a very, very cool piece of technology and I would love to see successors to Strix Halo with newer CPU and GPU IP and possibly even larger memory buses similar to Apple’s Max and Ultra series of SoCs with 512b and 1024b memory respectively. AMD has a formula for building bigger APUs with Strix Halo, which opens the door to a lot of interesting hardware possibilities in the future.</p><p><span>If you like the content then consider heading over to the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese" rel="">Patreon</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ" rel="">PayPal</a><span> if you want to toss a few bucks to Chips and Cheese.

<p>Law enforcement agencies will soon have easier access to footage captured by Amazon’s Ring smart cameras. In a partnership announced this week, Amazon will allow approximately 5,000 local law enforcement agencies to request access to Ring camera footage via surveillance platforms from <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/">Flock Safety</a>. Ring cooperating with law enforcement and the reported use of Flock technologies by federal agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has resurfaced privacy concerns that have followed the devices for years.</p>
<p>According to Flock’s announcement, its Ring partnership allows local law enforcement members to use Flock software “to send a direct post in the Ring Neighbors app with details about the investigation and request voluntary assistance.” Requests must include “specific location and timeframe of the incident, a unique investigation code, and details about what is being investigated,” and users can look at the requests anonymously, Flock said.</p>
<p>“Any footage a Ring customer chooses to submit will be securely packaged by Flock and shared directly with the requesting local public safety agency through the FlockOS or Flock Nova platform,” the announcement reads.</p>
<p>Flock said its local law enforcement users will gain access to Ring Community Requests in “the coming months.”</p>
<h2>A flock of privacy concerns</h2>
<p>Outside its software platforms, Flock is known for <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/ebooks/license-plate-reader-cameras-overview">license plate recognition cameras</a>. Flock customers can also <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/products/flock-freeform#:~:text=Most%20tools%20rely%20on%20rigid,to%20find%20visual%20matches%20instantly.'">search</a> footage from Flock cameras using descriptors to find people, such as “man in blue shirt and cowboy hat.” Besides law enforcement agencies, Flock says 6,000 communities and 1,000 businesses use their products.</p>
<p>For years, privacy advocates have warned against companies like Flock.</p>
<p>This week, US Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent a letter <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wyden_letter_to_flock.pdf">[PDF]</a> to Flock CEO Garrett Langley saying that ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Secret Service, and the US Navy’s Criminal Investigative Service have had access to footage from Flock’s license plate cameras.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“I now believe that abuses of your product are not only likely but inevitable and that Flock is unable and uninterested in preventing them,” Wyden wrote.</p>
<p>In August, Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst for the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup">wrote</a> that “Flock is building a dangerous, nationwide mass-surveillance infrastructure.” Stanley pointed to <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/">ICE using</a> Flock’s network of cameras, as well as Flock’s efforts to build a <a href="https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/">people lookup tool</a> with data brokers.</p>
<p>Matthew Guariglia, senior policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), told Ars via email that Flock is a “mass surveillance tool” that “has increasingly been used to spy on both immigrants and people exercising their First Amendment-protected rights.”</p>
<p>Flock has earned this reputation among privacy advocates through its own cameras, not Ring’s.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told Ars Technica that only local public safety agencies will be able to make Community Requests via Flock software, and that requests will also show the name of the agency making the request.</p>
<p>A Flock spokesperson told Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>Flock does not currently have any contracts with any division of [the US Department of Homeland Security], including ICE. The Ring Community Requests process through Flock is only available for local public safety agencies for specific, active investigations. All requests are time and geographically-bound. Ring users can choose to share relevant footage or ignore the request.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flock’s rep added that all activity within FlockOS and Flock Nova is “permanently recorded in a comprehensive CJIS-compliant audit trail for unalterable custody tracking,” referring to a set of standards created by the FBI’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis">Criminal Justice Information Services</a> division.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But there’s still concern that federal agencies will end up accessing Ring footage through Flock. Guariglia told Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even without formal partnerships with federal authorities, data from these surveillance companies flow to agencies like ICE through local law enforcement. Local and state police have run more than 4,000 Flock searches on behalf of federal authorities or with a potential immigration focus,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1760807427153000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c_dUFIaqOJutylG4zjHu0">reporting has found</a>. Additionally, just this month, it became clear that Texas police searched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flock-safety-and-texas-sheriff-claimed-license-plate-search-was-missing-person-it&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1760807427153000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0I2Yt8eYfc6vO0usQ4AwxA">83,000 Flock cameras</a> in an attempt to prosecute a woman for her abortion and then tried to cover it up.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ring cozies up to the law</h2>
<p>This week’s announcement shows Amazon, which acquired Ring in 2018, increasingly positioning its consumer cameras as a law enforcement tool. After years of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cops-offering-ring-doorbell-cameras-for-information/">cops using Ring footage</a>, Amazon last year said that it would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/amazon-ring-stops-letting-cops-get-doorbell-footage-without-a-warrant/">stop letting police request Ring footage</a>—unless it was an “emergency”—only to reverse course about 18 months later by allowing police to request Ring footage through a Flock rival, <a href="https://www.axon.com/newsroom/press-releases/axon-announces-new-fixed-ALPR-camera-solutions-and-next-gen-AI-advancements-to-expand-real-time-public-safety-ecosystem">Axon</a>.</p>
<p>While announcing Ring’s deals with Flock and Axon, Ring founder and CEO Jamie Siminoff claimed that the partnerships would help Ring cameras keep neighborhoods safe. But there’s doubt as to whether people buy Ring cameras to protect their neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Ring’s new partnership with Flock shows that the company is more interested in contributing to mounting authoritarianism than servicing the specific needs of their customers,” Guariglia told Ars.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ring initiated conversations about a deal with Flock, Langely told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/amazon-ring-cameras-surveillance-law-enforcement-crime-police-investigations.html">CNBC</a>.</p>
<p>Flock says that its cameras don’t use facial recognition, which has been criticized for <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/unmasking-bias-facial-recognition-algorithms">racial biases</a>. But local law enforcement agencies using Flock will soon have access to footage from Ring cameras with facial recognition. In a conversation with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/03/amazon-ring-doorbell-facial-recognition-pricacy/">The Washington Post</a> this month, Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the consumer advocacy and policy group Electronic Privacy Information Center, described the new feature for Ring cameras as “invasive for anyone who walks within range of” a Ring doorbell, since they likely haven’t consented to facial recognition being used on them.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Amazon, for its part, has mostly pushed the burden of ensuring responsible facial recognition use to its customers. Schroeder shared concern with the Post that Ring’s facial recognition data could end up being shared with law enforcement.</p>
<p>Some people who are perturbed about Ring deepening its ties with law enforcement have complained online.</p>
<p>“Inviting big brother into the system. Screw that,” a user on the Ring subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/1o8jl9u/amazons_ring_to_partner_with_flock_a_network_of/">said</a> this week.</p>
<p>Another Reddit user said: “And… I’m gone. Nope, NO WAY IN HELL. Goodbye, Ring. I’ll be switching to a UniFi[-brand] system with 100 percent local storage. You don’t get my money any more. This is some <em>1984</em> BS …”</p>
<p>Privacy concerns are also exacerbated by Ring’s past, as the company has previously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/ring-used-parties-swag-to-build-700-police-partnerships-report-finds/">failed to meet users’ privacy expectations</a>. In 2023, Ring agreed to pay $5.8 million to settle claims that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/ftc-amazon-ring-workers-illegally-spied-on-users-of-home-security-cameras/">employees illegally spied on Ring customers</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon and Flock say their collaboration will only involve voluntary customers and local enforcement agencies. But there’s still reason to be concerned about the implications of people sending doorbell and personal camera footage to law enforcement via platforms that are reportedly widely used by federal agencies for deportation purposes. Combined with the privacy issues that Ring has already faced for years, it’s not hard to see why some feel that Amazon scaling up Ring’s association with any type of law enforcement is unacceptable.</p>
<p>And it appears that Amazon and Flock would both like Ring customers to opt in when possible.</p>
<p>“It will be turned on for free for every customer, and I think all of them will use it,” Langely told CNBC.</p>

                    <p>Forget that! Who would ever want to put in all of that effort to understand what they're building? Just open up your browser and type "make me a website" into Claude or ChatGPT, and you're on your way! There are hundreds of identical prompts to choose from, but go ahead and use the same exact one everyone else uses, paste the output without reading it, and you're done! No one will notice that every AI-coded site looks identical! Plus you get to argue on Twitter about whether "prompt engineering" counts as real programming!</p>

                    <p>Here's my contact info because that's what Claude suggested when I prompted "make me a website". Can't wait for all the recruiters asking if I "really know how to code" or if I just prompt stuff. Of course I know how to code! I can write a mean ChatGPT prompt!</p>
                    <p>This site was built in 5 minutes by asking Claude "make me a website" and I'm very proud of myself.</p>
                    <p>No, I did not read any of the code. Yes, it works. No, I cannot explain how. Yes, I will put "Full Stack Developer" on my resume.</p>

<p dir="auto">WebMCP allows websites to share tools, resources, prompts, etc. to LLMs. In other words, WebMCP allows a website to be an MCP server. No sharing API Keys. Use any model you want.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://webmcp.dev/" rel="nofollow">Here's a simple website I built that is WebMCP-enabled</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It comes in the form of a widget that a website owner can put on their site and expose tools to give client-side LLMs what they need to provide a great UX for the user or agent.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>The look, feel, how it's used, and security are all absolutely open for contribution / constructive criticism. MCP Clients directly building WebMCP functionality seems like an ideal outcome.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">An end-user can connect to any number of websites at a time - and tools are "scoped" (by name) based on the domain to simplify organization.</p>

<p dir="auto">When you're ready to connect to a website, you can ask your model to generate you an mcp token.</p>
<p dir="auto">Copy the token and paste it to the website's input. As soon as the website registers with it, it's thrown away and cannot be used for subsequent registrations or anything else. The website will receive its own session token for making requests.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd rather your model / service never see the token, you can manually execute <code>npx @jason.today/webmcp --new</code> instead.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some MCP clients, including Claude Desktop, need to be restarted to get access to new tools. (at least at time of writing)</p>
<p dir="auto">To disconnect, you can close the browser tab, click "disconnect", or shut down the server with <code>npx @jason.today/webmcp -q</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The bridge between the MCP client and the website is a localhost-only (not accessible to requests outside your computer) websocket server. Because it is configured to allow requests from your local web browser, authentication / token exchange is required, in case you visit a website attempting to abuse this.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Ideally the web browser itself would have an explicit permission for this, like webcam or microphone use.</em></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The MCP client connects to the <code>/mcp</code> path using the server token from <code>.env</code> (auto-generated)</li>
<li>The server generates a registration token (instigated via the built-in mcp tool by a model or the <code>--new</code> command)</li>
<li>Web clients connect to the <code>/register</code> endpoint with this token and its domain.</li>
<li>Web pages connect to their assigned channel based on their domain.</li>
<li>When an LLM wants to use a tool / resource / prompt, the request flows from:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>MCP Client → MCP Server → WebSocket Server → Web Page with the tool / resource / prompt</li>
<li>(similar for requesting a list of tools / resources / prompts)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The web page performs the request (e.g. call tool) and sends the result back through the same path</li>
<li>Multiple web pages can be connected simultaneously, each with their own set of tools and tokens</li>
<li>The MCP client sees all tools as a unified list, with channel prefixes to avoid name collisions</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">There is a <code>Dockerfile</code> specifically for Smithery deployment.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you'd like to use docker to run the websocket server, I've added a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto">If <code>--docker</code> is provided to the mcp client config alongside <code>--mcp</code>, it will assume the server is running. This will allow you to dockerize the main process (websocket server), and your mcp client will connect to your docker container via websocket. Similarly, websites will communicate with your docker container.</p>

    <p>I don’t want to mislead anyone here. This corner of the website—“New Stuff”—is not a resurrection of <em>The Far Side</em> daily cartoons. (Well, not exactly, anyway—like the proverbial tiger and its stripes, I’m pretty much stuck with my sense of humor. Aren’t we all?) The thing is, I <em>thoroughly</em> enjoyed my career as a syndicated cartoonist, and I hope, in spirit at least, we had some laughs together. But after fifteen years of meeting deadlines, well, blah blah blah … you know the rest. The day after I retired from syndication, it felt good <em>not</em> to draw on a deadline. And after moving on to other interests, drawing just wasn’t on my to-do list. Things change. But then a few years ago—and returning to the subject at hand—­something happened in my life, and it started with a clogged pen.</p>
    <p>Despite my retirement, I still had intermittent connections to cartooning, including my wife’s and my personal Christmas card. Once a year, I’d sit myself down to take on Santa, and every year it began with the same ritual: me cursing at, and then cleaning out, my clogged pen. (Apparently, the concept of cleaning it before putting it away each year was just too elusive for me.) As problems go, this is admittedly not exactly on the scale of global warming, but in the small world of my studio, it was cataclysmic. Okay, highly annoying.</p>
    <p>So a few years ago—finally fed up with my once-loyal but now reliably traitorous pen—I decided to try a digital tablet. I knew nothing about these devices but hoped it would just get me through my annual Christmas card ordeal. I got one, fired it up, and lo and behold, something totally unexpected happened: within moments, I was having fun drawing again. I was stunned at all the tools the thing offered, all the creative potential it contained. I simply had no idea how far these things had evolved. Perhaps fittingly, the first thing I drew was a caveman.</p>
    <p>The “New Stuff” that you’ll see here is the result of my journey into the world of digital art. Believe me, this has been a bit of a learning curve for me. I hail from a world of pen and ink, and suddenly I was feeling like I was sitting at the controls of a 747. (True, I don’t get out much.) But as overwhelmed as I was, there was still something familiar there—a sense of adventure. That had always been at the core of what I enjoyed most when I was drawing <em>The Far Side</em>, that sense of exploring, reaching for something, taking some risks, sometimes hitting a home run and sometimes coming up with “Cow tools.” (Let’s not get into that.) But as a jazz teacher once said to me about improvisation, “You want to try and take people somewhere where they might not have been before.” I think that my approach to cartooning was similar—I’m just not sure if even <em>I</em> knew where I was going. But I was having fun.</p>
    <p>So here goes. I’ve got my coffee, I’ve got this cool gizmo, and I’ve got no deadlines. And—to borrow from Sherlock Holmes—the game is afoot.</p>
    <p>Again, please remember, I’m just exploring, experimenting, and trying stuff. New Stuff. I have just one last thing to say before I go: thank <em>you</em>, clogged pen.</p>

The recent collapses of Tricolor, a used car seller and sub-prime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto parts supplier, have put the finance industry on edge, almost two decades after problems in the sub-prime mortgage lending market set the stage for the global financial crisis.</p><p>“When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase CEO, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/14/jp-morgan-jamie-dimon-losses-private-credit-sector" data-link-name="in body link">ominously cautioned analysts</a> this week, after the US’s largest bank disclosed a $170m charge tied to Tricolor’s bankruptcy. “Everyone should be forewarned on this one.”</p><p>As the car lending market shows signs of strain, business around repossessions is booming. “Right now, we’re overwhelmed with work,” George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, Michigan, said.</p><figure id="1dff80fa-3f0c-40ee-8c10-c2cb38476e3c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;JP Morgan boss says more ‘cockroaches’ will emerge after private credit sector failures&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;1dff80fa-3f0c-40ee-8c10-c2cb38476e3c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/14/jp-morgan-jamie-dimon-losses-private-credit-sector&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The so-called repo man, tasked with recovering vehicles from drivers who default on loan agreements, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj1x5LejAuM&amp;list=RDlj1x5LejAuM&amp;start_radio=1" data-link-name="in body link">eulogized in music by Bruce Springsteen</a> and in the 1984 Alex Cox film Repo Man.</p><p>Repossessions – especially in the sub-prime auto market – are on the rise, according to Badeen, who is also president of the Allied Finance Adjusters trade body. “We’ve seen some sub-primes making changes, which probably indicates they’re having issues,” he said. “They’re not financing cars like they were. Two years ago they were financing anybody.”</p><p>While few are bracing for a crisis on the scale of the crash that pushed the world economy to the brink in 2008 – sub-prime auto lending is a fraction of the $1.7tn overall car lending business – the collapses of Tricolor and First Brands have drawn the car sector into the spotlight, amid fears they highlight credit stress in lower-income households, as well as problems in credit markets tied to auto debt.</p><p>First Brands received approval for $500m rescue financing from a bankruptcy court, although Scott Greenberg, an attorney for First Brand’s lenders, told the court of concerns that they could be “lending good money after bad”.</p><p>The wider fear – and the one causing consternation among investors – is what the troubles inside this one market might indicate about broader pressures rippling throughout the wider economy. “Distress in auto lending broadly is often seen as a bellwether to changing circumstances in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">US economy</a>, because Americans particularly in the lower-income brackets tend to put their highest priority in auto payments,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School.</p><p>“Having a car is essential to being able to work,” he added. “So when we see stress in the auto financing market, we typically receive that as an indication that household finances are getting tighter.”</p><p>An estimated 100 million Americans hold auto loans, with 85% of new car purchases and 55% of used car purchases financed. It is the third-largest consumer credit market in the US, behind mortgages and student loans.</p><p>Problems in the auto loan industry have been manifesting for several years, as car prices rose sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic while inflation soared and interest rate increases followed. Paying off a new car required 42 weeks of income in 2023, according to Cox Automotive, up from about 33 before the pandemic.</p><p>High prices meant bigger loans. The average monthly repayment now stands at more than $750.</p><p>Car repossessions surged to their highest level since 2009 last year, according to Cox, with 1.73m vehicles seized, up 16% from the year prior and 43% from 2022.</p><p>Car owners were found to be missing payments at the highest rate in more than 30 years in January, when a Fitch Ratings index monitoring the share of sub-prime auto borrowers at least 60 days past due on their loans hit 6.5%.</p><p>“The consumer has been distressed for a little while,” Bill Nash, CEO of CarMax, the biggest seller of used cars in the US, told analysts last month after its lower sales and profits unnerved shareholders. “I think there’s some angst.”</p><p>Auto loans are short-term investments, and Kevin Armstrong, author of Repo Blood: A Century of Auto Repossession History, believes they are often extended to consumers who may not be credit-worthy. For this reason, he said, auto loan delinquencies are often seen as clues – “one of the canaries in the coalmine” – to the health of the broader economy.</p><p>Loan operators are now “giving out massive amounts of loan modification to try to move back delinquencies” to stave off repossession orders, Armstrong said. But they may only be buying time. “There’s a massive amount of recidivism when it comes to loan delinquencies,” he added.</p><p>Armstrong traces the rise in repossessions to the pandemic, when stimulus checks and extra unemployment aid allowed consumers to pay up for pricier cars. “When Covid hit, prices went through the roof,” he said. “I watched people paying outrageous amounts for cars that just weren’t going to hold their value, and the dealers laughing all the way to the bank. They got hosed.”</p><p>Now, coupled with higher mortgage or rental payments, high grocery bills and higher auto loan payments, he added: “Consumers got stuck with loan payments they can’t afford.”</p><p>Under most loan agreements, the lender or leaseholder can repossess the car even if borrowers are only a few weeks behind in payments, in part because a borrower could try to hide the car if they know the lender is looking to repossess it – and potentially sell it at auction.</p><figure id="ea2a3db9-8d5e-4c95-b00b-9bee4e55d030" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:21,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worried&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;ea2a3db9-8d5e-4c95-b00b-9bee4e55d030&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/10/first-brands-wall-street&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The job of repossessing a car is becoming harder, according to Badeen, with greater consumer rights awareness and a higher likelihood of confrontation. “We’ve had so much violence in recent years that we’ve had to train our people in what people like to call situational awareness and de-escalation,” he said. His company typically now sends tow trucks out with two people, one to pick up the car and another to keep watch.</p><p>The clouds gathering over the auto lending market could grow darker. Should Congress fail to agree on a continuation of Covid-era healthcare subsidies, the political issue at the center of the current federal government shutdown, that could put more pressure on the finances of auto borrowers.</p><p>“That whole mess comes out of Covid. It has an impact on individual people that many people don’t understand,” said Badeen. “Everything intertwines in some way, shape or form.”</p><p>If a large sub-prime lender stumbles as a result of this pressure – Santander Consumer is the nation’s biggest, and was last year <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-over-550-million-settlement-against-nation%E2%80%99s" data-link-name="in body link">fined $550m</a> to resolve claims it violated consumer protection laws by placing borrowers with sub-prime credit into auto loans it knew carried an unacceptably high probability of default – there could be wider turbulence.</p><p>Unlike First Brands, Tricolor sought bankruptcy protection last month under the shadow of fraud allegations that have prompted two federal investigations. Charles Gibbs, the attorney representing Tricolor’s court-appointed trustee, told a Texas court this month that initial reports “indicate potentially systemic levels of fraud”.</p><p>“Tricolor’s failure is not necessarily indicative of what is immediately ahead for the sector as a whole, because of the special circumstances, but I would still see it as an economic warning indicator,” said House.</p><p>Armstrong, too, was reluctant to call the failure of the companies, and the rise in repossessions, a trend. “But it’s on the verge,” he added.</p></div></div>]]></description>
