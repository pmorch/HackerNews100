            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-privacy-pass">https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-privacy-pass</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43040521">Hacker News</a></p>

            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-12/1739386497-186661-image.png" alt="Kagi Privacy Pass"></p>

<p>Today we are announcing a new privacy feature coming to Kagi Search. Privacy Pass is an authentication protocol first introduced by Davidson <em>et al.,</em> in [<a href="#references">1</a>], and recently standardized by the IETF as RFCs [<a href="#references">2—4</a>]. At the same time, we are announcing the immediate availability of Kagi’s <a href="#tor">Tor onion service</a>.</p>

<p>In general terms, Privacy Pass allows “Clients” (generally users) to authenticate to “Servers” (like Kagi) in such a way that while the Server can verify that the connecting Client has the right to access its services, it cannot determine which of its rightful Clients is actually connecting. This is particularly useful in the context of a privacy-respecting paid search engine, where the Server wants to ensure that the Client can access the services, and the Client seeks strong guarantees that, for example, the searches are not associated with them.</p>

<p>As a privacy-respecting search engine, Kagi’s business model is such that we have no incentive to track what an individual user is searching for. We are in the business of selling a search product, not selling user data or attention.</p>

<p>Now, Privacy Pass adds another layer of trust: we can verify that you have the right to search without knowing who you are or what you’re searching for. It’s one thing to promise we won’t track you; it’s another to make it technically impossible. We jumped on the opportunity to implement Privacy Pass as soon as the IETF made it an official standard.</p>

<p>This matters, because for many users, privacy isn’t just about incentives and privacy policies; it’s about proof. When we cannot track you even if we wanted to, that’s genuine privacy.</p>

<p>Initially, we will be offering Privacy Pass to all our plans with unlimited searches: Professional, Ultimate, Family, and Team plans. Privacy Pass will not be available to Trial and Starter plans due to technical limitations at this moment (see below for more info).</p>

<p><a name="use"></a>
To get started with Kagi Privacy Pass right away:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the newest version of Kagi’s <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a> (for macOS/iOS/iPadOS) with Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated. You will need at least 0.99.131 for macOS and 1.3.17 for iOS/iPadOS (they are expected to be rolling out globally today).</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the newest version of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search&amp;hl=en_US">Kagi for Android</a> app with Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated. You will need to use at least version 0.29 (this is expected to roll out globally today).</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the extension for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-privacy-pass/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-privacy-pass/mendokngpagmkejfpmeellpppjgbpdaj">Chrome</a></li>
<li>If you are already using the Kagi Search extension, you will want to update it to the latest version (0.7.6 on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-search-for-firefox">Firefox</a>, 1.2.2.5 on <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-search/cdglnehniifkbagbbombnjghhcihifij">Chrome</a>) to avoid compatibility issues, or simply disable it.</li>
<li>Safari is not yet supported due to technical limitations, see the F.A.Q. below.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition our implementation of Privacy Pass is open sourced and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/privacypass-extension">here</a>.</p>

<p>When using Kagi Privacy Pass mode, you’ll be truly anonymous - which means your account settings won’t be available since we can’t identify which user you are.</p>

<p>But don’t worry - we’ve made it flexible. You can easily toggle Privacy Pass on or off based on your needs. Think of it as two modes: full features with normal privacy, or maximum privacy with core features. You choose what makes sense for you based on your context and needs.</p>

<h2>An overview of Privacy Pass</h2>

<p>Privacy Pass uses cryptography to allow a client to authenticate to a server by performing a protocol with two phases: token generation and token redemption.</p>

<h2>Token generation</h2>

<p>In the initial “token generation” phase, the client interacts with the server to generate some authentication “tokens.”</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739474737-13606-image.png" alt="Generation_Phase"></p>

<p>For the server to willingly participate in this protocol, the client must prove their “right” to generate tokens.</p>

<p>In the case of Kagi’s users, this can be done by presenting their Kagi session cookie to the server.</p>

<p>The tokens eventually generated by the client at the end of this phase are indistinguishable from a randomly generated token from the server’s point of view. They cannot be traced back to the user who generated them, or to other tokens generated by the same user at the same or a different time.</p>

<h2>Token redemption</h2>

<p>After token generation is performed, a client can initiate a “token redemption” phase.</p>

<p>During this phase, the client actually accesses the services provided by the server, proving the client’s right to access the services by presenting one of the previously generated tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-01-13/1736805562-421965-image.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-01-13/1736805562-421965-image.png" alt="token redemption"></a></p>

<p>Since the previously generated tokens are unknown and unpredictable to the server, the latter can only tell that the client has successfully completed token generation at some point.</p>

<p>Technically, we say that the techniques used by Privacy Pass result in the two phases being “unlinkable”. While the server is able to tell whether a token presented for redemption was previously generated by interacting with a rightful client, it cannot link the token to a specific token generation phase.</p>

<p>Crucially, tokens are single-use: servers keep track of which tokens have already been redeemed to avoid multiple redemptions. Furthermore, clients should not present the same token twice to prevent different redemption phases from being linked.</p>

<p>Tokens have a fixed life span. If they are too old, they will stop being redeemable. In that case, a new token generation phase must be initiated by the client to obtain new tokens.</p>



<h2>Kagi’s implementation of Privacy Pass</h2>

<h2>Deployment model</h2>

<p>As standardized in [<a href="#references">2 - 4</a>], the Privacy Pass protocol is able to accommodate many “architectures.” Our deployment model follows the original architecture presented by Davidson <em>et al.</em> [<a href="#references">1</a>], called “Shared Origin, Attester, Issuer” in § 4 of [<a href="#references">2</a>].</p>

<p>Here, Kagi plays all the “Server roles” (Attester, Issuer, Origin), and Kagi users play the Client role via the new Kagi browser extensions for Privacy Pass, or via native support in Orion. This is what it looks like in practice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Once installed, and periodically, the browser extension will generate and store a large number of tokens.</li>
<li>The user can mark in the extension whether searches should be performed by authenticating classically via a session cookie, or by using Privacy Pass.</li>
<li>If the user chooses the second option, they will authenticate to Kagi during the search by redeeming one of the tokens it previously generated.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Using Privacy Pass is as easy as clicking a toggle.</p>

<h3>Orion browser</h3>

<p>If you are using the latest version of <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion</a> for macOS,  select Kagi as your search engine in <code>Settings -&gt; Search</code> and then enable the checkbox for showing Privacy Pass options on your toolbar.</p>

<p>From there you can easily toggle when you want to use Privacy Pass or standard authentication.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-12/1739386531-380483-screenshot-2025-02-12-at-105527.png" alt="Kagi Privacy Pass Orion"></p>

<p>On iOS and iPadOS, Kagi Privacy Pass is natively supported in the latest version of the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orion-browser-by-kagi/id1484498200">Orion Browser</a> for iOS and iPadOS and takes just a few clicks to enable.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-01-27/1738021158-834107-screenshot-2025-01-27-at-153837.png" alt="Kagi Privacy Pass Orion iOS"></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Orion iOS app is under review by Apple and will soon be available for download.</p>

<h3>Kagi app for Android</h3>

<p>Our <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search">Android app</a> now supports Privacy Pass mode via an app shortcut. Launching the shortcut allows you to browse Kagi seamlessly in Privacy Pass mode. You can also add the shortcut to your home screen for quick access.</p>

<p>This feature lets you either use Kagi exclusively in Privacy Pass mode or switch effortlessly between modes.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739474404-966034-screenshot-1739455802.png" alt="android_app"></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Android app is currently under review by Google Play and will be available for download soon.</p>

<h3>Chrome and Firefox browser extensions</h3>

<p>If you are using the Kagi Privacy Pass extension for <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-privacy-pass/mendokngpagmkejfpmeellpppjgbpdaj">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-privacy-pass/">Firefox</a>, once installed you should see the Kagi Privacy Pass icon on your toolbar.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739474834-913179-image.png" alt="extension-toolbar"></p>

<p>Once installed, the extension automatically generates tokens. To use them, click the extension icon, and make sure the toggle is on.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739474867-733807-image.png" alt="extension-popup"></p>

<p>Note that Safari is not supported at this moment; see the F.A.Q. below for more information.</p>



<h2>What guarantees does Privacy Pass offer?</h2>

<p>As used by Kagi, Privacy Pass tokens offer various security properties (§ 3.3,  of [<a href="#references">2</a>]).</p>

<p>These can be a little technical to capture. In a few words, they guarantee that users can trust that their searches authenticated via Privacy Pass cannot be linked to their accounts, and Kagi can rest assured that only legitimate users can correctly authenticate using Privacy Pass. Crucially, the guarantee for users is even against malicious servers that attempt to incorrectly implement the server-side computation, as long as the client-side implementation is correct.</p>

<p>Three of these security properties serve to protect our users:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generation-redemption unlinkability: Kagi cannot link the tokens presented during token redemption (<em>i.e.</em> during search) with any specific token generation phase. This means that Kagi will not be able to tell who it is serving search results to, only that it is someone who presented a valid Privacy Pass token.</p></li>

<li><p>Redemption-redemption unlinkability: Kagi cannot link the tokens presented during two different token redemptions. This means that Kagi will not be able to tell from tokens alone whether two searches are being performed by the same user.</p></li>

<li><p>No redemption hijacking: an eavesdropper that observes any token generation phase, cannot use the observed information alone to “steal” the tokens from the intended user and redeem them themselves. This means that third parties snooping on a user’s token generation interaction will not be able to steal the tokens. This adds a layer of security on top of the confidentiality attained during token generation by using a TLS-protected connection.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Two of these security properties serve to protect Kagi.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Correctness: honestly generated tokens will pass Kagi’s validation.</p></li>

<li><p>One-more-forgery security: a malicious client cannot use knowledge of a correctly generated token to forge a new one. This means that valid tokens cannot be generated without correctly interacting with Kagi, and therefore valid tokens are evidence that the user owned a valid session cookie for a supported Kagi plan at the moment of generating the token.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Is Privacy Pass a silver bullet for all your privacy needs?</h2>

<p>Naturally, online interactions are never fully described by a mathematical model.</p>

<p>While the Privacy Pass protocol <em>does</em> indeed guarantee that the server will not be able to link token generation and token redemption phases <em>from the tokens alone</em>, in principle, a malicious server could still attempt to track clients via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side-channel</a> information.</p>

<p>For example, if someone were to make the same specific request to a server at the same time every day (say, searching “lunch places near 123 Mulholland Drive, LA” at 11:58 AM), a server that records all searches being made could, in principle, guess that these searches are all made by the same person.</p>

<p>In this case, Privacy Pass would make it harder for the server to determine who this specific person is, but the server could nonetheless link searches to one another.</p>

<p>On a level beyond, it is well known that browsers can often have a unique “fingerprint” [<a href="#references">5-7</a>]. Fingerprinting attacks heavily rely on side-channel signals that evade the Privacy Pass protocol, such as user-agent strings or IP addresses. For example, if a server receives a token generation request from a given IP address, and immediately after a token redemption request from the same address, it can likely conclude that the same individual is behind the request. For this reason, it is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9576.html#section-4.1">highly recommended</a> to separate token generation and redemption in time, or “in space” (by using an anonymizing service such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> when redeeming tokens, see below).</p>

<p>Kagi’s Privacy Pass extension and native implementation in Orion take care, as much as we can, to uniform your browser fingerprint, by removing deanonymizing HTTP headers and cookies.</p>

<p>We see Privacy Pass as an important tool for increasing the anonymity guarantees we can offer to Kagi users.</p>

<p>Adopting state-of-the-art standards for new privacy enhancing technologies also signals to researchers and standardization bodies that there is a public demand for more privacy and anonymity tools in today’s digital world and incentivizes further scrutiny and development of privacy-enhancing technologies.</p>



<h2>Kagi Tor service</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-02-13/1739466591-66443-image.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Together with launching Privacy Pass, we are also announcing that we now have a Tor onion service available, which allows access to Kagi directly from the Tor network. Kagi’s onion address is:</p>

<p><a href="http://kagi2pv5bdcxxqla5itjzje2cgdccuwept5ub6patvmvn3qgmgjd6vid.onion/">kagi2pv5bdcxxqla5itjzje2cgdccuwept5ub6patvmvn3qgmgjd6vid.onion</a></p>

<p>On its own, Tor will obscure your location by hiding your IP address. However, without Privacy Pass, you still need to be logged into your Kagi account to perform searches, making them all theoretically linkable back to a single account. As always, Kagi does not link searches to accounts or permanently record them; see <a href="https://kagi.com/privacy">our Privacy Policy</a> for more info.</p>

<p>With Tor and Privacy Pass together, Kagi only knows that the search is being issued by a user who previously verified that they have an account authorized to receive tokens, but nothing about the user’s account, or where they’re located.</p>

<p>See more information about <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/privacy/tor.html">Kagi Tor service</a> in our documentation.</p>

<h2>Start using Kagi Privacy Pass</h2>

<p>Privacy Pass support is provided:
- Natively for <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion browser</a> users (macOS/iOS/iPadOS)
- Natively through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kagi.search&amp;hl=en_US">Kagi App for Android</a>
- Browser extension for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kagi-privacy-pass/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-privacy-pass/mendokngpagmkejfpmeellpppjgbpdaj">Chrome</a></p>

<p>This should accommodate users who want to install and use the extension across multiple browsers or computers. Please refer to our documentation for <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/privacy/privacy-pass.html">usage instructions</a>.</p>

<p>At first, Privacy Pass authentication will be available to users on any Kagi plan with unlimited searches. These plans will have a generous allocation of tokens (2000 to begin with) that they can generate monthly.</p>

<p>We are working on enabling this feature for Trial and Starter plans, which have access to a limited number of monthly searches. Therefore, they risk a worse user experience if their generated tokens are lost (for example, due to uninstalling the extension) and theoretically, users on this plan could redeem more tokens than the limit of searches allowed on their plan (again, we do not know who the user redeeming the tokens is, or what plan they are on). This makes it more technically challenging to support these plans with Privacy Pass, and we have left that for later.</p>



<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<p><strong>You mention “tokens.” Are blockchains involved in this protocol?</strong></p>

<p>Privacy Pass does not rely on any blockchain technology.</p>

<p>While the protocol makes use of various cryptographic primitives (specifically, elliptic curves and hash functions, as part of a “verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function” construction, [<a href="#references">8</a>]) and generates “tokens,” these are not generated, stored, or traded on a blockchain.</p>

<p><strong>You mention the client generating tokens. Is this process energy-intensive or storage-demanding?</strong></p>

<p>No. The generation of 500 search tokens requires approximately 1 second of computation on a consumer laptop, and is performed in the background when installing the extension. A few extra seconds may be required due to the time required to contact the server and get a response. Each token consists of 216 bytes, for a total of approximately 100 KiB of storage per token generation request.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a potential impact on the speed of search when using Privacy Pass?</strong></p>

<p>The initial generation of tokens takes about ~1 second for 500 tokens, plus the time required for contacting the server. This occurs infrequently and is done in the background when possible.</p>

<p>Currently, the token validation servers are only deployed in our us-central1 region, we plan to expand this shortly after launch.</p>

<p><strong>How many tokens am I able to generate?</strong></p>

<p>You can generate 2,000 tokens in one “epoch” (= one month). This should be enough for most users. If you need more than this, you can request additional tokens by contacting support@kagi.com.</p>

<p><strong>Do you plan to allow purchasing privacy pass tokens without having an account?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, this makes sense. Let us know <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/6163-kagi-privacy-pass">here</a> if you are excited about this, as it will help prioritize it.</p>

<p><strong>How can I submit feedback for Kagi Privacy Pass?</strong></p>

<p>We have a feedback thread open <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/6163-kagi-privacy-pass">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Even if the extension implements anti-fingerprinting measures, Kagi will still be able to see my IP address, correct?</strong></p>

<p>Even with Privacy Pass authentication enabled, due to the way the TCP/IP stack works, we will be able to see your search request come from an IP address. As outlined in our <a href="https://kagi.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, your privacy is our priority, whether you are using Privacy Pass to authenticate or otherwise. If you are worried about us seeing your IP address, our suggestion is to connect to Kagi via Tor or through a VPN service you trust.</p>

<p><strong>How can Privacy Pass increase my privacy, if I have to send a session cookie to authenticate during token generation?</strong></p>

<p>While token generation is indeed not anonymous, Privacy Pass provides you with anonymity <em>during search</em>.</p>

<p>By providing the server with a Privacy Pass token instead of a session cookie when searching, you will guarantee that your searches cannot be <em>linked</em> to any specific user account that generated Privacy Pass tokens, or to each other.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the server, your search query could have come from any of the users who previously generated Privacy Pass tokens.</p>

<p>The more users do so, the lower the probability that the server can guess it was you specifically who made a given search query.</p>

<p><strong>Token generation does not work in my Chrome/Firefox private window</strong></p>

<p>Correct, we need to authenticate you to create tokens (see above), and in the private window, the extension does not have access to your session cookie. Please use a normal browsing window while logged in to Kagi to generate tokens.</p>

<p>Note, generating tokens while in a private window will work in the <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion browser</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use Kagi Assistant while using Privacy Pass?</strong></p>

<p>Not at this time, since Kagi Assistant is only available to Ultimate members. In Privacy Pass, we don’t have any account information, so we can’t validate what plan you’re on. We could issue tokens attached to different keys for different plans, but that also has privacy implications, see the discussion of personalization below.</p>

<p><strong>What Kagi services will be compatible with Privacy Pass at launch?</strong></p>

<p>At launch, Privacy Pass will only be used to authenticate Kagi Search. Soon to follow (in the next few weeks), we plan to expand support for Kagi Privacy Pass to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kagi Assistant</li>
<li>Kagi Translate and Kagi Maps</li>
<li>Kagi universal Summarizer and Ask questions about page</li>
</ul>

<p>Please disable Privacy pass to access these services for now.</p>

<p><strong>Since initial token generation happens in batches and the tokens expire, could tokens with similar expiration dates potentially be used to identify multiple searches from the same user?</strong></p>

<p>All tokens generated during month X expire at midnight of the first day of month X+2, to avoid this exact issue. Meaning a freshly generated token lasts until the end of the month following its generation (generate today, use all of Feb and March).</p>

<p><strong>If Kagi cannot track who exactly is performing search queries, will I have access to my account settings including customization and personalization?</strong></p>

<p>Since Kagi will not know who you are, we will not be able to serve you content tailored to your custom settings via Privacy Pass-protected search.</p>

<p>We have considered allowing users to send a small configuration with every request <code>(language, region, safe-search)</code> to automatically customize your search experience to some extent. However, we currently believe this would quickly result in a significant loss of anonymity for you and for other users. To illustrate this, we have examined the most common configurations of <code>(language, region, search-safe)</code> used on Kagi.com, and extrapolated how many Privacy Pass users would share them. Looking at the top 35 configurations, we see the following approximate numbers.</p>

<p>This would mean that someone sending us <code>Lang 10</code> as their language configuration would automatically lose redemption-redemption unlinkability guarantees if approximately 1000 Kagi users used Privacy Pass.</p>

<p>While our extrapolation may be overly conservative, we won’t be enabling this level of “default” customization for users authenticating via Privacy Pass for the time being. We could reconsider if we find a better solution.</p>

<p>For manual search settings customization, you can always use bangs in your search query to enable basic settings for a specific query. For example, <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html#regional-bangs">regional bangs</a> will let you focus your query on one region. For example prefixing your search with <code>!de</code> will automatically search in the German region.</p>

<p>To access a fully customized search experience, you can always use the traditional login method and disable the use of Privacy Pass.</p>

<p><strong>Will Safari be supported?</strong></p>

<p>The Safari extensions API doesn’t support (as far as we know) removing cookies from requests, which means it will always authenticate with your logged-in account. We’re not aware of a way to change this. The alternative if you want a similar, native, WebKit-based browsing experience, is to use the <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a> which has Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated.</p>

Traditional CAPTCHAs help block bots, but often involve improving proprietary maps and software, while exposing user information to third-party CAPTCHA providers. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has many objects remaining to be mapped, but the quality of AI-generated objects is not high enough for direct inclusion. We introduce “MapTCHA”, a CAPTCHA that leverages the uncertainty of interpreting imagery with computer vision, and provides human verification for AI predictions: users are asked to identify images containing correctly interpreted objects, e.g. building outlines.</p>
<p>We separate known positive cases, where both the AI prediction and OSM contain an object, from unknown cases, where objects are only in the prediction. We also generate known negatives from areas where objects are neither in OSM nor in the prediction. We show a mix of these images without telling the user which are which. Humans are validated by confirming the known positives and negatives, and we determine the truth of the unknown images by aggregating users’ responses through voting. When the voting indicates high confidence that an object exists, we suggest the location for OSM mapping.</p>
<p>Our prototype identifies buildings using aerial imagery with high enough resolution to visualise individual buildings and medium-sized objects. Image recognition is provided by fAIr, an open-source AI-assisted mapping system developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). It allows the training and fine-tuning of pre-trained machine learning models to segment building footprints.</p>
<p>Future plans include expanding to more objects and types of imagery; refining AI models; integrating MapTCHA into various login systems; and enhancing the user interface.</p>
<p>In this session we will talk about how we are building this solution, how it might enhance mapping efforts in OSM that will support projects on the ground, and some of the challenges of working with AI derived data.</p></div>

  Now, UnitedHealth was pushing to terminate the 82-year-old’s rehab coverage.</p></div><p>Jackie and his son appealed UnitedHealth’s decision and won.

The federal inquiry found that UnitedHealth’s prior authorization denial rate for post-acute care for older people on Medicare Advantage shot up from 8.7% in 2019 to 22.7% in 2022. For Medicare Advantage seniors seeking post-acute care in nursing homes specifically, UnitedHealth’s denial rate jumped up dramatically during that period, from 1.4% to 12.6%, amounting to more than 34,000 denials.</p><p>
  In a statement, the spokesperson for UnitedHealth’s subsidiary said the Senate committee investigation “mischaracterizes” Medicare Advantage and the company’s clinical practices while ignoring federal criteria “demanding greater scrutiny around post-acute care”.</p></div><p>The corporate spokesperson also added that the company “ultimately” pays “98% of all claims” it receives, when they are submitted in “a timely manner with complete, non-duplicate information”.</p><div><p>UnitedHealth’s past coverage denials caught renewed attention after the December killing of Brian Thompson, a top executive who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/health/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare.html" data-link-name="in body link">helped establish</a> one of its subsidiaries as the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-in-2024-enrollment-update-and-key-trends/" data-link-name="in body link">dominant player</a> in the Medicare Advantage market. </p><p>
  Weeks before Thompson’s killing, Biden administration officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-27939/p-2" data-link-name="in body link">proposed new rules</a> to crack down on what it described as the “inappropriate” use of prior authorization by Medicare Advantage insurers.

 In a statement, the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, the investigations committee’s former chair, said older Americans like Jackie Martin “should receive the care they need” without delays or denials.</p></div><p>“For Jackie, his family, and the countless other Medicare Advantage enrollees, we must fight denials of post-acute care,” Blumenthal said. “I will continue to speak out and hold private insurers accountable for putting profits over people.”</p><h2 id="the-process">The process</h2><p>Before he suffered a fall on the hardwood floor of his kitchen that left him with a back fracture, Jackie Martin walked two to three miles a day and ran on the treadmill at his local Y in Kingsport, Tennessee.</p><div><p>Jackie’s subsequent recovery in the nursing home was slow, but he was making progress.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Some of my favorite internet people sometimes organize little community experiments. Like, let’s eat <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/04/29/potato-diet-community-trial-sign-up-now-lol/">potatoes</a> and see if we lose weight. Or, let’s take some supplements and see if <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/11/anxiety-sampler-kits/">anxiety</a> goes down. I’ve toyed with doing one myself, to see if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">theanine</a> (a chemical in tea) really helps with stress.</p>

<p>But sometimes, when everyone is having fun, some very mean very bad people show up and say, “HEY! YOU CAN’T DO THAT! THAT’S HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH! YOU NEED TO GET APPROVAL FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD!”</p>

<p>So I wondered—is that right? Who <em>exactly</em> actually needs to get approval from an institutional review board (IRB)? More than a year later, I’m now convinced that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No single source on the internet actually answers that question.</li>
  <li>The answer is absurdly complex.</li>
  <li>The reason it’s so complex is that IRB rules are an illegible mishmash of things, some of which <em>themselves</em> have near-fractal complexity.</li>
  <li>If you stare at this long enough, it’s impossible not to question the degree to which we actually have “laws”.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this post, I’ll give the answer and then explain—in maddening detail—why I think that answer is right. But first I want to tell a little story.</p>

<p>I used to live in an apartment with an extremely steep driveway. When I had visitors, I’d tell them, “At the bottom of the driveway you must slow to ⅒ of normal speed or your car will scrape the ground. I tell this to everyone and they only slow to ½ of normal speed and scrape their car on the ground. Don’t do that!” Then they’d only slow to ½ of normal speed and scrape their car on the ground.</p>

<p>Why? I think because my visitors simply couldn’t believe my driveway was as stupid as it was. When I explained the rules of safe driveway usage, they mentally substituted the closest version of those rules that would be correct in a sane universe, one without driveways that form sudden 30° angles with the road. I suspect this is a general cognitive bias.</p>

<p>So, who exactly needs IRB approval?  Here are some myths:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for medical research.</li>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for federally funded research.</li>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed for research at “institutions”.</li>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is only needed if you want to publish in a journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wrong. But this is also a myth:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Myth:</strong> IRB approval is needed for all research involving human subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also wrong. As far as I can tell, after months of research, here is how it works:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/irb.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/irb.svg" alt="irb chart"></a></p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: “That can’t be right! The government can’t possibly claim to regulate what me and my roommates eat at home! That would be stupid!” Yes, it <em>would</em> be stupid. But who says the world makes sense?</p>

<p>Now, would you actually be <em>prosecuted</em> for violating those rules? Unlikely. If a prosecutor went after you and you fought them in court, you might even be able to get some of these rules declared unconstitutional. But those are the rules as written.</p>

<p><em>Caution</em>: I estimate a 85% chance that this post contains at least one minor error and a 40% chance of a significant error. I’ve gone to insane lengths to try to get things right—I regret ever becoming interested in this topic—but this stuff is insanely convoluted. Past experience says that someone reading this knows much better than I do. If that’s you, let me know about any errors.</p>

<h2 id="reminder-of-how-law-works-in-the-us">Reminder of how law works in the US</h2>

<p>If you’re a sane person, and you want to know when IRB approval is needed, you might think something like, “I know! I’ll go find the IRB law and read it. Then I’ll know what’s legal and what isn’t. Yay!”</p>

<p>Hahaha, no. This won’t work, for several reasons.</p>

<p>For one, few federal rules actually come from <em>laws</em>. Usually politicians pass some broad law that says, “Human research is hereby regulated, details to come!” And then government employees write <em>regulations</em> that contain all the details, and those regulations have the power of law. And then the government employees issue “clarifications” that supposedly don’t change anything, but everyone treats like new laws.</p>

<p>Also, the US constitution theoretically imposes severe limits on the power of the federal government. <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/">Article 1 section 8</a> says the federal government has the power to (1) tax and spend, (2) regulate commerce, (3) control citizenship, (4) create post offices, (5) protect IP, (6) make treaties and (7) do war. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">10th amendment</a> says that’s <em>it</em>: everything else is left to the states.</p>

<p>The federal government doesn’t like those limits, so it evades them in various ways. The classic trick is to declare that everything is related to commerce and therefore almost anything can be considered “regulating commerce”. For example, it’s OK to make growing and eating wheat on your own property illegal, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn">growing and eating wheat is “commerce”</a>. Another trick is to write rules that sort of say, “If your state/organization wants back any of the money it’s paying in taxes, then you must create and enforce the following rules: […]”. For example, in 1984, the US government decreed that all states must raise the legal age to buy alcohol to 21 or they would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act">lose federal funding for highways</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the limits of federal power are only clarified when someone fights them in court. Did you know that at some point, bureaucrats decided that your boss must <a href="https://dynomight.net/2021/01/15/eeo/">guess your race and report it to the government</a>? Is that an illegal overreach? Is it “regulating commerce” to make personal consumption of cannabis illegal in states that have legalized it? The way you find out is you break the rules, get prosecuted, and spend millions fighting in court. (For cannabis, the answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich">yes</a>, that <em>is</em> regulating commerce.) If you win, OK, no refunds on your legal fees. If you lose, you pay massive fines or go to prison. Also, courts have constantly changing judges and opinions.</p>

<p>So what happens in practice is politicians write a vague law. Bureaucrats turn that law into very detailed (but often still vague) specific rules. Those rules might or might not be “legal”, but nobody want to risk fighting them in court. If the regulations are particularly ridiculous or likely to be overturned if challenged, prosecutors may quietly stop bringing cases. But the regulations still sit there on the books. And people still usually pay attention to them, because why risk it?</p>

<p>OK! Where do IRB regulations come from?</p>

<h2 id="the-common-rule">The Common Rule</h2>

<p>In 1932, the United States government and Tuskegee University began studying 600 poor black sharecroppers in Macon Country Alabama, ⅔ of whom had latent syphilis. The idea was to observe the progression of the disease if left untreated. By the late 1940s, syphilis was easily treatable with penicillin, but the men were never informed of their condition, never treated, and were even given fake treatments and diagnoses.</p>

<p>In 1965, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buxtun">Peter Buxton</a> joined the Public Health service and soon learned of the experiment. He was horrified and filed several official protests, but all were all rejected. Finally, in 1972, Buxton leaked the details to Jean Heller of the Associated Press which led to this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/26/archives/syphilis-victims-in-us-study-went-untreated-for-40-years-syphilis.html">front-page article</a> on July 26, 1972.</p>

<p><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/NYT.jpg" alt="NYT article"></p>

<p>The led to widespread outrage and cancellation of the study. By this time, dozens of the men had died from syphilis and many of their wives and children had also become infected.</p>

<p>It also led, in early 1973, a series of congressional hearings led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> of Massachusetts. These hearings eventually produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Act">National Research Act</a>. Several people voted for <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/93-1973/s382">the first version</a> of this bill and then against the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/93-1974/s865">second version</a>, including one Joseph Biden of Delaware, though I can’t find any record of why. Anyway, it was signed into law by Richard Nixon on July 12, 1974.</p>

<p>Formally speaking, the National Research Act did was to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_the_Protection_of_Human_Subjects_of_Biomedical_and_Behavioral_Research">commission</a>  to develop guidelines for ethical research in human subjects, including how IRBs should work. But in reality, it also sent a message that federal agencies should use their <em>existing</em> authority to regulate research. Even before the Act was passed, the Department of Health and Human Services had started <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1974-05-30/pdf/FR-1974-05-30.pdf#page=70">amending</a> the federal code to regulate human research. In 1978, the commission issued a <a href="https://videocast.nih.gov/pdf/ohrp_institutional_review_boards.pdf">report</a> on IRBs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Commission believes that the rights of subjects should be protected by local review committees operating pursuant to federal regulations and located in institutions where research involving human subjects is conducted.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>The Commission further believes that institutions receiving federal support for the conduct of research involving human subjects should be governed by uniform federal regulations applicable to the review of all such research, whether it is supported by one federal department or another, or is not federally supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Informed by this report, lots of different agencies issued different regulations. This continued until 1991, when 15 federal agencies harmonized on what is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Rule">Common Rule</a>, because it is “common” to different federal agencies. This is now codified as <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">Title 45 Part 46</a> of the federal code.</p>

<p>Since 1991, this has been continuously updated and various other agencies have joined, notably the department of Labor. There are still a couple holdouts including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National Endowment for the Humanities. The CIA is an odd case—they never issued any formal regulations, but supposedly apply the Common Rule because of a cryptic <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/12333">executive order</a> from 1981. The FDA hasn’t joined because they have their own regulatory structure.</p>

<p>So what does the Common Rule say? In principle, you can go <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46">here</a> and read it. Good luck with that. It’s exactly as readable as “a series of regulations amended by many agencies over many decades” <em>sounds</em> like it would be. But basically (1) It requires informed consent. (2) It requires that risks are reasonable in relation to expected benefits, <em>not</em> including any long-range benefits from new knowledge. (3) It requires participants are selected fairly and equitably (e.g. not all poor black sharecroppers) Finally, (4) It requires that federally funded research with human subjects is reviewed by an IRB.</p>

<p>Now, that might sound simple, but what exactly is “research”? This is defined by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-46#p-46.102(l)">45 CFR 46.102(l)</a> to be a “systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” It’s best to understand this with an example. Say you’re a teacher and you want to test if the cognitive bias of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect">anchoring</a> applies to your class. Is this research? If you’re doing it as part of normal “teaching stuff”, to demonstrate the effect to your students, then no. But if you’re doing it in hope of <em>learning</em> if the anchoring bias is real, then that <em>is</em> research. To some degree, the truth lies in your heart.</p>

<p>(The definition of a “human subject” is also somewhat convoluted: What if you’re using data someone else gathered? What if you’re just using some human tissue samples or nonviable human embryos? But never mind.)</p>

<p>Note that this applies to <em>all</em> research. The people who made these rules were almost all medical researchers thinking about serious medical risks. But they wrote the rules to apply to <em>all</em> research, including research where you might just ask people some questions.</p>

<p>There are some narrow categories of research that are “exempt” from IRB review, e.g. research on <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(1)">standard educational methods</a> or <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(6)">food taste evaluations</a>, or certain <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(3)">benign behavioral interventions</a> . Theoretically, an institution <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/exempt-research-determination/index.html#4109">could</a> allow investigators to decide for themselves if they are exempt, but this is not recommended, and in practice, essentially all institutions require you to apply for a determination of exemption. In reality, <em>no</em> research is really exempt, it’s just that certain categories of research have a somewhat more lightweight application process. To get a feel for how much friction this adds, here’s <a href="https://hrpp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/brief_protocol_for_exempt_research_projects_5.15.2020_4.docx">U. Michigan’s application for exemption</a>.</p>

<p>Up until the 1990s, IRBs at universities tended to be staffed with faculty “volunteers”. These were sympathetic to the needs of their colleagues, had little interest in reading (unreadable) federal regulations, and probably just wanted to get back to teaching and research. So IRBs were often pretty loose. But in 1996, Hoiyan Wan died after taking part of an experiment on the effects of smoking and air pollution the University of Rochester. And in 1999, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger">Jesse Gelsinger</a> died after taking an experimental gene therapy at the University Of Pennsylvania. Federal agencies cracked down and sent out hundreds of enforcement letters. Universities nervously responded with “hypercompliance”, leading to IRB process everyone loves today.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-the-common-rule-so-common">Why is the Common Rule so common?</h2>

<p>The 1978 commission recommended that any institution accepting federal funding must apply IRB rules to all research, regardless of funding source. But the written regulations did not follow that recommendation. Theoretically, a university could accept federal funding for some research and still allow other research on human subjects without any IRB approval. But in practice, no university ever does that. Why?</p>

<p>Well, before giving any federal funding to an institution, the government requires the institution to file a “<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/fwa-instructions/index.html">Federalwise Assurance</a>”. In this, the institution must promise to obey some “statement of ethical principles”. Supposedly this could be anything, but it appears that the only correct answer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report">“The Belmont Report”</a>, an ethics statement issued by the same commission from 1978. Then there is a section where the institution may “optionally” promise to apply the common rule to all research, regardless of funding source.</p>

<p>The government has a <a href="https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/fwasearch.aspx?">database</a> of these “assurances”, but you can’t actually read them. Still, I found that a few prominent institutions that had published theirs. They <em>all</em> promised to abide by the Belmont report. Some (<a href="https://www.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu/research/documents/IRB/FWA.pdf">NYU</a>, <a href="https://research.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/1-Institutional-Oversight-of-Assurance.pdf">U. C. Irvine</a>) promised to apply the Common Rule to all research, but most (<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/documents/mayo-clinic-federalwide-assurance/doc-20144006">Mayo Clinic</a>, <a href="https://irb.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/University-of-Florida-FWA-Exp.-07-06-2028.pdf">U. Florida</a>, <a href="https://irb.emory.edu/_includes/documents/sections/fwa-latest-copy.pdf">Emory</a>, <a href="https://research-compliance.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resource-download/um-fwa.pdf">U. Michigan</a>, <a href="https://ras.mit.edu/document/federalwide-assurance-protection-human-subjects">MIT</a>) do not.</p>

<p>So if you’re a researcher at MIT, can you do non-federally funded research without an IRB? Nope. <a href="https://couhes.mit.edu/researchers/frequently-asked-questions">MIT rules</a> still say you need an IRB for <em>all</em> research with human subjects.  So do the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/documents/1-inst-commitment-and-authoritypdf/doc-10027286">Mayo Clinic’s</a>. So do <a href="https://irb.ufl.edu/">U. Florida’s rules</a>. So do <a href="https://irb.emory.edu/_includes/documents/sections/pyramid-guidance.pdf">Emory’s rules</a>. So do <a href="https://hrpp.umich.edu/irb-health-sciences-and-behavioral-sciences-hsbs/irb-review-process/">U. Michigan’s rules</a>.</p>

<p>What’s going on here? Throughout the 1970s, there was a debate about if IRB rules should apply to social science at all. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/index.html">OHRP</a> (which oversees the Common Rule) gradually asserted <a href="https://willyreads.substack.com/p/ethical-imperialism-irbs-and-the">more and more broad IRB requirements</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithiel_de_Sola_Pool">Ithiel de Sola Pool</a>, a professor at MIT, protested this growing power. Apparently, a colleague had sought IRB approval to interview Boston anti-busing activists, and been rejected because this research could be used against them. Pool <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556121">argued</a> that much of social science should be exempt and got support from professional societies.</p>

<p>But no matter. Here’s Charles McCarthy, director of the OHRP from 1977 to 1993, bragging about subverting the Carter and the Reagan administrations to add more regulations during the transition in 1980:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But we were trying to decide when is the appropriate time to get the Secretary to sign off on the new regulations?&nbsp; They had already been proposed, we had got comments from the public.&nbsp; We’d incorporated the comments.&nbsp; We wrote the preamble, it was ready to go.&nbsp; And then when is the best time, ‘cause Harris could care less whether they every got published.&nbsp; So we talked to the transition team, and they said Reagan will never allow new regulations to see the light of day, so if you’re going to get those out at all, you’d better get them out before he takes over.</p>

  <p>So we’re struggling with this problem, and the way we worked it out was that’s when we wrote, overnight one night–brilliant inspiration–we wrote–everybody stayed in the office, and we worked all night long, and we wrote the exemptions to the regulations, and we also wrote expedited review neither of which had ever been addressed by the Commission.&nbsp; And that’s where they came from.</p>

  <p>Then we went to the transition team, and we said would the transition team endorse regulations that are less stringent than the previous regulations?&nbsp; And, of course, they weren’t, but they looked like they were because we wrote some exceptions.&nbsp; And so when we sent the package down to Harris, we said “Diminished Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects.”&nbsp; And that was the title.&nbsp; And, of course, we knew nobody down there in the last weeks of the Harris administration getting ready to leave office would actually read it.&nbsp; So they didn’t know what all that was about, but they could read the title.</p>

  <p>And so Secretary Harris signed that at her farewell party.&nbsp; She put down her glass of champagne and signed the regulations on January 19, 1980, and went out of office on the 20th.&nbsp; So we squeaked by.&nbsp; Those were some of the adventures we had that were kind of harrowing for regulators, and that’s why some of the language in those exemptions is so convoluted because it was really a first draft.&nbsp; But it survived and it’s still in there.&nbsp; And it makes some sense, but if we could rewrite the regulations, we would run that through three or four more drafts and make them crystal clear.&nbsp; They’re less than elegant writing, whereas if you read the rest of the regulation, I think you’ll find sub-part A is very well-written if you leave out the part about the exemptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a real quote that you can go read on the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/education-and-outreach/luminaries-lecture-series/belmont-report-25th-anniversary-interview-cmccarthy/index.html#:~:text=But%20we%20were%20trying"><code>hhs.gov</code> website</a> today.</p>

<p>The OHRP sent out “non-binding guidance” that suggested all research should be subject to IRB review. According to <a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/487/">Hamburger (2007)</a> in the 1990s, the Federalwise Assurance form implied that institutions <em>had</em> to apply the Common Rule to all research, despite the fact that no federal regulation to this effect existed. I can’t find the old form, but according to “persons who were in a position to know”, at one point all but about five institutions in the entire country had made this promise.</p>

<p>By 2000-2005, the form made clear that promising to apply the Common Rule (and thus IRBs) to non federally-funded research was optional, and many institutions decline to do this. But they are only declining <em>to make this assurance</em>. Apparently, after years of applying the Common Rule to all research, it had risen to legally qualify as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care">“standard of care”</a>, meaning that anyone that failed to apply it risked being legally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence">“negligent “</a> under state law. So, having established the Common Rule as standard through questionably legal tactics, the government could now relax and rely on state tort laws.</p>

<p>Now, say you’re affiliated with a university. Federal funded research without IRB approval is out. <em>Any</em> research at the university is out. But say you want to do research in your spare time, at home, without using any university resources. Is that OK?</p>

<p>Policies here seem to vary. Some are clear that this is <em>not</em> OK. <a href="https://irb.ucsf.edu/research-needing-irb-review#who">U.C. San Francisco</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UCSF faculty, staff,&nbsp;or students or researchers at UCSF-affiliated institutions conducting human subjects research require IRB approval before initiating the study. IRB approval is required <strong>regardless of the site of the study or the source of funding</strong> (if there is funding).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others are a bit ambiguous. <a href="https://couhes.mit.edu/researchers/frequently-asked-questions#who_apply">MIT</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any faculty member, employee or student at MIT who conducts human subjects research must apply [to the IRB] if the research involves any form of MIT involvement or support, including funding, <strong>personnel</strong>, facilities, academic credit or access to experimental subjects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how could a MIT <em>employee</em> do research without involving MIT <em>personnel</em>, when they themselves are personnel? The closest I can find to anyone saying it’s OK to do independent research without an IRB is <a href="https://research.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/HRPO/IRB_SOP_v5.2_2.12.19_TOC_CUIMC.176a.9.12.19.pdf">Columbia University</a> which says an IRB is needed if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent (faculty/student/staff) of Columbia, in connection with his or her institutional responsibilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly constitutes a “connection”? I guess you get to argue about the meaning of that term if/when you’re investigated for research misconduct.</p>

<h2 id="journals">Journals</h2>

<p>OK! So if you’re doing any research at any federally funded institution, you need an IRB. If you work at such an institution, you could <em>maybe</em> do research at home, as long as it’s unrelated to your job and you’re willing to live dangerously.</p>

<p>But suppose you’re not affiliated with any institution. Can you do research without an IRB?</p>

<p>One additional barrier is that if you want to <em>publish</em> your results in a journal, almost all journals that publish human subjects research require IRB approval. For example, all <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/ethics-and-biosecurity#:~:text=identify%20the%20ethics">Nature journals</a>, <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/before-you-start#:~:text=reference%20number">Springer journals</a> , and <a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/editorial-policies/research-ethics-guidelines-for-stem-journals/#:~:text=reference">Taylor and Francis</a>  journals require you to identify the ethics committee and give a reference number. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies#:~:text=human%20subjects%20research">Science</a> journals require IRB approval, but don’t seem to require details unless an editor requests them. (Those are publisher requirements. Specific journals can add additional restrictions.)</p>

<p>Now, I’m not sure how carefully these journals actually <em>check</em>. My impression is that some do and some don’t. Maybe you could lie and get away with it, but papers do in fact <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/category/by-reason-for-retraction/lack-of-irb-approval/">retracted</a> when a lack of IRB approval is revealed.</p>

<h2 id="state-laws">State laws</h2>

<p>Another barrier is that some states have their own laws. In 1975, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/2444">New York</a> passed a law that required IRB approval for <em>all</em> human subjects research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each person engaged in the conduct of human research or proposing to conduct human research shall affiliate himself with an institution or agency having a human research review committee, and such human research as he conducts or proposes to conduct shall be subject to review by such committee in the manner set forth in this section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter5.1/section32.1-162.19/">Virginia</a> passed a very similar law in 1979. These go further than requiring IRB approval. They make independent human subjects research fully illegal! (Read that quote!) In most states, a random person could submit their research plan to an independent IRB. Not in New York or Virginia.</p>

<p>In 2002, Maryland passed <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2002rs/billfile/hb0917.htm">house bill 917</a>. I find this text extremely confusing, but <a href="https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/HealthPolicy/humansubject.aspx">everyone seems to agree</a> that that it means that all human subjects research requires IRB approval.</p>

<p>I’ve seen many people claim that California also requires IRB approval for all human subjects research. While it’s true that California has some <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;division=20.&amp;title&amp;part&amp;chapter=1.3.&amp;article">extra regulations</a>, as far as I can tell none of these require IRB approval.</p>

<h2 id="fda-regulations">FDA regulations</h2>

<p>Have you found all this to be too simple? Too straightforward and legible?</p>

<p>The FDA is here to help. They have an <em>independent</em> set of IRB regulations. While the Common Rule IRB regulations are in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46">Title 45 Part 46</a> (45 CFR 46), the FDA IRB regulations are in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56">21 CFR 56</a> and also <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-50">21 CFR Part 50</a>.</p>

<p>Whereas the Common Rule derives its constitutional authority from the idea that the government can decide how it wants to give out <em>money</em>, the FDA regulations seem derive their constitutional authority from the idea that it is <em>regulating commerce</em>. So FDA regulations apply regardless of where you work or how you’ve gotten funding. The FDA operates according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act_of_1938">1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act</a> and its many amendments, most notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994">1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act</a>.</p>

<p>So what do the FDA regulations say? I found them to be much more painful to read than the (already extremely painful) Common Rule regulations. But after much thrashing and screaming, I think the core regulation is <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56/section-56.103#p-56.103(a)">21 CFR 56.103(a)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] any clinical investigation which must meet the requirements for prior submission (as required in parts <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312">312</a>, 812, and 813) […] shall not be initiated unless that investigation has been reviewed […] by an IRB meeting the requirements of this part.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>21 CFR § 56.103 gives a two cases where you’re exempt from the above rule, but these aren’t much help.</p>

      <p>The first (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56/subpart-A/section-56.104">21 CFR § 56.104</a>) is that you’re exempt if you meet the conditions of which basically are that (1) you started your investigation in 1981 or earlier (2) it’s an emergency and you get IRB approval within 5 days, or (3) “taste and food quality evaluations and consumer acceptance studies if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or if a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and for a use found to be safe”.</p>

      <p>The second (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-56/subpart-A/section-56.105">21 CFR § 56.105</a>) is that you’re exempt if you apply to the FDA to be exempt and they waive the requirements. Good luck with that.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56/section-56.103#p-56.103(b)">21 CFR § 56.103 (b)</a> says that if you apply to the FDA to get a drug approved, they may ignore your data if you should have gotten an IRB but you didn’t. But this an <em>additional</em>  thing to worry about, not a waiver to do whatever you want if you don’t care about FDA approval.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<p>So what does this mean?</p>

<p>Well, a “clinical investigation” is defined by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56#p-56.102(c)">21 CFR 56.102(c)</a> to be anything involving human subjects and a “test article”. And a “test article” which is defined in turn by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-56#p-56.102(l)">21 CFR 56.102(l)</a> to be any “drug” for human use. So if you’re doing anything with a “drug” that requires “prior submission”, then you need an IRB. What do <em>those</em> terms mean? <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-312">21 CFR Part 312</a> makes clear that “prior submission” is referring to an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA.</p>

<p>(Caution: An “IRB” and an “IND” are totally different things. An IRB is what this article is about. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigational_New_Drug">IND</a> is the kind of application that pharmaceutical companies make to the FDA before they can start clinical trials.)</p>

<p>So, at first, this seems like good news: As long as you don’t need to do a (gigantic, extremely expensive) IND application to the FDA before starting your research, then FDA regulations don’t force you to use an IRB. Whew! Except… When are you supposed to submit an IND? Surely that’s not some incredibly broad set of circumstances that could apply to almost anyone doing almost anything, is it?</p>

<p>Behold:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/79386/download"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/FDA.png" alt="Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND"></a></p>

<p>This is a supposedly “nonbinding” document that just explains old rules. <em>Supposedly</em>, the FDA is just publishing this as a helpful service to all the mouth-breathers who can’t understand federal regulations. But everyone in industry behaves as if it’s a new law. Which is understandable, since the written regulations are so confusing and ambiguous.</p>

<p>If you read this guidance, you will discover that an IND is needed if:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The research involves a “drug”</li>
  <li>The research is a “clinical investigation”</li>
  <li>The research is not exempt.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to avoid an IND, then (2) and (3) are little help. A “clinical investigation” is <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-312/section-312.3#p-312.3(Clinical%20investigation)">defined</a> as anything where a “drug” is given to human subjects. And the exemptions are extremely narrow: They are only for <em>marketed</em> drugs where the drug is being used for the labeled purpose as directed. Testing something already approved for a disease? Not exempt. Testing if normal food helps with some new disease? Not exempt. You’re only exempt if you’re doing research on something the FDA has already accepted to be true.</p>

<details>
  <summary>
(Click here for details)
</summary>

  <p>“Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?
If you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an
unlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is
considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However,
if you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate
the drug’s ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the
clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs
(see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance.”</p>

  <p>“If a product containing substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food is
administered to subjects in a study intended to evaluate the effect of the substance on the
pathogenesis of a human disease, is an IND required?
Substances designated as GRAS for use in food are generally not approved as drug products. A
clinical investigation of a GRAS substance that is intended to evaluate the product’s ability to
diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease requires an IND under part 312, unless the
substance to be studied is also a lawfully marketed drug and the clinical investigation meets the
criteria for exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b).”</p>
</details>

<p>If you want to avoid an IND, your best hope is that your research doesn’t involve a “drug”. Unfortunately, the term “drug” is defined extremely broadly, way beyond the colloquial meaning of  “drug” in English. A drug is defined to include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also includes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get that? Here’s a little picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/drug.pdf"><img src="https://dynomight.net/img/irb/drug.svg" alt="drug chart"></a></p>

<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking. “That can’t be right! That would mean that if I wanted to study if some normal food reduced the odds of, say, diabetes, then I wouldn’t just need IRB approval, I would also need to submit a freaking <em>IND</em>! That would be stupid!”</p>

<p>But the FDA is quite clear that this <em>is</em> right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As is the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is “intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,” except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug (see section VI.D.3). Therefore, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on a disease would require an IND under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on the signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease would require an IND.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/institutional-review-boards-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=54.">also says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?</strong></p>

  <p>Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized.</p>

  <p>An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first, I thought this couldn’t possibly be true. In 2017, it apparently cost $619,200 to submit an IND application to the FDA. However, in practice it appears that there are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/72340/download">many exceptions</a> and that there are <a href="https://academicentrepreneurship.pubpub.org/pub/aan4seyc/release/4">two categories</a> of INDs: Commercial and research. I assume the FDA doesn’t actually try to charge researchers $619,200 to review their research projects, but I don’t really know.</p>

<p>The FDA’s IND application page is <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/ind-application-procedures-overview">here</a>. Have fun.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how seriously people take these FDA regulations in practice. People <em>do</em> seem to get IND approval for research on actual (chemical) drugs. But does anyone actually seek IND approval if they want to study if diet influences obesity? Do they carefully avoid talking about disease, so they can fall under the looser “structure and function of the body”? And is <em>private research</em> on <em>normal food</em> really a form of inter-state commerce? I’m just not sure.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-learned">What I’ve learned</h2>

<p>Mostly I’ve learned that the set of abstractions I was using to think about the world were wrong. I assumed that there were “laws” that someone had written, and that someone could read to understand what is legal and what isn’t.</p>

<p>But in reality, politicians write vague laws, and then agencies write vague sprawling regulations, and then those agencies issue vague “clarifications”. Sometimes these might be unconstitutional or illegal, but no one knows unless they want to fight things in court. But courts are unpredictable, and even going to court is ruinously expensive. Trying to comply with the the written law is like trying to comply with a giant mound of potatoes.</p>

<p>So people basically operate as if the law doesn’t exist. The “law” is what the people who enforce the law choose to enforce. If you need to live in this world, that’s what you pay attention to. The law is what you can get away with.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-would-change">What I would change</h2>

<p>All the IRB rules were designed by medical doctors to regulate the research of other medical doctors, thinking about incidents like the Tuskegee syphilis study.</p>

<p>But here’s an opinion: Needing to submit an application before you can ask people to fill out some simple online survey is stupid. Needing to submit an application before you can interview a bunch of people is stupid.</p>

<p>I like incremental change, so why don’t we start by making “exempt” research <em>actually exempt</em>? For example, <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2018-07-19/title-45/part-46#p-46.104(d)(3)(ii)">45 CFR 46.104(d)(3)(ii)</a> exempts “benign behavioral interventions” from IRB review. But you still need to <em>apply</em> to prove you’re exempt. Why?</p>

<p>As an analogy, driving a car is dangerous. Whenever I drive, I could easily kill someone. But the government doesn’t force me to submit a driving plan any time I want to go somewhere. Instead, if I misbehave, I am punished <em>in retrospect</em>. Why don’t we apply the same policy to research?</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I found AI to be completely useless at parsing all these federal regulations. Maybe you need AI that’s specifically trained to be good at parsing legal text?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Say I want to feed potatoes to my friends and see if that reduces diabetes. Maybe that’s dumb. Fine. But the FDA seems to be claiming that it is constitutionally permitted to regulate this because by doing this I would be engaging in “interstate commerce”. Really?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc."><em>Chevron</em> decision</a> might have some implications for all this?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can tell, no one has ever been prosecuted anyone for failure to comply with IRB requirements. It’s not even clear what the penalty would be. In practice, rules are enforced on <em>institutions</em>—if one failed to comply, then their “assurance” might be cancelled, meaning they couldn’t take any federal funding for research. Or, if they wanted to sell something, the FDA might refuse to approve it for sale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you chaotic good? Then you may find it interesting that it seems to be relatively easy to form a new IRB. (<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/irb-registration/irb-registration-faq/index.html">HHS rules</a> / <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/77059/download">FDA rules</a>). And that while all federally funded institutions require IRB approval for all research, only some require approval from <em>their</em> IRB. You can probably see where this is going.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>FOSDEM 2025</span> LibreOffice is a big, mature chunk of code now, but that doesn't make it impossible to teach it impressive new tricks. Some of them could make it more important than ever.</p>
<p>The open-source office suite had its own <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/libreoffice/" rel="nofollow">program stream</a> at FOSDEM, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdempwa.com/event/5735?year=2025&amp;day=null&amp;test=false" rel="nofollow">pre-announcement</a> of the new <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/25.2" rel="nofollow">LibreOffice release 25.2</a>. It has been around in some form since 1985, so this version marks its 40th year. It's middle-aged and, almost inevitably, that means it's big, a bit saggy in places, it definitely has some issues, and it doesn't look as good as it did a couple of decades ago.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean it can't be taught interesting things. Even a 40-year-old can acquire new skills and take on entirely new roles.</p>

    

<p>One of these was the&nbsp;subject of a talk by Allotropia's Thorsten Behrens, <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6504-distributed-real-time-collaboration-for-writer-a-first-prototype/" rel="nofollow">Distributed real-time collaboration for Writer – a first prototype</a>. This is a mode where multiple people, each with their own local copy of LibreOffice Writer running on their own machine, can all work together simultaneously on the same collaborative document. There's a little more info in his <a target="_blank" href="https://fosdem.org/2025/events/attachments/fosdem-2025-6504-distributed-real-time-collaboration-for-writer-a-first-prototype/slides/236805/fosdem_cr_zFtxHDK.pdf" rel="nofollow">slide deck</a> [PDF], which explains that this is achieved using CRDTs, or <a target="_blank" href="https://crdt.tech/" rel="nofollow">conflict-free replicated data types</a> – the same tech whose use we described in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/15/zed_editor_arrives_on_linux/">Zed programmer's editor</a> last year.</p>

        


        

<p>It's the same sort of functionality that you get from Google Docs, and indeed this is already possible using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/01/collabora_releases_code_2205_webbased/">Collabora Online web-based version of LibreOffice</a>. The big difference is that such tools run in a browser, so you need to be online. What makes the CRDT implementation different is that this is a local app, working on a local file, but using a network copy to keep changes in sync. The idea is to free you from keeping your apps and data on someone else's computer, without losing the handy collaborative features that web apps bring.</p>
<p>We also met up with Thorsten for a demo of one of his other babies, <a target="_blank" href="https://zetaoffice.net/" rel="nofollow">ZetaOffice</a>. This is a version of LibreOffice built for the Wasm runtime, which means it can run inside a browser. He demonstrated it to us on an AMD Ryzen-powered developer-spec ThinkPad, but the same binaries could run on any OS and on any CPU, such as ARM hardware. ZetaOffice went into public beta <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.allotropia.de/2024/11/08/launching-zetaoffice/" rel="nofollow">last November</a>, and a first release is looming very soon.</p>

        

<p>This is a big undertaking and it's been a long time coming. <em>The Register</em> first covered its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/16/libreoffice_team_working_on_port/">early stages in 2021</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/19/webassembly_port_libreoffice/">first experimental build in 2022</a>. Last week, Thorsten was able to show it running happily in Firefox.</p>
<p>He showed us it running in multiple modes. You can embed any of the LibreOffice apps into a web page, complete with their normal user interface and so on, much like Google Apps. This enables a website to offer a very rich editing experience of text, spreadsheets, presentations, or anything else. ZetaOffice can also be embedded, scripted, and controlled using the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/allotropia/zetajs" rel="nofollow">zetajs wrapper</a>, so you can call it to display embedded rich objects in web pages. We were rather taken by a demo that displayed a moving line chart of ping times to the <code>zetaoffice.net</code> website. A script was extracting the times from the ping command, adding lines to a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet, graphing the last dozen or so lines and embedding the graph in a web page.</p>
<p>He told us that the Allotropia development team sees ZetaOffice as orthogonal to Collabora Office (or COOL for short). COOL runs in the browser and has simultaneous multiuser editing. ZetaOffice runs in the browser too, but it's perfectly able to run locally and doesn't need an uplink. For now, though, it's single user. The company will make a cross-platform version that is also available for local installation.</p>

</ul>
<p>The real power comes from the scriptability and integration with JavaScript, though. We are sure lots of people will find uses for the ability to embed any document LibreOffice can open into any web page, control and automate it from JavaScript, with the choice of a full local user interface – or none, just the content, controlled with a JavaScript UI instead. The code is all under the MIT licence, so it's all-FOSS, and all the work is being upstreamed to LibreOffice itself.</p>
<p>This is big stuff in more than one way. LibreOffice isn't lightweight anyway. Opening a document in a web page can pull in a gigabyte or so of code, and the memory footprint is a bit more than that. It is still in beta, though, and the team is working hard on modularizing the code into multiple smaller chunks so that it will load much faster and take less memory.</p>

        

<p>The potential flexibility here&nbsp;is impressive, though. You could have a portable app on a USB key that was usable on a PC or Mac or Chromebook, regardless of the OS, without installation. Web apps suddenly acquire full rich cross-platform document handling and editing, including, of course, all the main Microsoft files and formats.</p>
<p>Despite Sun's best efforts over the years – from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2002/02/25/sun_to_charge_for_staroffice/">charging a pittance for StarOffice</a> to convince management types of its value, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2004/02/04/sun_finally_ships_staroffice/">porting it to Solaris</a>, offering <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2008/11/17/sun_staroffice_nine/">commercial support</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/09/28/openoffice_independence_from_oracle/">rebranding it as OpenOffice</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/08/06/libreoffice_50_debuts_complete_with_fewer_german_code_comments/">finally releasing LibreOffice</a> – it never managed to displace Microsoft's stranglehold on the office desktop. Maybe componentizing it and letting it run in-browser will give it a new lease of life. ®</p>

<p>The world's fourth-most-richest man – a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/23/business/elon-musk-trump-family-friends-backers.html">good friend</a> also of the world's richest man <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/opinion_column_musk/">Elon Musk</a> – insisted artificial intelligence is soon going to change everyone's lives "across the board."</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I have to tell the AI model as much about my country as I can. We need to unify all the national data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If governments want in, they’ll need to gather all their data – spatial information, economic data, electronic healthcare records including genomic data, and info about infrastructure. Whatever they’ve got, basically. And put it all in one place to be analyzed by algorithms. The American multi-billionaire used the United States as an example, if not a goal.</p>
<p>"I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can," Ellison said. "We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it's easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like," he said. "That's the missing link."</p>

    

<p>He believes the payoff will include better healthcare, thanks to treatments tailored to individuals, and the ability for governments to lift food production by better predicting crop yields. Analyzing land so that farmers can be advised where to apply fertilizers or increase irrigation was another scenario Ellison floated.</p>

        


        

<p>"As long as countries will put their data - all of it - in a single place we can use AI to help manage the care of all of the patients and the population at large," Ellison said, adding his belief that AI can handle other social services and eliminate fraud.</p>
<p>Of course, such a vast database system could also be the precursor to pervasive surveillance – an idea Ellison last year <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/16/oracle_ai_mass_surveillance_cloud/">said</a> he feels is desirable and would like Oracle to help facilitate.</p>

        

<p>Constant real-time surveillance of populations, analyzed by Oracle-powered machine-learning products, would keep everyone "on their best behavior," Ellison said at an Oracle financial analyst conference in September 2024. We're reminded of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/06/26/nsa_spy_program_aclu/">NSA</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/06/07/prism_plan_for_nsa_surveillance_of_internet_companies/">PRISM</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/01/24/snowden_speaks_nsa_whistleblower_calls_for_global_privacy_standards/">Snowden</a> <em>et cetera</em>.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/13/larry_ellison_worth_15_billion/">Oracle AI buzz means Larry Ellison's worth $15B more today</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/21/ai_policy_trump/">Prepare for an AI policy upending under Trump, say experts</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/11/oracle_1gw_datacenter_smr_plan/">Oracle wants to power 1GW datacenter with trio of tiny nuclear reactors</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/06/federal_court_leashes_doges_tresury_access/">Federal judge tightens DOGE leash over critical Treasury payment system access</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ellison is not just a techno-optimist. He’s also a top executive and shareholder who has made big AI investments as well as a database company to feed.</p>
<p>He therefore told the Dubai audience that Oracle, already a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/08/doge_us_goverment_tech_spending/">big-time government and military contractor</a>, is ready to help nations realize his above-mentioned AI visions. Ie: Put all this data into one big expensive Oracle system to learn from and process.</p>
<p>"Oracle is building a 2.2GW datacenter that costs between $50 and $100 billion dollars to build," Ellison said, noting it's sites like that where super-powered AI models will be trained. "Because these models are so expensive, you won't build your own as a rule. There'll be a handful of these models."</p>
<p>And a handful of players that can train them. Oracle’s own facilities will likely be one. The super-corp has also joined another, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/22/openai_stargate_ai_datacenter_company">Stargate project</a>, that plans to blow $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US in the next four years. ®</p>

These options include:</span></p><ol><li><p>TSMC setting up an advanced packaging factory in the U.S., offering a full suite of services from foundry to packaging.</p></li><li><p>TSMC joining other firms as investors in Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a division being spun off from Intel, with TSMC transferring its technology as part of its shareholder role.</p></li><li><p>Allowing Intel to handle the packaging process for TSMC's Arizona-based operations.</p></li></ol><p>However, TSMC has not disclosed its stance on any of these proposed strategies, nor has it confirmed plans to expand its Arizona site as speculated by the market. Instead, TSMC's Board of Directors approved a capital budget of approximately $17.14 billion, less than half of the $38-42 billion projected for 2025 during its earnings conference in January. TSMC said the budget will be allocated toward long-term capacity planning based on market demand and technology development, covering the construction and upgrading of advanced process capacity, packaging, and specialty processes without specifying the locations.</p><p><a href="https://tspasemiconductor.substack.com/" rel="">SemiVision</a><span> analysts told </span><em>TechSoda</em><span> that Amkor has already pilot-run Nvidia’s chip packaging processes. Therefore, any proposal requesting TSMC to hand the advanced chip packaging orders to Intel will hurt Amkor. </span></p><p>Even if TSMC agrees to transfer technology to Intel, there’s no shortcut in the manufacturing processes of semiconductors because it takes a lengthy and painful effort to finetune for yield optimization. </p><p><span>Further reports from </span><a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/baird-notes-supply-chain-talk-of-intel-fab-spinoff-with-tsmc-involved#google_vignette" rel="">Baird analyst Tristan Gerra</a><span> citing supply chain chatters that the U.S. government may push for TSMC to send engineers to Intel's 3nm/2nm fabs, contributing expertise to ensure that Intel’s manufacturing projects remain competitive. This news led to a 7.2% increase in Intel’s stock price after a 6% surge the day before, while TSMC’s shares fell by over 1%, with another 1.3% drop in the Taiwan Stock Exchange trading session.</span></p><p>Another possibility Baird raised is that Intel’s fab could be spun off into a joint entity owned by TSMC and Intel, with TSMC taking the helm. According to sources, the new entity could benefit from U.S. Chip Act funding.</p><p><span>This arrangement would require TSMC to prioritize U.S. interests over its own shareholders, many of whom are American. If TSMC’s executives compromise their company's interests for a local customer (which is also a foundry competitor), </span><strong>could this lead to shareholder backlash or even collective litigation</strong><span>?</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, if TSMC rejects the proposals, the U.S. government could impose a 100% tariff on chips made in Taiwan, potentially </span><a href="https://techsoda.substack.com/p/may-you-live-in-interesting-times" rel="">crippling the legacy chip manufacturers in Taiwan</a><span> and forcing many of them to surrender their American market share to competitors such as those from China. Indeed, China has increased its semiconductor manufacturing capacities so </span><a href="https://techsoda.substack.com/p/chip-wars-escalate-can-us-counter" rel="">aggressively</a><span> that </span><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250208PD205/dram-inventory-revenue-2025-market.html" rel="">memory prices plunged and stayed flat</a><span> partly due to weak demand and partly due to oversupply.</span></p><p>As TSMC weighs its options, one question looms: whether to comply with the geopolitical pressures or to resist, preserving its autonomy and shareholder interests.</p><p>TSMC has previously announced the progress of mass production and construction of three plants, which, after a delay of many months from the 5-nanometer change to the 4-nanometer U.S. plant, has now entered mass production, the monthly production capacity of the first quarter of 2026 about 30,000 wafers, the second plant is expected to move in the equipment in the second half of 2026 at the fastest.</p><p>In addition to the originally announced 3nm, 2nm process will also be introduced to Arizona. It is expected that by the end of 2027, 4/3nm monthly production capacity of about 50,000 wafers, 2nm production will begin in 2028, and the third plant is expected to produce 2nm or below advanced process technology before 2030.</p><p>There is still room for three extra facilities at the TSMC Arizona site.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/iridium-satellite">https://spectrum.ieee.org/iridium-satellite</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43037623">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="White Hat Hackers Expose Iridium Satellite Security Flaws"><p><span>In a recent demonstration, German white hat <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hackers">hackers</a> showed how to intercept text messages sent via the U.S. satellite communication system <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/iridium">Iridium</a> and locate users with an accuracy of about 4 kilometers.</span></p><p>The two<strong></strong>hackers, known publicly only under the nicknames Sec and Schneider, made the revelations during a presentation at the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/infos/index.html" target="_blank">Chaos Communication Congress</a> in late December in Hamburg, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/germany">Germany</a>. During the talk, they highlighted severe vulnerabilities in services that tens of thousands of users from the U.S. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/department-of-defense">Department of Defense</a> rely on.</p><p>Although the DoD uses a secure gateway to route and encrypt its traffic, the hackers were able to see which devices were connecting via the DoD pathway. That allowed the duo to identify and locate DoD users with an accuracy of about 4 km using a home-assembled eavesdropping kit consisting of a commercially available Iridium antenna, a <a data-linked-post="2658479890" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/passive-radar-with-sdr" target="_blank">software-defined radio</a> receiver and a basic computer, such as the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> N100 mobile <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cpu">CPU</a> or the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> mini-computer. </p><p>“We see devices that register with the DoD service center and then we can find their positions from these registrations,” Sec said during the talk. “You don’t have to see the communication from the actual phone to the network, you just see the network’s answer with the position, and you then can map where all the registered devices are.”</p><h2>Iridium’s Legacy Components Still Cause Problems</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.iridium.com/network/" target="_blank">Iridium constellation</a>, first deployed in the late 1990s, is made up of 66 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellites">satellites</a> disbursed across six orbital planes roughly 870 km above Earth. The constellation, the first to have provided global commercial <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellite-communications">satellite communications</a> services, supports satellite <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telephony">telephony</a> and connects pagers, emergency beacons, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things">Internet of Things</a> devices all over the world. Out of Iridium’s 2.3 million subscribers, 145,000 are U.S. government customers. Iridium receivers are also frequently used by vessels at sea and by aircraft pilots exchanging information with other airplanes and with ground control.</p><p>“Back then <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/encryption">encryption</a> was not something on everyone’s mind,” Sec said during the presentation. “All the [first generation] Iridium data is unencrypted.” (Iridium didn’t respond to a request to comment.)</p><p>Iridium replaced its first-generation fleet with more secure satellites (the second-generation <a href="https://www.iridium.com/blog/iridium-next-review/" target="_blank">NEXT constellation</a>) between 2017 and 2019. But according to satellite and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telecommunications-industry">telecommunications industry</a> analyst Christian von der Ropp, many Iridium devices in use today, including civilian <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/satellite-phones">satellite phones</a>, still rely on the first-generation Iridium radio protocol that has no <a data-linked-post="2666125398" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fully-homomorphic-encryption" target="_blank">encryption</a>.</p><p>“The regular satellite phones that they sell still operate under the old legacy protocol,” says von der Ropp. “If you buy a brand-new civilian Iridium phone, it still operates using the 30-year-old radio protocol, and it is subject to the same vulnerability. So, you can intercept everything. You can listen to the voice calls, you can read <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/sms">SMS</a>, absolutely everything. Out of the box it’s a totally unsecure service.”</p><p>Von der Ropp estimates that tens or even hundreds of thousands of Iridium devices in use today rely on the old, unsecured radio protocol. </p><h2>Hackers Reveal Vulnerabilities in Iridium’s Systems</h2><p>While the DoD uses an extra layer of encryption to protect the content of its exchanges, other nations’ agencies appear to be less aware of the vulnerabilities. In perhaps the most jaw-dropping moment of the hacking demonstration, Sec revealed a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/text-message">text message</a> exchanged between two employees of the German Foreign Office that he and Schneider were able to intercept.</p><p>“I need a good doctor in [Tel Aviv] who can also look at gunshot wounds. Can you send me a number ASAP,” read the message sent by a worker at the Crisis Response Center of the German Foreign Office’s mission in Tel Aviv. The hackers did not reveal when the exchange had taken place. </p><p>Using software he and Schneider had created, Sec also showed a map of devices visible in a single moment to their eavesdropping gear located in Munich. Iridium devices as far as London, central <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/norway">Norway</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/syria">Syria</a> (more than 3,000 km away) could be seen.</p><p>“With US $400 worth of equipment and freely available software, you can start right away intercepting Iridium communications in an area with a diameter of hundreds, sometimes even thousands of kilometers,” said von der Ropp, who was present at the demonstration. “The Iridium signal is divided into spot beams that are about 400 km wide. In principle, one should only be able to listen to the spot beam overhead. But the signal is so strong that you can also detect many of the surrounding spot beams, sometimes up to 2,000 km away.”</p><p>The DoD, von der Ropp said, is looking for alternatives to Iridium, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/starlink">Starlink</a>. Still, last year Iridium won a $94 million contract to provide communication services to the U.S. Space Force. </p><p>Von der Ropp noted that few Iridium users seemed to be active in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, suggesting the local forces are potentially aware of Iridium’s shortcomings. The vulnerability of satellite systems and services to disruption and interference by bad actors has become a hot topic since Russia’s invasion of the country three years ago. The widespread cyberattack on the ground infrastructure of satellite communication provider Viasat crippled the Ukrainian forces’ access to satcom services on the eve of the invasion. The incident, which  according to analysts was planned by Russian state-backed hackers for months, revealed the weakness of Viasat’s cyber defenses. </p><p>Since then, the number of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cyberattacks">cyberattacks</a> on satcom providers has increased exponentially. Global navigation and positioning satellite systems such as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/GPS">GPS</a> have also been put to the test. <a data-linked-post="2659993248" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-jamming" target="_blank">Signal jamming</a> is now a regular occurrence even outside conflict zones and instances of sophisticated <a data-linked-post="2670499105" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/gps-spoofing-2670499105" target="_blank">spoofing attacks</a>, designed to confuse users and send them to wrong locations, are becoming increasingly common.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
    <p>Back in the late 2000s, I was a major contributor to the Wii homebrew scene. At the time, I worked on software (people call them “jailbreaks” these days) to allow users to run their own unofficial apps on the Nintendo Wii.</p>
<p>I was passionate about my work and the team I was part of (Team Twiizers, later fail0verflow). Despite that, I ended up burning out, primarily due to the very large fraction of entitled users. Most people using our software just wanted to play pirated games (something we did not support, condone, or directly enable). We kept playing a cat and mouse game with the manufacturer to keep the platform open, only to see our efforts primarily used by people who just wanted to steal other people’s work, and very loudly felt entitled to it. It got really old after a while. As newer game consoles were released, I ended up focusing on Linux ports purely for fun, and didn’t attempt to build a community nor work on the jailbreaks/exploits that would end up becoming a tool used by pirates.</p>
<p>When Apple released the M1, I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project. The technical challenges were the same as my console homebrew projects of the past (in fact, much bigger), but this time, the platform was already open - there was no need for a jailbreak, and no drama and entitled users who want to pirate software to worry about. And running Linux on an M1 was a <em>much</em> bigger deal than running it on a PS4.</p>
<p>I launched the Asahi Linux project, and received an immense amount of support and donations. Incredibly, I had the support I needed to make the project happen just a few days after my call to action, so I got to work. The first couple of years were amazing, as we brought the platform from nothing to one of the smoothest Linux experiences you can get on a laptop. Sure, there were/are still some bits and pieces of hardware support missing, but the overall experience rivaled or exceeded what you could get on most x86 laptops. And we built it all from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation. It was an impossible feat, something that had never been done before, and we pulled it off.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things became less fun after a while. First, there were the issues upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, which I’ve already spoken at length about and I won’t repeat here. Suffice it to say, being in a position to have to upstream code across practically every Linux subsystem, touching drivers of all categories as well as some common code, is an <em>incredibly</em> frustrating experience.</p>
<p>But then also came the entitled users. This time, it wasn’t about stealing games, it was about features. “When is Thunderbolt coming?” “Asahi is useless to me until I can use monitors over USB-C” “The battery life sucks compared to macOS” (nobody ever complained when compared to x86 laptops…) “I can’t even check my CPU temperature” (yes, I seriously got that one).</p>
<p>And, of course, “When is M3/M4 support coming?”</p>
<p>For a long time, well after we had a stable release, people kept claiming Asahi Linux and Fedora Asahi Remix in particular were “alpha” and “unstable” and “not suitable for a daily driver” (despite <a href="https://stats.asahilinux.org/">thousands of users</a>, myself included, daily driving it and even using it for servers).</p>
<p>No matter how much we did, how many impossible feats we pulled off, people always wanted more. And more. Meanwhile, donations and pledges kept slowly <em>decreasing</em>, and have done so since the project launched. Not enough to spell immediate doom for my dream of working on Asahi full time in the short term, but enough to make me wonder if any of this was really appreciated. The all-time peak monthly donation volume was the very first month or two. It seemed the more things we accomplished, the less support we had.</p>
<p>I knew burnout was a very real risk and managed this by limiting my time spent on certain areas, such as kernel upstreaming. This worked reasonably well and was mostly sustainable at the time.</p>
<p>Then 2024 happened. Last year was incredibly tumultuous for me due to personal reasons which I won’t go into detail about. Suffice it to say, I ended up traveling for most of the year, all the while having to handle various abusers and stalkers who harassed and attacked me and my family (and continue to do so).</p>
<p>I did make some progress in 2024, but this left me in a very vulnerable position. I hadn’t gotten nearly as much Asahi work done as I’d liked, and the users weren’t getting any quieter about demanding more features and machine support.</p>
<p>We shipped conformant Vulkan drivers and a whole emulation stack for x86-64 games and apps, but we were still stuck without DP Alt Mode (a feature which required deep reverse engineering, debugging, and kernel surgery to pull off, and which, if it were to be implemented properly and robustly, would require a major refactor of certain kernel subsystems or perhaps even the introduction of an entirely new subsystem).</p>
<p>I slowly started to ramp work up again at the beginning of this year, feeling very stressed out and guilty about having gotten very little work done for the previous year. “Full” DP Alt support was still a ways away, but we were hoping to ship a limited version that only worked on a specific Type C port for each machine type in the first month or two of the year. Sven had gotten some progress into the PHY code in December, so I picked it up and ended up beating the code of three drivers into enough shape that it mostly worked reliably. Even though it wasn’t the best approach, it was the most I could manage without having another huge bikeshed discussion with the kernel community (I did <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/fda8b831-1ffc-4087-8e7b-d97779b3ecc5@marcan.st/T/#u">try</a> to bring the subject up on the mailing lists, but it didn’t get much response).</p>
<p>The issues Rust for Linux has had surviving as an upstream Linux project are well documented, so I won’t repeat them in detail here. Suffice it to say, I consider Linus’ handling of the integration of Rust into Linux a major failure of leadership. Such a large project needs significant support from major stakeholders to survive, while his approach seems to have been to just wait and see. Meanwhile, multiple subsystem maintainers downstream of him have done their best to stonewall or hinder the project, issue unacceptable verbal abuse, and generally hurt morale, with no consequence. One major Rust for Linux maintainer already resigned a few months ago.</p>
<p>As you know, this is deeply personal to me, as we’ve made a bet on Rust for Linux for Asahi. Not just for fun (or just for memory safety), either: Rust is the entire reason our GPU driver was able to succeed in the time it did. We have two more Rust drivers in our downstream tree now, and a third one on track to be rewritten from C to Rust, because Rust is simply much better suited to the unique challenges we face, and the C driver is becoming unmaintainable. This is, by the way, the same reason the new Nova driver for Nvidia GPUs is being written in Rust. More modern programming languages are better suited to writing drivers for more modern hardware with more complexity and novel challenges, unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Some might be wondering why we can’t just let the Rust situation play out on its own over a longer period of time, perhaps several more years, and simply maintain things downstream until then. One reason is that, of course, this situation is hurting developer morale in the present. Another is that our Apple GPU driver is itself major evidence that Rust for Linux is fit for purpose (it was the first big driver to be written from scratch in Rust and brought along with it lots of development in Rust kernel abstractions). Simply not aiming for upstream might be seen as lack of interest, and hurt the chances of survival of the Rust for Linux effort. But there’s more.</p>
<p>In fact, the Linux kernel development model is (perhaps paradoxically) designed to encourage upstreaming and punish downstream forks. While it is possible to just not care about upstream and maintain an outright hard fork, this is not a viable long-term solution (that’s how you get vendor Android kernel trees that die off in 2 years). The Asahi Linux downstream tree is continuously rebased on top of the latest upstream kernel, and that means that every extra patch we carry downstream increases our maintenance workload, sometimes significantly. But it goes deeper than that: Kernel/Mesa policy states that upstream Mesa support for a GPU driver cannot be merged and enabled until the kernel side is ready for merge. This means that we also have to ship a Mesa fork to users. While our GPU driver is 99% upstreamed into Mesa, it is intentionally hard-disabled and we are not allowed to submit a change that would enable it until the kernel side lands. This, in practice, means that users cannot have GPU acceleration work together with container technologies (such as Docker/Podman, but also including things like Waydroid), since standard container images will ship upstream Mesa builds, which would not be compatible. We have a <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-asahi/mesa-asahi-flatpak">partial workaround</a> for Flatpak, but all other container systems are out of luck. Due to all this and more, the difficulty of upstreaming to the Linux kernel is hurting our downstream users today.</p>
<p>I’m not the kind to let injustices go when I see them, so when yet another long-term maintainer abused his position to attempt to hinder R4L and block upstreaming progress, I spoke out. And the response (which has been pretty widely covered) was the last drop that put me over the edge. I resigned from my position as an upstream maintainer for Apple ARM support, as I no longer want to be involved with that community. Later in that thread, another major maintainer unironically stated <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250208204416.GL1130956@mit.edu/">“We
are the ‘thin blue line’”</a>, and nobody cared, which just further confirmed to me that I don’t want to have anything to do with them. This is the same person that previously prompted a Rust for Linux maintainer to <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240828211117.9422-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/">quit</a>.</p>
<p>But it goes well beyond the public incident. In the days that followed, I learned that some members of the kernel and adjacent Linux spaces have been playing a two-faced game with me, where they feigned support for me and Asahi Linux while secretly resenting me and rallying resentment behind closed doors. All this occurred without anyone ever sending me any private email or otherwise clueing me into what was going on. I heard that one of these people, one who has a high level position in multiple projects that Asahi Linux must interact with to survive, had sided with and continues to side with individuals who have abused and harassed me directly. Apparently there were also implied falsehoods, such as the idea that I am employed by someone to work on Asahi (I am not, we have zero corporate sponsorship other than <a href="https://bunny.net/">bunny.net</a> giving us free CDN credits for the hosting).</p>
<p>I get that some people might not have liked my Mastodon posts. Yes, I can be abrasive sometimes, and that is a fault I own up to. But this is simply not okay. I cannot work with people who form cliques behind the scenes and lie about their intentions. I cannot work with those who place blame on the messenger, instead of those who are truly toxic in the community. I cannot work with those who resent public commentary and claim things are better handled in private despite the fact that nothing ever seems to change in private. I cannot work with those who denounce calling out misbehavior on social media to thousands of followers, while themselves roasting people both on social media and on mailing lists with thousands of subscribers. I cannot work with those in high-level positions who use politically charged and discriminatory language in public and face no repercussions. I cannot work with those who say I’m the problem and everything is going great, while major supporters and maintainers are actively resigning and I keep receiving messages from all kinds of people saying they won’t touch the Linux kernel with a 10-foot pole.</p>
<p>When Apple released the M1, Linus Torvalds <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/linus-torvalds-wants-apples-new-m1-powered-macs-to-run-linux">wished it could run Linux</a>, but didn’t have much hope it would ever happen. We made it happen, and Linux 5.19 was <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wgrz5BBk=rCz7W28Fj_o02s0Xi0OEQ3H1uQgOdFvHgx0w@mail.gmail.com/T/#u">released from an M2 MacBook Air running Asahi Linux</a>. I had hoped his enthusiasm would translate to some support for our community and help with our upstreaming struggles. Sadly, that never came to pass. In November 2023 I sent him <a href="https://gist.github.com/marcan/fe70ee6648f3d5ae94eb8332265b8d95">an invitation</a> to discuss the challenges of kernel contributions and maintenace and see how we could help. He never replied.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, Con Kolivas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707151924/http://apcmag.com/why_i_quit_kernel_developer_con_kolivas.htm">left the Linux kernel community</a>. An anaesthetist by day, he was arguably the last great Linux kernel hobbyist hacker. In the years since it seems things have, if anything, only gotten worse. Today, it is practically impossible to survive being a significant Linux maintainer or cross-subsystem contributor if you’re not employed to do it by a corporation. Linux started out as a hobbyist project, but it has well and truly lost its hobbyist roots.</p>
<p>When I started Asahi Linux, I let it take over most of my life. I gave up most of my hobbies (after all, this was my dream hobby), and spent significantly more than full time working on the project. It was fun back then, but it’s not fun any more. I have an M3 Pro in a box and I haven’t even turned it on yet. I dread doing the bring-up work. It doesn’t feel worth the trouble.</p>
<p>I miss having free time where I can relax and not worry about the features we haven’t shipped yet. I miss <a href="https://youtube.com/@TsuiokuCircuit">making music</a>. I miss attending jam sessions. I miss going out for dinner with my friends and family and not having to worry about how much we haven’t upstreamed. I miss being able to sit down and play a game or watch a movie without feeling guilty.</p>
<p>I’m resigning as lead of the Asahi Linux project, effective immediately. The project will <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2025/02/passing-the-torch/">continue on without me</a>, and I’m working with the rest of the team to handle transfer of responsibilities and administrative credentials. My personal Patreon will be paused, and those who supported me personally are encouraged to transfer their support to the <a href="https://opencollective.com/asahilinux">Asahi Linux OpenCollective</a> (GitHub Sponsors does not allow me to unilaterally pause payments, but my sponsors will be notified of this change so they can manually cancel their sponsorship).</p>
<p>I want to thank the entire Asahi Linux team, without whom I would’ve never gotten anywhere alone. You all know who you are. I also give my utmost gratitude to all of my Patreon and GitHub sponsors, who made the project a viable reality to begin with.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hiring me or know someone who might be, please get in touch. Remote positions only please, on a consulting or flexible time/non exclusive basis. Contact: <a href="mailto:marcan@marcan.st">marcan@marcan.st</a>.</p>

<p>The job of a web rendering engine is vast, and much of this work, such as
styling, media, or layout, is driven by standards. These standards ensure that
independent engines can be interoperable, which has allowed the web to flourish.
But some finer details, such as how text is rendered at the pixel level, are
often left to interpretation by the standards bodies, and typically end up
relying on the operating systems that browsers run on.</p>

<p>In 2020, Microsoft Edge had a rare opportunity—a complete replacement of its
underlying rendering engine.
<a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdge/blob/master/README.md">Edge transitioned to Chromium</a>,
away from a Windows-only platform where it used Windows APIs directly, and
became a true cross-platform web renderer. Before the switch to Chromium, Edge
relied entirely on a Windows API called
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directwrite/direct-write-portal">DirectWrite</a>
for text rendering. However, Chromium relies on <a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a>, a
powerful and flexible cross-platform graphics engine, which abstracts many of
the operating system-specific code from its API.</p>

<p>During Edge's transition to Chromium, the Edge team had the opportunity to
gather feedback from its users about the Chromium rendering engine. One piece of
feedback was significant—many Edge users shared that text appeared "washed out"
and that it didn't look consistent with text in other parts of Windows.</p>

<p><img src="https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google.png" alt="Text looked washed out on Chrome on Windows pre-132." srcset="https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_36.png 36w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_48.png 48w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_72.png 72w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_96.png 96w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_480.png 480w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_720.png 720w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_856.png 856w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_960.png 960w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_1440.png 1440w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_1920.png 1920w,https://developer.chrome.com/static/blog/better-text-rendering-in-chromium-based-browsers-on-windows/google_2880.png 2880w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 856px"></p>

<p>The team took this feedback seriously and did some investigation. While Skia
uses DirectWrite on Windows for certain functionality such as font lookup, the
final text rasterization is actually handled directly by Skia. And one major
factor in the "washed out" feedback from users is the internal contrast and
gamma settings for text rendering.</p>

<p>Two main differences in text contrast and gamma values were uncovered between
Edge's Chromium-based engine and its prior engine. First, Skia does not pick up
text contrast and gamma values from the
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/cleartype/">Windows ClearType Tuner</a>.
Secondly, it uses different default values for text contrast and gamma than
those used by Edge's DirectWrite-based text stack.</p>

<p>The Edge team added support for respecting the ClearType Tuner values in
Chromium directly, last year. This gave Chromium-based browser users the ability
to control text contrast and gamma settings on Windows. While this was a
significant step in the right direction, most users tend to not adjust their
system-wide text contrast and gamma settings. So the next phase in this journey
was to seriously consider adjusting the default text contrast and gamma settings
for both web and browser UI text content.</p>

<p>Changing what text looks like on the web is a large undertaking. The web has
always been text heavy, and a high-quality text engine is necessary. It was
evident that the text contrast value needed to increase, but data was needed to
determine how much to adjust it.</p>

<p>The Edge team began experimenting with various text contrast values back in
2021. After a lot of user research, members of both Edge and Chromium determined
that a contrast value of 1.0 closely matched the text rendering of pre-Chromium
Edge and looked consistent compared to other native Windows applications.</p>

<p>On the Edge team, we believed our research and experiments could be beneficial
to the overall Chromium community on Windows, so we shared our findings with the

proceeded to enable the new contrast value by default for Windows builds,
starting with Chrome&nbsp;132.</p>

<p>Today, all users of Chromium-based browsers on Windows can benefit from these
past years of shared research, experimentation, and implementation.</p>

From Australia and Japan to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01504-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01504-8" data-track-category="body text link">Brazil</a> and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01392-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01392-w" data-track-category="body text link">United Kingdom</a>, there are concerns that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03369-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03369-1" data-track-category="body text link">high living costs</a>, low stipends and limited job options after graduation are deterring people from pursuing doctoral degrees.</p><p>These declining numbers should “act as a wake-up call” for those countries, says Cláudia Sarrico, a project lead at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris. “This is a signal you need to reform working conditions and think about diversifying career options — otherwise, you risk a talent drain that will ultimately slow down scientific progress.”</p><p>The <a href="https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/media-item/phd-poverty-crisis-declining-enrolments-risk-our-economic-future/" data-track="click" data-label="https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/media-item/phd-poverty-crisis-declining-enrolments-risk-our-economic-future/" data-track-category="body text link">most recent figures</a> on this trend, released by Universities Australia and the Australian Council of Graduate Research (ACGR) in January, revealed an 8% reduction in the number of domestic PhD enrolments in Australia from 2018 to 2023, although the population of the country grew by more than 7% over the same period.</p><h2>PhD poverty</h2><p>In many countries, one of the biggest factors deterring students from pursuing doctoral degrees is the high cost of living relative to how much they get paid.</p><p>In Australia, the average PhD stipend is roughly Aus$32,000 (US$20,000). “It is well under the minimum wage,” says Louise Sharpe, president of the ACGR, based in Melbourne, Australia. And although it is just above the poverty line for people who are single, the average doctoral student in the country is in their late thirties — often having come with experience working in different sectors — and have families and other responsibilities, Sharpe adds.</p><p>Financial insecurity is also one of the chief concerns for doctoral students in Japan, where the number of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03136-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03136-4" data-track-category="body text link">PhD students</a> has been dropping since the early 2000s. In 2023, the number of domestic PhD enrolments was 15,014, compared with a high of 18,232 in 2003. In response to this issue, Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), announced plans last year to provide <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02718-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02718-6" data-track-category="body text link">extra funding for doctoral students</a>.</p><p>People have also been losing an interest in postgraduate education on the other side of the ocean. Last year, the Brazilian Federal Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES) released a <a href="https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br/centrais-de-conteudo/documentos/19122023_pnpg_2024_2028.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br/centrais-de-conteudo/documentos/19122023_pnpg_2024_2028.pdf" data-track-category="body text link">report</a> revealing that, in 2022, the country saw its lowest number of domestic PhD entrants in almost a decade. One factor was the COVID-19 pandemic, but that was not the only reason for the drop, says CAPES president Denise Pires de Carvalho, headquartered in Brasilia. The economic crisis in Brazil, along with the government’s unwillingness to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01504-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01504-8" data-track-category="body text link">increase funding</a> for science and technology were also major contributors, Pires de Carvalho says.</p><p>Things are beginning to shift. In 2023, the Brazilian government increased the value of grants for master’s and doctoral students by 40% — the first increase in a decade. This change brought with it a slight increase in enrolments in that same year.</p><p>In Canada, where PhD numbers haven’t yet dropped, a need for more funding to provide a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01453-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01453-8" data-track-category="body text link">living wage</a> for doctoral students has been a big discussion over the past few years, says Adam Sarty, president-elect of the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies, who is based in Halifax. Last year, the Canadian government responded to this need by increasing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01124-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01124-2" data-track-category="body text link">graduate-student scholarships</a> for the first time in more than two decades. This has been a welcome change, but Sarty notes that these grants only go to the top students — and extra changes are needed to provide more financial security to those who don’t win these scholarships.</p><p>But many Canadian universities are under financial strain because of a dip in enrolments in professional graduate programmes, such as MBAs, owing to a cap on international students that was put into place in 2024. Countries such as the United Kingdom have seen similar rules put in place in recent years — raising concerns about universities’ abilities to support early-career researchers.</p><h2>Job precarity</h2></div></div>]]></description>

Once funds are appropriated to a federal agency by Congress, deobligating them would effectively terminate them. The only way to get the money back, once deobligated, would be to go through the Treasury, sources within FEMA told Drop Site.</span></p><p><span>Now that the Trump administration and DOGE have been </span><a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5138733-judge-ruling-doge-treasury/" rel="">blocked</a><span> by the courts from accessing the Treasury payment system, deobligating funds would be a new workaround—rendering appropriated funds unusable from within federal agencies.</span></p><p>At least four FEMA employees have been fired with letters that cite Article II of the Constitution, “executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America,” and “this termination is an exercise of that power.” A source within FEMA told Drop Site: “the four people fired were just following instructions as required by Congress.” One of the fired employees had even “achieved excellence” in a recent performance review.</p><p>FEMA staff asked their bosses how employees were notified they were fired. “I don’t know,” an administrator replied. This led FEMA workers to wonder: if administrators are not responsible for the firings, who is? When asked, union representatives told FEMA employees they “didn’t think it was appropriate to mention” who fired the employees and how.</p><p>DOGE currently has FEMA employees tasked with combing through grants for DEI-related keywords for all grants dating back to 2021. DOGE’s list of “problematic" keywords include: Disadvantaged, Marginalized, Underserved, Environmental Justice, Climate, Equity, Equitable, Inclusion, Diversity, and Culture.</p><p>One source within FEMA confirmed to Drop Site that the funds being reviewed were appropriated by Congress. FEMA does not have discretion over how funds are used. Their job is to guarantee recipients—the most vulnerable populations in America—meet the requirements outlined by Congress.</p><p>As a consequence of DOGE gaining access to IFMIS, it now has access to personally identifiable information on migrants and disaster relief grant applicants. DOGE has access to Alien Numbers—called A-numbers within FEMA—for any migrants in the Shelter and Services Program (SSP). A-numbers help the agency track services allocated to migrants. A-numbers are like the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) version of a social security number. They can be used to trace any funds allocated by FEMA to migrants, pull personally identifiable information, and access final destination information in the CBP system.</p><p>The Disaster Relief Fund portion of FEMA has migrated their financial management to IFMIS as well, meaning DOGE has the names, addresses, and social security numbers for anyone who has applied for disaster relief, according to sources within FEMA.</p><p>DOGE claims to be auditing FEMA. But sources within FEMA report that the DOGE employees are primarily “computer science guys” and do not understand the basics of financial management.

		<p>In the span of just weeks, the US government has experienced what may be the most consequential security breach in its history—not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role. And the implications for national security are profound.</p>
<p>First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wyden.senate.gov/post/3lh5ejpwncc23">accessed</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">the</a> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-doge-treasury-access-federal-payments.html">US</a> <a href="https://therecord.media/union-groups-sue-treasury-over-giving-doge-access-to-data">Treasury</a> computer system, giving them the ability to collect data on and potentially control the department’s roughly <a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/fds/">$5.45 trillion</a> in annual federal payments.</p>
<p>Then, we learned that uncleared DOGE personnel had gained access to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/usaid-security-leaders-removed-refusing-elon-musks-doge-employees-acce-rcna190357">classified</a> data from the US Agency for International Development, possibly copying it onto their own systems. Next, the Office of Personnel Management—which holds detailed personal data on millions of federal employees, including those with security clearances—<a href="https://fedscoop.com/opm-email-federal-workforce-lawsuit-server-privacy-security/">was</a> <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/elon-musk-seizes-computer-system-171738117.html">compromised</a>. After that, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-aides-search-medicare-agency-payment-systems-fraud-wsj-reports-2025-02-05/">Medicaid and Medicare records</a> were compromised.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, only partially redacted names of CIA employees <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5129170-cia-email-employee-identities/">were sent</a> over an unclassified email account. DOGE personnel are also reported to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/">feeding</a> Education Department data into artificial intelligence software, and they have also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-doge-members-raise-access-concerns-us-energy-department-sources-say-2025-02-07/">started working</a> at the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>This story is moving very fast. On Feb. 8, a federal judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-musks-doge-accessing-payment-systems-2025-02-08/">blocked</a> the DOGE team from accessing the Treasury Department systems any further. But given that DOGE workers have already copied data and possibly installed and modified software, it’s unclear how this fixes anything.</p>
<p>In any case, breaches of other critical government systems are likely to follow unless federal employees stand firm on the protocols protecting national security.</p>

<p>The systems that DOGE is accessing are not esoteric pieces of our nation’s infrastructure—they are the <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/elon-musk-weaponizes-the-government">sinews of government</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the Treasury Department systems contain the technical blueprints for how the federal government moves money, while the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) network contains information on who and what organizations the government employs and contracts with.</p>
<p>What makes this situation unprecedented isn’t just the scope, but also the method of attack. Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. The Chinese government’s 2015 breach of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html">OPM</a> was a significant US security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.</p>
<p>In this case, external operators with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">limited experience</a> and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny: gaining the highest levels of <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base">administrative access</a> and making changes to the United States’ most sensitive networks, potentially introducing new security vulnerabilities in the process.</p>
<p>But the most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted. It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/usaid-officials-put-on-leave-musk-doge">by</a> removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.</p>
<p>The Treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: No single person should have unlimited power. Just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.</p>
<p>This approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. When your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. When a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. These aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. These measures have been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">bypassed or ignored</a>. It’s as if someone found a way to rob Fort Knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.</p>
<p>The implications for national security are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/the-biggest-breach-of-u-s-government-data-is-under-way/">staggering</a>. Sen. Ron Wyden said his office had learned that the attackers gained <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/173776/security/elon-musk-s-doge-granted-full-access-to-sensitive-treasury-systems.html">privileges</a> that allow them to modify core programs in Treasury Department computers that verify federal payments, access encrypted keys that secure financial transactions, and alter audit logs that record system changes. Over at OPM, reports indicate that individuals associated with DOGE <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/elon-musk-doge-lawsuit/">connected</a> an unauthorized server into the network. They are also reportedly <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-doge-running-highly-sensitive-government-data-through-ai-report-2000560381">training</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/">AI</a> software on all of this sensitive data.</p>
<p>This is much more critical than the initial unauthorized access. These new servers have unknown capabilities and configurations, and there’s no evidence that this new code has gone through any rigorous security testing protocols. The AIs being trained are certainly not secure enough for this kind of data. All are ideal targets for any adversary, foreign or domestic, also seeking access to federal data.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why every modification—hardware or software—to these systems goes through a complex planning process and includes sophisticated access-control mechanisms. The national security crisis is that these systems are now much more vulnerable to dangerous attacks at the same time that the legitimate system administrators trained to protect them have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-aides-lock-government-workers-out-computer-systems-us-agency-sources-say-2025-01-31/">locked out</a>.</p>
<p>By modifying core systems, the attackers have not only compromised current operations, but have also left behind vulnerabilities that could be exploited in future attacks—giving adversaries such as Russia and China an <a href="https://therecord.media/doge-opm-treasury-cybersecurity">unprecedented</a> <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/musk-doge-opm-treasury-breach/">opportunity</a>. These countries have long targeted these systems. And they don’t just want to gather intelligence—they also want to understand how to disrupt these systems in a crisis.</p>
<p>Now, the technical details of how these systems operate, their security protocols, and their vulnerabilities are now potentially exposed to unknown parties without any of the usual safeguards. Instead of having to breach heavily fortified digital walls, these parties &nbsp;can simply walk through doors that are being propped open—and then erase evidence of their actions.</p>

<p>The security implications span three critical areas.</p>
<p>First, system manipulation: External operators can now modify operations while also altering audit trails that would track their changes. Second, data exposure: Beyond accessing personal information and transaction records, these operators can copy entire system architectures and security configurations—in one case, the technical blueprint of the country’s federal payment infrastructure. Third, and most critically, is the issue of system control: These operators can alter core systems and authentication mechanisms while disabling the very tools designed to detect such changes. This is more than modifying operations; it is modifying the infrastructure that those operations use.</p>
<p>To address these vulnerabilities, three immediate steps are essential. First, unauthorized access must be revoked and proper authentication protocols restored. Next, comprehensive system monitoring and change management must be reinstated—which, given the difficulty of cleaning a compromised system, will likely require a complete system reset. Finally, thorough audits must be conducted of all system changes made during this period.</p>
<p>This is beyond politics—this is a matter of national security. Foreign national intelligence organizations will be quick to take advantage of both the chaos and the new insecurities to steal US data and install backdoors to allow for future access.</p>
<p>Each day of continued unrestricted access makes the eventual recovery more difficult and increases the risk of irreversible damage to these critical systems. While the full impact may take time to assess, these steps represent the minimum necessary actions to begin restoring system integrity and security protocols.</p>
<p>Assuming that anyone in the government still cares.</p>

<hr>



<p>So a bit under 3 years ago, I made my infamous Wayland rant post that is likely the most read post on this blog by miles. I should really actually write about music again one of these days, but that's a topic for another time. The language was perhaps a bit inflammatory, but I felt the criticisms I made at the time were fair. It was primarily born out some frustrations I had with the entire ecosystem, and it was not like I was the only sole voice. There are other people out there you can find that encountered their own unique Wayland problems and wrote about it.</p>

<p>With that post, I probably cast myself as some anti-Wayland guy which is my own doing, but I promise you that is not the case. You can check my mpv commits, and it's businesses as usual. Lots of Wayland fixes, features, and all that good stuff. Quite some time has passed since then, and it is really overdue look at the situation again with all the new developments in mind. To be frank, my original post is very outdated and it is not fair to leave it up in its current state without acknowledging the work that has been done. So in comparison to 3 years ago, I have a much more positive outlook now.</p>

<br>

<h2>Upstream Wayland basically fixed most of the technical things I complained about.</h2>

<p>I mean honestly that kind of sums it up. In retrospect, it is a bit surprising. Maybe I should publicly complain more if it gets me these kinds of results (this is a joke everybody). But a good example here would be the support of explicit sync. Not too long ago, I did not think we were going to be anywhere close to this being a thing. To be frank, Linux in general was pretty far behind on this front. Getting explicit sync took a lot of work all over the graphics space: kernel, mesa, protocol changes, compositors, etc. Nvidia of all companies (a certain famous Linus video comes to mind) was a key player in making this a reality. Kudos to everyone who put in work to get that done. I honestly assumed we were still going to be implicit sync only for most of the 2020s.</p>

<p>Another big development is the introduction of the commit-timing and fifo protocols to finally solve the dreaded "compositor stalls the rendering thread" issue. In the past, clients on Wayland had no way to know if they were visible and compositors would indefinitely throttle the rendering thread of your client if you rendered offscreen. For many, the workaround in this case is to set mailbox mode (or the equivalent in whatever you are doing) and just blast away. People that raised issues with this behavior upstream often got mixed responses, so I was skeptical that this would ever change.</p>

<p>Mesa now currently supports commit-timing and fifo in vulkan which allows surfaces to stay in vsync without being indefinitely stalled by the compositor, as long as the compositor supports it of course. This was particularly important for people playing games through wine and whatnot. It is not like refactoring the rendering loop of ancient proprietary games to be Wayland-friendly was realistically possible, so this behavior was quite a brick wall. Compositor implementations are still in the works for this and there's still no support on the EGL side yet, but from my testing it works perfectly well. From mpv's perspective, it allows us to skip a particular piece of code that I personally find quite cursed, so I am rather happy about this. It's also potentially possible to use commit-timing and fifo internally for some of our other Wayland VOs. That requires investigation.</p>

<p>Speaking of Mesa, I did bash it a little bit in the old post, so I suppose I need to apologize now. It's true that at the time, the implementations were a bit on the lacking side, but it's a much different story now. In those 3 years since then, a massive amount of effort has been put into Wayland wsi. Lots of developers made some rather large sweeping changes. Things like immediate mode, explicit sync, presentation timestamps, etc. are all in there now. There's also an open MR right now for the color management protocol for the vulkan in Mesa. That protocol has been in development hell for a long time, but we're all finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I expect it will be finalized in the near future. There are several proven implementations, and the only comments left are all relatively minor. Once that's all in place, HDR on Wayland will actually just work out of the box. It's exciting honestly.</p>

<br>

<h2>The wayland-protocols upstream itself got way better.</h2>

<p>It's not exactly a secret, but wayland-protocols was a bit of a painful upstream. It is not that any of the main people were unpleasant or anything; I've had mostly positive experiences myself. It's was just more that movement in general in that space was colossally slow and every little thing got discussed to death. The bar for getting protocols in was incredibly high, and it just seemed like something that was nearly impossible.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if there's a definite turning point, but things in that repo move much faster than they used to. There was a fairly high profile merge request to add an experimental namespace to wayland-protocols. This is, of course, welcome, but honestly even before that I thought the repo had already made leaps and bounds when it came to reviewing and accepting contributions. When I made my original post, wayland protocols was at 1.25. At the time of writing, we are on 1.40, so a whopping 15 more versions. And it is not like those are just small pointless bumps. Lots of protocols that I would consider fairly major (fractional-scale, linux-drm-syncobj, tearing-control, fifo, etc.) found their way into upstream in that time frame. One of the common Wayland complaints was how restricted you felt as client sometimes and protocols like that go a very long way in addressing that concern.</p>

<p>Heck even the little things are better now. I never complained about it much because it is not a big deal, but I always thought that the default stance of Wayland to use client side cursors was silly. Most applications don't care about drawing the cursor at all. Considering that most compositors are going to be drawing a cursor anyway, why not just let clients use that? And indeed this was fixed with the cursor shape protocol. All the little annoyances about inconsistent cursor sizes go away if you just let the compositor handle it. Again, not a major issue or anything but it's a nice example of one of those little pestering things being addressed. Furthermore, there's even a screencopy protocol in upstream as well. This was another one of those things I thought that was going to be a "never ever" since many compositor developers were not particularly found of the idea of clients potentially recording the screen. Now sure, plenty of compositors do not support it currently, but at least you can finally target something purely through Wayland APIs to get what you need.</p>

<br>

<h2>Of course, nothing is perfect.</h2>

<p>In the past, I felt a bit annoyed at people overselling Wayland when there were so many things still wrong with it on the fundamental level. But it's a dramatically different story today. For most use cases, Wayland should be as good or even better at this point. There is a big list of factors that you need to weigh to make this assessment, but the scales are in Wayland's favor. Now of course, there's still plenty of work to do. One personal pain point of mine is the inability to embed foreign surfaces without making your application its own compositor. This is one of those things that works fine on other platforms, but is still lacking on Wayland. Another is the whole issue with an application with multiple windows managing them on Wayland. That was a fairly visible issue when it was brought up, and work is still being done trying to find a solution for that.</p>

<p>In terms of development philosophy, the usual group of compositor/upstream developers are still a lot more on the "policy" side of the fence as opposed to "mechanism". I personally lean the opposite, but the Wayland side of the house has gotten much more flexible lately. A lot of things that you used to just not be able to do are possible now. As a small pain point, the general Wayland ecosystem is still a bit chaotic. You have the army of compositors to deal with and the plethora of protocols to thumb through. It's just a consequence of the core protocol being so small and everyone writing their own server implementations instead of sharing one, but it's manageable. Sure I have to write a bunch of boilerplate for any protocol I want to use and test against the usual group of compositors to figure out if it's my bug or their bug, but if it does what I need, I'm a happy camper at the end of the day.</p>

<br>

<h2>So what about Xorg?</h2>

<p>The story is a bit interesting here since 2024 saw a surge in activity in Xorg due to mostly one guy although that may end up being a fluke. Time will tell on that one. There are people that are quick to deride Xorg, but I still think it has its place and there will still be many users of it (not just xwayland) for many years to come. Sure, GTK 5 won't support Xorg which is not surprising, but I doubt QT or most applications in general are looking to delete their Xorg backends anytime soon. And there's still some known gaps between Xorg and Wayland compositors. For example, the recently publicized about mouse latency differences is true and something I've noticed but the difference doesn't particularly bother me. Something like that is just one of those inevitable consequences of the design of Wayland being so fundamentally different.</p>

<p>I do still wish that Wayland could have been a bit more conservative and "Xorg-like" in its original approach. It's, of course, far too late for that, but it does feel like a lot of the underlying pain points are self-inflicted and could have been avoided with less radical design choices. But at the same time, it is true that Wayland is where all of the work is going these days and I would say it has eclipsed Xorg in most things at this point minus some specific areas. As for Xorg, if people still want to develop and use it, I see no problem with that. It can coexist just fine. Perhaps one day in the future I'll realize that virtually nobody uses any of the Xorg code. When we reach that point, I can consider removing the code. But that seems far off into the future, and I see no reason worry about that anytime soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'll be fair to Wayland and compositor developers. They've fixed <em>a ton</em> of stuff recently and deserve credit for it. On mpv's side of the house, I've been helped multiple times and have gotten good contributions from multiple compositor developers. It's been a long haul, but truly things in a far better state now. The amount of progress in a relatively short period of time is remarkable and honestly unexpected. It's not right to continue to be grouchy and negative when real problems are being solved. We'll see how the rest of the decade goes, but it's looking like an uphill trajectory thus far.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Today, when my 1.9-year-old daughter tried to grab and eat an unwashed orange, I asked her to give it to me so I could wash and peel it if she could wait for a moment. She did. It got me thinking about the marshmallow experiment, where the idea was that patience equals success. But … it wasn’t the whole story.</p>



<p>The marshmallow experiment is famous: a little kid in a room staring at a marshmallow. If they wait 15 minutes, they get two marshmallows instead of just one. Some kids would poke the marshmallow, lick it, or just gobble it up. Others found clever ways to distract themselves – singing, closing their eyes, even falling asleep. The results – children who waited supposedly went on to achieve higher scores in school and better life outcomes. The message was clear: if you can delay gratification, you’re set for life.&nbsp;But later studies revealed some serious holes in that conclusion.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Marshmallow Test | Igniter Media | Church Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QX_oy9614HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>First of all, it’s not just about willpower. A follow-up study showed that kids from stable, reliable homes were much more likely to wait than kids from unpredictable ones. If you’re a kid and the adults in your life constantly break promises, why would you trust them this time? Why wait for the second marshmallow if history tells you it might not show up? Waiting isn’t a character trait; it’s a strategy. And strategies are shaped by experience.</p>



<p>Kids are like tiny detectives, watching and learning from every single thing we do. My toddler loves routines – the same bedtime story, the same morning/evening ritual. He thrives on knowing what’s next. So when I tell him to wait and then actually deliver, I’m teaching him something important: trust. But if I say “five more minutes” and don’t follow through, I’m sending a different message – that waiting might not be worth it.</p>



<p>Back to the marshmallow test. Another big revelation came when researchers looked at economic backgrounds. Kids from wealthier families waited longer than kids from low-income families. Not because they had more self-control, but because their environment made waiting feel safer. If you grow up knowing there will always be food on the table, waiting for an extra marshmallow isn’t a big deal. But if your life is more uncertain, grabbing what you can when you can make total sense.&nbsp;It’s a survival skill, not a lack of discipline.</p>



<p>This reminds me of a moment last week. My daughter asked me to swing her in my arms, but I was busy and promised her we’d do it once I finished my work. She switched to another task and waited. When I finally asked, “Would you like to have fun now?” she cheerfully screamed, “Yes!” Would she have trusted me if I forgot about it? Probably not.</p>



<p>Kids crave predictability. That’s why they ask for the same bedtime story 300 nights in a row. It’s why they get upset if the routine changes without warning. Predictability equals safety. And safety builds trust. When they trust us, they’re willing to wait, to try, to take risks.</p>



<p>So, here’s where the marshmallow test gets it wrong: it’s not just about the kid’s ability to wait; it’s about the adult’s ability to create an environment worth waiting in. If we, as parents, and teachers, aren’t consistent, why would a kid believe us when we say, “Just hold on, something better is coming”?</p>



<p>Another thing I’ve noticed is how much modeling matters. My daughter watches everything I do. If I tell her to wait and then lose my patience two seconds later because the internet is slow, what’s the lesson there? Waiting is for other people? The best way to teach patience is to live it – easier said than done …</p>



<p>The marshmallow test also doesn’t account for cultural differences. In some cultures, waiting is baked into daily life. Think about Japan, where kids are often taught to wait quietly for meals or gifts. Compare that to the US, where instant gratification is practically a way of life. These cultural norms shape how kids approach situations like the marshmallow test. It’s not just about personality; it’s about the world they live in.</p>



<p>In 2012, researchers added a modification to the marshmallow experiment. Before the test, kids were split into two groups. One group experienced a broken promise (they were told they’d get crayons to draw with, but never did). The other group experienced a kept promise (they actually got the crayons). Then came the marshmallow test. Which group waited longer? The kids who saw promises kept. The trust made all the difference.</p>



<p>So what’s the takeaway here? It’s simple, really: as parents, we set the tone. Our actions, promises, and reliability shape how our kids see the world. Are we building an environment where they feel safe enough to wait? Or are we teaching them that they need to grab what they can, when they can?</p>



<p>The marshmallow test highlights how our actions shape our kids’ lives. Small gestures – like keeping promises, sticking to “just five more minutes,” or reading bedtime stories – build trust and security. These moments might even help them wait for their own second marshmallow – or decide they don’t need to. Ultimately, it’s about the environment we are creating for them. And who knows, maybe one day they will pass their own version of the marshmallow test – not because they have to, but because they know they can.</p>

        <p>Since the start of the new Trump administration, hundreds of federal data sets and government websites have gone offline without warning, sometimes returning with major changes and sometimes not returning at all.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2025/feb/04/the-fight-to-preserve-federal-government-data/">a range of civil society organizations had been preparing for this scenario</a>. Just last week, Harvard’s Library Innovation Lab team released 16 terabytes of archived data.gov — <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/02/06/announcing-data-gov-archive/">a complete collection of the data that platform had hosted</a>.</p>
