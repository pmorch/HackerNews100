Independent of his work with Buffett, Munger is a successful businessman and philanthropist in his own right. An avid reader and life-long, multidisciplinary learner, he is admired for his witty life lessons and often-too-blunt pieces of advice. Born in 1924, he is 96 years young. </p><p><h2><b>When handing out misfortune, life has no obligation to be fair.</b></h2></p><div><p>In 1953, Charlie was 29 years old when he and his wife divorced. He had been married since he was 21. Charlie lost everything in the divorce, his wife keeping the family home in South Pasadena. Munger moved into “dreadful” conditions at the University Club…</p><p><b>Shortly after the divorce, Charlie learned that his son, Teddy, had leukemia</b>. In those days, there was no health insurance, you just paid everything out of pocket and <b>the death rate was near 100% since there was nothing doctors could do</b>. Rick Guerin, Charlie’s friend, said Munger would go into the hospital, hold his young son, and then walk the streets of Pasadena crying.</p><p>One year after the diagnosis, in 1955, Teddy Munger died. <b>Charlie was 31 years old, divorced, broke, and burying his 9 year old son.</b></p></div><p><h2><b>If you are misfortunate, a victim mentality is incredibly useful if you wish to remain miserable…</b></h2></p><div><p>Whenever you think that some situation or some person is ruining your life, [think that] it’s actually you who are ruining your life. It’s such a simple idea. <b>Feeling like a victim is a perfectly disastrous way to go through life</b>. </p><p>If you just take the attitude that, however bad it is in anyway, <b>it’s always your fault and you just fix it as best you can</b> – the so-called ‘iron prescription’ – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U0TE4oqj24&amp;utm_source=www.butwhatfor.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=charlie-munger-feeling-like-a-victim-is-perfectly-disastrous" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">I think that really works</a>.</p></div><p><h2><b>… as self-pity itself is guaranteed to never improve your position.</b></h2></p><div><p>Well you can say that’s waggery, but I suggest that every time you find you’re drifting into self-pity, I don’t care what the cause, your child could be dying of cancer, <b>self-pity is not going to improve the situation…</b></p><p>It’s a ridiculous way to behave, and <b><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/p/suppose-wanted-kill-lot-ofpilots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">when you avoid it you get a great advantage over everybody else</a></b>, almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard condition and yet you can train yourself out of it.</p></div><p><h2><b>Alternatively, you can accept personal responsibility to better your situation…</b></h2></p><div><p><b>Another thing of course is life will have terrible blows, horrible blows, unfair blows, doesn’t matter</b>. And some people recover and others don’t. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. </p><p>He thought that every mischance in life was an opportunity to behave well, every mischance in life was an opportunity to learn something, and <b>your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity but to utilize the terrible blow in a constructive fashion. </b><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDcOuTdjq8E&amp;utm_source=www.butwhatfor.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=charlie-munger-feeling-like-a-victim-is-perfectly-disastrous" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">That is a very good idea</a></b><b>.</b></p></div><p><h2><b>… because even in the worst of situations, you can still better yourself.</b></h2></p><div><p><b>We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation</b>, when facing a fate that cannot be changed.

And when they closed the banks in 1933, the banking examiners came in and said you can't reopen and it was the only business he had. </p><p>Well judge Munger always saved this money and he had a lot of good first mortgages on homes occupied by teetotaling German butchers and people he’d carefully pitch.

After all, </span><em>most</em><span> </span><em>startups</em><span> are doomed, </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/bdm/us_age_naics_00_table5.txt" rel="">just by the numbers</a><span>.</span></p><p>I’m trying to say something more provocative. Almost all startups formed from post-ChatGPT hype and who specifically label themselves as “AI startups” are doomed.</p><p>Now, I am a VC who has been investing in AI for a long time—and, in fact, originally left the hedge fund world because I saw so much happening in AI. So, I’m definitely not an AI skeptic.</p><p>That being said, I fundamentally think most of what’s getting funded in the current hype cycle is valueless from an investor’s perspective.</p><p>Let’s tackle the easiest case.</p><p><span>I’ve met numerous startups who essentially glue together a few generative AI APIs, do some prompt engineering, and slap a front-end user interface on it. Some of these products are </span><em>quite</em><span> impressive in terms of polish and what they can do.</span></p><p><span>These companies are also all doomed to either be perfectly ok businesses (but not </span><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html" rel="">startups, by Paul Graham’s classic definition</a><span>) or die.</span></p><p><span>Obviously, if you built it over a weekend, someone else can do the same. Now, let’s say you’re a coding genius. A veritable 10X programmer prodigy! It might take everyone else in the world </span><em>several</em><span> weekends… but it’s going to get built.</span></p><p>If you basically give your project’s product away for free and are just having fun, no big deal.</p><p>However, if you start charging for it and customers start relying on it a lot, others can come in and just slightly undercut you. Maybe yours is still nicer. Being nicer does often drive product adoption and choice of one over another.</p><p>But if it’s actually important (i.e., commands a high willingness to pay and is used frequently), this is where the curse of economics and competition come into play. People are going to copy you and compete away your profits.</p><p>No defensibility and no differentiation = no profits. That’s basic economics.</p><p>Ok, so that was Econ 101 and also Startup 101. It’s not particularly unique to this area. Every hype cycle is essentially characterized by people forgetting that these rules exist, and then rediscovering them to their chagrin at the end of the cycle.</p><p><span>However, note that I’ve mainly been talking about these startups that just glue together APIs like those from ChatGPT together into UIs. </span><em>Those</em><span> obviously have very little differentiation and defensibility. Even if your UI is nicer, someone else can just come along and copy it.</span></p><p>My point is broader than just those trivial examples, though.</p><p>Let’s now apply this same logic to the underlying technology itself for LLMs like ChatGPT, Bard, LlaMA, and the like.</p><p><span>If I told you I had a fantastic technology that </span><em>everyone</em><span> will want to use, and to create it, what I had to do was:</span></p><ol><li><p>Gather all the text on the internet</p></li><li><p>Train it all using tons of GPUs and millions of dollars</p></li><li><p>Built it on well-known technologies, most of which are open-source</p></li></ol><p><span>Is that defensible? Point 1 and 2 might have some level of technical or logistical difficulty for small startups, but neither of those are particular insurmountable for other large companies—especially when combined with the fact of Point 3. All of these things are built on the same underlying architecture in transformers and LLMs. </span><strong>These LLMs have no real moat. Any large internet company can replicate them.</strong></p><p><span>And, indeed, </span><a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither" rel="">even Alphabet/Google internally have said this</a><span>.</span></p><p>The same applies for all image and video generative AIs. Just replace Point 1 with either images or video instead (side note: video may be an exception if Alphabet can choke off easy access to YouTube).</p><p>Ok, so we’ve established that it’s not super useful to just build an API in front of other people’s technologies (our trivial case). We’ve now also talked about why the less trivial case of LLMs is fundamentally indefensible.</p><p><span>What if I flex Point 3 above, and come up with the </span><em>best version of an LLM</em><span>? Or something like it in terms of some other field of AI?</span></p><p><span>Well, in theory, that’s interesting. Except, of course, for the fact of how fast the technological frontier of </span><em>the entire industry</em><span> is moving.</span></p><p><span>What if I told you in the 1990s that I had </span><em>the best</em><span> CPU? Mine is, like, 3 times the speed of Intel!</span></p><p><span>Given the expense and incredible difficulty of developing a CPU, that is indeed quite technically impressive! Of course, then the question is, can you repeat that feat year after year? Because your problem is, given how fast semiconductor technologies are moving at the time (Moore’s Law), you have an advantage for a year or two (maybe). Intel—and everyone else—will equal your performance. If you have some special sauce that lets you </span><em>continuously</em><span> stay ahead, that’s one thing, but more likely than not, you simply stumbled on a particular set of optimizations that everyone else will adopt quickly.</span></p><p>The same issue exists in AI today. The frontier is moving too fast, and the frontier of the entire AI academic and industry research community almost certainly has more firepower than your single company.</p><p>By the way, when we’re talking about firepower, this challenge applies even at the most massive scales. For example, China—by all quiet, anecdotal accounts—is not keeping up with the global (concentrated in the US) research community in the speed of AI development. Basically, everyone who branches off proprietary models falls behind quickly and ends up adopting the global state-of-the-art anyway. AI is just even worse than semiconductors because all of it tends to be open source, which just makes it even harder to hold any sort of long-standing advantage in algorithmic prowess.</p><p>As such, you don’t get any lasting value unless you’re able to make that year or two advantage actually count in building a lasting moat—which, if you think about it, is actually extremely hard.</p><p>Ok, so we’ve gone through this process of elimination. What’s actually left?</p><p><span>Well, you can either have something that’s so compute intensive that only you could possibly do the training or inference economically. That is unlikely, in my opinion, </span><a href="https://weightythoughts.com/p/compute-is-overrated-as-ais-bottleneck" rel="">given how AI has progressed in bringing down the quantity of data and compute required to achieve a certain result</a><span>. However, note that my opinion is somewhat unpopular. You can decide for yourself whether this point is true (which I talk about in the linked article above). However, least from an investor’s perspective, even if it </span><em>is</em><span> a true advantage, I’m uncertain whether I’m thrilled about a startup strategy to accumulate more GPUs/ASICs/FPGAs than Google, Facebook, Baidu, what have you…</span></p><p><span>Secondly, you can be operating in a place where you </span><em>can’t</em><span> simply harvest the data off the internet. For example, healthcare data that is siloed in hospitals, or not even collected at all today. Or, protein folding or pharmacokinetic reaction data that has to be painstakingly collected through real-world experiments. Or a ton of other things… all of which share the characteristic that it doesn’t exist in the pure digital world and can’t simply be scraped off the internet.</span></p><p><em>That</em><span> is where I see the value of most of AI startups being generated. Places where you can’t simply decide to go collect the data without prohibitive cost, time, and simply physical world messiness. These startups can simply ride the wave of AI improvements—it doesn’t matter, the algorithms are all commoditized anyway—but are the only ones who own and hold that proprietary, next-to-impossible to get real-world data.</span></p><p><span>Note, I mentioned </span><strong>startups</strong><span>. Many forget that just because value is created on a societal level, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the value is captured by a company at all. The Internet boom in the 1990s created tons of networking infrastructure, but the companies realized massively negative ROI from their investments. It was great for bringing communities online though, but that’s a societal benefit, not a company ROI.</span></p><p><span>In a more recent case, did you know that Azure actually runs </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/web3" rel="">tons of private blockchains</a><span>? It’s hard to actually break out on their financial results for various reasons, but many large companies run this stuff on Azure, making Microsoft one of the big winners in blockchain. (Yes, there’s a separate question of whether a private blockchain is really any different from, say, a database. But that’s irrelevant to my point here.)</span></p><p><span>The same thing is likely to happen with OpenAI, </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership" rel="">where OpenAI mostly looks like an R&amp;D lab for Microsoft</a><span>. Microsoft provides the computing resources in Azure, and in return, OpenAI develops the tools that Azure will then provide as hosted services. Azure can then make a bunch of money from ChatGPT and other stuff that can be pay-as-you-go API calls. This, of course, also looks the same with Bard and Google Cloud Compute, etc. as we go.</span></p><p><span>This principle runs through most of the AI sector today. There’s going to be a </span><em>lot</em><span> of value generated that just accrues to society, and isn’t captured by any private player. Which is wonderful, by the way—this is how technology becomes one of the few “free lunches” we have in society and macroeconomics.</span></p><p>There’s also going to be a lot of value generated that is simply captured by existing industry incumbents, using their market power and scale. That’s not a free lunch for society, but is also just how capitalism works and often still generates “surplus” (Econ speak for “good stuff”) for society.</p><p><span>Finally, there’s a fairly </span><em>narrow</em><span> slice that will be both value generated, and accrue to new, young companies, that ideally then can come along and replace the incumbents (which is how healthy market turnover happens).</span></p><p><strong>Those</strong><span> are the companies that will generate outsized returns and become tomorrow’s well-known tech names—and, of course, are what VCs are theoretically looking for. In reality, most investors are being a bit more indiscriminate in slinging money at AI startups (and even big, public companies that claim to have an “AI strategy”) right now. And, as such, are mostly flushing money down the drain.</span></p><p>AI is going to change the world. But most AI startups are doomed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

									<p>Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is overseeing a sweeping global investment program designed to counteract the world’s efforts to reduce demand for oil and tackle climate change, according to an undercover investigation by the Centre for Climate Reporting.</p>
<p>The program, which is chaired by the Crown Prince and his energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, aims to boost oil consumption across Asia and Africa, with the ultimate goal of protecting Saudi oil revenues from efforts to phase out fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia publicly claims to support the Paris climate change agreement, which aims to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C or 2C – requiring an almost total transformation of the way in which the world produces and consumes energy. The Crown Prince, also known as MBS, has said that the Kingdom needs to go “further and faster” in tackling climate change.</p>
<p>But an undercover investigation by the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) reveals how, in private, the Kingdom is seeking to ensure that emerging economies across Africa and Asia become vastly more dependent on oil, not less.</p>
<p>The Oil Demand Sustainability Program (OSP) is a vast government program with dozens of projects aimed at embedding a high-carbon, fossil fuel-dependent development model in countries across Africa and Asia. This includes meticulously researched plans to drive a major increase in gasoline and diesel-fuelled vehicles and boost jet fuel sales via increased air travel.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;“There’s a fundamental policy aim, which is to burn and exploit all Saudi’s oil reserves until the last drop”</p></blockquote>
<p>It brings together the most powerful arms of the Saudi state, including the $700 billion Saudi Public Investment Fund; the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco; petrochemicals giant, Sabic; and the Kingdom’s most important ministries – all under the auspices of the Crown Prince’s supreme committee of hydrocarbon affairs.</p>
<p>When asked by an undercover reporter whether the aim of the program is to artificially stimulate oil demand to counter global efforts to reduce oil consumption and tackle climate change, a Saudi official responded: “Yes… it is one of the main objectives that we are trying to accomplish.”</p>
<p>Following a six-month investigation, the Centre for Climate Reporting can – for the first time – reveal MBS’ secret plans to keep the world hooked on oil, even as the devastating impacts of global warming are beginning to bite.</p>
<p>The investigation, based on secret recordings, documents provided by Saudi officials to undercover reporters, and an analysis of regulatory filings, reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sophisticated strategy to deploy fleets of petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles across Asia and Africa so that Saudi Arabia can “capture the increasing gasoline/diesel demand.”</li>
<li>Plans to collaborate with an undisclosed global auto manufacturer to develop and produce a cheap car that can be sold in emerging markets to give “an oil uplift for the kingdom.”</li>
<li>Plans to fast-track commercial supersonic air travel, explicitly because it consumes three times more jet fuel than normal aircraft.</li>
<li>A plan to lobby against government subsidies for electric vehicles in countries around the world.</li>
<li>Plans to encourage the use of toxic heavy fuel oil to generate power in Africa and South Asia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to the investigation, Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a non-governmental organisation based in Nairobi focused on climate change, told CCR: “The Saudi government is like a drug dealer trying to get Africa hooked on its harmful product. The rest of the world is cleaning up its act and weaning itself off dirty and polluting fossil fuels and Saudi Arabia is getting desperate for more customers and is turning its sights on Africa.”</p>
<p>“It’s like the tobacco companies that knew the addictive and lethal nature of cigarettes yet continued to get millions of teenagers hooked on them,” Adow said, “it’s repulsive”.</p>
<p>Akinbode Oluwafemi, executive director of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), a civil society organisation headquartered in Lagos, told CCR that Africa needs “infrastructure that will reduce carbon emissions and not exacerbate the climate crisis.”</p>
<p>“This Saudi model is a Greek gift that will further sink Africa into climate catastrophe,” Oluwafemi said.</p>
<p>The Saudi Arabia energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

																	<h2>Climate leader</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Speaking at the<a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/604892"> launch of the Saudi Green Initiative</a> in March 2021, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, said the Kingdom would become a leader on climate change. He pledged to reduce Saudi emissions to net zero by 2060 and to play a leading role internationally to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>“The Kingdom, the region and the world needs to go much further and faster in combating climate change,” MBS said, “Young people, both in the kingdom and the world, are demanding a cleaner, greener and more inclusive future, and we owe it to them to deliver on this.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“OSP’s goal is to support the deployment of&nbsp; internal combustion engine fleets across developing countries”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the Kingdom has gone to great lengths to promote these commitments, with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNPQPo8-jNk"> glossy promotional videos</a> claiming the country is “leading the charge in tackling energy and climate challenges.”</p>
<p>Joanna Depledge, a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge who has authored academic papers on Saudi climate obstruction, told CCR that, despite a recent shift in tone, little has changed in the way Saudi Arabia approaches the climate change: “There’s everything you can possibly do except for reducing oil and gas production and consumption. Every single trick in the book.”</p>
<p>“It’s all part of the delay,” Depledge said, “I think basically there’s a fundamental policy aim, which is to burn and exploit all Saudi’s oil reserves until the last drop. That’s what they plan to do but that involves, obviously, a delaying of the climate change agenda and that’s what they’re doing. And all this can help to delay it.”</p>
<p>At the same time as developing the Saudi Green Initiative, MBS has overseen the development of a program designed to reverse global progress on phasing out oil, something scientists say is crucial if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

																	<h2>Sustainable development</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Only a small amount of information about the Oil Demand Sustainability Program (OSP) is publicly available. On its website and social media channels, the Saudi energy ministry largely characterises the OSP as a sustainable development initiative aimed at providing energy access to emerging economies.</p>
<p>Regulatory filings seen by CCR suggest that this characterisation is part of a deliberate strategy to avoid public communications that might suggest the program’s primary aim is to boost Saudi oil sales. Filings on the Saudi stock exchange show that a May announcement of a deal between OSP and another state entity, the Saudi Industrial Export Company, was corrected because it accidentally referred to boosting oil demand, rather than fostering energy access.</p>
<p>In the first version of the announcement, the objective of the partnership was described as being “sustaining the demand of oil.” A day later a correction was issued, with this wording removed and replaced with “increase energy access.”</p>
								</div>

											</div>

					
				
											<div>
									<p>CCR also found significant differences in the way the program is presented to English and Arabic speaking audiences, including its name. The English version of the Saudi energy ministry website states that the initiative is called the “Oil Sustainability Program” and says its mission is to ensure that “hydrocarbons remain part of the global energy mix in the most efficient and sustainable way.”</p>
<p>On the Arabic version of the website, the word sustainable appears to have a completely different meaning. The initiative is called برنامج استدامة الطلب على البترول which translates to “Oil Demand Sustainability Program.” It says its purpose is to “sustain and develop the demand for hydrocarbons” and ensure “that the transition in the energy mix takes place in an effective manner, sustainable for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”</p>

																	<h2>Cape Town</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>In May 2023, Mohammed Al Tayyar, head of the OSP, took to the stage at the annual conference of the African Refiners &amp; Distributors Association, a members-only event in the suburbs of Cape Town. He came with a message for the assembled politicians and oil executives: “come and work with us.”</p>
<p>According to documents and audio recordings obtained by CCR, Al Tayyar travelled to South Africa to pitch OSP as a sustainable development solution to Africa’s infrastructure problems, explaining how Saudi Arabia could help increase access to energy and facilitate investment in roads, airports, and the cars and planes to make use of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are actually conducting some studies to understand the psychological behaviour of these countries”</p></blockquote>
<p>Al Tayyar said that his team had developed forty-six projects, or “opportunities,” and hundreds of pages of business development strategy. The plan, he said, is to engage with stakeholders, ranging from governments and companies to international investment funds, to make them a reality.</p>
<p>Following the Cape Town conference, undercover journalists for the Centre for Climate Reporting contacted the OSP officials who had travelled to South Africa to set up a meeting. The aim was to find out more about a program which, on the surface, appears to be about helping countries in Africa and Asia to grow their economies, but which appeared to be oriented around solutions that benefit the Saudi economy.</p>
								</div>
							</div>

					
				
											<div>
																	<h2>The pitch</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Posing as international investors interested in funding some of the projects identified by Al Tayyar, CCR reporters attended a remote video conference with Saudi officials in Riyadh, who pitched the program’s key projects as potential areas for collaboration. During this private pitch, Saudi officials presented a different image of the OSP, based on slides not shown by Al Tayyar in Cape Town, which revealed an overriding objective to boost sales of Saudi oil.</p>
<p>The OSP officials detailed a vastly ambitious scheme, with plans to channel investment into ports, airports and roads across Asia and Africa, while ensuring that the ships, aeroplanes, cars and buses that use this infrastructure are powered by Saudi oil rather than cleaner forms of energy.</p>
<p>One of the officials, Nawaf Al-Fallaj, told the undercover reporters that the program’s forty-six projects had been selected from an initial batch of eighty, based partly on the scale to which they could boost oil demand, something he described as their “incremental demand potential”. He added that Saudi Arabia plans to deploy its sovereign wealth funds and diplomatic influence to make these projects a reality.</p>
<p>A slide deck shared on the call states that the strategy underpinning the program is to “unlock demand in emerging markets.” Undercover reporters asked the officials on the call if the aim is to artificially stimulate demand in emerging markets in order to offset a decline in oil demand due to efforts to tackle climate change. “Yes”, Al-Fallaj replied, “it’s one of the main objectives that we are trying to accomplish.”</p>

											<div>
																	<h2>Increasing demand</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>At the heart of the program is a plan to make sure that people around the world continue to drive diesel and petrol fuelled vehicles rather than switching to electric.</p>
<p>Saleh Aldayel, one of the OSP officials on the call, told undercover reporters that the plan is to facilitate investment in highways across Africa and Asia and to then fill these roads with vehicles that depend on oil. “In [the] case of roads, we aim to accelerate and enhance the impact and adoption of internal combustion engine technology,” Aldayel said</p>
<p>OSP officials were explicit about why Saudi Arabia wants to increase the number of oil-fuelled vehicles on the road, a slide deck shared by Aldayel states: “OSP’s goal is to support the deployment of ICE [internal combustion engine] fleets across developing countries to capture the increasing gasoline/diesel demand.”</p>
<p>This includes the development of ride hailing companies and local and regional bus companies. “OSP’s goal is to support the deployment of bus transportation across developing countries to capture the increasing diesel demand,” the presentation states.</p>
<p>Crucially, OSP officials said that they are in discussions with an undisclosed global auto manufacturer to develop cheap mass market cars that run on petrol or diesel and can be sold at scale in emerging markets. This would, Aldayel’s presentation says, “have an oil uplift for the kingdom.”</p>
<p>Aldayel explained there is “an opportunity for increasing availability and adoption of low-cost cars, especially in emerging markets.” This could, he said, either be through a joint venture with a car manufacturer or via micro-financing.</p>
								</div>
							</div>

					
				
											

					
				
											<div>
									<p>When undercover reporters asked for more information about the program, such as the scale of investment OSP would be undertaking and how much more oil Saudi Arabia wants to sell, they were told they would need to sign a non-disclosure agreement. But the Saudi officials did outline the detailed work that is going into the project, including psychological studies in emerging economies and mapping existing infrastructure in order to best target markets with cheap oil-fuelled vehicles.</p>
<p>“We are actually conducting some studies to understand the psychological behaviour, the infrastructure readiness of these countries, what type of cars are possible to be deployed there and even the financial capabilities of certain countries,” Aldayel said.</p>
<p>“So, it’s different from country to country. You can deploy two-wheelers in some countries, in other countries or other regions, you cannot go with the two-wheelers you have to have 4×4 cars, the smaller ones, the ones that are cheaper with not the advanced features that is more appealing for more developed countries,” he continued, “and we build a model that suits that country.”</p>

											<div>
																	<h2>Unfair</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>OSP officials also made it clear that Saudi Arabia sees the spread of electric vehicles (EVs) as a threat. They complained that EVs are being favoured with subsidies and other “regulatory advantages” and suggested that they might not even be better for the climate than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV).</p>
<p>“You know the situation that EVs are being favoured in terms of subsidies and regulatory advantage, irrespective of the actual economic and environmental competitiveness,” Aldayel said, “what we are working on is to support, to increase internal combustion engine adoptions… promoted through fair policies by working with regulators and industry leaders.”</p>
<p>The presentation shared by OSP officials claims that “global emissions regulations can be met by improved internal combustion engine vehicles and fair regulations.” It says this can partly be achieved through Saudi diplomacy, or “Kingdom relations,” and work with industry and regulators to promote internal combustion engine vehicles “through science and fair policies.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Obviously aviation is a key market for them”</p></blockquote>
<p>The presentation shared by officials on the call describes a program of “regulatory advocacy” to “shape local and international viewpoints for policymakers,” “promote fair policies,” and “ensure the Kingdom’s view is represented in relevant global forums.”</p>
<p>A 2021<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/climate/saudi-arabia-aramco-oil-solar-climate.html"> New York Times investigation</a> found that Saudi Aramco has funded huge amounts of scientific research into contentious energy issues in recent years, including studies aimed at keeping petrol and diesel vehicles competitive or casting doubt on electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Al-Tayyar, the head of OSP, told his Cape Town audience that the mining that is required for EVs will also create emissions, adding “so, we need to be very careful in pushing hard on one mode versus the other. Our view on which we base all of our efforts is having a more inclusive approach, we will need all of the above to help increase connectivity and mobility globally and Africa is a prime example for that ability to do so.”</p>
								</div>
							</div>

					
				
											<div>
																	<h2>Supersonic flight</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Saudi Arabia is also a major retailer of jet fuel and OSP officials outlined plans aimed at increasing sales around the world. This includes a plan to help fast-track the commercialisation of supersonic air travel, something that hasn’t been seen the demise of Concord.</p>
<p>The presentation makes clear that the incentive for doing so is that “supersonic aviation consumes more energy”, detailing that it uses three times the energy of subsonic commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>In October 2023, Saudi Arabia’s $500 billion NEOM project<a href="https://www.neom.com/en-us/newsroom/neom-announces-investment-fund"> announced</a> that it had made an investment in<a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/faq"> Boom Technology</a>, a<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2023/11/13/boom-supersonic-nears-first-test"> $700 million start-up</a> that aims to make commercial supersonic air travel a reality by 2030.</p>
<p>OSP also plans to facilitate investment into low-cost airlines in emerging economies across Asia and Africa. The presentation states that OSP could “facilitate investment in existing low-cost carriers with potential for expansion to fund growth through the acquisition of new aircraft and routes.”</p>
<p>To help manage the climate impacts of these plans, OSP officials said that Saudi Arabia is investing in an optimised jet fuel with at least 10% less greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.</p>
<p>Joanna Depledge told CCR that Saudi obstruction has led to very little action on tackling emissions from aviation: “It’s really quite extraordinary what they’ve got away with,” she said, “they’ve just said no, even to any debate.”</p>
<p>“Because obviously, aviation is a key market for them,” Depledge said.</p>

											<div>
																	<h2>Floating power plants</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>In addition to transport, Saudi Arabia is also hoping to increase the use of fossil fuels for generating electricity in developing countries. The presentation portrays this as a sustainable development initiative, but the proposed solutions depend upon countries importing Saudi diesel and highly polluting heavy fuel oil.</p>
<p>This includes a plan to create “oil-powered mini-grids” in landlocked countries across Africa and South Asia. Nawaf Al-Fallaj told undercover reporters the plan is “comprised of mini-grid and off-grid power generation and includes the use of diesel and HFO [heavy fuel oil] and hybrid systems also.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“Africa has the largest potential for green energy, why can’t the Saudis fund the development of those types of infrastructure”</p></blockquote>
<p>OSP officials also outlined a plan to use “floating power plants” off the coast of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Power ships<a href="https://www.karadenizholding.com/uploads/2020-6/15934405989512020-karpowership-brochure-englishpdf.pdf"> use heavy fuel oil or liquefied natural gas</a> – usually whichever is cheapest at the time – to generate electricity. They have<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20180823-lebanon-heavy-price-fuel-burning-barges-solve-energy-crisis"> proven controversial</a> in the past, with countries locked into high cost contracts and burning highly polluting heavy fuel oil in close proximity to towns and cities.</p>
<p>The officials added that, as part of the OSP strategy, Saudi Arabia would be accelerating upgrades to its heavy fuel oil refining capacity.</p>

																	<h2>Leapfrogging</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>When asked by an undercover reporter if the Saudi strategy is to ensure that developing countries don’t “leapfrog” fossil fuel-based development in favour of cleaner options like renewable energy and electrified transport, a Saudi official smiled and said “actually, we don’t believe it’s possible that they can skip this phase.”</p>
<p>Mohamed Adow of Power Shift Africa told CCR: “I will strongly disagree with anyone who says that Africa can’t leapfrog. Africa has all the essential ingredients to allow it to move away from fossil fuels.”</p>
<p>“But we need investment from rich countries that claim to be climate leaders,” Adow said, “otherwise we can expect more dodgy deals like this one, which endangers not just Africans but the global effort to ensure a safe and prosperous climate for all.”</p>
<p>Akinbode Oluwafemi of CAPPA told CCR: “As an African, I feel insulted that the Saudis think Africa is not ripe for a green economy and just transition. What Africa needs is sustainable climate financing that will allow the continent to make the transition to a climate resilient economy.”</p>
<p>“Africa has the largest potential for green energy, why can’t the Saudis fund the development of those types of infrastructure,” Oluwafemi said.</p>

																	<h2>Putting it into action</h2>
								
								<div>
									<p>Earlier this month, Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman,<a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/N1994212"> signed memoranda of understanding</a> with Rwanda, Nigeria, Chad, Ethiopia and Senegal during a diplomatic conference in Riyadh.</p>
<p>The agreements were part of an<a href="https://www.moenergy.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/ClimateWeek/Pages/OSP-Announces-Empowering-Africa-with-Several-Saudi-Ministries.aspx"> OSP initiative</a> called “Empowering Africa,” which is framed as a sustainable development program that will fund electric cooking stoves and introduce “connectivity solutions, e-education platforms, and e-health services to rural areas in Africa.”</p>
<p>But the memoranda of understanding struck by Abdulaziz bin Salman this month as part of the initiative appear to largely focus upon oil and gas supply. This includes a deal between the<a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/N1994212"> OSP and Rwanda</a> to “develop demand for hydrocarbon resources” and an agreement with Ethiopia to “<a href="https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_3559421">cooperate on oil supply</a>”. An<a href="https://twitter.com/senlokpobiri/status/1722677232131293579?s=20"> agreement with Nigeria</a> also focuses on cooperation in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p>Significantly, the Saudi energy minister is reported to have framed the initiative as an alternative to the<a href="https://www.unep.org/about-un-environment/funding-and-partnerships/green-climate-fund"> Green Climate Fund</a>, which was set up as part of the UN climate process to support developing countries to transition to cleaner forms of energy and transport. According to Saudi newspaper, Arab News, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at the event: “we have asked many of our colleagues in Africa if they have received any of the climate fund. I have yet to hear any who have.”</p>
<p>“Economies of Africa need to grow,” he added, “the people of Africa need to prosper, if these two things happen the world economy will grow and there will be a rippling effect.”</p>
<p>According to Adow: “A just transition is what Africa requires and Africans need to be proactive and ensure that the narrative of a just transition is not appropriated by polluters. We don’t want Africa’s poverty and Africa’s low emissions used to now undermine Africa’s future development.”</p>
<p>“I think the dominant narrative is that Africa lacks the resources,” Adow said, “and so you can then justify any infrastructure development including dirty development on that basis. ​​But what that misses is – if you look at the history of the world and the fossil heavy development that powered the advanced economies – that is what caused the climate crisis in the first place. And so, as the most vulnerable geography but also the one that is incredibly blessed with renewables, Africa can avoid the pitfalls of the past and realise the new opportunities of the twenty-first century.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nihalsid.github.io/mesh-gpt/">https://nihalsid.github.io/mesh-gpt/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38448653">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <p>
                        We introduce <span>MeshGPT</span>, a new approach for generating triangle meshes that reflects the compactness typical of artist-created meshes, in contrast to dense triangle meshes extracted by iso-surfacing methods from neural fields. Inspired by recent advances in powerful large language models, we adopt a sequence-based approach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of triangles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings, using graph convolutions, which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder, ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained, our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes, directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges, more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes.
                        </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Four years ago I founded Loyal with a simple vision — to bring to market the first drug explicitly approved and labeled for healthy lifespan extension. Loyal was only a few months old and about five people when we decided to begin by targeting the abnormally short lifespan of large breed dogs with a drug program we code-named LOY-001.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, I’m so proud to announce that <strong><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231127326868/en/FDA-Agrees-Loyal-Data-Supports-Reasonable-Expectation-of-Effectiveness-for-Large-Dog-Lifespan-Extension">Loyal has earned</a> what we believe to be the FDA’s first-ever formal acceptance that a drug can be developed and approved to extend lifespan. </strong>In regulatory parlance, we have completed the technical effectiveness portion of our conditional approval application for LOY-001’s use in large dog lifespan extension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As there was no established regulatory path for a lifespan extension drug, we had to design from scratch a scientifically strong and logistically feasible way to demonstrate efficacy of an aging drug. This process took more than four years, resulting in the 2,300+ page technical section now approved by the FDA. It included interventional studies of LOY-001 in an FDA-accepted model of canine aging and an observational (no-drug) study of 451 dogs.</p>



<p>Our interventional studies with LOY-001 showed that the drug improved clinically-relevant aging parameters. We assessed these in laboratory studies using a dog model that represents accelerated aging. We then correlated those results with quality of life scores in the observational study, as independently measured by dog owners, and health outcomes as measured by veterinarians. This was key to show that the biological benefits of the drug are linked to clinically relevant outcomes.</p>



<p>From our data, the FDA believes LOY-001 is likely to be effective for large dog lifespan extension in the real world. Once we satisfactorily complete safety and manufacturing sections and other requirements, vets will be able to prescribe LOY-001 to extend the lifespan of large dogs while we complete the confirmatory pivotal lifespan extension study in parallel.</p>







<h2>What this means for large-breed dogs</h2>



<p>If you have a large- or giant-breed dog you may be familiar with the sad reality that these large dogs tend to live shorter lives than smaller dogs — often by half.</p>

<p>This is unusual — very few if any other animals have such an extreme lifespan variation <em>within</em> the same species. Generally, the larger a mammal is, the longer its expected lifespan — a mouse may live two to three years, while elephants can live over 60 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of this lifespan disparity comes from the process of selective breeding that “created” these dog breeds.&nbsp; Historical selective breeding is understood to have created genetic issues like hip dysplasia in German Shepherds and breathing issues in brachycephalic dogs. In large- and giant-breed dogs, breeding for size caused these dogs to have highly elevated levels of IGF-1, a hormone that drives cell growth. High IGF-1 effectively drives these dogs to grow large when they’re young, but high IGF-1 levels in adult dogs are believed to accelerate their aging and reduce their healthy lifespan.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://blog-admin.loyalfordogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/large-dogs-IGF-1-eigenmann-et-al-1984-Maxwell-et-al-1998-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog-admin.loyalfordogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/large-dogs-IGF-1-eigenmann-et-al-1984-Maxwell-et-al-1998-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog-admin.loyalfordogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/large-dogs-IGF-1-eigenmann-et-al-1984-Maxwell-et-al-1998-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog-admin.loyalfordogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/large-dogs-IGF-1-eigenmann-et-al-1984-Maxwell-et-al-1998-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog-admin.loyalfordogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/large-dogs-IGF-1-eigenmann-et-al-1984-Maxwell-et-al-1998-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blog-admin.loyalfordogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/large-dogs-IGF-1-eigenmann-et-al-1984-Maxwell-et-al-1998.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>LOY-001 extends lifespan in part by reducing IGF-1 to levels seen in smaller-breed dogs. The IGF-1 axis is one of the most well-studied longevity pathways. In model organisms from <em>c.elegans </em>to mice, reducing IGF-1 extends healthy lifespan, and increasing IGF-1 shortens healthy lifespan. In humans, certain centenarians have been shown to have genetically lower levels of IGF-1.</p>



<p>The breakthrough moment for Loyal was connecting the biological mechanism of big dogs’ size to their short lifespan, and recognizing the big-dog-short-lifespan phenotype may not be inherent, but instead a type of “accelerated aging disorder”.</p>



<p>We designed LOY–01 as a long-acting injectable administered by your veterinarian every three to six months. In parallel, through our <a href="https://loyalfordogs.com/posts/announcing-our-partnership-with-crinetics-pharmaceuticals">recently-announced</a> partnership with Crinetics, we’re also developing LOY-003, a daily pill to address this same IGF-1 over-expression.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>A regulatory process that ensures safety and effectiveness</h2>



<p>Our product strategy has always been centered on earning FDA approval. While more challenging, time intensive, and expensive, I believe achieving FDA approval is critical to demonstrating the scientific legitimacy of lifespan extension drugs.</p>



<p>Most people know that the FDA has a rigorous system for ensuring that pharmaceutical products are safe and effective for humans. The same is true for veterinary medications — the drugs your vet prescribes to your dog, like the Rimadyl my senior Rottweiler takes for her arthritis, have been tested extensively and are regularly monitored by the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine.</p>



<p>To obtain approval to sell the drug, companies must present extensive data to the FDA in three core areas:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Efficacy</strong> — It does what it says it will do; in our case, it extends the lifespan of dogs.</li>



<li><strong>Safety</strong> — It’s proven safe for dogs, and any side effects are well-understood and documented.</li>



<li><strong>Manufacturing</strong> — We can manufacture it at a consistently high quality, at scale.</li>
</ol>



<p>The health and safety of dogs is our top priority in all things, and there’s no higher bar in the United States than the FDA.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conditional approval helps us help dogs sooner</h2>



<p>The FDA’s expanded conditional approval process allows companies to bring certain products to patients while conducting longer effectiveness studies, specifically when the product meets an important unmet need. This helps us get treatment as early as possible to older dogs who need it most.</p>



<p>To receive conditional approval, the product must meet the same rigorous safety and manufacturing standards as drugs that are fully approved. To stay on the market beyond the five-year conditional approval period, we must demonstrate full efficacy — in our case lifespan extension — in a pivotal study.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What this means for all dogs</h2>



<p>Each milestone we’ve achieved in this methodical, evidence-based process has demonstrated steady progress toward our vision of helping dogs live longer and stay healthy as they age.</p>



<p>This one is especially important because it marks a key step toward FDA approval based on credible, carefully reviewed data.</p>



<p>This process will make it possible for us to bring our products into veterinary clinics everywhere, and lead the charge on a new approach to age-related disease and decline.</p>



<p>That will ultimately mean more healthy years for the dogs we love — and that’s why we’re here.</p>

<p>A prolific espionage hacking group with ties to China spent over two years looting the corporate network of NXP, the Netherlands-based chipmaker whose silicon powers security-sensitive components found in smartphones, smartcards, and electric vehicles, a news outlet has reported.</p>
<p>The intrusion, by a group tracked under names including "Chimera" and "G0114," lasted from late 2017 to the beginning of 2020, <a href="https://www-nrc-nl.translate.goog/nieuws/2023/11/24/spionage-chinese-hackersgroep-zat-jarenlang-in-het-netwerk-van-de-nederlandse-chipfabrikant-nxp-a4182149?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US">according to</a> Netherlands national news outlet NRC Handelsblad, which cited “several sources” familiar with the incident. During that time, the threat actors periodically accessed employee mailboxes and network drives in search of chip designs and other NXP intellectual property. The breach wasn’t uncovered until Chimera intruders were detected in a separate company network that connected to compromised NXP systems on several occasions. Details of the breach remained a closely guarded secret until now.</p>
<h2>No material damage</h2>
<p>NRC cited a report published (and later deleted) by security firm Fox-IT, titled <a href="https://web-archive-org.translate.goog/web/20210620162513/https://blog.fox-it.com/2021/01/12/abusing-cloud-services-to-fly-under-the-radar/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US"><em>Abusing Cloud Services to Fly Under the Radar</em></a>. It documented Chimera using cloud services from companies including Microsoft and Dropbox to receive data stolen from the networks of semiconductor makers, including one in Europe that was hit in “early Q4 2017.” Some of the intrusions lasted as long as three years before coming to light. NRC said the unidentified victim was NXP.</p>
<p>“Once nested on a first computer—patient zero—the spies gradually expand their access rights, erase their tracks in between and secretly sneak to the protected parts of the network,” NRC reporters wrote in an English translation. “They try to secrete the sensitive data they find there in encrypted archive files via cloud storage services such as Microsoft OneDrive. According to the log files that Fox-IT finds, the hackers come every few weeks to see whether interesting new data can be found at NXP&nbsp;and whether more user accounts and parts of the network can be hacked.”</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>NXP apparently did not alert customers or shareholders to the intrusion, other than a brief reference in a 2019 annual report. It read:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have, from time to time, experienced cyber-attacks attempting to obtain access to our computer systems and networks. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in the misappropriation of our proprietary information and technology, the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees, customers, or suppliers, or interrupt our business. For instance, in January 2020, we became aware of a compromise of certain of our systems. We are taking steps to identify the malicious activity and are implementing remedial measures to increase the security of our systems and networks to respond to evolving threats and new information. As of the date of this filing, we do not believe that this IT system compromise has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or any material damage to us. However, the investigation is ongoing, and we are continuing to evaluate the amount and type of data compromised. There can be no assurance that this or any other breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results in the future.</p></blockquote>
<h2>“A big deal”</h2>
<p>NXP is Europe’s second-biggest semiconductor company behind ASML and the world’s 18th biggest chipmaker by market capitalization. Its chips are used in iPhones and Apple watches to support advanced near-field communications security mechanisms such as tag originality, tamper detection, and authentication for Apple Pay. NXP also provides chips for the MIFARE card used by transit companies, FIDO-compliant security keys, and tools for relaying data inside the networks of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Some security researchers said it was surprising that NXP officials didn’t inform customers of the two-year intrusion by threat actors, often abbreviated as TAs.</p>
<p>“NXP chips are in a lot of products,” Jake Williams, a former hacker for the National Security Agency, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@malwarejake/111477602993876340">wrote</a> on Mastodon. “It's likely the TA knows of specific flaws reported to NXP that can be leveraged to exploit devices the chips are embedded in, and that's assuming they didn't implement backdoors themselves. Over 2.5 years (at least), that's not unrealistic.”</p>                                            
                                                        

<p>A separate researcher who has published research in the past documenting a successful hack on a widely used product containing NXP chips voiced similar surprise.</p>
<p>“If a Chinese threat actor group gets source code or hardware designs of a chip manufacturer, these kinds of groups can use the source code even if the source code isn’t very well commented and documented,” the researcher, who asked not to be identified, said in an interview. “For me, [the intrusion] is a big deal. I was surprised NXP didn’t communicate with its customers.”</p>
<p>In an email, an NXP representative said the NRC report “is very dated as it was addressed back in 2019. As stated in our 2019 Annual Report, we became aware of a compromise of certain IT systems, and after a thorough investigation we determined that this incident did not result in a material adverse effect on our business. At NXP, we take the security of data very seriously. We learned from this experience and prioritize continually strengthening our IT systems to protect against ever-evolving cybersecurity threats.”</p>
<p>Chimera has extensive experience stealing data from a wide range of companies. The threat actor uses a variety of means to compromise its victims. In the campaign that hit NXP, hackers often leveraged account information revealed in previous data breaches of sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook. The data allowed Chimera to guess the passwords that employees used to access VPN accounts. Team members were able to bypass multi-factor authentication by changing telephone numbers associated with the accounts.</p>
<p>Security firm Cycraft <a href="https://cycraft.com/download/CyCraft-Whitepaper-Chimera_V4.1.pdf">documented </a> one two-year hacking spree that targeted semiconductor makers with operations in Taiwan, where NXP happens to have research and development facilities. An attack on one of the unnamed victims compromised 10 endpoints and another compromised 24 endpoints.</p>
<p>“The main objective of these attacks appeared to be stealing intelligence, specifically documents about IC chips, software development kits (SDKs), IC designs, source code, etc.,” Cycraft researchers wrote. “If such documents are successfully stolen, the impact can be devastating.”</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 14:02:24 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-general-availability-of-the-aws-sdk-for-rust/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-general-availability-of-the-aws-sdk-for-rust/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38445747">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section property="articleBody"> 
       <p>We’re excited to announce that the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/">AWS SDK for Rust</a> is now generally available and supported for production use.</p> 
       <p>The AWS SDK for Rust provides an idiomatic, type-safe API, along with the benefits of the Rust language such as <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">performance, reliability, and productivity</a>. The SDK supports modern Rust language features like async/await, non-blocking IO, and builders. It provides access to 300+ AWS Services, each with their own crate. The SDK works out of the box using sensible defaults but it’s also extensible, allowing users to customize it to their unique use case. The SDK is modular, allowing customers to compile crates only for the services they use. It’s also engineered to be fast. With the Rust SDK, users can quickly transfer data to and from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and Amazon DynamoDB.</p> 
       <h2>Getting Started with AWS SDK for Rust</h2> 
       <p>You can access the SDK through <a href="https://crates.io/teams/github:awslabs:rust-sdk-owners">crates.io</a>. The following is an example of how to use the AWS SDK for Rust with DynamoDB to perform a common operation of listing your tables. This example assumes you already have Rust and Cargo installed <em>(If you don’t, you can</em> <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install"><em>follow these instructions to install Rust and Cargo.</em></a><em>)</em></p> 
       <p>Create a new Rust project using <code>cargo</code>:</p> 
       <pre><code>cd &lt;your-project-directory&gt;
cargo new &lt;name-of-your-new-rust-project&gt;</code></pre> 
       <p>If this is the first time you are using an AWS SDK, you will need to set up your AWS credentials. We recommend <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-short-term.html">authenticating with short-term credentials</a>.</p> 
       <h3>Adding SDK crates to your dependencies</h3> 
       <p>Now that you’ve created your new Rust project, we’ll add some SDK crates and an async runtime. Add the following lines under <code>[dependencies]</code> in your new project’s <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p> 
       <pre><code>[dependencies]
aws-config = { version = "1", features = ["behavior-version-latest"] }
aws-sdk-dynamodb = "1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }</code></pre> 
       <p>Here’s what each of those crates does:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li><strong>aws-config</strong>: While not strictly required, this crate makes it easy to create the configuration needed by the DynamoDB client we’ll be creating. It will handle the sourcing of AWS credentials as well as providing useful defaults.</li> 
        <li><strong>aws-sdk-dynamodb</strong>: This crate provides the client for the service we want to interact with.</li> 
        <li><strong>tokio</strong>: The AWS SDK for Rust has an async API, so an async runtime is required to run our requests. We recommend the <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a> runtime. It’s well-supported by our SDK.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h3>Listing your DynamoDB tables with the Rust SDK</h3> 
       <p>We’re ready to write our <code>main</code> function now:</p> 
       <pre><code>#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let sdk_config = aws_config::load_from_env().await;
    let client = aws_sdk_dynamodb::Client::new(&amp;sdk_config);
    let res = client
        .list_tables()
        .limit(10)
        .send()
        .await?;
    println!("Current DynamoDB tables: {:?}", res.table_names());
    Ok(())
}</code></pre> 
       <p>You can now run the example program with <code>cargo</code>:</p> 
       <pre><code>cargo run</code></pre> 
       <p>The result is a list of your DynamoDB tables, or a helpful error message explaining why your request couldn’t be completed.</p> 
       <p><em>You can access many more examples in the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/tree/main/examples">SDK repository</a>.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ikea’s push to democratize the smart home continues with the introduction of three new Zigbee sensors that won’t break the bank. There’s Parasoll, the door and window sensor; Vallhorn, the motion sensor; and Badring, the water leakage sensor.&nbsp;They’ll all be priced less than $10 when they go on sale globally in the first half of next year.</p><p>Parasoll is a typical window and door sensor that can be discretely mounted to trigger an automation when an open / close event is detected. It can also be paired directly with an Ikea light bulb right out of the box without needing to buy and configure an Ikea Home smart hub. It’s priced at €9.99 in Europe, but exact US pricing is yet to be confirmed for it or any of Ikea’s three new sensors.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Parasoll door and window sensor pair." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/376x376/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/384x384/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/415x415/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/480x480/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/540x540/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/640x640/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/750x750/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/828x828/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/1080x1080/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/1200x1200/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/1440x1440/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/1920x1920/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/2048x2048/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/2400x2400/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4000x4000/2400x2400/filters:focal(2000x2000:2001x2001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25114660/PE909548__1_.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Parasoll door and window sensor pair.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ikea</cite></p></div></div><p>The Vallhorn motion sensor can be used both indoors and outdoors (with IP44 splash protection against rain) to activate lights or other automations when movement is detected.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>This account comes from several publicly available sources as well as accounts from insiders who worked at
Knight Capital Group at the time of the issue. I am telling it second- or third-hand.</em></p>
<p>On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital fell on its sword. It experienced a software glitch that literally bankrupted the
company. Between 9:30 am and 10:15 am EST, the employees of Knight capital watched in disbelief and scrambled to
figure out what went wrong as the company acquired massive long and short positions, largely concentrated in 154
stocks, totaling 397 million shares and $7.65 billion. At 10:15, the kill switch was flipped, stopping the
company’s trading operations for the day. By early afternoon, many of Knight Capital’s employees had already
sent out resumes, expecting to be unemployed by the end of the week.</p>
<p>The root cause of the failure? A comedy of errors in several parts of their development and ops processes.</p>
<h3 id="knights-order-entry-software">Knight’s Order-entry Software</h3>
<p>Knight Capital had an application called “SMARS” which sends orders to the stock exchange. It contained some logic
to break up large orders into much smaller orders that would have less of an effect on the market. The SMARS
software accepted orders from trading strategies using a binary protocol, and contained logic to make sure that
those orders got filled at a desired price. The protocol contained fields for price, desired size, time in force,
etc. The protocol also had a flag field, which set options for a given order. Nanoseconds counted, so protobufs
and JSON were too heavy here: these commands were sent over the wire as serialized structs.</p>
<p>One such option, from the very early 2000’s, was called “power peg.” Power peg was an order type used for manual
market making: a power peg order would stay open at a given price, effectively “pegging” the stock to a given
price. If a power peg order was filled, SMARS would refresh it at the same price. It kept a count of how many
shares were filled for a power peg order, and when a certain (very large) cumulative number was hit, the power peg
order would be automatically canceled. The intended user flow was for a market maker to open a power peg order,
get it filled as many times as needed, and then cancel the order when the market was about to move.</p>
<p>In 2003, Knight Capital deprecated the power peg option. They followed almost all the steps for flag deprecation
that you would expect from a disciplined engineering department: they marked the flag as deprecated, they switched
users away from using it, and they defaulted the clients to prevent use of the option. However, they never took
the last step: removing the server code. SMARS had been written somewhat hastily, and some of the code for Power
Peg was deeply entwined with other code in the server, and as long as the tests kept working, it wouldn’t be a
big deal. During a refactor 2 years later, the tests for power peg were breaking, so they were deleted. Nobody was
using the long-deprecated option, so there was no longer a need to check its correctness.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-new-feature">Adding a New Feature</h3>
<p>In July 2012, Knight Capital needed a flag for orders from their new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP).
Knight had opened a new line of business: buying order flow from retail brokerage and executing those orders.
Retail orders needed special handling, so SMARS needed a new flag. However, the flag word was out of new bits
for flags, so an engineer reused a bit from a deprecated flag: the power peg flag. The remaining power peg code
in SMARS was disconnected from the flag, and new RLP code was added. The code went through review successfully,
and passed a battery of automated tests.</p>
<p>The new RLP code was deployed to the SMARS system on July 27, 2012. Knight Capital officially ran a manual
deployment process: the person assigned to deploy the code would SSH into each SMARS machine, rsync the new
binary to that machine, and update some configuration to set it up to run instead of the old binary. Knight’s
operations team had seen the danger of this: to avoid missing a machine, they set up a script to perform the
process for each machine. On July 27, 2012, one member of the operations team ran the deployment script for the
new version of SMARS.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the team, the deployment script had a small bug: when it failed to open an SSH connection to a
machine, it would fail silently, continue to update the other machines, and report success. It was never tested
or checked in like a piece of software because it’s a script that one person wrote for convenience.</p>
<p>That day, one of ten SMARS machines was down for maintenance during the software upgrade, and rejected
an SSH connection. After its planned maintenance, the server came back up with an old version of SMARS.</p>
<p>Knight allowed the new SMARS binary to soak for 3 days before turning on RLP trades, and caught no errors.
That was to happen on August 1. They also did a limited test of RLP orders in one of the production SMARS
servers to make sure that the new logic was working correctly. The server they tested had received the new
software version, and the test was successful.</p>
<h3 id="august-1-2012">August 1, 2012</h3>
<p>Beginning at 8:01 EST on August 1, Knight began receiving retail orders through the RLP. Things were going
well, and the internal servers handling RLP orders were working exactly as they had in testing the prior days.</p>
<p>At 9:30, the market opened. Initially, trading in about 150 stocks looked like it was going wrong. Engineers
and quants were called to figure out what the problem was. New and experimental trading algorithms were shut
off. Quantitative researchers, not known for their programming prowess, were thought to have created the bug.
The RLP, now past its experimental soaking period, was allowed to continue operating.</p>
<p>From debug logs, engineers later narrowed down the problem to a bug in SMARS: orders were leaving trading
servers correctly, but somehow the firm was starting to accrue large positions on these orders, filling them
many times over. Noticing the flaw, engineers decided to roll back SMARS to its previous version, hoping to
continue trading with a known-good version.</p>
<p>After the rollback, the abnormal behavior accelerated and spread to seemingly every stock on the market. The
losses accelerated, and the SMARS software kept acquiring massive positions that were not allocated to any
trading strategy. Trading algorithms also continued to be rolled back, as bugs in those machines could have
caused the same issue, but none of this helped. Unknown to the operations department, they hadn’t rolled
back to a good version of SMARS—they had rolled back to the same bad version that had been the cause of
their problems.</p>
<p>At 10:15, the call was made to shut down trading for the day. Knight had been losing money and accruing
positions so quickly that the computers took a while to figure out exactly how bad it was.</p>
<p>Knight’s executive team now needed to figure out how to cover these positions. Some positions could be closed
manually, and some of these trades even made money. However, most of Knight’s positions were too large for this
approach. Talks began with banks and other trading partners to figure out how to get out of the hole. Exchanges
were asked if they could reverse the trades. It appeared that Knight would have a $1 billion loss on their hands,
and not anywhere near enough cash to cover it.</p>
<p>Line employees caught wind of the trouble, and many started to answer the emails from recruiters that they had
long ignored. In the afternoon of August 1, more Knight employees were working on resumes than anything else.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-fatal-flaws">The Final Fatal Flaws</h3>
<p>During the 2005 refactor of SMARS, the code for reporting power peg positions back to trading strategies had
broken, which was what caused the test failures (and the subsequent deletion of tests). If not for this
breakage, the strategies would have been allocated correct positions, and the correct trading algorithms could
have been shut down.</p>
<p>Finally, SMARS was built to be fast, and did not conduct a lot of pre-trade risk checks. That was the job for the
trading servers, and they were very accurate at it. SMARS simply accepted orders and executed them, regardless
of whether the strategy (or the firm) had the requisite capital. Since Knight was a broker-dealer and had a
direct connection to the exchange, the exchange didn’t know whether Knight had the money for their trades either,
and continued accepting orders. This type of check is the responsibility of the broker, and Knight was their own.
Trading strategies, whose risk management code had an inaccurate view of their own positions, continued to send
orders like nothing was wrong. Nobody at Knight had built any infrastructure to manage the financial risks
related to rogue order entry servers.</p>
<h3 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
<p>When the dust settled, Knight was able to close its positions at a $440 million loss. On August 5, 2012, Knight
received $400 million of rescue financing that allowed them to continue operations. They rebranded as “KCG,”
and were acquired in 2013 by GETCO, another algorithmic trading company, to form KCG Holdings. They were later
acquired by Virtu Financial in 2017.</p>
<p>The story of Knight Capital prompted other trading firms to review their processes and adopt new layers of risk
checks as well as modern DevOps practices to protect themselves from being the next Knight. Some of them quietly
admitted that they were lucky: their practices were similar to the ones that brought down their competitor.
Adding risk checks to the <em>last</em> stage of an order’s life became universal in the industry, and testing and
deployment practices were largely brought into the modern era.</p>
<p>Knight Capital, the SEC, the exchanges, and FINRA conducted thorough postmortem reviews of what happened during
this incident. There was a lot of blame to go around at Knight, and they ended up paying an additional $12 million
of fines for failing to hold up their responsibilities as broker. A lot of Knight’s development practices were
changed. As of 2016, the engineer who did the update still worked at KCG. His entire management chain had been
replaced, all the way up to the CTO.</p>
<p>The story of Knight Capital today serves as a cautionary tale for trading firms who ask “what’s the worst that
could happen?”</p>

<h3>What We’re Announcing</h3>



<p>Every once in a while, a new open source initiative comes along which is truly an industry changing event. Today, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things-blog/microsoft-contributes-azure-rtos-to-open-source/ba-p/3986318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft announced</a> that Azure RTOS, including all of its components, is going to be made available as the <a href="https://www.threadx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eclipse ThreadX</a> open source <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-threadx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project</a>. This new project is exactly what the highly fragmented embedded software market has needed for a very long time. ThreadX is going to be the world’s first open source real time operating system which is:</p>



<ol>
<li>Mature and scalable technology. ThreadX has been developed for over 20 years, is currently running on over 12 billion devices around the world, and is highly regarded as a high-performance, highly deterministic, real time operating system.<br></li>



<li>Made available under a permissive open source license. ThreadX is going to be licensed under the MIT license, which provides highly permissive license terms for users and adopters.<br></li>



<li>Governed under a vendor-neutral open source foundation. ThreadX is going to be governed by the Eclipse Foundation and its development process. This will guarantee a vendor-neutral governance model to manage the evolution and sustainability of ThreadX for the benefit of the entire industry.<p>AND</p></li>



<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/rtos/overview-rtos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Certified</a> for functional safety and security. ThreadX is IEC 61508, IEC 62304, ISO 26262, and EN 50128 conformance certified by SGS-TÜV Saar. ThreadX has also achieved EAL4+ Common Criteria security certification. These certifications are a big differentiator, and are unprecedented in the industry. They are a game changer, as there are currently no open source RTOS’s which have them.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>While there are other open source RTOS’s out there, none have all of the four attributes listed above. We are optimistic that, because of these attributes, ThreadX is going to rapidly expand its adoption in a wide range of use cases including aerospace, automotive, IoT, medical, transportation, automation, and consumer wearables.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Next Steps</h3>



<p>In addition to the project, we are also announcing the creation of an interest group focused on developing an industry-supported, sustainable funding model for ThreadX. We are excited that AMD, Cypherbridge, Microsoft, NXP, PX5, Renesas, ST Microelectronics, Silicon Labs, and Witekio (an Avnet company) have all committed to supporting this conversation. We highly encourage every company with an interest in embedded technology to join to help create the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ThreadX interest group’s sole focus will be on establishing a working group focused on the following:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Consolidate the project: </strong>There is going to be a great deal of focus on getting ThreadX moved under Eclipse Foundation governance as quickly as possible. This will involve transferring and re-licensing the code and documentation, and assigning the trademarks over the next few weeks. In parallel, we are looking for developers who have experience with the ThreadX code base to get involved as key resources from Cypherbridge, PX5, and Witekio have already done. The intent is to have the first release of ThreadX under Eclipse Foundation governance completed by the end of January 2024.<br></li>



<li><strong>Preserve the certifications: </strong>As I mentioned above, the safety and security certifications are a key differentiator for ThreadX. Maintaining those certifications while under open source governance is going to be a key factor in the evolution of ThreadX as an open source project. Fortunately, the Eclipse Foundation has been thinking about and staffing for this capability for a long time as our IoT and Software Defined Vehicle communities have similar requirements. Our intent is to develop best practices for the ThreadX community and, if required, modify and enhance our Eclipse Foundation Development Process to support the additional process requirements necessary to support safety and security. The documentation which will enable downstream adopters of ThreadX to certify their products will be made available under open licenses. This will significantly shorten the lifecycle of safety-certified products based on Eclipse ThreadX.<br></li>



<li><strong>Build the community: </strong>ThreadX represents an amazing opportunity to build an open source embedded software developer community. There will be a great deal of focus on nurturing new contributions, driving adoption via developer advocacy, and creating cross-pollination with our other communities within the Eclipse Foundation such as IoT and SDV, all while preserving the processes required for the certifications which differentiate ThreadX.<br></li>



<li><strong>Promote the brand: </strong>Returning to the original ThreadX name is purposefully intended to assure the many current adopters of this technology that this is and will remain the RTOS that they trust for their products. The new mission will be to associate the ThreadX brand with vendor-neutral governance, communicate clear market positioning, and establish compatibility programs that will provide value to current and future adopters.<br></li>



<li><strong>Grow the ecosystem: </strong>With over 10 billion devices deployed using ThreadX, it is clear that this is an important and mature technology. To ensure a sustainable future for ThreadX we need to obtain the support, participation, and contributions of all ecosystem participants: silicon/SBC manufacturers, embedded system integrators, and tool vendors. We highly encourage every company with an interest in embedded technology to join the interest group to help define and secure the future of ThreadX.</li>
</ol>



<p>Eclipse ThreadX presents the industry with a game-changing opportunity. Having a performant, mature, safety and security certified, permissively-licensed, open source RTOS under vendor-neutral governance will enable new business and product opportunities around the world. We are very excited to work with the community to make ThreadX a huge success.</p>

The company has <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things-blog/microsoft-contributes-azure-rtos-to-open-source/ba-p/3986318" rel="nofollow">contributed Azure RTOS</a> to the stewardship of the Eclipse Foundation, where it will be <a href="https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2023/11/21/introducing-eclipse-threadx/" rel="nofollow">known as Eclipse ThreadX</a> and available under the permissive MIT licence.</p>
<p>Although there are many Real-time OSes – RTOS for short – out there, you generally don't hear much about them. You may never have heard of ThreadX, but there's a fairly good chance that you unwittingly have several copies lying around or even running right now.</p>

    

<p>There are more famous RTOSes, such as Wind River's VxWorks: it's running on Mars, inside <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/23/perseverance_landing_video/">NASA's Perseverance Rover</a> for example. Blackberry's QNX RTOS, which we called <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/02/18/qnx_hypervisor/">the money-making part of the business</a>, has been in the spotlight twice: once as <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/09/28/blackberry_tablet_runs_qnx/">the basis for RIM's Blackberry X</a> fondleslab and smartphone range, but back in the 1990s for the amazing QNX <a href="http://qnx.puslapiai.lt/qnxdemo/qnx_demo_disk.htm" rel="nofollow">single-floppy demo disk</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>ThreadX was quite pervasive, though. Microsoft claims 12 billion devices run it, and you might own some of them. For a while it powered <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/05/01/intel_amt_me_vulnerability/">Intel's on-chip Management Engine</a>. It is also the firmware that controls every Raspberry Pi bigger than the Pi Pico. On the Pi 1, 2 and 3, it's <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/develop/documentation/asciidoc/computers/configuration/boot_folder.adoc" rel="nofollow">the file on your Pi's SD card</a> called <code>bootcode.bin</code>; in the Pi 4 and 400, it's called <code>start*.elf</code>. Even though it's <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware" rel="nofollow">on GitHub</a> and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/raspi-firmware" rel="nofollow">included in Debian</a>, it's a proprietary "blob" (<em>B</em>inary <em>L</em>arge <em>OB</em>ject). It's a metaphorical sealed black box which doesn't even contain Arm code: instead, it runs on the Pi's VideoCore GPU. This is the primary device, the part that boots up the Pi and controls its hardware: the Arm cores are <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/106077/125748" rel="nofollow">slave devices</a> to the VideoCore GPU.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/10/18/rpi_with_active_cooling.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="Raspberry Pi active cooling"></p><h2 title="Choose between five options">Ah lovely, here's something you can do with those Raspberry Pis, NUC PCs in the bottom of the drawer: Run Ubuntu Appliances on them</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/18/ubuntu_raspberry_pi/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>This, incidentally, is why Xen only runs on the Pi 4 and later: they were the first versions where the Arm cores had their own interrupt controller, and even so, <a href="https://xenproject.org/2020/09/29/xen-on-raspberry-pi-4-adventures/" rel="nofollow">it took some work</a>. We have read that in the Pi 5, it's in EEPROM and does even less, meaning that the Arm cores have more control, as this <a href="https://forums.theregister.com/post/reply/4735439" rel="nofollow"><em>Reg</em> comment</a> bears out.</p>
<p>As soon as this innocent little OS turned 21 in 2019, Microsoft grabbed it, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/21/microsoft_build_iot/">acquiring ThreadX owners Express Logic</a> and rebranding the poor thing as <em>Azure RTOS</em>, which hasn't done any favours for its brand awareness. The purchase came soon after <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/22/freertos_iot_platform_security_flaws/">AWS took over stewardship of FreeRTOS</a>, and some observers, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/181g1nk/comment/kae4gi2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" rel="nofollow">this commenter on Reddit</a>, claim that the deal was a response to Amazon's move. After the purchase, original developer William Lamie left, starting a new company which sells a "fifth-generation" RTOS with POSIX-compatible threads, called <a href="https://px5rtos.com/about/" rel="nofollow">PX5OS</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, ThreadX is a tested and established product; some parts even have <a href="https://www.tuvsud.com/en/industries/mobility-and-automotive/automotive-and-oem/iso-26262-functional-safety/iso-26262-functional-safety-certification-programme" rel="nofollow">TÜV Functional Safety</a> (FuSa) certification, such as the <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/product_presentation/stm32_stm8_functional-safety-packages.pdf" rel="nofollow">STM32 version</a> [PDF]. That kind of thing is powerfully attractive to some customers.</p>

</ul>
<p>At this point, only the current version <a href="https://github.com/azure-rtos" rel="nofollow">is on GitHub</a>, and we don't see any trace of a VideoCore version. Although the GPU drivers have <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/10/24/raspberry_pi_broadcom_soc_drivers_now_fully_open_source/">long been open source</a>, the firmware never was, and attempts to write <a href="https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware" rel="nofollow">an independent FOSS version</a> were never completed, for <a href="https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware/issues/37" rel="nofollow">reasons explained</a> on the project page. Now, there is at least some hope that the Raspberry Pi Foundation might be able to get permission to release the source code for its version. As of last year, the foundation had <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/28/pi_at_10/">sold over 46 million</a> of the things, and if the whole software stack were open source, that would make them even more appealing for a lot of people. ®</p>

<p>The sixth major version is being released today and we are very proud&nbsp;! It is the most ambitious one since we added peer-to-peer livestreaming. There is a good reason for that&nbsp;: we packed this v6 with features inspired by <a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/">your ideas</a>&nbsp;!</p>
<p>We are so eager to present all the work we achieved that we’ll get right into it. But stay tuned&nbsp;: in two weeks, we’ll take more time to talk about PeerTube’s history, the state of this project and the great plans we have for its future&nbsp;!</p>

<h2 id="this-year-two-minor-updates-and-a-major-achievement">This year&nbsp;: two minor updates and a major achievement</h2>
<p>In 2023, and before preparing this major update, we released only two minor versions… but one of them brought to the table a major technical feature that will help democratize video hosting even more.</p>
<h3 id="march-2023-peertube-v5-1">March 2023&nbsp;: PeerTube v5.1</h3>
<p>You’ll get more details in <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news/release-5.1">the news dedidacted to the 5.1 release</a>, so to keep it short, this version brought&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>an «&nbsp;asking for an account&nbsp;» feature, where instance moderators can <strong>manage and moderate news account requests</strong>&nbsp;;</li>
<li>a <strong>back-to-live button</strong>, so when you can lag behind during a livestream, you can go back to the direct</li>
<li>Improvements on the <strong>authentification plugin</strong>, to facilitate signing on with external credentials</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="june-2023-peertube-5-2-">June 2023&nbsp;: PeerTube 5.2…</h3>
<p>As you’ll find out in our <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news/release-5.2">5.2 release blogpost</a>, there were some smaller but important new features such as&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapting <strong>RSS feeds to podcast standards</strong>, so any podcast client could be able to read a PeerTube channel, for example</li>
<li>The option to <strong>set the privacy of a livestream replay</strong>, that way streamers can choose beforehand if the replay of their live will be <em>Public</em>, <em>Unlisted</em>, <em>Private</em> or <em>Internal</em></li>
<li>Improved mouse-free navigation&nbsp;: for those who prefer or need to <strong>navigate using their keyboard</strong></li>
<li>And <strong>upgrades in our documentation</strong> (it’s quite thorough&nbsp;: <a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/">check it out</a>&nbsp;!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-with-a-major-feature-remote-transcoding">…with a major feature&nbsp;: Remote Transcoding</h3>
<p>But the game changer in this 5.2 release was the new <strong>remote transcoding feature</strong>.</p>
<p>When a creator uploads a video (or when they are streaming live), PeerTube needs to transform their video file into an efficient format. This task is called video transcoding, and it consumes lots of CPU power. PeerTube admins used to need (costly) big-CPU servers for a task that wasn’t permanent… until remote transcoding.</p>
<p>Remote transcoding allows PeerTube admins to deport some or all of their transcoding tasks to another, more powerful server, one that can be shared with other admins, for example.</p>
<p><strong>It makes the whole PeerTube administration cheaper, more resilient, more power-efficient</strong>… and opens a way of sharing resources between communities&nbsp;!</p>
<p>We want, once again to thank the NGI Entrust program and the NLnet foundation for the grant that helped us achieve such a technical improvement&nbsp;!</p>

<h2 id="peertube-v6-powered-by-your-ideas-">PeerTube v6 is Based… (on your ideas)</h2>
<p>Enough about the past, let’s detail the features of this new major version. Note that, for this whole 2023 roadmap, we developed features suggested and upvoted by… you&nbsp;! Or at least by those of you who shared your ideas on <a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/">our feedback website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="protect-your-videos-with-passwords-">Protect your videos with passwords&nbsp;!</h3>
<p>That was a very awaited feature. Password-protected videos can be used in lots of situations&nbsp;: to create exclusive content, mark a step in a pedagogical plan, share videos with people trusted by the ones you trust…</p>

<p>On their PeerTube account, creators can now set a single password when they upload, import or update the settings of their videos.</p>
<p>But with our REST API, admins and developers can take it a step further. They can set and store as many passwords as they want, thus easily give and revoke access to videos.</p>
<p>This feature was the work of Wicklow, during his internship with us.</p>
<h3 id="video-storyboard-preview-what-s-coming-">Video storyboard&nbsp;: preview what’s coming&nbsp;!</h3>
<p>If you like to peruse your videos online, you might be used to hover the progress bar with your mouse or finger. Usually, a preview of the frame appears as a thumbnail&nbsp;: that’s called a storyboard feature, and that’s now available in PeerTube&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Please note that as Storyboards are only generated when uploading (or importing) a video, they will only be available for new videos of instances that upgraded to v6…</p>
<p>Or you can ask, very kindly, to your admin(s) that they use the magical <code>npm run create-generate-storyboard-job</code> command (warning&nbsp;: this task might need some CPU power), and generate storyboards for older videos.</p>
<h3 id="upload-a-new-version-of-your-video">Upload a new version of your video&nbsp;!</h3>
<p>Sometimes, video creators want to update a video, to correct a mistake, offer new informations… or just to propose a better cut of their work&nbsp;!</p>
<p>Now, with PeerTube, they can upload and replace an older version of their video. Though the older video file will be permanently erased (no backsies&nbsp;!), creators will keep the same URL, title and infos, comments, stats, etc.</p>

<p>Obviously, such a feature requires trust between videomakers and admins, who don’t want to be responsible for a cute kitten video being «&nbsp;updated&nbsp;» into an awful advertisement for cat-hating groups.</p>
<p>That’s why such a feature will only be available if admins choose to enable it on their PeerTube platforms, and will display a «&nbsp;Video re-upload&nbsp;» tag on updated videos.</p>
<h3 id="get-chapters-in-your-videos-">Get chapters in your videos&nbsp;!</h3>
<p>Creators can now add chapters to their videos on PeerTube. In a video settings page, they’ll get a new «&nbsp;chapters&nbsp;» tab where they’ll only need to specify the timecode and title of each chapter for PeerTube to add it.</p>

<p>If they import their video from another platform (<em>cough</em> YouTube <em>cough</em>), PeerTube should automatically recognize and import chapters set on this distant video.</p>
<p>When chapters are set, markers will appear and segment the progress bar. Chapter titles will be displayed when you hover or touch one of those chapters segments.</p>
<h3 id="stress-tests-performance-and-config-recommandations">Stress tests, performance and config recommandations</h3>
<p>Last year, thanks to French indie journalist David Dufresne’s Au Poste&nbsp;! livestream show and his hoster Octopuce, we got a livestream stress test with more than 400 simultaneous viewers&nbsp;: <a href="https://www.octopuce.fr/test-de-charge-dun-peertube-en-live-avec-auposte/">see the report here on Octopuce’s blog[FR]</a>.</p>
<p>Such tests are really helpful to understand where we can improve PeerTube to reduce bottlenecks, improve performance, and give advice on the best configuration for a PeerTube server if an admin plans on getting a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>That’s why this year, we have decided to realize more tests, with a thousand simultaneous users simulated both in livestream and classic video streaming conditions. Lots of thanks and datalove to Octopuce for helping us deploy our test infrastructure.</p>
<p>We will soon publish a report with our conclusions and recommended server configurations depending on usecases (late 2023, early 2024). In the meantime, early tests motivated us to <strong>add many performances improvements</strong> into this v6, such as (brace yourselves for the technical terms)&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process unicast HTTP job in worker threads</li>
<li>Sign ActivityPub requests in worker threads</li>
<li>Optimize recommended videos HTTP request</li>
<li>Optimize videos SQL queries when filtering on lives or tags</li>
<li>Optimize /videos/{id}/views endpoint with many viewers</li>
<li>Add ability to disable PeerTube HTTP logs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-and-there-s-always-more-">…and there’s always more&nbsp;!</h3>
<p>A new major version always comes with its lot of changes, improvements, bugfixes, etc. You can read <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v6.0.0">the complete log here</a>, but here are the highlights&nbsp;:</p>
<ul>
<li>We needed to settle a technical debt&nbsp;: <strong>v6 removes support for WebTorrent to focus on HLS (with WebRTC P2P)</strong>. Both are technical bricks used to get peer-to-peer streaming in web browsers, but HLS is more fitted to what we are doing (and plan to do) with PeerTube</li>
<li>The <strong>video player is more efficient</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is not being rebuilt anymore every time the video changes</li>
<li>It keeps your watching settings (speed, fullscreen, etc.) when the video changes</li>
<li>It automatically adjust its size to match the video ratio</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have <strong>improved SEO</strong>, to help videos hosted on a PeerTube platform appear higher in the search results of search engines</li>
<li>We worked a lot on <strong>improving PeerTube’s accessibility</strong> on many levels, to streamline the experience of people with disabilities.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay">https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-files-gdpr-complaint-against-meta-over-pay-or-okay</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38443292">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
                    

<p><strong>Today, <em>noyb </em>filed a complaint against Meta with the Austrian data protection authority. European users now have the “choice” to either consent to being tracked for personalized advertising – or pay up to €251.88 a year to retain their fundamental right to data protection on Instagram and Facebook. Not only is the cost unacceptable, but industry numbers suggest that only 3 percent of people want to be tracked – while more than 99 percent decide against a payment when faced with a “privacy fee”. If Meta gets away with this, competitors will soon follow in its footsteps. Given that the average phone has 35 apps installed, keeping your phone private could soon cost around € 8,815 a year.</strong></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-11/Complaint%20-%20Meta%20Pay%20or%20Okay%20-%20REDACTED.pdf">Complaint with the Austrian data protection authority (automated machine-translation)</a></li>
</ul><p><strong>Another attempt to circumvent EU privacy laws.</strong> The European Court of Justice (CJEU) <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/cjeu-declares-metafacebooks-gdpr-approach-largely-illegal">ruled in July</a> that Meta’s handling of user data for personalized ads was illegal. But not only that: In January, the European Data Protection Board <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/breaking-meta-prohibited-use-personal-data-advertising">fined Meta €390 million</a> for this violation and ordered the company to obtain users’ consent, based on a <em>noyb </em><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/noybeu-filed-complaints-over-forced-consent-against-google-instagram-whatsapp-and-facebook">complaint from 2018</a>. In its next attempt to undermine EU law, Meta now wants to charge people for choosing a privacy-friendly setting. Since the beginning of November, Instagram and Facebook users have had to choose between paying up to €251.88 a year or having their personal data surveilled for targeted advertising.</p>

<p><strong>“Freely given” consent at a high price?</strong> Under EU law, consent to online tracking and personalized advertising is only valid if it is “freely given”. This is to ensure that users only give up their fundamental right to privacy if it is their genuine free will to do so. Meta has now implemented the exact opposite of a genuinely free choice: Facebook alone will introduce a “privacy fee” of up to €12.99 per month if users do not consent to their personal data being processed for targeted advertising. Each linked account (such as Instagram) will cost another €8, making a total of €251.88 a year for one person using Instagram and Facebook. By comparison: <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_earnings/2023/q3/presentation/Earnings-Presentation-Q3-2023.pdf">Meta says</a> its average revenue per user in Europe between Q3 2022 and Q3 2023 was $16.79. This equates to an annual revenue of just €62,88 per user – and puts the monthly fee way out of proportion.</p>

<p>Felix Mikolasch, data protection lawyer at <em>noyb</em>: <em>“EU law requires that consent is the genuine free will of the user. Contrary to this law, Meta charges a “privacy fee” of up to €250 per year if anyone dares to exercise their fundamental right to data protection.”</em></p>

<p><strong>3 to 10 percent want personalized ads – but 99.9 percent consent.</strong> All available scientific research suggests that so-called “Pay or Okay” systems are the antithesis of free consent and fundamentally affect the “free will” of users. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11625.pdf">the CEO of the “Pay or Okay” provider contentpass</a> stated that 99,9 percent of visitors agree to tracking when faced with a € 1,99 fee. At the same time, <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2020-05/Gallup_Facebook_DE.pdf">objective surveys suggest</a> that only 3 to 10 percent of users want their personal data to be used for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>Max Schrems, Chairman of <em>noyb</em>:<em> “When 3 percent of people actually want to swim, but 99.9 percent end up in the water, every child knows that it wasn’t a “free” choice. It’s neither smart nor legal – it’s just pitiful how Meta continues to ignore EU law.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Data protection could soon cost €35,000 per family.</strong> If Meta is successful in defending this new approach, it is likely to set off a domino effect. Already now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/02/tiktok-begins-testing-4-99-ad-free-subscription-tier/">TikTok is reportedly testing</a> an ad-free subscription outside the US. Other app providers could follow in the near future, making online privacy unaffordable. <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/average-number-of-apps-on-smartphones/">According to Google</a>, the average person has 35 apps installed on their smartphone. If all of these apps followed Meta’s lead and charged a similar fee, people would have to pay a “fundamental rights fee” of €8,815.80 a year. For a family of four, the price of data privacy would rise to €35,263.20 per year - more than the average full-time income in the EU. Obviously, these figures become even more extreme in EU Member States with lower average incomes.</p>

<p>Max Schrems:<em> “Fundamental rights are usually available to everyone. How many people would still exercise their right to vote if they had to pay € 250 to do so? There were times when fundamental rights were reserved for the rich. It seems Meta wants to take us back for more than a hundred years.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Privacy only for the rich. </strong>While this price is extremely high in general, it also completely ignores the very different income levels in EU countries – and the fact that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/15234730/17582411/KS-HA-23-001-EN-N.pdf/5d783d9e-9cb3-897c-8360-5122563ae8f3?version=6.0&amp;t=1700579783008">21.6% of the EU population is at risk of poverty or social exclusion</a>. The complainant in this case, for example, is in financial distress and receives unemployment assistance. He simply cannot afford to pay another €250 a year, when he is already struggling to pay his rent.</p>

<p>Max Schrems:<em> “More than 20% of the EU population are already at risk of poverty. For the complainant in our case, as for many others, a ‘Pay or Okay’ system would mean paying the rent or having privacy.”</em></p>

<p><strong>The DPA should initiate an urgency procedure.</strong> Given the seriousness of the violations and the unusually high number of users affected, <em>noyb </em>urges the Austrian data protection authority to initiate an urgency procedure to stop the illegal processing. In addition, <em>noyb </em>suggests that the authority imposes a deterrent fine, making sure that no other company starts copying Meta’s approach.</p>

Designing a good, fast, portable SIMD algorithm is not a simple matter and requires thinking a little bit like a circuit designer.</p> <p>Here’s the mandatory performance benchmark graph to catch your eye.</p> <p><img src="https://mcyoung.xyz/public/simd-img/graph.png" alt="perf perf perf"></p> <p>“SIMD” often gets thrown around as a buzzword by performance and HPC (high performance computing) nerds, but I don’t think it’s a topic that has very friendly introductions out there, for a lot of reasons.</p> <ul> <li>It’s not something you will really want to care about unless you think performance is cool.</li> <li>APIs for programming with SIMD in most programming languages are <em>garbage</em> (I’ll get into why).</li> <li>SIMD algorithms are hard to think about if you’re very procedural-programming-brained. A functional programming mindset can help a lot.</li> </ul> <p>This post is mostly about <a href="https://docs.rs/vb64/latest/vb64/"><code>vb64</code></a> (which stands for <em>v</em>ector <em>b</em>ase<em>64</em>), a base64 codec I wrote to see for myself if Rust’s <code>std::simd</code> library is any good, but it’s also an excuse to talk about SIMD in general.</p> <p>What <em>is</em> SIMD, anyways? Let’s dive in.</p> <p>If you want to skip straight to the writeup on <code>vb64</code>, click <a href="#parsing-with-simd">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="problems-with-physics"><a href="#problems-with-physics">Problems with Physics</a></h2> <p>Unfortunately, computers exist in the real world<sup>[citation-needed]</sup>, and are bound by the laws of nature. SIMD has relatively little to do with theoretical CS considerations, and everything to do with <em>physics</em>.</p> <p>In the infancy of modern computing, you could simply improve performance of existing programs by buying new computers. This is often incorrectly attributed to Moore’s law (the number of transistors on IC designs doubles every two years). Moore’s law still appears to hold as of 2023, but some time in the last 15 years the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling">Dennard scaling</a> effect broke down. This means that denser transistors eventually means increased power dissipation density. In simpler terms, we don’t know how to continue to increase the clock frequency of computers without literally <em>liquefying</em> them.</p> <p>So, since the early aughts, the hot new thing has been bigger core counts. Make your program more multi-threaded and it will run faster on bigger CPUs. This comes with synchronization overhead, since now the cores need to cooperate. All control flow, be it jumps, virtual calls, or synchronization will result in “stall”.</p> <p>The main causes of stall are <em>branches</em>, instructions that indicate code can take one of two possible paths (like an <code>if</code> statement), and <em>memory operations</em>. Branches include all control flow: <code>if</code> statements, loops, function calls, function returns, even <code>switch</code> statements in C. Memory operations are loads and stores, especially ones that are cache-unfriendly.</p> <h3 id="procedural-code-is-slow"><a href="#procedural-code-is-slow">Procedural Code Is Slow</a></h3> <p>Modern compute cores do not execute code line-by-line, because that would be very inefficient. Suppose I have this program:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>;</span>

<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{a}, {b}"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>There’s no reason for the CPU to wait to finish computing <code>a</code> before it begins computing <code>b</code>; it does not depend on <code>a</code>, and while the add is being executed, the xor circuits are idle. Computers say “program order be damned” and issue the add for <code>a</code> and the xor for <code>b</code> simultaneously. This is called <em>instruction-level parallelism</em>, and dependencies that get in the way of it are often called <em>data hazards</em>.</p> <p>Of course, the Zen 2 in the machine I’m writing this with does not have one measly adder per core. It has dozens and dozens! The opportunities for parallelism are massive, as long as the compiler in your CPU’s execution pipeline can clear any data hazards in the way.</p> <p>The better the core can do this, the more it can saturate all of the “functional units” for things like arithmetic, and the more numbers it can crunch per unit time, approaching maximum utilization of the hardware. Whenever the compiler can’t do this, the execution pipeline stalls and your code is slower.</p> <p>Branches stall because they need to wait for the branch condition to be computed before fetching the next instruction (speculative execution is a somewhat iffy workaround for this). Memory operations stall because the data needs to physically arrive at the CPU, and the speed of light is finite in this universe.</p> <p>Trying to reduce stall by improving opportunities for single-core parallelism is not a new idea. Consider the not-so-humble GPU, whose purpose in life is to render images. Images are vectors of pixels (i.e., color values), and rendering operations tend to be highly local. For example, a convolution kernel for a Gaussian blur will be two or even three orders of magnitude smaller than the final image, lending itself to locality.</p> <p>Thus, GPUs are built for divide-and-conquer: they provide primitives for doing batched operations, and extremely limited control flow.</p> <p>“SIMD” is synonymous with “batching”. It stands for “single instruction, multiple data”: a single instruction dispatches parallel operations on multiple <em>lanes</em> of data. GPUs are the original SIMD machines.</p> <h2 id="lane-wise"><a href="#lane-wise">Lane-wise</a></h2> <p>“SIMD” and “vector” are often used interchangeably. The fundamental unit a SIMD instruction (or “vector instruction”) operates on is a vector: a fixed-size array of numbers that you primarily operate on component-wise These components are called <em>lanes</em>.</p> <p>SIMD vectors are usually quite small, since they need to fit into registers. For example, on my machine, the largest vectors are 256 bits wide. This is enough for 32 bytes (a <code>u8x32</code>), 4 double-precision floats (an <code>f64x8</code>), or all kinds of things in between.</p> <p><img src="https://mcyoung.xyz/public/simd-img/vectors.png" alt="some 256-bit vectors"></p> <p>Although this doesn’t seem like much, remember that offloading the overhead of keeping the pipeline saturated by a factor of 4x can translate to that big of a speedup in latency.</p> <h3 id="one-bit-lanes"><a href="#one-bit-lanes">One-bit Lanes</a></h3> <p>The simplest vector operations are bitwise: and, or, xor. Ordinary integers can be thought of as vectors themselves, with respect to the bitwise operations. That’s literally what “bitwise” means: lanes-wise with lanes that are one bit wide. An <code>i32</code> is, in this regard, an <code>i1x32</code>.</p> <p>In fact, as a warmup, let’s look at the problem of counting the number of 1 bits in an integer. This operation is called “population count”, or <code>popcnt</code>. If we view an <code>i32</code> as an <code>i1x32</code>, <code>popcnt</code> is just a fold or reduce operation:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>popcnt</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u32</span> <span>{</span>

Note that the accumulator needs to be higher precision to avoid overflow: accumulating into an <code>i1</code> (as with the <code>Iterator::reduce()</code> method) will only tell us whether the number of 1 bits is even or odd.</p> <p>Of course, this produces… comically bad code, frankly. We can do much better if we notice that we can <em>vectorize</em> the addition: first we add all of the adjacent pairs of bits together, then the pairs of pairs, and so on. This means the number of adds is logarithmic in the number of bits in the integer.</p> <p>Visually, what we do is we “unzip” each vector, shift one to line up the lanes, add them, and then repeat with lanes twice as big.</p> <p><img src="https://mcyoung.xyz/public/simd-img/popcnt.png" alt="first two popcnt merge steps"></p> <p>This is what that looks like in code.</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>popcnt</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u32</span> <span>{</span>

The search scope for such a simplification is in the regime of superoptimizers. However, the generated code is small and fast, which is why this is the ideal implementation of <code>popcnt</code> for systems without such an instruction.</p> <p>It’s <em>especially</em> nice because it is implementable for e.g. <code>u64</code> with only one more reduction step (remember: it’s <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(\log n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>!), and does not at any point require a full <code>u64</code> addition.</p> <p>Even though this is “just” using scalars, divide-and-conquer approaches like this are the bread and butter of the SIMD programmer.</p> <h3 id="scaling-up-operations-on-real-vectors"><a href="#scaling-up-operations-on-real-vectors">Scaling Up: Operations on Real Vectors</a></h3> <p>Proper SIMD vectors provide more sophisticated semantics than scalars do, particularly because there is more need to provide replacements for things like control flow. Remember, control flow is slow!</p> <p>What’s actually available is highly dependent on the architecture you’re compiling to (more on this later), but the way vector instruction sets are usually structured is something like this.</p> <p>We have <em>vector registers</em> that are kind of like really big general-purpose registers. For example, on x86, most “high performance” cores (like my Zen 2) implement AVX2, which provides 256 bit <code>ymm</code> vectors. The registers themselves do not have a “lane count”; that is specified by the instructions. For example, the “vector byte add instruction” interprets the register as being divided into eight-byte lanes and adds them. The corresponding x86 instruction is <code>vpaddb</code>, which interprets a <code>ymm</code> as an <code>i8x32</code>.</p> <p>The operations you usually get are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Bitwise operations. These don’t need to specify a lane width because it’s always implicitly <code>1</code>: they’re <em>bit</em>wise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lane-wise arithmetic. This is addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (both int and float), and shifts<sup id="fnref:shifts-are-arithmetic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:shifts-are-arithmetic" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (int only). Lane-wise min and max are also common. These require specifying a lane width. Typically the smallest number of lanes is two or four.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lane-wise compare. Given <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, we can create a new <em>mask vector</em> <code>m</code> such that <code>m[i] = a[i] &lt; b[i]</code> (or any other comparison operation). A mask vector’s lanes contain boolean values with an unusual bit-pattern: all-zeros (for false) or all-ones (for true)<sup id="fnref:minus-true" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:minus-true" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p> <ul> <li>Masks can be used to select between two vectors: for example, given <code>m</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code>, you can form a fourth vector <code>z</code> such that <code>z[i] = m[i] ? a[i] : b[i]</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Shuffles (sometimes called swizzles). Given <code>a</code> and <code>x</code>, create a third vector <code>s</code> such that <code>s[i] = a[x[i]]</code>. <code>a</code> is used as a lookup table, and <code>x</code> as a set of indices. Out of bounds produces a special value, usually zero. This emulates parallelized array access without needing to actually touch RAM (RAM is extremely slow).</p> <ul> <li>Often there is a “shuffle2” or “riffle” operation that allows taking elements from one of two vectors. Given <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>x</code>, we now define <code>s</code> as being <code>s[i] = (a ++ b)[x[i]]</code>, where <code>a ++ b</code> is a double-width concatenation. How this is actually implemented depends on architecture, and it’s easy to build out of single shuffles regardless.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>(1) and (2) are ordinary number crunching. Nothing deeply special about them.</p> <p>The comparison and select operations in (3) are intended to help SIMD code stay “branchless”. Branchless code is written such that it performs the same operations regardless of its inputs, and relies on the properties of those operations to produce correct results. For example, this might mean taking advantage of identities like <code>x * 0 = 0</code> and <code>a ^ b ^ a = b</code> to discard “garbage” results.</p> <p>The shuffles described in (4) are much more powerful than meets the eye.</p> <p>For example, “broadcast” (sometimes called “splat”) makes a vector whose lanes are all the same scalar, like Rust’s <code>[42; N]</code> array literal. A broadcast can be expressed as a shuffle: create a vector with the desired value in the first lane, and then shuffle it with an index vector of <code>[0, 0, ...]</code>.</p> <p><img src="https://mcyoung.xyz/public/simd-img/broadcast.png" alt="diagram of a broadcast"></p> <p>“Interleave” (also called “zip” or “pack”) takes two vectors <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and creates two new vectors <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> whose lanes are alternating lanes from <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. If the lane count is <code>n</code>, then <code>c = [a[0], b[0], a[1], b[1], ...]</code> and <code>d = [a[n/2], b[n/2], a[n/2 + 1], b[n/2 + 1], ...]</code>. This can also be implemented as a shuffle2, with shuffle indices of <code>[0, n, 1, n + 1, ...]</code>. “Deinterleave” (or “unzip”, or “unpack”) is the opposite operation: it interprets a pair of vectors as two halves of a larger vector of pairs, and produces two new vectors consisting of the halves of each pair.</p> <p>Interleave can also be interpreted as taking a <code>[T; N]</code>, transmuting it to a <code>[[T; N/2]; 2]</code>, performing a matrix transpose to turn it into a <code>[[T; 2]; N/2]</code>, and then transmuting that back to <code>[T; N]</code> again. Deinterleave is the same but it transmutes to <code>[[T; 2]; N/2]</code> first.</p> <p><img src="https://mcyoung.xyz/public/simd-img/interleave.png" alt="diagram of a interleave"></p> <p>“Rotate” takes a vector <code>a</code> with <code>n</code> lanes and produces a new vector <code>b</code> such that <code>b[i] = a[(i + j) % n]</code>, for some chosen integer <code>j</code>. This is yet another shuffle, with indices <code>[j, j + 1, ..., n - 1, 0, 1, ... j - 1]</code>.</p> <p><img src="https://mcyoung.xyz/public/simd-img/rotate.png" alt="diagram of a rotate"></p> <p>Shuffles are worth trying to wrap your mind around. SIMD programming is all about reinterpreting larger-than-an-integer-sized blocks of data as smaller blocks of varying sizes, and shuffling is important for getting data into the right “place”.</p> <h3 id="intrinsics-and-instruction-selection"><a href="#intrinsics-and-instruction-selection">Intrinsics and Instruction Selection</a></h3> <p>Earlier, I mentioned that what you get varies by architecture. This section is basically a giant footnote.</p> <p>So, there’s two big factors that go into this.</p> <ol> <li>We’ve learned over time which operations tend to be most useful to programmers. x86 might have something that ARM doesn’t because it “seemed like a good idea at the time” but turned out to be kinda niche.</li> <li>Instruction set extensions are often market differentiators, even within the same vendor. Intel has AVX-512, which provides even more sophisticated instructions, but it’s only available on high-end server chips, because it makes manufacturing more expensive.</li> </ol> <p>Toolchains generalize different extensions as “target features”. Features can be detected at runtime through architecture-specific magic. On Linux, the <code>lscpu</code> command will list what features the CPU advertises that it recognizes, which correlate with the names of features that e.g. LLVM understands. What features are enabled for a particular function affects how LLVM compiles it. For example, LLVM will only emit <code>ymm</code>-using code when compiling with <code>+avx2</code>.</p> <p>So how do you write portable SIMD code? On the surface, the answer is mostly “you don’t”, but it’s more complicated than that, and for that we need to understand how the later parts of a compiler works.</p> <p>When a user requests an add by writing <code>a + b</code>, how should I decide which instruction to use for it? This seems like a trick question… <em>just</em> an <code>add</code> right? On x86, even this isn’t so easy, since you have a choice between the actual <code>add</code> instruction, or a <code>lea</code> instruction (which, among other things, preserves the <code>rflags</code> register). This question becomes more complicated for more sophisticated operations. This general problem is called <em>instruction selection</em>.</p> <p>Because which “target features” are enabled affects which instructions are available, they affect instruction selection. When I went over operations “typically available”, this means that compilers will usually be able to select good choices of instructions for them on most architectures.</p> <p>Compiling with something like <code>-march=native</code> or <code>-Ctarget-cpu=native</code> gets you “the best” code possible for the machine you’re building on, but it might not be portable<sup id="fnref:abi" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:abi" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to different processors. Gentoo was quite famous for building packages from source on user machines to take advantage of this (not to mention that they loved using <code>-O3</code>, which mostly exists to slow down build times with little benefit).</p> <p>There is also runtime feature detection, where a program decides which version of a function to call at runtime by asking the CPU what it supports. Code deployed on heterogenous devices (like cryptography libraries) often make use of this. Doing this correctly is very hard and something I don’t particularly want to dig deeply into here.</p> <p>The situation is made worse by the fact that in C++, you usually write SIMD code using “intrinsics”, which are special functions with inscrutable names like <code>_mm256_cvtps_epu32</code> that represent a low-level operation in a specific instruction set (this is a float to int cast from AVX2). Intrinsics are defined by hardware vendors, but don’t necessarily map down to single instructions; the compiler can still optimize these instructions by merging, deduplication, and through instruction selection.</p> <p>As a result you wind up writing the same code multiple times for different instruction sets, with only minor maintainability benefits over writing assembly.</p> <p>The alternative is a portable SIMD library, which does some instruction selection behind the scenes at the library level but tries to rely on the compiler for most of the heavy-duty work. For a long time I was skeptical that this approach would actually produce good, competitive code, which brings us to the actual point of this article: using Rust’s portable SIMD library to implement a somewhat fussy algorithm, and measuring performance.</p> <h2 id="parsing-with-simd"><a href="#parsing-with-simd">Parsing with SIMD</a></h2> <p>Let’s design a SIMD implementation for a well-known algorithm. Although it doesn’t look like it at first, the power of shuffles makes it possible to parse text with SIMD. And this parsing can be very, very fast.</p> <p>In this case, we’re going to implement base64 decoding. To review, base64 is an encoding scheme for arbitrary binary data into ASCII. We interpret a byte slice as a bit vector, and divide it into six-bit chunks called <em>sextets</em>. Then, each sextet from 0 to 63 is mapped to an ASCII character:</p> <ol> <li><code>0</code> to <code>25</code> go to <code>'A'</code> to <code>'Z'</code>.</li> <li><code>26</code> to <code>51</code> go to <code>'a'</code> to <code>'z'</code>.</li> <li><code>52</code> to <code>61</code> go to <code>'0'</code> to <code>'9'</code>.</li> <li><code>62</code> goes to <code>+</code>.</li> <li><code>63</code> goes to <code>/</code>.</li> </ol> <p>There <em>are</em> other variants of base64, but the bulk of the complexity is the same for each variant.</p> <p>There are a few basic pitfalls to keep in mind.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Base64 is a “big endian” format: specifically, the bits in each byte are big endian. Because a sextet can span only parts of a byte, this distinction is important.</p> </li> <li> <p>We need to beware of cases where the input length is not divisible by 4; ostensibly messages should be padded with <code>=</code> to a multiple of 4, but it’s easy to just handle messages that aren’t padded correctly.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The length of a decoded message is given by this function:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>decoded_len</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>

But we can try. There are several branches in this code:</p> <ol> <li>The <code>for chunk in</code> line. This one is is the length check: it checks if there is any data left to process.</li> <li>The <code>for &amp;byte in</code> line. This is the hottest loop: it branches once per input byte.</li> <li>The <code>match byte</code> line is several branches, to determine which of the five “valid” match arms we land in.</li> <li>The <code>return Err</code> line. Returning in a hot loop is extra control flow, which is not ideal.</li> <li>The call to <code>decoded_len</code> contains a <code>match</code>, which generates branches.</li> <li>The call to <code>Vec::extend_from_slice</code>. This contains not just branches, but potential calls into the allocator. Extremely slow.</li> </ol> <p>(5) is the easiest to deal with. The <code>match</code> is mapping the values <code>0, 1, 2, 3</code> to <code>0, 1, 1, 2</code>. Call this function <code>f</code>. Then, the sequence given by <code>x - f(x)</code> is <code>0, 0, 1, 1</code>. This just happens to equal <code>x / 2</code> (or <code>x &gt;&gt; 1</code>), so we can write a completely branchless version of <code>decoded_len</code> like so.</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>decoded_len</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>

For example, by passing <code>0b110000</code> as <code>input[1]</code>, we see that the two high bits of <code>input[1]</code> correspond to the low bits of <code>output[0]</code>. I’ve written the code so that the bits in each byte are printed in little-endian order, so bits on the left are the low bits.</p> <p>Putting this all together, we can draw a schematic of what this operation does to a general <code>Simd&lt;u8, 4&gt;</code>.</p> <p><img src="https://mcyoung.xyz/public/simd-img/riffle.png" alt="the riffling operation"></p> <p>Now, there’s no single instruction that will do this for us. Shuffles can be used to move bytes around, but we’re dealing with <em>pieces</em> of bytes here. We also can’t really do a shift, since we need bits that are overshifted to move into adjacent lanes.</p> <p>The trick is to just make the lanes bigger.</p> <p>Among the operations available for SIMD vectors are lane-wise casts, which allow us to zero-extend, sign-extend, or truncate each lane. So what we can do is cast <code>sextets</code> to a vector of <code>u16</code>, do the shift there and then… somehow put the parts back together?</p> <p>Let’s see how far shifting gets us. How much do we need to shift things by? First, notice that the order of the bits within each chunk that doesn’t cross a byte boundary doesn’t change. For example, the four low bits of <code>input[1]</code> are in the same order when they become the high bits of <code>output[1]</code>, and the two high bits of <code>input[1]</code> are also in the same order when they become the low bits of <code>output[0]</code>.</p> <p>This means we can determine how far to shift by comparing the bit position of the lowest bit of a byte of <code>input</code> with the bit position of the corresponding bit in <code>output</code>.</p> <p><code>input[0]</code>’s low bit is the third bit of <code>output[0]</code>, so we need to shift <code>input[0]</code> by 2. <code>input[1]</code>’s lowest bit is the fifth bit of <code>output[1]</code>, so we need to shift by 4. Analogously, the shifts for <code>input[2]</code> and <code>input[3]</code> turn out to be 6 and 0. In code:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>sextets</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span>

For example, <code>shifted[0][0]</code> contains <code>sextet[0]</code>, but shifted. This corresponds to the red segment in the first schematic. The smaller blue segment is given by <code>shifted[1][1]</code>, i.e., the high byte of the second <code>u16</code>. It’s already in the right place within that byte, so we want <code>output[0] = shifted[0][0] | shifted[1][1]</code>.</p> <p>This suggests a more general strategy: we want to take two vectors, the low bytes and the high bytes of each <code>u16</code> in <code>shifted</code>, respectively, and somehow shuffle them so that when or’ed together, they give the desired output.</p> <p>Look at the schematic again: if we had a vector consisting of <code>[..aaaaaa, ....bbbb, ......cc]</code>, we could or it with a vector like <code>[bb......, cccc...., dddddd..]</code> to get the desired result.</p> <p>One problem: <code>dddddd..</code> is <code>shifted[3][0]</code>, i.e., it’s a low byte. If we change the vector we shift by to <code>[2, 4, 6, 8]</code>, though, it winds up in <code>shifted[3][1]</code>, since it’s been shifted up by <code>8</code> bits: a full byte.</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Split shifted into low byte and high byte vectors.</span>

You can load a <code>u64</code> from <code>p</code>, and then another one from <code>p + 7</code>; these loads (call them <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>) overlap by one byte, but we can or them together to merge that byte, so our loaded value is <code>a as u128 | (b as u128 &lt;&lt; 56)</code>.</p> <p>A similar trick works if the data to load is between a <code>u32</code> and a <code>u64</code>. Finally, to load 1, 2, or 3 bytes, we can load <code>p</code>, <code>p + len/2</code> and <code>p + len-1</code>; depending on whether <code>len</code> is 1, 2, or 3, this will potentially load the same byte multiple times; however, this reduces the number of branches necessary, since we don’t need to distinguish the 1, 2, or 3 lines.</p> <p>This is the kind of code that’s probably easier to read than to explain.</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>

But standard transformer blocks are far from simple, interweaving attention and MLP sub-blocks with skip connections &amp; normalisation layers in precise arrangements. This complexity leads to brittle architectures, where seemingly minor changes can significantly reduce training speed, or render models untrainable.
<br>In this work, we ask to what extent the standard transformer block can be simplified? Combining signal propagation theory and empirical observations, we motivate modifications that allow many block components to be removed with no loss of training speed, including skip connections, projection or value parameters, sequential sub-blocks and normalisation layers. In experiments on both autoregressive decoder-only and BERT encoder-only models, our simplified transformers emulate the per-update training speed and performance of standard transformers, while enjoying 15% faster training throughput, and using 15% fewer parameters.

    <p>Nov 27, 2023</p>
    <p>Salvatore Sanfilippo, aka <a href="https://github.com/antirez">antirez</a> released a <a href="https://github.com/antirez/botlib">telegram bot library in C</a> recently. While I'm not at all interested in a telegram bot library, I always like to read Salvatore's code, which is uniformly superb.</p>
<p>The bit of code that caught my eye in this release is in <a href="https://github.com/antirez/botlib/blob/ca2f977deeb3455e69e9a8f6b8ba711798dba6e6/json_wrap.c">this file</a>, which implements a simple selector library on top of the <a href="https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON">json library he's using</a>. In about 100 lines of code, it implements a function that parses and executes a tiny <a href="https://notes.billmill.org/programming/json/jq.html">jq</a>-like language:</p>
<pre><code><div><pre><span></span><span>/* You can select things like this:</span>
<span> *</span>
<span> * cJSON *json = cJSON_Parse(myjson_string);</span>
<span> * cJSON *width = cJSON_Select(json,".features.screens[*].width",4);</span>
<span> * cJSON *height = cJSON_Select(json,".features.screens[4].*","height");</span>
<span> * cJSON *price = cJSON_Select(json,".features.screens[4].price_*",</span>
<span> *                  price_type == EUR ? "eur" : "usd");</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>It's a really nice example of just how simple you can make a parser for a tiny language.</p>
<p>I think it'd be fun to re-implement this in another language to understand it better, and I might give it a go at some point.</p>

<p>(I did <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1699862605517713786">a Twitter thread</a> on this a while back, against my better judgment, and now moving to a proper blog.)</p>
<hr>
<p>The <code>hanging-punctuation</code> property in CSS is almost a no-brainer. The classic example is a blockquote that starts with a curly-quote. Hanging that opening curly-quote into the space off to the start of the text and aligning the actual words is a better look.</p>

<p>The blue line is just to help see the alignment.</p>

<p>It is a cascading property, so you can just do this if you like:</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>html</span> {
  <span>hanging-punctuation</span>: first last;
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
<p>In case you go against the grain, for aesthetics, and align text the other way, the `last` value will hang punctuation off the other else also. That’s what it’s supposed to do anyway, but in my testing (trying quotes and periods), Safari doesn’t support that. 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>There is some risk to the property. Because the punctuation hangs off the edge, if you don’t have any available space, it can trigger a horizontal scroll bar, which sucks. This is probably why it’s not a default. It’s rare there is zero space on the edge of text, though, so meh.</p>

<p>Want it to work across all browsers? Use a negative <code>text-indent</code> instead. Then test for support and replace it.</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-2" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>blockquote</span> {
  <span>text-indent</span>: -<span>0.45em</span>; 
}
@​supports (<span>hanging-punctuation:</span> first) {
  <span>blockquote</span> {
    <span>text-indent</span>: <span>0</span>;
    <span>hanging-punctuation</span>: first;
  }
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-2"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
<p>Having to use a magic number for the `text-indent` kinda sucks, so definitely isolate where you are applying it. Here’s a demo where a custom property is used instead to make it less weird:</p>

<p>By the way! For putting curly quotes on blockquote, might as well do that in CSS rather than in the content.</p>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-3" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>blockquote</span> {
  &amp;::before {
    <span>content</span>: open-quote;
  }
  &amp;<span>::after</span> {

<p>Hanging punctuation is relevant in design software and print design as well. I feel like any half-decent book typesetting will be doing this. Adobe InDesign calls it “Optical Margin Alignment”.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RPG Engine for the Nintendo 64</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2>
<p dir="auto">This unnamed project is an attempt to write all the parts of an RPG from scratch. Below is the list of features currently being written:</p>
<ul>
<li> Actors</li>
<li> Player</li>
<li> Camera</li>
<li> NPCs</li>
<li> Collision</li>
<li> Map Rendering
<ul>
<li> Background (Landscape) Tilemap</li>
<li> Foreground (Structure / Building) Tilemap</li>
<li> NPC Map Layer</li>
<li> Entrance/Exit Layer
<ul>
<li> Entrance/Exit Triggers</li>
<li> Map Switching</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Map Builder (external tool; Tiled)</li>
<li> Tilemap Renderer from Map Builder's Binaries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you are on Windows, you will need to first set up WSL to get a linux environment in Windows</p>
<p dir="auto">You will need to install the following (if you are using WSL, you will need to install inside that environment):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Docker</li>
<li>NodeJS &gt;v18</li>
<li>NPM</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To get libdragon setup, you will need to run the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Make sure the Docker daemon is running</li>
<li><code>npm i libdragon -g</code></li>
<li><code>cd /path/to/this/project</code></li>
<li><code>libdragon init</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To build the project:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>libdragon make assets</code></li>
<li><code>libdragon make</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This will produce an N64 ROM  called <code>breacodes.z64</code></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Playing</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The best way to play is on a real Nintendo 64 via a flashcart</h3>
<p dir="auto">However if you must use an emulator, you must use an accurate emulator such as Ares. Common emulators are <em><strong>not</strong></em> accurate. They are typically optimized to run official games at a good speed, but are not hardware accurate. <code>libdragon</code> is a different from the official SDK, and most emulators cover emulation for the official SDK only, meaning it requires hardware accuracy or specially built support.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Editing the map</h2>
<p dir="auto">To make the map, I used software called <a href="https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled?download" rel="nofollow">Tiled</a>. You can find the project file at <code>map/n64-rpg.tiled-project</code>. I export as a CSV called <code>overworld.csv</code> and it will generate a CSV for each layer.</p>
<p dir="auto">To build the mpa, run the included tool with <code>python3 tools/makemap.py</code> to generate the map file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Important notes:</p>
<p dir="auto">I work only in the positive area (0,0) and higher. Do not add any tiles in the negative coordinates or it will shift the entire map.</p>
<p dir="auto">Tiled does not export with perfect coordinates in CSV format, so every layer must have a tile in the (0,0) coordinate. This is to prevent offset problems. For example, the background layer has a grass tile at (0,0), and the foreground layer has a tree.</p>

<!-- cache hit 74:single/related:c86ee390c9378031a828d29352811a8a --><!-- empty -->
<p>App developer Elias Saba has had some bad luck with Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedowns. His Android TV app Downloader, which combines a web browser with a file manager, was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/google-bans-downloader-app-after-tv-firms-complain-it-can-load-a-pirate-website/">suspended by Google Play in May</a> after several Israeli TV companies complained that the app could be used to load a pirate website.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/google-un-bans-downloader-app-but-developer-still-mad-about-broken-dmca/">reversed that suspension</a> after three weeks. But Downloader has been suspended by Google Play again, and this time the reason is even harder to understand. Based on a vague DMCA notice, it appears that Downloader was suspended simply because it can load <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/">the Warner Bros. website</a>.</p>
<p>Downloader is similar to standard web browsers in that it lets users access both legal and illegally shared content. The app can be used for general web surfing and can download files from a website when a user inputs the desired URL. According to Saba, the app itself contains no infringing content, nor does it direct users to infringing content.</p>
<p>Google notified Saba that the app was suspended again last night, according to the notice that Saba shared with Ars. "Your app contains content that allegedly infringes upon the copyright of others, and violates applicable copyright laws in the relevant country/jurisdiction," the notice from Google said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The notice includes a copy of the DMCA complaint, which came from <a href="https://markscan.co.in/">MarkScan</a>, a "digital asset protection" firm that content owners hire to enforce copyrights. MarkScan said in its complaint that it represents Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.</p>
<h2>“Properties of Warner Bros. Discovery”</h2>
<p>A DMCA notice is supposed to identify and describe the copyrighted work that was infringed. But MarkScan's notice about Downloader identifies the copyrighted work only as "Properties of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc." It provides no detail on which Warner Bros. work was infringed by Downloader.</p>
<p>A DMCA notice is also supposed to provide an example of where someone can see "an authorized example of the work." In this field, MarkScan simply entered the main Warner Bros. URL: <a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.warnerbros.com/</a>.</p>
<p>"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law," MarkScan's notice said.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Saba is outraged. "You would think that Google would at least verify that the takedown request is actually making a plausible claim," he told Ars today. "The most important field in the takedown where the claimant has to specify where the copyright infringement exists is void of all detail. If this complete lack of information is all it takes to take an app down, then no app in the Google Play Store is safe from being suspended with just a few clicks and a frivolous takedown request."</p>
<p>The Downloader app had been installed over 10 million times, according to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230824170506/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esaba.downloader">Internet Archive capture</a> taken before the latest suspension.</p>

The answer-- as others have pointed out-- is no. But it's interesting to look at why in the early 1990s that might have been a popular choice for a sitcom family dynamic and how Peg Bundy differed from other sitcom women of her era and those who came before her.</p>

<p>Let's look at the original sitcom woman: Lucy. She managed to live in an apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting and fresh drapes while living on a single-income non-white entertainer's salary in the 1950s and maintaining a friendship with her landlord and his wife. Was that realistic? Probably not. But the show didn't get into the details of how they paid the bills. It presented the normalized idea that men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home and had lots of spare time to get into crazy schemes. Her schemes-- even when they were purely economical ones-- were always motivated internally. Lucy wanted fame: on television, or in the club, or in Hollywood. She never tried to advance herself to make money. Because that's not the sort of thing a (successful?) woman did.</p>

<p>The next relevant sitcom wife of the era was Laura Pietrie (Mary Tyler Moore on the Dick Van Dyke show). Again, here was a pretty domestic wife, now in a New York suburb instead of the city. On a few occasions she did go after money opportunities-- like appearing on a game show-- but the premise of the episode was never that the family's economic security was in doubt. Instead, the woman grasping after success was characterized as reaching at "even more" economic success for "already successful" households.</p>

<p>In reality, in this era, the work situation was anything but rosy or optional. Firms like Manpower and Kelly Girl were discovering the power of the female "temp" workforce. Why pay a full-time (male) clerk (who would expect benefits and a pension) when you could just as easily hire a Kelly Girl "temp" who was "just doing this for some extra money" and didn't have to be paid-- even thought of-- if she were sick, unavailable, or anything else. You were paying Kelly Girl, and if your usual Kelly Girl was unavailable, they'd just send a different one.</p>

<p>These details of women entering the workplace are detailed in TEMP by Louis Hyman, who is a labor economist at Cornell. In his book, he makes the point that in the post-war 20th Century, women were essential in establishing the idea of "temp" labor, and once big corporate management consultancy firms (McKinsey being the big one) figured out how much more profitable it was to hire only temp workers-- the economy was forever changed.</p>

<p>But the real changes in the economy were light-years ahead of what we saw on TV. In 1977 we saw the release of The Mary Tyler Moore Show: a big deal because it featured a single woman renting an apartment and holding a newspaper job on her own: contrasted by Phyllis, of course, a "normal" woman with a child and husband. But there was also Rhoda, Mary's "weird" neighbor who washed her own windows and wore trousers. Fifty years ago, these details were groundshaking.</p>

<p>Anyway, fast forward through the series of spinoffs from the MGM TV world and Norman Lear's universe to pause briefly on Edith Bunker. Here again-- 25 years after Lucy-- was a homemaker wife who would never even DREAM of holding a job other than taking care of her husband. And suddenly-- magically-- that's what makes her ridiculous. Edith is always portrayed as the voice of... well-- if not reason-- common sense maybe. And although Archie Bunker's household is still living as if it's the 1950s... they're certainly not living as well as Lucy did in the 1950s... Meathead is not afraid to point this out. Edith is.</p>

<p>Moving on further: the pilot of Cheers. 1980s now. Diane enters Cheers to enjoy a toast: she's just gotten engaged. But her fiancé runs off to be with his ex wife so suddenly... she needs a job? What an unusual and unexpected position for an educated white woman to be in!? She takes the job but immediately the stakes turn into a sexual ping-pong match between her and her boss. I guess the idea that she was even at the table was considered revolutionary.</p>

<p>Later, there was Murphy Brown. She was the opposite of all these sitcom wives: married to her career. Sexless. But a woman! And hot! The writers couldn't resist and eventually a pregnancy story got built into the show, which Dan Quayle-- Vice-President-at-the-Time who once spelled potato wrong and for a brief period of time that's the stupidest we thought Republicans could ever be-- took great offense to. Anyway he tried to burn Murphy Brown but historically speaking he was too stupid to and failed. The show carried on for several seasons including Murphy once stealing the 'T' off TRUMP Tower but the point was always that she was some sort of exceptional, outsize woman, not anybody normal. A woman, but not a wife. This was new and revolutionary.</p>

<p>So we've reached Peg Bundy. After generations where the hits had sterling, strong wives: why was she a bon-bon eating, stay at home manicurist? And why was it so successful? Well... in a weird way... because it was new. As much as these outsider perspectives on women in television had on women making advancements in the field of women's equality, there were still lots of places in America (and then later, the rest of the world) where women had NOT seen the sort of economic and labor equalizing forces that defined the 20th Century. </p>

<p>Married With Children became a huge international hit. In Russia it aired five nights a week: they recreated the entire English language series, then commissioned the original American writing staff to write an entire extra season that would air in Russia (and then get re-broadcast in Ukraine, Poland, etc.). </p>

<p>My point is that since there was such a social incentive to make the point that your wife didn't "need" to work, she just did to "get out of the house" or whatever, the idea of working women wasn't normalized on television until the late 90s, when Al Bundy: supporter of a decadent wife and even more decadent children became the face of "enough is enough". Men saw-- through Al Bundy-- an economy that had long ceased to exist (a single male breadwinner; no education but the expectation is to put the kids through college) and didn't get the joke. You're out here checking Chicago real estate prices instead of asking the bigger question: were single-income retail families viable in the 1990s? No. They were not. </p>

<p>What this meant for women was especially tough. There was a tacit understanding that going to work was something "everyone was doing" but was also "not normal". That can't hold for long. In the  late 90s and early 00s we see and justify women working (in general) with them excelling in female-driven careers: Monica is a chef; Rachel is a personal shopper at Bloomingdales. We've since moved on from a family dynamic in the Chicago suburbs and are looking at a sitcom area dominated by childless attractive people unstressed by the worries that 9/11 might convey.</p>

<p>And we've been carrying forward our unwillingness to confront those troubles for 20 years now. </p>

<p>I am struggling to imagine a broadly successful sitcom pilot in which we don't ask the question, "but why does the wife have a job?" The best answer might be Modern Family. That pilot aired in 2009, and still, the answer was <em>because she works for her dad</em>. </p>

<p>The good question isn't 'why doesn't Peg Bundy have a job in the early 90's'. The good question is "why, in the early 90's, would we look at Peg Bundy and assume she's real?" That question has everything to do with a calculated effort to denormalize women as equal contributors to the household and hypernormalize the male breadwinner at a time when it was so anti-normal that we were there to laugh at it. As we're seeing now: people adhere to old visions of society until a big impact occasion forces them to change focus.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After 151 years, <em>Popular Science</em> will no longer be available to purchase as a magazine. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Cathy Hebert, the communications director for <em>PopSci</em> owner Recurrent Ventures, says the outlet needs to “evolve” beyond its magazine product, which published its <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/popsci-spring-2021-digital-issue/">first all-digital issue in 2021</a>.</p><p><em>PopSci</em>, which covers a whole range of stories related to the fields of science, technology, and nature, published its first issue in 1872. Things have changed a lot over the years, with the magazine <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/07/this-mag-accurately-predicted-the-future-95-years-ago/">switching to a quarterly publication</a> schedule in 2018 and doing away with the physical copies altogether after 2020.</p><section tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p><span><img alt="<em>The November 1921 issue of </em>Popular

Purbita Saha commented on the magazine’s discontinuation, stating she’s “frustrated, incensed, and appalled that the owners shut down a pioneering publication that’s adapted to 151 years worth of changes in the space of a five-minute Zoom call.” Layoffs have impacted journalists on the science beat particularly hard in recent weeks. <a

The digital media group Recurrent Ventures <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recurrent-ventures-named-the-new-parent-company-of-popular-science-the-drive-domino-field--stream-and-other-brands-301312885.html">acquired <em>PopSci</em></a><em> </em>in 2021 and <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/recurrent-ventures-new-ceo-andrew-perlman/">named its third CEO</a> in three years just one week before the layoffs hit. </p><p><em>PopSci</em> will continue to offer articles on its website, along with its PopSci Plus subscription, which offers access to exclusive content and the magazine’s archive.
