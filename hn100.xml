<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I spent a recent flight finding out what I could do with a connection to the flight’s wifi, but without access to the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/flight.jpg" alt="The view from my seat on the flight"></p>
<p>I was on my way home from Strange Loop, a direct flight from St. Louis to Oakland.
It’s a long enough flight that I planned to purchase the $8 internet access and get some work done, but Southwest’s wifi portal wouldn’t accept any form of payment.
The web page didn’t give me any helpful error messages, so I opened up my browser’s network dev tools to see if I could figure out what was going wrong.</p>
<p>I found the failing request, but it didn’t provide any useful hints to point me toward a solution.
While I was there, I saw another request that caught my eye: A repeating successful request for <code>current.json</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/current-json-requests.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing requests for current.json in my browser"></p>
<p>Here’s an example response from one of those requests:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"sat_commlink_portal"</span>: {

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This appeared to be the data that drives the in-flight wifi portal’s flight status page.
Since this was one of the only things I could access on this network, I decided to make the most of it.</p>
<p>I used my browser’s “Copy as cURL” feature to quickly get a command to hit the endpoint.
As an aside, this feature is present in Firefox and all chromium-based browsers and it’s really handy if you ever need to reply requests made by your browser and want to send all the same headers.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/copy-as-curl.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing where the “Copy as cURL” option is"></p>
<p>After some experimenting, I found that none of the cookies or headers that were included in the request were strictly necessary, meaning that I could fetch the data with a simple <code>curl 'https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json'</code>.
I set up a loop to dump the data in a log file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>watch -n <span>30</span> <span>"curl https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json | jq -c &gt;&gt; flight-logs"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I didn’t know what I’d do with the data at this point, but I started collecting it right away so that I’d have as much as possible to play with later.</p>
<p>With that running, I decided to look more closely at the responses to figure out what exactly I had to work with.
Here’s that same example response, annotated with my best guess at what the fields represent:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Most of that is straightforward, but I’m curious about a few parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the difference between <code>sat_commlink_portal.status</code> and <code>satcomm_status.commlink</code>?</li>
<li>Is <code>pcent_flt_complete</code> in terms of distance or in terms of estimated time?</li>
<li>How much with <code>altVal</code>, <code>etad</code>, and <code>gspdVal</code> fluctuate throughout the flight?</li>
<li>What is the <code>ac</code> in <code>actime24</code>? I would think “aircraft”, but in this case that time is the current time in our destination, not the current time in the aircraft’s location.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent the flight working on some scripts that could visualize some of the data
after I finished collecting it.
Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<h2 id="change-in-altitude-over-time">Change in altitude over time</h2>
<p>Going into this, I was mostly curious to see how noisy the altitude data would be.</p>
<canvas id="altitude-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Flight altitude chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's altitude over time here.
</canvas>

<p>It’s difficult to see the noise with such a large range.
Here’s the same data, but with the plane’s descent removed:</p>
<canvas id="cropped-altitude-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Flight altitude chart (cropped)">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's altitude over time here.
</canvas>

<p>According to this data, the plane’s altitude was only fluctuating by about 20-30 feet.
This is more stable than I expected!
I had assumed that I’d see a lot more change here, but I don’t know what’s normal and I don’t know how accurate this data is.</p>
<h2 id="change-in-eta-over-time">Change in ETA over time</h2>
<p>I predicted that this would be reasonably stable, and it was.
This was a pretty smooth flight, at least after the initial departure.</p>
<canvas id="eta-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="ETA chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's change ETA over time here.
</canvas>

<p>I’m curious what this would have looked like if we had a delayed landing due to weather.
Would the reported ETA slowly creep up as the airline’s confidence in the delay increased, or would it spike up sharply near the end?</p>
<h2 id="change-in-ground-speed-over-time">Change in ground speed over time</h2>
<p>This was also stable, as expected.</p>
<canvas id="ground-speed-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Ground speed chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's ground speed over time here.
</canvas>

<p><em>edit: I originally labeled these speeds as MPH, but <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37691582">some HN readers helpfully pointed out that these are more likely to be knots</a>.</em></p>
<p>I wish I had started collecting the data earlier in the flight.
I’m curious to see shape of this curve as we approached cruising speed.</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn’t find anything particularly useful or surprising here, but this was a fun way to spend the flight!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="">
<p>
<strong>According to a media report, a striking number of work accidents occur in the factory of the US electric car manufacturer Tesla in Grünheide. IG Metall has called on Tesla to make improvements to occupational safety.</strong>
</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, the US car company Tesla opened its factory in Grünheide near Berlin. Accidents at work have not been uncommon since then – this is what the magazine “Stern” reports, citing previously unknown documents from authorities and emergency services.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-taeglich-Unfaelle-bei-Tesla-in-Gruenheide">“Accidents almost every day” at Tesla in Grünheide</h2>
<p>According to a file note from the State Office for Occupational Safety, “accidents occurred almost daily on the factory premises over a long period of time.” According to research, Tesla is said to have reported at least 190 reportable accidents between June and November 2022 alone. In Germany, all work accidents must be reported. </p>
<p>According to “Stern”, documents from the rescue centers also documented that Tesla boss Elon Musk’s factory requested an ambulance or helicopter 247 times in the first year after opening alone. For comparison: Converted to the number of employees, this is three times as many emergencies – in a similar period of time – as occurred, for example, at the Audi factory in Ingolstadt. </p>
<h2 id="Verbrennungen-und-amputierte-Gliedmassen">Burns and amputated limbs</h2>
<p>The rescue reports showed, among other things, that a wooden box weighing 50 kilograms fell on an employee’s head from a height of several meters. Another employee broke into a dosing oven with red-hot aluminum with his foot. The injuries listed by the rescuers also included amputated limbs and injuries caused by burns or hydrochloric acid. </p>
<h2 id="IG-Metall-fordert-Tesla-zu-Nachbesserungen-auf">IG Metall calls on Tesla <span>Improvements </span>on</h2>
<p>IG Metall has now called on Tesla to improve occupational safety for employees in the plant. “Health comes before profit – that also applies to Tesla in Grünheide,” said Dirk Schulze, IG Metall district manager for Berlin-Brandenburg-Saxony, today. IG Metall has long been concerned about occupational safety at the plant. </p>
<p>Numerous employees reported accidents and health problems, in some areas this led to sickness rates of up to 40 percent. Instead of addressing the causes, management reacts by putting pressure on the sick. Fewer staff should produce the same quantities. “The management clearly does not give the issue of occupational health and safety a priority.” </p>
<h2 id="Bisher-26-Umwelt-Vorfaelle-in-Gruenheide">So far 26 environmental incidents in Grünheide</h2>
<p>There have also been several environmental incidents since the factory opened a year and a half ago. Tesla has since reported 26 environmental accidents. This emerges from information from the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment, which “Stern” reports on and which is also available to the dpa news agency. These include spilled substances such as paint, diesel and fires. Part of the site lies in the water protection area. </p>
<p>Specifically, the accidents included leaks of 15,000 liters of paint, 13 tons of aluminum and 50 and 150 liters of diesel. The paint incident in April 2022 was already known. According to information from the State Environment Agency, paint and aluminum were disposed of professionally or properly. </p>
<h2 id="Gefahr-fuer-das-Trinkwasser">Danger to drinking water?</h2>
<p>The “Stern” also reported that after a fire in September 2020, up to 300 liters of extinguishing water seeped into the ground; 250 liters of diesel leaked in a gas station on site in May 2023. The State Environment Agency did not provide any information on this. </p>
<p>The head of ecosystems at the Leibniz Institute for Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Martin Pusch, spoke of a fundamentally high risk with regard to drinking water. “There is a high risk of impairment of the drinking water supply due to the low retention capacity of the subsoil,” Pusch told dpa. Tesla has dismissed concerns. </p>

                <figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image1-35.png" alt="Cloudflare is now powering Microsoft Edge Secure Network" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1014"></figure><p>Between third-party cookies that track your activity across websites, to highly targeted advertising based on your IP address and browsing data, it's no secret that today’s Internet browsing experience isn’t as private as it should be. Here at Cloudflare, we believe everyone should be able to browse the Internet free of persistent tracking and prying eyes.</p><p>That’s why we’re excited to announce that we’ve partnered with Microsoft Edge to provide a fast and secure VPN, right in the browser. Users don’t have to install anything new or understand complex concepts to get the latest in network-level privacy: Edge Secure Network VPN is available on the latest consumer version of Microsoft Edge in most markets, and automatically comes with 5 GB of data. Just enable the feature by going to <em>[Microsoft Edge Settings &amp; more (…) &gt; Browser essentials, </em>and click <em>Get VPN for free]</em>. See Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/edge-secure-network-vpn?form=MT00D8">Edge Secure Network page</a> for more details.</p><h3 id="cloudflare%E2%80%99s-privacy-proxy-platform-isn%E2%80%99t-your-typical-vpn">Cloudflare’s Privacy Proxy platform isn’t your typical VPN</h3><p>To take a step back: a VPN is a way in which the Internet traffic leaving your device is tunneled through an intermediary server operated by a provider – in this case, Cloudflare! There are many important pieces that make this possible, but among them is the VPN<em> </em>protocol, which defines the way in which the tunnel is established and how traffic flows through it. You may have heard of some of these protocols: Wireguard, IPsec, and OpenVPN, for example. And while we’re no stranger to these, (Cloudflare’s WireGuard implementation is currently in use by millions of devices that use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>) – we see our Privacy Proxy Platform as a way to push forward the next frontier of Internet privacy and embrace one of Cloudflare’s core values: open Internet standards.</p><p>The Privacy Proxy Platform implements HTTP CONNECT, a method defined in the <a href="http://placeholder/">HTTP standard</a> that proxies traffic by establishing a tunnel and then sending reliable and ordered byte streams through that tunnel. You can read more about this proxying method (and its history!) in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-primer-on-proxies/">Primer on Proxies</a>.</p><p>We also leverage other parts of Cloudflare’s privacy-oriented infrastructure that are already deployed at scale: requests first utilize <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">1.1.1.1</a> for DNS, a token proxy based on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/privacypass/about/">Privacy Pass</a> for client authentication, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">Geo-egress</a> to choose an accurate egress IP address without exposing users’ precise location.</p><h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3><p>Let’s dive into the details of these components. For the purposes of this blog, we’ll call the devices people are using to browse the Internet (your phone, tablet or computer) <em>clients, </em>and the websites they’re trying to visit <em>origin sites.</em></p><p>The Privacy Proxy Platform includes three main parts:</p><ol><li><strong>Token Proxy</strong>: this is the service that checks if you’re an Edge Secure Network user with a legitimate Microsoft account.</li><li><strong>Privacy API</strong>: based on the above, Cloudflare’s Privacy API issues authentication tokens that clients use for authenticating to the proxy itself.</li><li><strong>Privacy Proxy</strong>: this is the HTTP CONNECT-based proxy service running on Cloudflare’s network. This service checks that the client presents a valid authentication token, and if so, proxies the encrypted HTTP request to the origin site. It is also responsible for selecting a valid egress IP address to be used.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="897"></figure><p>When Edge Secure Network protections are on – say, when a user connects to an open Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop – our proxy will automatically prompt that client for a token to authenticate. If the client has a token, it will present one. If it doesn’t, it will utilize the token proxy to mint a new pool using the help of an attester and issuer: the attester checks the validity of the client and Microsoft account, and the issuer issues tokens for that client in return. This dance is based on the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/supporting-the-latest-version-of-the-privacy-pass-protocol/">Privacy Pass protocol</a>. Importantly, it allows Cloudflare to validate that clients are who they say they are without collecting or storing personal information from Microsoft users.</p><p>Once the client has presented the proxy server with a valid token, the Privacy Proxy then chooses a valid egress IP address based on a hash of the client’s geolocation. It then uses the DNS record (provided by Cloudflare’s DNS resolver, <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>) to open up an encrypted session to the origin website. From there, it’s pretty straightforward: if the user continues to browse on that site, further requests will be sent through that connection, if they stop or close the browser, that connection will close as well.</p><p>Because Cloudflare proxies millions of requests per second, many of the operational aspects of the proxy are managed by <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/">Oxy</a>, our proxying framework that handles everything from telemetry, graceful restarts, to stream multiplexing and IP fallbacks, and authentication <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oxy-extensibility/">hooks</a>.</p><h3 id="low-last-mile-latency-and-geolocation-parity-thanks-to-cloudflare%E2%80%99s-network">Low last-mile latency and geolocation parity thanks to Cloudflare’s Network</h3><p>Cloudflare’s privacy proxy implementation maximizes user experience without sacrificing privacy. When Edge Secure Network is enabled, users will have search and browsing results relevant to where they’re geographically located. At Cloudflare, we call this the pizza test: people should be able to use any of our privacy proxy products and still be able to get results for “<em>pizza places near me</em>”. We accomplish this by always egressing through a Cloudflare data center that has an IP address that corresponds to the user’s location – we’ve written more about how we did this for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>.</p><p>Unlike your typical VPN operator that has dozens – sometimes hundreds – of servers, Cloudflare has a much larger footprint: data centers in <a href="https://cloudflare.com/network">over 300 cities</a>. Because our network is an anycast “every service, everywhere” approach, each of our data centers can accept traffic from an Edge Secure network client. This means that Edge users will automatically detect and connect with a Cloudflare data center geographically very close to them, minimizing last-mile latency. Finally, because Cloudflare also operates a CDN, websites that are already on Cloudflare will be given a “hot-path,” and will load faster.</p><p>We at Cloudflare are always striving to bring more privacy options to the open Internet, and we are excited to provide more private and secure browsing to Edge users.

I'm not sure why a bot detection service would need to check sensors, but maybe it's just one signal in a myriad of signals to detect if a requestor is a human or a bot?

The BMP SDK collects behavioral data while the user is interacting with the application. This behavioral data, also known as sensor data, includes the device characteristics, device orientation, accelerometer data, touch events, etc. Akamai BMP SDK provides a simple API to detect bot activities and defend against malicious bot and account takeover.</blockquote><p>It includes this graphic, which just seems to reinforce the above description, that their bot detection service(s) uses sensor data like accelerometer capabilities to determine whether a requestor is a bot or not.</p><figure><img src="https://grantwinney.com/content/images/2020/07/infographic_overview_human-request_redo.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption>source: <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Bot Manager Premier SDK</a></figcaption></figure><p>I feel fairly confident that's the answer, but it leaves at least one more question...</p><h3 id="but-why-do-they-expect-desktops-to-have-an-accelerometer">But why do they expect desktops to have an accelerometer?</h3><p>I think maybe it's an oversight, but I can't really prove it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
  ONE of the most iconic trees in the UK has come down overnight, with authorities believing it's been deliberately felled.
</p><div id="po-inline-articlegate-partialarticle">
<p>
  The Sycamore Gap tree&nbsp;which stood tall&nbsp;next to Hadrian's Wall near Crag Lough in Northumberland,&nbsp;is standing no more, pictures from the scene show.
</p>
<p>
  In a statement, Northumberland National Park Authority said: "Northumberland National Park Authority can confirm that sadly, the famous tree at Sycamore Gap has come down overnight. We have reason to believe it has been deliberately felled.
</p>

<p>
  "We are working with the relevant agencies and partners with an interest in this iconic North East landmark and will issue more details once they are known.
</p>
<p>
  "Sycamore Gap was voted English Tree of the Year in 2016 in the Woodland Trust’s awards and is much-loved by people from across the world.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/23819533.live-updates-shock-iconic-sycamore-gap-taken/">Follow live updates here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  "Northumberland National Park Authority would like to ask the public not to visit the site at this time whilst we work with our partners to identify what has happened and to make the site safe."
</p>

<p>
  The location was once a popular photographic subject, and it was described as one of the most photographed trees in the country.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It featured in the 1991 film&nbsp;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and won the&nbsp;2016 England Tree of the Year&nbsp;award.
</p>
<p>
  A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: “We can confirm an investigation has been launched following damage to the Sycamore Gap Tree in Northumberland.
</p>
<p>
  “Enquiries are ongoing to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed."

I'm a big believer in "decision support systems". Find out <i>what</i> decisions your customers need to make, repeatedly, to their job.  Quantify the heuristics and visualize that information (and that information only) in an easy to consume manner.  More often than not <i>that's an email or PDF</i>. Another advantage is that by <i>supporting</i> the business users they feel less threatened by the changes or technology.<p>I think "self-serve" analytics is silly, the idea that you put all of the data in front of people and they'll derive "insights". That's not how normal people or data work. We just had a discussion on HN the other day about Facebook's Prophet, and its pitfalls.  Meanwhile we expect Joe in sales to be able to identify useful trends on a chart he made.  <i>Every</i> company needs to forecast, regardless of their sophistication.  That stuff needs to be defined by the right people and given to the users.

It mixes 'strategic insights' with 'operational needs'. And I think self-service needs to be about operationalizing data. Sales managers are not necessarily looking to 'analyze' data or 'get an insight'. They need answers from data to manage their team. They need to track well-defined KPIs. See how their salespeople are doing and be able to have a productive meeting to tell them what they are neglecting. Customer success people need to "pull some data real quick" on the usage of the product by a certain client before a meeting.<p>These things happen all the time. And yet most companies out there think that the solution is to just build a bunch of dashboards, foreseeing what everyone will ask in the future. And then nobody checks the dashboards. Or finds the right one. And then they have a team of SQL translators pulling data for ad-hoc questions. That's silly IMO.</p><p>I'm obviously biased as a founder of a self-service analytics company based on AI (<a href="https://www.veezoo.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.veezoo.com</a>). But this is just my 2 cents on a topic I really care about.

It was shocking -- at the time (I was naive) -- how many business requirements were essentially "replicate Excel in a browser", and completely divorced from the actual business processes and decisions that needed to be made.<p>Also, it might surprise a lot of less experienced developers just how many reporting tools are actually pieces of a workflow, not just reports.  If you sniff this out during the requirements phase, do your best to convert these reports into features of an actual workflow app/system rather than allow them to persist as standalone reports.

A fun, and fairly quick, way to develop that is by taking a course on financial modelling (in excel). Modelling a business in a spreadsheet is a lot of fun, and it helps you build good intuition on the underlying "physics" of how a business makes money.

Some thoughts from my experience:<p>- Everyone asks to translate simpler spreadsheets and Excel charts/graphs into dashboards in your BI tool of choice. As soon as it's there, they'll ask you why they can't export to manage the data themselves. This vicious cycle can sometimes be stopped but is a slow-motion drag on productivity in lots of orgs.</p><p>- Build in validations, and/or work on ways to check the dashboard. Dashboards sometimes put their builders and consumers on auto-pilot. The dashboard "must be right" but could easily have a bug or inaccuracy for weeks/months/etc. that isn't obvious without some external validation.</p><p>- The dashboard never has the "right" metrics - users will continue asking for changes. Be your best advocate and say no as a way of understanding the importance of the ask</p><p>- Related: always ask why about everything you're building into or modifying in dashboards. Business users often ask for things without an ounce of rationale.</p><p>- Related: taking away is harder than not doing at all!</p><p>Finally, I think most dashboards miss one fundamental point. Imagine you're the CEO/COO and you've got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you're seeing? What's the succinct summary?</p><p>I like building in spots to write 2-3 sentence executive summaries.

The concept I like to explain to the BI teams is that the dashboard is always just a snapshot of “what” is happening. But the underlying base level data is always needed to understand “why” it’s happening. And without the why, there’s no actual intelligence gain.<p>Take a metric like Average Order Value (AOV). It may be ; total sales / order quantity. But as that metric is used it’s often being compared to something like last year, last month, or a plan and anyone interested in that number is really interested in understanding the “why” it has changed from some other point in time/scenario.</p><p>For that, you actually need to bring in line item details behind orders as each order has multiple products/skus and they likely sold at different prices from a year ago or what was expected in a plan. An analysis of this has a name, price-volume-mix analysis or PVM.</p><p>I always seem to have to explain this to BI teams when I join a new company and am seeking data. I’m currently going through it with a BI team, that apparently the BI tool wouldn’t store this information. It’s like it only stores aggregate values so it’s not even possible to get base level data for analysis (without major architectural changes). I don’t know if that’s normal in BI or was an implementation decision at some point but I’ve come across this same thing on a handful of companies and as I said I really have to drive this concept for those teams. When I ask of it I’m usually met with a “why would you need that info / give us a use case”. Which means, the don’t even understand how un-intelligent their BI tool is or why the execs likely aren’t feeling like investing in BI has been worthwhile (eg. Ever build a dashboard that then goes unused? I probably wasn’t perceived as useful for some reason like this).</p><p>This could be more concise put as, understanding your end users needs. Understand the difference of what people ask for is often different than what they need. If they ask for AOV metrics, they’re really saying “I need to understand AOV” and that’s done via PVM analysis.

The visual aspects of dashboards can easily drift over time even if the data is correct. You’re often theming charting libraries for example and the compliance of the theme can drift slightly if you update the library without really checking every detail of the visual appearance/layout every time. Or you may not even notice the “visual drift”…

Imagine you're the CEO/COO and you've got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you're seeing? What's the succinct summary?<p>Having been on both sides of this, I think the challenge is that the CEO/COO's job is to figure out "what should we do about this?," which is the right approach to coming up with that summary (it's not just "here's a text version of the chart"). And the corollary challenge is that, in most cases, non-technical people with domain knowledge are the ones who need to produce the analysis: so any feature incomplete dashboard is going to stymie them and any general framework that requires a technical person to step in for code or configuration is going to slow the process to a crawl.</p><p>It's the rule (not the exception) that (especially if things are going poorly) the next step is asking more questions, which involves investigating something else in more detail. A dashboard, however pretty, is as useless as a doorknob if it doesn't have the needed information.</p><p>I have found that dashboards per say are always great as the high-level KPI trackers, like the things you would consider hanging on a wall in an office (e.g. "revenue growth this month" or "new customers acquired"). You'll always want to know that information, and many people of unrelated departments need to have that information shared to them.</p><p>The other helpful area is a deep-dive domain-specific analytics programs, like for example Google Analytics, where it has a very full featureset for non-technical marketing people to go in and drill down to answer questions. The UI/UX designers of that product have spent years honing and A/B testing which types of graphs to show where, and mapping out how to have people click around to find what they're looking for, to the point it is pretty easy for non-technical people. They even have courses and certifications on how to use the system.</p><p>Organizations that try to internally build a feature-complete system like google analytics for a specific domain need to consider it like building an entire software product (even if there's a general low/no-code BI SaaS to assist) because you'll need collaboration between general technical experts and non-technical stakeholders with changing and vague requirements. It can be done, but likely only with years of investment and UI/UX research, just like any other software product that solves a domain problem well. In practice: millions of dollars.</p><p>Technologists often forget that Excel *is* a turing complete programming language (and it's a functional programming paradigm too!). If an org is not committed to spend years and millions of dollars on deep dive analytics for a specific domain, the right choice is almost always using a commercial analytics system for that domain that costs less than the internal build, or embracing the trusty spreadsheet.

The solution is to write well commented SQL which laymen can audit and improve.

It’s often less clear what those insights will be or what is needed to produce them, we somehow hope they will materialize by just displaying some data. Often the focus is on making pretty-looking charts (which only ever look good when you demo with picturesque fake data), because you want the product to feel colorful, welcoming and visual.</p><p>A better approach is to either make a focused tool for solving a specific problem you know users have - you won’t think of what you end up with as a “dashboard” but it might occasionally end up looking a little like one - or to make general tools that allow users to dig through data interactively to find the things they care about.

What are the licenses involved? Power BI is proprietary to microsoft and will have per user economics. Grafana is AGPL, be very careful with anything AGPL in your tech stack because it may force you to open source your code. Apache Superset is pretty cool. I've seen big startup valuations with off-the-shelf BI tools. If its an MVP, definitely consider using this as opposed to rolling your own.</p><p>- Making assumptions for your users is bad because users will always ask for more. So building a flexible framework where users can add/remove visuals and build their own analytics may be necessary. The flipside is this adds complexity and can confuse the user. Its a delicate balance to cater to all types of users: the basic user vs the power user.</p><p>- How do users send you feedback? Bad data point? How do you find out?

I was a specialized systems dev, only occasionally doing a bit of webdev if necessary and really didn't have time for those kind of errands.<p>I showed him this tutorial I had recently seen. Just a few minutes and the thumbnail,  about how to build a "dashboard" in excel.
<a href="https://youtu.be/z26zbiGJnd4?si=HWn8qTbozD8vmXiF" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://youtu.be/z26zbiGJnd4?si=HWn8qTbozD8vmXiF</a></p><p>"Oh wow, I didn't know excel could look so beautiful!". 
He asked for the link, never did anything with it of course but was totally satisfied. I am pretty sure he just wanted a shiny toy and also felt inadequate about "just using excel" to do his important founder work.  Showing him that excel can look beautiful and is a powerful tool was enough. No more feeling inadequate, no need for an actual (or even excel) dashboard.

This pre-empts a lot of questions about the report, but more importantly builds trust in what the data is showing (vs having a user self-serve, nervous that they’re making a decision with bad data - ultimately they’ll reach out to an analyst to get them to do the analysis for them).</p><p>The second most important factor was loading speed - we noticed that after around 8 seconds of waiting, business users would disengage with a report, or lose trust in the system presenting the information (“I think it’s broken”). Most often this resulted in people not logging in to look at reports - they were busy with tons of other things, so once they expected reports to take a while to load, they stopped coming back.</p><p>The third big finding was giving people data where they already are, in a format they understand. A complicated filter interface would drive our users nuts and turned into many hours of training and technical support. For this reason, we always wanted a simple UI with great mobile support for reports - our users were on the go and could already do most other things on their phones.</p><p>We couldn’t achieve these things in BI tools, so for important decisions, we had to move the work to tools that could offer text support, instant report loading, and a familiar and accessible format: PowerPoint, PDF, and email. Of course this is a difficult workflow to automate and maintain, but for us it was crucial to get engagement on the work we were producing, and it worked.</p><p>This experience inspired my colleague and I to start an open source BI tool which could achieve these things with a more maintainable, version controlled workflow. The tool is called Evidence (<a href="https://evidence.dev/">https://evidence.dev</a>) if anyone is interested.

It can be tough to figure out what the end user needs in the first place, let alone the details of how to define individual metrics or slice the data. This is a huge pain point for both externally and internally facing deliverables, but it's especially tough for external clients because you're likely a lot more limited in your ability to communicate ad-hoc to clarify things down the line. And once you've delivered something that's either irrelevant or inaccurate, then it can end up being game over for the engagement (if you're working externally) or your counterpart's trust in your output (if you're working internally).<p>So it's super important to get on the same page RE: goals and expectations and keep that alignment going to the end - so that there aren't any unpleasant surprises at the delivery stage.

In python, Altair is the only client-side rendering that is also interactive that I'm aware of. It's important for payload considerations</p><p>4. Related to 3 - consider payload considerations.

So large amounts of work go into building dashboards that are used for a very short amount of time and then discarded. Probably we should do a better job on one-off analyses and only dashboard after the fact.</p><p>Many users don't actually want a dashboard, what they actually want is a live data dump into excel where they can pivot table it. Maybe, <i>maybe</i> a bar or line chart.</p><p>In general, I find people always ask for more filters, more slicers, just endless options to reconfigure the data as they please. But they quickly become trapped in a swamp of their own making, now nobody knows how this should be sorted or sliced, does it even make sense to do it this way? People think what they want is a 'data democracy' with hundreds of dashboards with hundreds of options with hundreds of users and so they ask for and usually receive it. But they usually just end up coming back to the data team and asking - 'so what's the answer?' What many orgs need is actually a data dictator.</p><p>On the other hand, dashboards do allow you to establish really good feedback loops within the business so when you can identify an ongoing constraint, figure out how to track it and then force people to receive it on a regular cadence and be accountable to it, you can make a lot of headway. But that's a more niche use-case than how they're frequently used and the skills involved are different - less visualization skills, more business analysis - and you need to be positioned to make sure someone is held accountable.

At risk of repeating others, here's what I've learned working on business intelligence tools for an engineering group:<p>- What users ask for and what users really want are often extremely different.</p><p>- Engineering executives like to place their "thumbprint" on every business analytics dashboard. They want evidence that the "intelligence" being reported has been customized by them. It's their way of imparting branding on the organization.</p><p>- UI/UX is far more important to users than how you handle the technical details. When discussing implementation with them, start with the UI so that they have a mental model to build from.</p><p>- Leave space to create cool things that you/your team want to make. The developers of BI dashboards often have excellent ideas for visualizing data that an end-user would not immediately think of. Leave room to "delight".</p><p>- Never assume the data is clean or accurate (even when there are regulatory reasons for it to be either of those things)</p><p>- Not everyone's opinion is equally valuable.</p><p>- Beware of corporate politics. I once had an analytics project completely shut down because it would expose certain weaknesses in the business that were not acceptable to discuss publicly.</p><p>Bonus: Read "Envisioning Information" by Edward Tufte.

# 🤔 Why YAML is the right devops technology for you 🤔
#
# - 100% test coverage, always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings, always shippable
# - no enforced error handling during development because runtime "panic at the disco" in production is dope
# - "something broke" is way better than stack traces with line numbers
# - you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline
# - safe choice with unquestionable industry adoption, "used by kubernetes"
# - is marginally better than windows.ini
# - unlike json [1], YAML supports comments
# - no official documentation (other than a specification for implementers) is totally fine
# - you need a super safe way to "execute this code"

# 🍿 wait a sec, did you say "executable yaml"?? 🍿

# YAML is the super best way to encode Octal (tm) and learning the hard way that Kubernetes uses YAML 1.1
# is a DevOps rite of passage. Below YAML 1.2 a large integer is automatically converted to octal.
- YAML 1.1 uses `0666` notation.
- YAML 1.2 uses `0o666` notation

- I need to burn the very motherboard this site runs from. It’s that awful.
- This is the worst website I've ever seen
- I agree with the author in principle but that website is inexcusable. I'm going to add YAML config to my projects on Monday just to spite that horrific "website".
- Wtf is this website and why does it repeatedly pop up my phone's keyboard
	- This Website is a giant editable textfield
		- Why?!?
			- Because it’s a good idea to demonstrate good standards while standing on one’s soapbox
				- The author of THAT website wants to tell the rest of us how to program.
- While I agree with the spirit of the website (fuck yaml), the design decisions of the author are questionable to say the least.
- The good news (I realised) was that you can select all the text of the site, and then delete it. Problem solved.
- Fuck this website. Maybe if this person stopped bitching about yaml their website wouldn't blow.
- Yeah, I’m not going to take advice on best practices from a guy whose website is a giant editable text field with unclickable hyperlinks.

# ps. By design, this website is as usable as YAML. 💕

The percentage of medium-sized CMs (100–300 μm<sup>2</sup>) decreased, whereas the number of larger CMs (&gt;300 μm<sup>2</sup>) increased significantly, reflecting the overall increase of CM surface area (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig1">1h</a>). The relatively modest increase of CM surface area, in contrast to the massive increase in CM numbers in <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> hearts, suggests that the increased heart size is mainly caused by hyperplastic growth.

Notably, the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup>, pH3<sup>+</sup> and aurora B<sup>+</sup> CMs and the total number of CMs per heart were markedly elevated 4 weeks after TAM injection (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig1">1k–n</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig7">2p–r</a>). We also detected a further increase in the absolute number of CMs per heart and in HW at 8 weeks compared to 4 weeks after TAM administration, indicating that induction of CM proliferation by inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> is a lasting and continuous process (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig1">1o</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig7">2j</a>).</p><p>We next carried out RNA-seq analysis of CMs isolated from control, <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup> mice and identified 1,513 and 1,432 differentially expressed genes (<i>P</i> value &lt; 0.05) in <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup> hearts, respectively.

In both mutant mouse lines, we also detected strong upregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression and reduced expression levels of genes involved in maturation and contraction, concomitant with upregulation of dedifferentiation markers (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3a–c</a>).

This notion was further confirmed by electron microscopy analysis and quantification of sarcomere density through immunofluorescence staining, uncovering reduced density of sarcomeres and irregular positioning of mitochondria, respectively (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3d,e</a>).

In addition, analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with reverse transcription demonstrated reduced expression levels of mature CM-specific genes involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, glucose transport (<i>Slc2a4</i>) and lactate production (<i>Ldha</i>), but increased expression levels of dedifferentiation markers (<i>Nppa</i> and <i>Acta1</i>; Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3f</a>). Integrative analysis of RNA-seq datasets from <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup> CMs disclosed 172 and 299 genes that were jointly upregulated or downregulated in both mutant strains (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig8">3g</a>).

Furthermore, targeted metabolome analysis revealed that levels of acyl-carnitines derived from medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids are strongly reduced in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, whereas intracellular levels of free carnitine were markedly elevated (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3b</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6b,c</a>). Unexpectedly, intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA and most metabolites of the Krebs cycle, such as citrate, succinate and malate, were not significantly altered, suggesting that CMs use different forms of energy production in the absence of FAO (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6d</a>). We assume that increased glucose oxidation compensates to some extent for the loss of FAO in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs to generate acetyl-CoA, as the expression level of PDH1A but not that of its inhibitor PDK4 increases. Likewise, the expression levels of ACSS1 and ACSS2 that generate acetyl-CoA from acetate remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6e</a>).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-3" data-title="Impeded mitochondrial import of fatty acid rewires the metabolism of CMs and boosts αKG levels."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig3" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 3: Impeded mitochondrial import of fatty acid rewires the metabolism of CMs and boosts αKG levels.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5/figures/3" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig3_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig3" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig3_HTML.png" alt="figure 3" loading="lazy" width="685" height="244"></picture></a></div><div data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-3-desc"><p><b>a</b>, Metabolic flux assay of <i>Ctrl</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> hearts perfused with [<sup>13</sup>C]palmitate (<i>n</i> = 5 each). <b>b</b>, Volcano plot showing different metabolites in <i>Ctrl</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> hearts (<i>n</i> = 8 each).

We detected a major enrichment of metabolites involved in amino acid turnover, including ammonia recycling and urea cycle (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6f</a>). The levels of several amino acids whose intermediates (for example, acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA and fumarate) replenish the Krebs cycle were increased as well (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6g,h</a>). Likewise, we found a marked elevation of the levels of metabolites from branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient hearts, including α-ketoisovalerate and α-keto-β-methylvalerate. The levels of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA, which serve as precursors for succinyl-CoA, were also increased (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3d,e</a>). Thus, we reason that enhanced glucose oxidation and BCAA catabolism in <i>Cpt1b-</i>deficient CMs efficiently compensate for impaired metabolic flux of fatty acid-derived acetyl-CoA into the Krebs cycle in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs. This conclusion is also supported by the increased metabolic flux rate of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled glucose and isoleucine to metabolites of the Krebs cycle or BCAA catabolism, respectively. Additional evidence comes from Seahorse analysis of <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, indicating more efficient utilization of pyruvate, BCAAs and glucose compared to control CMs (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3f,g</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6i,j</a>).</p><p>Notably, we detected a marked, nearly 20-fold, increase of αKG in CMs after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a>). A direct conversion of glutamine and glutamate to αKG seems unlikely to account for the accumulation of αKG, as neither the concentration of glutamine nor that of glutamate declined (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a>). Instead, we observed significantly reduced isocitrate levels, along with an increase of the levels of IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3A, which catalyse conversion of isocitrate to αKG (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c,h</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6k</a>). In addition, the enzymatic activity of OGDH, the key component of the αKG dehydrogenase complex converting αKG to succinyl-CoA was reduced in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, despite an increase in protein concentrations of OGDH complex components (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3h,i</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6l</a>). The reduction of the enzymatic activity of OGDH is most likely caused by the well-known inhibitory effects of intermediate metabolites from BCAA catabolism, the levels of which are increased in the <i>Cpt1b</i> mutants<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Patel, M.

Inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> and αKG accumulation did not alter protein levels of other Krebs cycle enzymes or mitochondrial DNA content (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6m,n</a>), indicating that FAO-independent functions of mitochondria were not compromised. Taken together, the results indicate that elevated synthesis and reduced metabolization synergize to accumulate αKG in CMs after abrogation of FAO.</p><p>We did not observe significant differences in the concentrations of diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols and very long-chain acyl-CoA in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient compared to control CMs (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig12">7a–d</a>).

To further substantiate the causality between αKG accumulation and CM reprogramming, we inactivated <i>Ogdh</i> in adult CMs using <i>αMHC-MerCreMer</i><sup><i>pos/+</i></sup><i>Ogdh</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> (<i>Ogdh</i><sup><i>iKO</i></sup>)&nbsp;mice and <i>αMHC-MerCreMer</i><sup><i>pos/+</i></sup><i>Ogdh</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> as controls, which—as expected—results in substantial accumulation of αKG (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3j</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig12">7f–h</a>). Notably, CM-specific inactivation of <i>Ogdh</i> essentially recapitulated the phenotype observed in <i>Cpt1b</i>-knockout animals, including the massive increase in CM numbers, increased proliferation of CMs and reactivation of genes characteristic of immature CMs (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3k–o</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig12">7i–m</a>). However, in contrast to <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient mice, <i>Ogdh</i> mutants die between 5 and 8 weeks after gene inactivation, which makes them unsuitable for cardiac regeneration studies.</p></div></div><div id="Sec6-section" data-title="Reduced H3K4me3 in CM identity genes"><h2 id="Sec6">Reduced H3K4me3 in CM identity genes</h2><div id="Sec6-content"><p>αKG is an essential cofactor for histone demethylases. Therefore, we wondered whether accumulation of αKG in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs affects histone methylation. Analysis of different histone lysine methylation&nbsp;modifications using cardiac nuclei sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed only a reduction in the level of H3K4me3, whereas the levels of 11 other histone lysine methylation&nbsp;modifications were not reduced. By contrast, the levels of heterochromatin markers such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me2 were markedly increased after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i>, probably owing to secondary effects associated with the shift of CMs to a more immature state (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4a</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8a</a>). Consistently, H3K4me3 levels are decreased in <i>Ogdh</i>-deficient CMs, which also exhibited increased αKG levels (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8b</a>). Expression levels of enzymes determining H3K4me3 levels, including methyltransferases (that is, <i>Kmt2</i> family, <i>Ash1l</i>, <i>Prdm9</i> and <i>Smyd</i> family) and αKG-dependent H3K4me3 demethylases (that is, <i>Kdm5a-d</i>, <i>Kdm2b</i> and <i>Riox1</i>), did not change after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i>. Neither did we detect a change in the intracellular levels of <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine, the methyl-group donor for histone methylation. Therefore, we conclude that αKG boosts the activity of a H3K4me3-specific demethylase, eventually leading to reduction of H3K4me3 levels (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8c,d</a>).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Increased αKG levels induce H3K4me3 demethylation and decrease expression of CM maturity genes."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 4: Increased αKG levels induce H3K4me3 demethylation and decrease expression of CM maturity genes.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig4" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig4_HTML.png" alt="figure 4" loading="lazy" width="685" height="594"></picture></a></div><div data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-4-desc"><p><b>a</b>, Western blot analysis of histone methylation&nbsp;modifications using FACS-isolated CM nuclei from <i>Ctrl</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> mice (<i>n</i> = 3 mice&nbsp;each).

Reduction of H3K4me3 deposition in genes with both reduced expression and reduced H3K4me3 peaks was found to be more pronounced inside gene bodies compared to transcription start site regions (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8h</a>).

We validated these findings by ChIP–qPCR, demonstrating that H3K4me3 enrichment was broadly diminished in both promoters and gene bodies of genes associated with CM maturation, whereas H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels at promoters remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8i–k</a>). Taking these findings together, we conclude that accumulation of αKG activates a H3K4me3-specific demethylase, which subsequently erases H3K4me3 within genes required for cardiac differentiation and maturation, thereby converting <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs into a more immature, proliferation-competent state.</p></div></div><div id="Sec7-section" data-title="Activated KDM5 stimulates proliferation"><h2 id="Sec7">Activated KDM5 stimulates proliferation</h2><div id="Sec7-content"><p>To confirm that accumulation of αKG is a critical signal to prevent CM maturation and enable proliferation, we treated P0–1 neonatal CMs for 4 days with cell-permeable αKG.

This hypothesis was confirmed by overexpression of <i>Kdm5b</i>, which strongly reduced H3K4me3 levels and markedly increased CM cell cycle activity when combined with αKG treatment (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig5">5g,h</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig15">10a–d</a>). <i>Kdm5b</i> plays important roles during heart development, and its expression progressively declines during CM maturation<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Zaidi, S. et al.

To validate potential targets of KDM5B, we carried out ChIP–qPCR experiments. We found that KDM5B preferentially binds to genes with broad H3K4me3 domains involved in maintaining the mature phenotype of CMs, such as <i>Tnni3</i>, <i>Mylk3</i> and <i>Myocd</i>. By contrast, no enrichment of KDM5B was found on housekeeping genes characterized by narrow peaks, such as <i>Dus1l</i>, <i>Snx19</i> and <i>Lsm6</i>. Notably, mRNA levels of these housekeeping genes were not altered in response to αKG, <i>Kdm5b</i> knockdown or combined treatment (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig5">5j</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig15">10h</a>).

In line with these reports, we identified 151 genes in <i>Cpt1b</i>-mutant CMs with reduced H3K4me3 peaks and diminished gene transcription. Of note, 92% of these genes contain broad or medium peaks and are mainly associated with cardiac development and contraction. We reason that cell-type-specific genes with broad H3K4me3 peaks are preferentially targeted by an αKG-dependent H3K4me3 demethylase. On the basis of inhibitor and overexpression studies, we reason that a member of the KDM5 family, most likely KDM5B, is the responsible H3K4me3 demethylase<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Zaidi, S. et al.

Future studies will unveil how precisely the αKG-dependent stimulation of a H3K4me3 demethylase achieves target selectivity and preferentially deactivates genes associated with cardiac development and contraction. We assume that genes containing broad H3K4me3 peaks provide more docking sites for KDM5 and therefore represent privileged targets. Genes with enhanced recruitment of KDM5 will automatically be more responsive to an increase of αKG and KDM5-mediated silencing. However, it is also possible that maturation-associated genes with broad H3K4me3 peaks possess other distinct features promoting enhanced recruitment of KDM5 (ref. <sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Brier, A.

All mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background, and littermates were used as controls in all experiments. Animals were assigned to different groups according to genotypes. The genotype of animals, from which individual samples were taken, was not known to the investigator, and experiments were performed in a blinded manner. After data collection, individual genotypes were revealed and the animals were assigned to separate groups for further data analysis. Observed results did not differ between male mice and female mice. No sex-specific experiments were performed. Sample sizes were determined on the basis of established practice and applicable standards. We opted for sample sizes that are commonly used sample sizes in the field.

In brief, dissected hearts were cannulated through the aorta and retrogradely perfused with calcium-free buffer. Cannulated hearts were enzymatically digested by perfusion with enzyme buffer solution and cut off from the cannula. Atria were separated, and ventricles were minced in enzyme buffer. After gentle pipetting, myocytes were centrifuged at 500 r.p.m. for 1 min and cell pellets containing CM fractions were resuspended in stop buffer. The calcium content of the cell suspension was then stepwise adjusted to 1 mM and CM-containing cell pellets were resuspended in M199 cell culture medium, supplemented with creatinine, <span>l</span>-carnitine, HEPES, penicillin–streptavidin, 5% FCS and insulin–transferrin–sodium selenite medium supplement. Cells were seeded in dishes precoated with laminin and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To determine CM numbers in adult hearts, the dissected heart was washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 1% PFA overnight.

In each perfusion assay, only one metabolite was replaced by a <sup>13</sup>C-labelled metabolite ([<sup>13</sup>C]glucose, [<sup>13</sup>C]isoleucine or [<sup>13</sup>C]palmitate–BSA). Subsequently, hearts were snap frozen, pulverized in liquid nitrogen and subjected to metabolite extraction (acyl-CoAs or metabolites of the Krebs cycle) and quantification using liquid chromatography with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Metabolic flux assays and α-ketoacids measurements were carried out using tissue from isolated hearts after perfusion with different substrates as indicated. Measurements of Krebs cycle metabolites and standardized targeted metabolic analysis were carried out with isolated adult CMs. A detailed description of the quantification of acyl-CoAs, Krebs cycle metabolites, α-ketoacids and targeted metabolome analysis is provided in the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#MOESM1">Supplementary Information</a>.</p><h3 id="Sec24">Lentiviral transduction of CMs</h3><p>HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma), 2 mM <span>l</span>-glutamine, 100 U penicillin and 100 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. HEK293T cells (2 × 10<sup>6</sup> per 10-cm dish) were transfected with 5 µg pLJM1-Kdm5b, pLJM1-Idh3b or pLJM1-Idh3g, 4.5 µg psPAX2 (Addgene, no. 12260) and 0.5 µg pMD2.G (Addgene, no. 12259) using the Turbofect transfection reagent and Opti-MEM for 6–8 h. The supernatants containing lentiviral particles were collected at 48 and 72 h after transfection and pooled. Lentiviruses were filtered through a 0.45 µM cell strainer to remove HEK293T cells and concentrated with a Lenti-X concentrator according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TaKaRa, 631231). Primary neonatal CMs were infected in suspension with Polybrene (8 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) for 6 to 8 h.</p><h3 id="Sec25">Analysis of gene expression using qPCR with reverse transcription and assessment of mitochondrial DNA copy numbers</h3><p>Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) following standard procedures. Real-time PCR was carried out with two technical replicates using the StepOne real-time PCR system and KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (KAPA Biosystems). Relative quantification of gene expression was carried out using the ∆∆CT method. The Ct values of the target genes were normalized to expression of the <i>36b4</i> gene using the equation ΔCt = Ct<sub>reference</sub> − Ct<sub>target</sub> and expressed as ΔCt. Relative mRNA expression values were shown with the average from control samples set as 1. Mitochondrial DNA copy numbers were determined using DNA extracted from isolated adult CMs. The data were normalized to internal controls (<i>H19</i> or <i>Mx1</i>) and cell numbers.

Samples were stained en bloc with 50%-saturated watery uranyl acetate, followed by sequential ethanol dehydration (30%, 50%, 75%, 95%), and embedded in Agar 100. Ultrathin sections were cut using an ultramicrotome and image acquisition was carried out with a Philips CM10 electron microscope. All images were captured with a slow-scan 2k CCD (charge-coupled device) camera.</p><h3 id="Sec27">Statistical analysis</h3><p>For all quantitative analyses, a minimum of three biological replicates were analysed. Statistical tests were selected on the basis of the assumption that sample data are from a population following a probability distribution based on a fixed set of parameters. Student’s <i>t</i>-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of differences between two groups. One-way AVOVA was used for multiple comparison tests. The following values were considered to be statistically significant: *<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, **<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01, ***<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, ****<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001.

In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge.</span></p></section></header><section data-event-module="article body"><p icap="on">This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership. Now, for many, this appears to be approaching an end. What are the scientists to do next?</p><p>For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there can be little indecision, for their war has hardly required them to leave the old paths. Many indeed have been able to carry on their war research in their familiar peacetime laboratories. Their objectives remain much the same.</p><p>It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride, who have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated assignments. They have done their part on the devices that made it possible to turn back the enemy, have worked in combined effort with the physicists of our allies. They have felt within themselves the stir of achievement. They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.</p><p><h3>1</h3></p><p>Of what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought into existence? First, they have increased his control of his material environment. They have improved his food, his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his security and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence. They have given him increased knowledge of his own biological processes so that he has had a progressive freedom from disease and an increased span of life. They are illuminating the interactions of his physiological and psychological functions, giving the promise of an improved mental health.</p><p>Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.</p><p>There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.</p><p>Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose. If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works and in reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these amounts of time might well be startling. Those who conscientiously attempt to keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call. Mendel's concept of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/genes-are-overrated/480729/">laws of genetics</a> was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.</p><p>The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.</p><p>But there are signs of a change as new and powerful instrumentalities come into use. Photocells capable of seeing things in a physical sense, advanced photography which can record what is seen or even what is not, thermionic tubes capable of controlling potent forces under the guidance of less power than a mosquito uses to vibrate his wings, cathode ray tubes rendering visible an occurrence so brief that by comparison a microsecond is a long time, relay combinations which will carry out involved sequences of movements more reliably than any human operator and thousands of times as fast—there are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records.</p><p>Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper. Moreover, it would have been subject to frequent breakdown, so that it could not have been depended upon; for at that time and long after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.</p><p>Babbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. Had a Pharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, and that car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza.</p><p>Machines with interchangeable parts can now be constructed with great economy of effort. In spite of much complexity, they perform reliably. Witness the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/the-hidden-world-of-the-typewriter/279523/">humble typewriter</a>, or the movie camera, or the automobile. Electrical contacts have ceased to stick when thoroughly understood. Note the automatic telephone exchange, which has hundreds of thousands of such contacts, and yet is reliable. A spider web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant glow, in short, the thermionic tube of radio sets, is made by the hundred million, tossed about in packages, plugged into sockets—and it works! Its gossamer parts, the precise location and alignment involved in its construction, would have occupied a master craftsman of the guild for months; now it is built for thirty cents. The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it.</p><p><h3>2</h3></p><p>A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. Today we make the record conventionally by writing and photography, followed by printing; but we also record on film, on wax disks, and on magnetic wires. Even if utterly new recording procedures do not appear, these present ones are certainly in the process of modification and extension.</p><p>Certainly progress in photography is not going to stop. Faster material and lenses, more automatic cameras, finer-grained sensitive compounds to allow an extension of the minicamera idea, are all imminent. Let us project this trend ahead to a logical, if not inevitable, outcome. The camera hound of the future wears on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut. It takes pictures 3 millimeters square, later to be projected or enlarged, which after all involves only a factor of 10 beyond present practice. The lens is of universal focus, down to any distance accommodated by the unaided eye, simply because it is of short focal length. There is a built-in photocell on the walnut such as we now have on at least one camera, which automatically adjusts exposure for a wide range of illumination. There is film in the walnut for a hundred exposures, and the spring for operating its shutter and shifting its film is wound once for all when the film clip is inserted. It produces its result in full color. It may well be stereoscopic, and record with two spaced glass eyes, for striking improvements in stereoscopic technique are just around the corner.</p><p>The cord which trips its shutter may reach down a man's sleeve within easy reach of his fingers. A quick squeeze, and the picture is taken. On a pair of ordinary glasses is a square of fine lines near the top of one lens, where it is out of the way of ordinary vision. When an object appears in that square, it is lined up for its picture. As the scientist of the future moves about the laboratory or the field, every time he looks at something worthy of the record, he trips the shutter and in it goes, without even an audible click. Is this all fantastic? The only fantastic thing about it is the idea of making as many pictures as would result from its use.</p><p>Will there be dry photography? It is already here in two forms. When Brady made his Civil War pictures, the plate had to be wet at the time of exposure. Now it has to be wet during development instead. In the future perhaps it need not be wetted at all. There have long been films impregnated with diazo dyes which form a picture without development, so that it is already there as soon as the camera has been operated. An exposure to ammonia gas destroys the unexposed dye, and the picture can then be taken out into the light and examined. The process is now slow, but someone may speed it up, and it has no grain difficulties such as now keep photographic researchers busy. Often it would be advantageous to be able to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately.</p><p>Another process now in use is also slow, and more or less clumsy. For fifty years impregnated papers have been used which turn dark at every point where an electrical contact touches them, by reason of the chemical change thus produced in an iodine compound included in the paper. They have been used to make records, for a pointer moving across them can leave a trail behind. If the electrical potential on the pointer is varied as it moves, the line becomes light or dark in accordance with the potential.</p><p>This scheme is now used in facsimile transmission. The pointer draws a set of closely spaced lines across the paper one after another. As it moves, its potential is varied in accordance with a varying current received over wires from a distant station, where these variations are produced by a photocell which is similarly scanning a picture. At every instant the darkness of the line being drawn is made equal to the darkness of the point on the picture being observed by the photocell. Thus, when the whole picture has been covered, a replica appears at the receiving end.</p><p>A scene itself can be just as well looked over line by line by the photocell in this way as can a photograph of the scene. This whole apparatus constitutes a camera, with the added feature, which can be dispensed with if desired, of making its picture at a distance. It is slow, and the picture is poor in detail. Still, it does give another process of dry photography, in which the picture is finished as soon as it is taken.</p><p>It would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail. Television equipment today transmits sixteen reasonably good pictures a second, and it involves only two essential differences from the process described above. For one, the record is made by a moving beam of electrons rather than a moving pointer, for the reason that an electron beam can sweep across the picture very rapidly indeed. The other difference involves merely the use of a screen which glows momentarily when the electrons hit, rather than a chemically treated paper or film which is permanently altered. This speed is necessary in television, for motion pictures rather than stills are the object.</p><p>Use chemically treated film in place of the glowing screen, allow the apparatus to transmit one picture only rather than a succession, and a rapid camera for dry photography results. The treated film needs to be far faster in action than present examples, but it probably could be. More serious is the objection that this scheme would involve putting the film inside a vacuum chamber, for electron beams behave normally only in such a rarefied environment. This difficulty could be avoided by allowing the electron beam to play on one side of a partition, and by pressing the film against the other side, if this partition were such as to allow the electrons to go through perpendicular to its surface, and to prevent them from spreading out sideways. Such partitions, in crude form, could certainly be constructed, and they will hardly hold up the general development.</p><p>Like dry photography, microphotography still has a long way to go. The basic scheme of reducing the size of the record, and examining it by projection rather than directly, has possibilities too great to be ignored. The combination of optical projection and photographic reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive. Today, with microfilm, reductions by a linear factor of 20 can be employed and still produce full clarity when the material is re-enlarged for examination. The limits are set by the graininess of the film, the excellence of the optical system, and the efficiency of the light sources employed. All of these are rapidly improving.</p><p>Assume a linear ratio of 100 for future use. Consider film of the same thickness as paper, although thinner film will certainly be usable. Even under these conditions there would be a total factor of 10,000 between the bulk of the ordinary record on books, and its microfilm replica. The <i>Encyclop</i><em>æ</em><i>dia Britannica</i> could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk. If the human race has produced since the invention of movable type a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books, tracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume corresponding to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and compressed, could be lugged off in a moving van. Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.</p><p>Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilm <i>Britannica</i> would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent. What would it cost to print a million copies? To print a sheet of newspaper, in a large edition, costs a small fraction of a cent. The entire material of the <i>Britannica</i> in reduced microfilm form would go on a sheet eight and one-half by eleven inches. Once it is available, with the photographic reproduction methods of the future, duplicates in large quantities could probably be turned out for a cent apiece beyond the cost of materials. The preparation of the original copy? That introduces the next aspect of the subject.</p><p><h3>3</h3></p><p>To make the record, we now push a pencil or tap a typewriter. Then comes the process of digestion and correction, followed by an intricate process of typesetting, printing, and distribution. To consider the first stage of the procedure, will the author of the future cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record? He does so indirectly, by talking to a stenographer or a wax cylinder; but the elements are all present if he wishes to have his talk directly produce a typed record. All he needs to do is to take advantage of existing mechanisms and to alter his language.</p><p>At a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown. A girl stroked its keys and it emitted recognizable speech. No human vocal chords entered into the procedure at any point; the keys simply combined some electrically produced vibrations and passed these on to a loud-speaker. In the Bell Laboratories there is the converse of this machine, called a Vocoder. The loudspeaker is replaced by a microphone, which picks up sound. Speak to it, and the corresponding keys move. This may be one element of the postulated system.</p><p>The other element is found in the stenotype, that somewhat disconcerting device encountered usually at public meetings. A girl strokes its keys languidly and looks about the room and sometimes at the speaker with a disquieting gaze. From it emerges a typed strip which records in a phonetically simplified language a record of what the speaker is supposed to have said. Later this strip is retyped into ordinary language, for in its nascent form it is intelligible only to the initiated. Combine these two elements, let the Vocoder run the stenotype, and the result is a machine which types when talked to.</p><p>Our present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of mechanization, it is true. It is strange that the inventors of universal languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one which better fitted the technique for transmitting and recording speech. Mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the scientific field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less intelligible to the layman.</p><p>One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments. Time is automatically recorded to tie the two records together. If he goes into the field, he may be connected by radio to his recorder. As he ponders over his notes in the evening, he again talks his comments into the record. His typed record, as well as his photographs, may both be in miniature, so that he projects them for examination.</p><p>Much needs to occur, however, between the collection of data and observations, the extraction of parallel material from the existing record, and the final insertion of new material into the general body of the common record. For mature thought there is no mechanical substitute. But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very different things. For the latter there are, and may be, powerful mechanical aids.</p><p>Adding a column of figures is a repetitive thought process, and it was long ago properly relegated to the machine. True, the machine is sometimes controlled by a keyboard, and thought of a sort enters in reading the figures and poking the corresponding keys, but even this is avoidable. Machines have been made which will read typed figures by photocells and then depress the corresponding keys; these are combinations of photocells for scanning the type, electric circuits for sorting the consequent variations, and relay circuits for interpreting the result into the action of solenoids to pull the keys down.</p><p>All this complication is needed because of the clumsy way in which we have learned to write figures. If we recorded them positionally, simply by the configuration of a set of dots on a card, the automatic reading mechanism would become comparatively simple. In fact if the dots are holes, we have the punched-card machine long ago produced by Hollorith for the purposes of the census, and now used throughout business. Some types of complex businesses could hardly operate without these machines.</p><p>Adding is only one operation. To perform arithmetical computation involves also subtraction, multiplication, and division, and in addition some method for temporary storage of results, removal from storage for further manipulation, and recording of final results by printing. Machines for these purposes are now of two types: keyboard machines for accounting and the like, manually controlled for the insertion of data, and usually automatically controlled as far as the sequence of operations is concerned; and punched-card machines in which separate operations are usually delegated to a series of machines, and the cards then transferred bodily from one to another. Both forms are very useful; but as far as complex computations are concerned, both are still in embryo.</p><p>Rapid electrical counting appeared soon after the physicists found it desirable to count cosmic rays. For their own purposes the physicists promptly constructed thermionic-tube equipment capable of counting electrical impulses at the rate of 100,000 a second. The advanced arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and they will perform at 100 times present speeds, or more.</p><p>Moreover, they will be far more versatile than present commercial machines, so that they may readily be adapted for a wide variety of operations. They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results in such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later further manipulation. Such machines will have enormous appetites. One of them will take instructions and data from a whole roomful of girls armed with simple key board punches, and will deliver sheets of computed results every few minutes. There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things.</p><p><h3>4</h3></p><p>The repetitive processes of thought are not confined however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine. Not so much has been done along these lines, beyond the bounds of arithmetic, as might be done, primarily because of the economics of the situation. The needs of business and the extensive market obviously waiting, assured the advent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just as soon as production methods were sufficiently advanced.</p><p>With machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for there was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of manipulating data are a very small part of the population. There are, however, machines for solving differential equations—and functional and integral equations, for that matter. There are many special machines, such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides. There will be many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the scientist and in small numbers.</p><p>If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of arithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical world. One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability. The abacus, with its beads strung on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration and the concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world; and it was a useful tool—so useful that it still exists.</p><p>It is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting machine. It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the future. But even this new machine will not take the scientist where he needs to go. Relief must be secured from laborious detailed manipulation of higher mathematics as well, if the users of it are to free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules. A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot. He is not even a man who can readily perform the transformations of equations by the use of calculus. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs.</p><p>All else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism, just as confidently as he turns over the propelling of his car to the intricate mechanism under the hood. Only then will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistics to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology. For this reason there still come more machines to handle advanced mathematics for the scientist. Some of them will be sufficiently bizarre to suit the most fastidious connoisseur of the present artifacts of civilization.</p><p><h3>5</h3></p><p>The scientist, however, is not the only person who manipulates data and examines the world about him by the use of logical processes, although he sometimes preserves this appearance by adopting into the fold anyone who becomes logical, much in the manner in which a British labor leader is elevated to knighthood. Whenever logical processes of thought are employed—that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted groove—there is an opportunity for the machine. Formal logic used to be a keen instrument in the hands of the teacher in his trying of students' souls. It is readily possible to construct a machine which will manipulate premises in accordance with formal logic, simply by the clever use of relay circuits. Put a set of premises into such a device and turn the crank, and it will readily pass out conclusion after conclusion, all in accordance with logical law, and with no more slips than would be expected of a keyboard adding machine.</p><p>Logic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well to produce more assurance in its use. The machines for higher analysis have usually been equation solvers. Ideas are beginning to appear for equation transformers, which will rearrange the relationship expressed by an equation in accordance with strict and rather advanced logic. Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They employ a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field.</p><p>A new symbolism, probably positional, must apparently precede the reduction of mathematical transformations to machine processes. Then, on beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of logic in everyday affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register. But the machine of logic will not look like a cash register, even of the streamlined model.</p><p>So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before—for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.</p><p>Selection, in this broad sense, is a stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker. Yet, in a narrow sense and in other areas, something has already been done mechanically on selection. The personnel officer of a factory drops a stack of a few thousand employee cards into a selecting machine, sets a code in accordance with an established convention, and produces in a short time a list of all employees who live in Trenton and know Spanish. Even such devices are much too slow when it comes, for example, to matching a set of fingerprints with one of five million on file. Selection devices of this sort will soon be speeded up from their present rate of reviewing data at a few hundred a minute. By the use of photocells and microfilm they will survey items at the rate of a thousand a second, and will print out duplicates of those selected.</p><p>This process, however, is simple selection: it proceeds by examining in turn every one of a large set of items, and by picking out those which have certain specified characteristics. There is another form of selection best illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange. You dial a number and the machine selects and connects just one of a million possible stations. It does not run over them all. It pays attention only to a class given by a first digit, then only to a subclass of this given by the second digit, and so on; and thus proceeds rapidly and almost unerringly to the selected station. It requires a few seconds to make the selection, although the process could be speeded up if increased speed were economically warranted. If necessary, it could be made extremely fast by substituting thermionic-tube switching for mechanical switching, so that the full selection could be made in one one-hundredth of a second. No one would wish to spend the money necessary to make this change in the telephone system, but the general idea is applicable elsewhere.</p><p>Take the prosaic problem of the great department store. Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and, most important, the customer needs to be charged. A central records device has been developed in which much of this work is done conveniently. The salesman places on a stand the customer's identification card, his own card, and the card taken from the article sold—all punched cards. When he pulls a lever, contacts are made through the holes, machinery at a central point makes the necessary computations and entries, and the proper receipt is printed for the salesman to pass to the customer.</p><p>But there may be ten thousand charge customers doing business with the store, and before the full operation can be completed someone has to select the right card and insert it at the central office. Now rapid selection can slide just the proper card into position in an instant or two, and return it afterward. Another difficulty occurs, however. Someone must read a total on the card, so that the machine can add its computed item to it. Conceivably the cards might be of the dry photography type I have described. Existing totals could then be read by photocell, and the new total entered by an electron beam.</p><p>The cards may be in miniature, so that they occupy little space. They must move quickly. They need not be transferred far, but merely into position so that the photocell and recorder can operate on them. Positional dots can enter the data. At the end of the month a machine can readily be made to read these and to print an ordinary bill. With tube selection, in which no mechanical parts are involved in the switches, little time need be occupied in bringing the correct card into use—a second should suffice for the entire operation. The whole record on the card may be made by magnetic dots on a steel sheet if desired, instead of dots to be observed optically, following the scheme by which Poulsen long ago put speech on a magnetic wire. This method has the advantage of simplicity and ease of erasure. By using photography, however one can arrange to project the record in enlarged form and at a distance by using the process common in television equipment.</p><p>One can consider rapid selection of this form, and distant projection for other purposes. To be able to key one sheet of a million before an operator in a second or two, with the possibility of then adding notes thereto, is suggestive in many ways. It might even be of use in libraries, but that is another story. At any rate, there are now some interesting combinations possible. One might, for example, speak to a microphone, in the manner described in connection with the speech controlled typewriter, and thus make his selections. It would certainly beat the usual file clerk.</p><p><h3>6</h3></p><p>The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path.</p><p>The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.</p><p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.</p><p>Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.</p><p>It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.</p><p>In one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care of by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the memex is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.</p><p>Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business correspondence takes the same path. And there is provision for direct entry. On the top of the memex is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sorts of things. When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being employed.</p><p>There is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions. Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects it for his use. Moreover, he has supplemental levers. On deflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at 100 pages at a time. Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.</p><p>A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the index. Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he calls up another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography, and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.</p><p><h3>7</h3></p><p>All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. It affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.</p><p>When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code word. Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.</p><p>Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.</p><p>The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.</p><p>And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outraged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.</p><p><h3>8</h3></p><p>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.</p><p>The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.</p><p>Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race. It might be striking to outline the instrumentalities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to stick closely to methods and elements now known and undergoing rapid development, as has been done here. Technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube. In order that the picture may not be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to present-day patterns, it may be well to mention one such possibility, not to prophesy but merely to suggest, for prophecy based on extension of the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess.</p><p>All our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed through one of the senses—the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak or listen, the visual when we read. Is it not possible that some day the path may be established more directly?</p><p>We know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is transmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the channel of the optic nerve. This is an exact analogy with the electrical vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.</p><p>The impulses which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her fingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys. Might not these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in which information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously metamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?</p><p>By bone conduction we already introduce sounds: into the nerve channels of the deaf in order that they may hear. Is it not possible that we may learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of first transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the human mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form? With a couple of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces pen-and-ink traces which bear some relation to the electrical phenomena going on in the brain itself. True, the record is unintelligible, except as it points out certain gross misfunctioning of the cerebral mechanism; but who would now place bounds on where such a thing may lead?</p><p>In the outside world, all forms of intelligence whether of sound or sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame exactly the same sort of process occurs. Must we always transform to mechanical movements in order to proceed from one electrical phenomenon to another? It is a suggestive thought, but it hardly warrants prediction without losing touch with reality and immediateness.</p><p>Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.</p><p>The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

</p></div><p><span>But it’s not just boxes. As demonstrated by the Twitter (X) hashtag #CatSquares, cats often rush over to claim a square marked off on the floor with pieces of tape. And as many a cat person has noticed, a piece of paper on your desk, table or floor is also a powerful cat attractor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is peculiar. How safe and cozy can a cat feel sitting right out in the open on top of the water bill? Dodman describes it as something like the placebo effect. “This virtual box may provide some misplaced sense of security and psychosomatic comfort,” he writes.</span></p><p><span>Cats like boxes so much that they even fall for fake boxes. A team of researchers from Hunter College, CUNY, found that cats will happily sit in&nbsp;</span><span>illusory</span><span>&nbsp;squares.</span></p><hr><p><span>Read More: </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/yes-cats-really-do-have-facial-expressions"><span>Yes, Cats Really Do Have Facial Expressions</span></a><span></span></p><hr><h2><span>The Challenges of Cat Studies</span></h2><div><p>(Credit: Krakenimages.com/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>But before we get into the details of that study, let’s step aside for a moment and talk about scientific studies on cats. There aren’t as many of them as you’d think based on cats’ social media popularity. The reason? Cats make extremely lousy research subjects. When researchers bring cats into the lab to test their intelligence, the cats tend to wander around, hide or just laze about, completely uninterested in what the researchers are trying to get them to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>David Grimm is the author of&nbsp;</span><span>Citizen Canine: Our Evolving Relationship with Cats and Dogs</span><span>. In an</span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/04/cat-intelligence-and-cognition-are-cats-smarter-than-dogs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;article</span></a><span>&nbsp;for Slate magazine, he wrote that when he was researching the book’s chapter on animal intelligence, he asked Ádám Miklósi, one of the world’s top experts on the subject, about research on cat intelligence. Miklósi’s answer, according to Grimm, was, “We did one study on cats—and that was enough!”</span></p><p><span>So, the Hunter College researchers wisely decided to let the cats stay home. Instead of inviting cats to the lab, they recruited citizen scientists to test their cats at home. (It helped that this was during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, so plenty of people were at home with their cats, apparently getting bored with tossing catnip toys and looking for new ways to pass the time.)</span></p><hr><p><span>Read More: </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/5-cats-who-owned-famous-scientists"><span>5 Cats Who Owned Famous Scientists</span></a><span></span></p><hr><h2><span>If I Fits I Sits</span></h2><div><p>(Credit:Master1305/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>In the charmingly named and very clever</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?via=ihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;study</span></a><span>, “If I Fits I Sits: A Citizen Science Investigation into Illusory Contour Susceptibility in Domestic Cats (Felis silvestris catus),” the researchers tested cats to see if these notorious square sitters would be fooled by an optical illusion known as a Kanisza square.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A</span><a href="https://puzzlewocky.com/optical-illusions/kanizsa-square-and-triangle-illusions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;Kanisza square</span></a><span>&nbsp;is a visual puzzle in which Pac-Man-like circles are arranged so as to create the illusion of a square.

And sure enough, the cats were just as likely to sit in a Kanisza square as a real one.</span></p><div><p>(Credit: SwampTurtle/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>The study, the researchers say, confirmed previous research showing that cats are susceptible to visual illusions, which adds to the growing but still relatively meager body of research on cat cognition.

<p>The <b>prophetic perfect tense</b> is a literary technique used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> that describes future events that are so certain to happen that they are referred to in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_tense" title="Past tense">past tense</a> as if they had already happened.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

The category of "prophetic perfect" was already suggested by medieval Hebrew grammarians,<sup id="cite_ref-rogland_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-rogland-2">[2]</a></sup> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi" title="David Kimhi">David Kimhi</a>: "The matter is as clear as though it had already passed,"<sup id="cite_ref-waltke1_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-waltke1-3">[3]</a></sup> or Isaac ben Yedaiah:</p><blockquote><p>
"[The rabbis] of blessed memory followed, in these words of theirs, in the paths of the prophets who speak of something which will happen in the future in the language of the past. Since they saw in prophetic vision that which was to occur in the future, they spoke about it in the past tense and testified firmly that it had happened, to teach the certainty of his [God's] words -- may he be blessed -- and his positive promise that can never change and his beneficent message that will not be altered." (Isaac ben Yedaiah):<sup id="cite_ref-chazan_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-chazan-4">[4]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Gesenius describes it as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The perfect serves to express actions, events, or states, which the speaker wishes to represent from the point of view of completion, whether they belong to a determinate past time, or extend into the present, <b>or while still future</b>, are pictured as in their completed state." (GKC §106a)<sup id="cite_ref-gesenius_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-gesenius-5">[5]</a></sup> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"[The perfect can be used to] express facts which are undoubtedly imminent, and, therefore, in the imagination of the speaker, already accomplished (perfectum confidentiae), e.g. Nu 17:27... Gn 30:13, 1 S 6:5 ..., Pr 4:2. Even in interrogative sentences, Gn 18:12, Nu 17:28, 23:10, Ju 9:9, 11, Zc 4:10 (?), Pr 22:20.8 This use of the perfect occurs most frequently in prophetic language (perfectum propheticum). The prophet so transports himself in imagination into the future that he describes the future event as if it had been already seen or heard by him, e.g. Is 5:13 ...; 19:7, Jb 5:20, 2 Ch 20:37. Not infrequently the imperfect interchanges with such perfects either in the parallel member or further on in the narrative." (GKC §106n)<sup id="cite_ref-gesenius_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-gesenius-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote><p>
According to Waltke &amp; O'Connor:</p><blockquote><p>
"Referring to absolute future time, a perfective form may be <i>persistent</i> or <i>accidental</i>. A <i>persistent (future) perfective</i> represents a single situation extending from the present into the future.... With an <i>accidental perfective</i> a speaker vividly and dramatically represents a future situation both as complete and as independent…. This use is especially frequent in prophetic address (hence it is also called the “prophetic perfect” or “perfective of confidence”)."<sup id="cite_ref-waltke2_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-waltke2-6">[6]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Klein has attempted to identify all established instances of the prophetic perfect.<sup id="cite_ref-klein_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-klein-7">[7]</a></sup> Notarius, siding with Rogland,<sup id="cite_ref-rogland_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-rogland-2">[2]</a></sup> argues that the "prophetic perfect" is "a metaphorical use of the past tense in the retrospective future-oriented report."<sup id="cite_ref-notarius_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-notarius-8">[8]</a></sup>

<h2>Short explation</h2>
<p>The Windows NT 3.1 kernel is incompatible with enhanced 486 processors. Specifically, it is incompatible with 486 processors providing the <code>CPUID</code> instructions. Kernel debugging works fine with the 486DX-33 that was originally installed in the machine, and with the older non-enhanced core in a write-through Am486DX4-NV8T without SMM.</p>
<p>If your goal is just toying around with NT 3.1 kernel debugging, you might want to use a processor that is compatible with Windows NT 3.1 out-of-the-box. If you are as curious as me, you might want to fix Windows NT. Keep reading in this case.</p>
<h2>The underlying issue</h2>
<p>The incompatibility is due to a bug in <code>KiSaveProcessorControlState</code> (and a similar bug in the counterpart <code>KiRestoreProcessorControlState</code>), which is called from three locations inside NTOSKRNL.EXE:</p>
<ol>
<li>When an exception is reflected to the kernel debugger using <code>KdpTrap</code> (If I use Ctrl-C to break into the kernel debugger, a breakpoint exception is raised from the break-in polling functionality in the timer tick interrupt)</li>
<li>When <code>KeBugCheckEx</code> is called (i.e. the "blue screen")</li>
<li>When <code>KiSaveProcessorState</code> is invoked. This appears to never happen, as this function is neither exported nor called from inside NTOSKRNL if the control flow analysis by IDA in NTOSKRNL.EXE is exhaustive.</li>
</ol>
<p>This function is supposed to save the processor control registers into an extended <code>CONTEXT</code> structure. Its disassembly looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This function is supposed to save all control register (CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4 on pentium and later processors), all debug registers (DR0-DR3, DR6, DR7) and various global protected mode settings (the address of the GDT, the address of the IDT, the selector of the active TSS and the selector of the LDT). To detect the processor type, it uses a value from the KPRCB (Kernel Processor Control Block). The KPRCB is part of the KPCR (Kernel Processor Control Region). The KPRCB for the boot processor (or the only processor on uniprocessor systems) is located at virtual address <code>FFDFF120</code>, which is hard-coded into this method. <a href="https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/inc/ntos/i386_x/kprcb/index.htm" rel="noreferrer">Geoff Chappell</a> writes this about the relevant part of the KPRCB in NT 3.1:</p>
<pre><code>+018   CHAR CpuType;
+019   CHAR CpuID;
+01A   UShort CpuStep;
</code></pre>
<p>These members of the KPCRB are initialized by <code>KiSetProcessorType</code>, which identifies the relevant processors correctly (but be aware that it mistrusts processors that report a CPUID feature level above 3 and considers them as "generic non-CPUID capable 586 compatible processors". The byte at offset 18 is set to 4 for 486 processors, 5 for Pentium processors and 6 for Pentium Pro and Pentium II/III processors. The byte at offset 19 is a boolean flag that indicates whether the processor support CPUID and it behaves "reasonable".</p>
<p>A very attentive reader might already have noticed the bug: The CMP instruction uses the <em>word</em> at address <code>FFDFF138</code> (which is 18h bytes into the KPRCB), instead of the <em>byte</em> at that address. This means the byte at offset 19h in the KPRCB is considered part of the model number. If a processor supports CPUID, its model number is considered to be 256 bigger than it actually is. This means Windows NT 3.1 treats a CPUID capable 80-4-86 processor as 80-260-86 processor. And as 260 is way larger than 5 (Pentium), that processor better had CR4.</p>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p>The fix is obvious once the bug is identified. The instruction <code>cmp     ds:word_FFDFF138, 5</code> only appears twice in NTOSKRNL.EXE, specifically in <code>KiSaveProcessorControlState</code> and <code>KiRestoreProcessorControlState</code>, and it needs to be patched to be a byte compare instead of a word compare. Use your favorite hex editor to patch <code>66 83 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05</code> to <code>90 80 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05</code>, two times. This fix applies both the NTOSKRNL.EXE from the original NT 3.1 Advanced Server distribution as well as NT 3.1 SP3.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>On a warm June day in 1978, William J. LeMessurier, one of the nation’s leading structural engineers, received a phone call at his headquarters, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from an engineering student in New Jersey. The young man, whose name has been lost in the swirl of subsequent events, said that his professor had assigned him to write a paper on the Citicorp tower, the slash-topped silver skyscraper that had become, on its completion in Manhattan the year before, the seventh-tallest building in the world.</p><p>LeMessurier found the subject hard to resist, even though the call caught him in the middle of a meeting. As a structural consultant to the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr., he had designed the twenty-five-thousand-ton steel skeleton beneath the tower’s sleek aluminum skin. And, in a field where architects usually get all the credit, the engineer, then fifty-two, had won his own share of praise for the tower’s technical elegance and singular grace; indeed, earlier that year he had been elected to the National Academy of Engineering, the highest honor his profession bestows. Excusing himself from the meeting, LeMessurier asked his caller how he could help.</p><p>The student wondered about the columns—there are four—that held the building up. According to his professor, LeMessurier had put them in the wrong place.</p><p>“I was very nice to this young man,” LeMessurier recalls. “But I said, ‘Listen, I want you to tell your teacher that he doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about, because he doesn’t know the problem that had to be solved.’ I promised to call back after my meeting and explain the whole thing.”</p><p>The problem had been posed by a church. When planning for Citicorp Center began, in the early nineteen-seventies, the site of choice was on the east side of Lexington Avenue between Fifty-third and Fifty-fourth Streets, directly across the street from Citicorp’s headquarters. But the northwest corner of that block was occupied by St. Peter’s Church, a decaying Gothic structure built in 1905. Since St. Peter’s owned the corner, and one of the world’s biggest banking corporations wanted the whole block, the church was able to strike a deal that seemed heaven-sent: its old building would be demolished and a new one built as a freestanding part of Citicorp Center.</p><p>To clear space for the new church, Hugh Stubbins and Bill LeMessurier (he pronounces his name “LeMeasure”) set their fifty-nine-story tower on four massive, nine-story-high stilts, and positioned them at the center of each side, rather than at each corner. This daring scheme allowed the designers to cantilever the building’s corners seventy-two feet out over the church, on the northwest, and over a plaza on the southwest. The columns also produced high visual drama: a nine-hundred-and-fourteen-foot monolith that seemed all but weightless as it hovered above the street.</p><p>When LeMessurier called the student back, he related this with the pride of a master builder and the elaborate patience of a pedagogue; he, too, taught a structural-engineering class, to architecture students at Harvard. Then he explained how the peculiar geometry of the building, far from constituting a mistake, put the columns in the strongest position to resist what sailors call quartering winds—those which come from a diagonal and, by flowing across two sides of a building at once, increase the forces on both. For further enlightenment on the matter, he referred the student to a technical article written by LeMessurier’s partner in New York, an engineer named Stanley Goldstein. LeMessurier recalls, “I gave him a lot of information, and I said, ‘Now you really have something on your professor, because you can explain all of this to him yourself.’ ”</p><p>Later that day, LeMessurier decided that the information would interest his own students; like sailors, designers of tall buildings must know the wind and respect its power. And the columns were only part of the tower’s defense against swaying in severe winds. A classroom lecture would also look at the tower’s unusual system of wind braces, which LeMessurier had first sketched out, in a burst of almost ecstatic invention, on a napkin in a Greek restaurant in Cambridge: forty-eight braces, in six tiers of eight, arrayed like giant chevrons behind the building’s curtain of aluminum and glass. (“I’m very vain,” LeMessurier says. “I would have liked my stuff to be expressed on the outside of the building, but Stubbins wouldn’t have it. In the end, I told myself I didn’t give a damn—the structure was there, it’d be seen by God.”)</p><p>LeMessurier had long since established the strength of those braces in perpendicular winds—the only calculation required by New York City’s building code. Now, in the spirit of intellectual play, he wanted to see if they were just as strong in winds hitting from forty-five degrees. His new calculations surprised him. In four of the eight chevrons in each tier, a quartering wind increased the strain by forty per cent. Under normal circumstances, the wind braces would have absorbed the extra load without so much as a tremor. But the circumstances were not normal. A few weeks before, during a meeting in his office, LeMessurier had learned of a crucial change in the way the braces were joined.</p><p>The meeting had been called, during the month of May, to review plans for two new skyscrapers in Pittsburgh. Those towers, too, were designed by Hugh Stubbins with LeMessurier as structural consultant, and the plans called for wind braces similar to those used in Citicorp Center, with the same specifications for welded joints. This was top-of-the-line engineering; two structural members joined by a skilled welder become as strong as one. But welded joints, which are labor-intensive and therefore expensive, can be needlessly strong; in most cases, bolted joints are more practical and equally safe. That was the position taken at the May meeting by a man from U.S. Steel, a potential bidder on the contract to erect the Pittsburgh towers. If welded joints were a condition, the project might be too expensive and his firm might not want to take it on.</p><p>To reassure him, LeMessurier put in a call to his office in New York. “I spoke to Stanley Goldstein and said, ‘Tell me about your success with those welded joints in Citicorp.’ And Stanley said, ‘Oh, didn’t you know? They were changed—they were never welded at all, because Bethlehem Steel came to us and said they didn’t think we needed to do it.’ ” Bethlehem, which built the Citicorp tower, had made the same objection—welds were stronger than necessary, bolts were the right way to do the job. On August 1, 1974, LeMessurier’s New York office—actually a venture in conjunction with an old-line Manhattan firm called the Office of James Ruderman—had accepted Bethlehem’s proposal.</p><p>This news gave LeMessurier no cause for concern in the days immediately following the meeting. The choice of bolted joints was technically sound and professionally correct. Even the failure of his associates to flag him on the design change was justifiable; had every decision on the site in Manhattan waited for approval from Cambridge, the building would never have been finished. Most important, modern skyscrapers are so strong that catastrophic collapse is not considered a realistic prospect; when engineers seek to limit a building’s sway, they do so for the tenants’ comfort.</p><p>Yet now, a month after the May meeting, the substitution of bolted joints raised a troubling question. If the bracing system was unusually sensitive to quartering winds, as LeMessurier had just discovered, so were the joints that held it together. The question was whether the Manhattan team had considered such winds when it designed the bolts. “I didn’t go into a panic over it,” LeMessurier says. “But I was haunted by a hunch that it was something I’d better look into.”</p><p>On July 24th, he flew to New York, where his hunch was soon confirmed: his people had taken only perpendicular winds into account. And he discovered another “subtle conceptual error,” as he calls it now—one that threatened to make the situation much worse.</p><p>To understand why, one must look at the interplay of opposing forces in a windblown building. The wind causes tension in the structural members—that is, it tries to blow the building down. At the same time, some of that tension, measured in thousands, or even millions, of pounds, is offset by the force of gravity, which, by pressing the members together, tends to hold the building in place. The joints must be strong enough to resist the differential between these forces—the amount of wind tension minus the amount of compression.</p><p>Within this seemingly simple computation, however, lurks a powerful multiplier. At any given level of the building, the compression figure remains constant; the wind may blow harder, but the structure doesn’t get any heavier. Thus, immense leverage can result from higher wind forces. In the Citicorp tower, the forty-per-cent increase in tension produced by a quartering wind became a hundred-and-sixty-per-cent increase on the building’s bolts.</p><p>Precisely because of that leverage, a margin of safety is built into the standard formulas for calculating how strong a joint must be; these formulas are contained in an American Institute of Steel Construction specification that deals with joints in structural columns. What LeMessurier found in New York, however, was that the people on his team had disregarded the standard. They had chosen to define the diagonal wind braces not as columns but as trusses, which are exempt from the safety factor. As a result, the bolts holding the joints together were perilously few. “By then,” LeMessurier says, “I was getting pretty shaky.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>He later detailed these mistakes in a thirty-page document called “Project <em>serene</em>”; the acronym, both rueful and apt, stands for “Special Engineering Review of Events Nobody Envisioned.” What emerges from this document, which has been confidential until now, and from interviews with LeMessurier and other principals in the events, is not malfeasance, or even negligence, but a series of miscalculations that flowed from a specific mind-set. In the case of the Citicorp tower, the first event that nobody envisioned had taken place when LeMessurier sketched, on a restaurant napkin, a bracing system with an inherent sensitivity to quartering winds. None of his associates identified this as a problem, let alone understood that they were compounding it with their fuzzy semantics. In the stiff, angular language of “Project <em>serene</em>,” “consideration of wind from non-perpendicular directions on ordinary rectangular buildings is generally not discussed in the literature or in the classroom.”</p><p>LeMessurier tried to take comfort from another element of Citicorp’s advanced design: the building’s tuned mass damper. This machine, built at his behest and perched where the bells would have been if the Citicorp tower had been a cathedral, was essentially a four-hundred-and-ten-ton block of concrete, attached to huge springs and floating on a film of oil. When the building swayed, the block’s inertia worked to damp the movement and calm tenants’ queasy stomachs. Reducing sway was of special importance, because the Citicorp tower was an unusually lightweight building; the twenty-five thousand tons of steel in its skeleton contrasted with the Empire State Building’s sixty-thousand-ton superstructure. Yet the damper, the first of its kind in a large building, was never meant to be a safety device. At best, the machine might reduce the danger, not dispel it.</p><p>Before making a final judgment on how dangerous the bolted joints were, LeMessurier turned to a Canadian engineer named Alan Davenport, the director of the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory, at the University of Western Ontario, and a world authority on the behavior of buildings in high winds. During the Citicorp tower’s design, Davenport had run extensive tests on scale models of the structure. Now LeMessurier asked him and his deputy to retrieve the relevant files and magnetic tapes. “If we were going to think about such things as the possibility of failure,” LeMessurier says—the word “failure” being a euphemism for the Citicorp tower’s falling down—“we would think about it in terms of the best knowledge that the state of the art can produce, which is what these guys could provide for me.”</p><p>On July 26th, he flew to London, Ontario, and met with Davenport. Presenting his new calculations, LeMessurier asked the Canadians to evaluate them in the light of the original data. “And you have to tell me the truth,” he added. “Don’t go easy if it doesn’t come out the right way.”</p><p>It didn’t, and they didn’t. The tale told by the wind-tunnel experts was more alarming than LeMessurier had expected. His assumption of a forty-per-cent increase in stress from diagonal winds was theoretically correct, but it could go higher in the real world, when storms lashed at the building and set it vibrating like a tuning fork. “Oh, my God,” he thought, “now we’ve got that on top of an error from the bolts being underdesigned.” Refining their data further, the Canadians teased out wind-tunnel forces for each structural member in the building, with and without the tuned mass damper in operation; it remained for LeMessurier to interpret the numbers’ meaning.</p><p>First, he went to Cambridge, where he talked to a trusted associate, and then he called his wife at their summerhouse in Maine. “Dorothy knew what I was up to,” he says. “I told her, ‘I think we’ve got a problem here, and I’m going to sit down and try to think about it.’ ” On July 28th, he drove to the northern shore of Sebago Lake, took an outboard motorboat a quarter of a mile across the water to his house on a twelve-acre private island, and worked through the wind-tunnel numbers, joint by joint and floor by floor.</p><p>The weakest joint, he discovered, was at the building’s thirtieth floor; if that one gave way, catastrophic failure of the whole structure would follow. Next, he took New York City weather records provided by Alan Davenport and calculated the probability of a storm severe enough to tear that joint apart. His figures told him that such an event had a statistical probability of occurring as often as once every sixteen years—what meteorologists call a sixteen-year storm.</p><p>“That was very low, awesomely low,” LeMessurier said, his voice hushed as if the horror of discovery were still fresh. “To put it another way, there was one chance in sixteen in any year, including that one.” When the steadying influence of the tuned mass damper was factored in, the probability dwindled to one in fifty-five—a fifty-five-year storm. But the machine required electric current, which might fail as soon as a major storm hit.</p><p>As an experienced engineer, LeMessurier liked to think he could solve most structural problems, and the Citicorp tower was no exception. The bolted joints were readily accessible, thanks to Hugh Stubbins’ insistence on putting the chevrons inside the building’s skin rather than displaying them outside. With money and materials, the joints could be reinforced by welding heavy steel plates over them, like giant Band-Aids. But time was short; this was the end of July, and the height of the hurricane season was approaching. To avert disaster, LeMessurier would have to blow the whistle quickly—on himself. That meant facing the pain of possible protracted litigation, probable bankruptcy, and professional disgrace. It also meant shock and dismay for Citicorp’s officers and shareholders when they learned that the bank’s proud new corporate symbol, built at a cost of a hundred and seventy-five million dollars, was threatened with collapse.</p><p>On the island, LeMessurier considered his options. Silence was one of them; only Davenport knew the full implications of what he had found, and he would not disclose them on his own. Suicide was another; if LeMessurier drove along the Maine Turnpike at a hundred miles an hour and steered into a bridge abutment, that would be that. But keeping silent required betting other people’s lives against the odds, while suicide struck him as a coward’s way out and—although he was passionate about nineteenth-century classical music—unconvincingly melodramatic. What seized him an instant later was entirely convincing, because it was so unexpected—an almost giddy sense of power. “I had information that nobody else in the world had,” LeMessurier recalls. “I had power in my hands to effect extraordinary events that only I could initiate. I mean, sixteen years to failure—that was very simple, very clear-cut. I almost said, ‘Thank you, dear Lord, for making this problem so sharply defined that there’s no choice to make.’ ”</p><p>At his office in Cambridge on the morning of Monday, July 31st, LeMessurier tried to reach Hugh Stubbins, whose firm was upstairs in the same building, but Stubbins was in California and unavailable by phone. Then he called Stubbins’ lawyer, Carl Sapers, and outlined the emergency over lunch. Sapers advised him against telling Citicorp until he had consulted with his own company’s liability insurers, the Northbrook Insurance Company, in Northbrook, Illinois. When LeMessurier called Northbrook, which represented the Office of James Ruderman as well, someone there referred him to the company’s attorneys in New York and warned him not to discuss the matter with anyone else.</p><p>At 9 <em>a</em>.<em>m</em>. on Tuesday, in New York, LeMessurier faced a battery of lawyers who, he says, “wanted to meet me to find out if I was nutty.” Being lawyers, not engineers, they were hard put to reconcile his dispassionate tone with the apocalyptic thrust of his prophecy. They also bridled at his carefully qualified answers to seemingly simple questions. When they asked how big a storm it would take to blow the building down, LeMessurier confined himself to statistical probabilities—a storm that might occur once in sixteen years.</p><p>When they pressed him for specific wind velocities—would the wind have to be at eighty miles per hour, or ninety, or ninety-five?—he insisted that such figures were not significant in themselves, since every structure was uniquely sensitive to certain winds; an eighty-five-mile-per-hour wind that blew for sixteen minutes from the northwest might pose less of a threat to a particular building than an eighty-mile-per-hour wind that blew for fourteen minutes from the southwest.</p><p>But the lawyers certainly understood that they had a crisis on their hands, so they sent for an expert adviser they trusted: Leslie Robertson, an engineer who had been a structural consultant for the World Trade Center. “I got a phone call out of the blue from some lawyer summoning me to a meeting,” Robertson says. “ ‘What’s it about?’ ‘You’ll find out when you get there.’ ‘Sorry, I have other things to do—I don’t attend meetings on that basis.’ A few minutes later, I got another call, from another lawyer, who said there’d been a problem with Citicorp Center. I went to the meeting that morning, and I didn’t know anybody there but Bill. He stood up and explained what he perceived were the difficulties with the building, and everyone, of course, was very concerned. Then they turned to me and said, ‘Well?’ I said, ‘Look, if this is in fact the case, you have a very serious problem.’ ”</p><p>The two structural engineers were peers, but not friends. LeMessurier was a visionary with a fondness for heroic designs, though he was also an energetic manager. Robertson was a stickler for technical detail, a man fascinated by how things fit together. LeMessurier, older by two years, was voluble and intense, with a courtly rhetorical style. Robertson was tall, trim, brisk, and edgily funny, but made no effort to hide his impatience with things that didn’t interest him.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In addition to his engineering expertise, Robertson brought to the table a background in disaster management. He had worked with such groups as the National Science Foundation and the National Research Council on teams that studied the aftermaths of earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. (In 1993, he worked with the F.B.I. on the World Trade Center bombing.) For the liability lawyers, this special perspective enhanced his stature as a consultant, but it unsettled LeMessurier from the start. As he remembers it, “Robertson predicted to everybody present that within hours of the time Citicorp heard about this the whole building would be evacuated. I almost fainted. I didn’t want that to happen.” (For his part, Robertson recalls making no such dire prediction.)</p><p>LeMessurier didn’t think an evacuation would be necessary. He believed that the building was safe for occupancy in all but the most violent weather, thanks to the tuned mass damper, and he insisted that the damper’s reliability in a storm could be assured by installing emergency generators. Robertson conceded the importance of keeping the damper running—it had performed flawlessly since it became operational earlier that year—but, because, in his view, its value as a safety device was unproved, he flatly refused to consider it as a mitigating factor. (In a conversation shortly after the World Trade Center bombing, Robertson noted dryly that the twin towers’ emergency generators “lasted for fifteen minutes.”)</p><p>One point on which everyone agreed was that LeMessurier, together with Stubbins, needed to inform Citicorp as soon as possible. Only Stubbins had ever dealt directly with Citicorp’s chairman, Walter B. Wriston, and he was flying home that same day from California and still didn’t know his building was flawed. That evening, LeMessurier took the shuttle to Boston, went to Stubbins’ house in Cambridge, and broke the news. “He winced, I must admit—here was his masterpiece,” LeMessurier says. “But he’s a man of enormous resilience, a very grown man, and fortunately we had a lifelong relationship of trust.”</p><p>The next morning, August 2nd, Stubbins and LeMessurier flew to New York, went to LeMessurier’s office at 515 Madison Avenue, put in a call to Wriston, but failed to penetrate the layers of secretaries and assistants that insulated Citicorp’s chairman from the outside world. They were no more successful in reaching the bank’s president, William I. Spencer, but Stubbins finally managed to get an appointment with Citicorp’s executive vice-president, John S. Reed, the man who has now succeeded Wriston as chairman. LeMessurier and Stubbins went to see Reed at the bank’s ornate executive offices, in an older building on Lexington Avenue, across the street from Citicorp Center. LeMessurier began by saying, “I have a real problem for you, sir.”</p><p>Reed was well equipped to understand the problem. He had an engineering background, and he had been involved in the design and construction of Citicorp Center; the company had called him in when it was considering the tuned mass damper. Reed listened impassively as LeMessurier detailed the structural defect and how he thought it could be fixed. LeMessurier says, “I’d already conceived that you could build a little plywood house around each of the connections that were critical, and a welder could work inside it without damaging the tenants’ space. You might have to take up the carpet, take down the Sheetrock, and work at night, but all this could be done. But the real message I conveyed to him was ‘I need your help—at once.’ ”</p><p>When Reed asked how much the repairs would cost, LeMessurier offered an estimate of a million dollars. At the end of the meeting, which lasted half an hour, Reed thanked the two men courteously, though noncommittally, and told them to go back to their office and await further instructions. They did so, but after waiting for more than an hour they decided to go out to lunch. As they were finishing their meal, a secretary from LeMessurier’s office called to say that John Reed would be in the office in ten minutes with Walter Wriston.</p><p>In the late nineteen-seventies, when Citicorp began its expansion into global banking, Wriston was one of the most influential bankers in the country. A tall man of piercing intelligence, he was not known for effusiveness in the best of circumstances, and LeMessurier expected none now, what with Citicorp Center—and his own career—literally hanging in the balance. But the bank’s chairman was genuinely proud of the building, and he offered his full support in getting it fixed.</p><p>“Wriston was fantastic,” LeMessurier says. “He said, ‘I guess my job is to handle the public relations of this, so I’ll have to start drafting a press release.’ ” But he didn’t have anything to write on, so someone handed him a yellow pad. That made him laugh. According to LeMessurier, “ ‘All wars,’ Wriston said, ‘are won by generals writing on yellow pads.’ ” In fact, Wriston simply took notes; the press release would not go out for six days. But his laughter put the others at ease. Citicorp’s general was on their side.</p><p>Within hours of Wriston’s visit, LeMessurier’s office arranged for emergency generators for the tower’s tuned mass damper. The bank issued beepers to LeMessurier and his key engineers, assuring them that Reed and other top managers could be reached by phone at any hour of the day or night. Citicorp also assigned two vice-presidents, Henry DeFord III and Robert Dexter, to manage the repairs; both had overseen the building’s construction and knew it well.</p><p>The next morning, Thursday, August 3rd, LeMessurier, Robertson, and four of LeMessurier’s associates met with DeFord and Dexter in a conference room on the thirtieth floor of Citicorp Center. (The decision to hold the initial meeting near the structure’s weakest point was purely coincidental.) LeMessurier outlined his plan to fix the wind braces by welding two-inch-thick steel plates over each of more than two hundred bolted joints. The plan was tentatively approved, pending actual examination of a typical joint, but putting it into effect depended on the availability of a contractor and on an adequate supply of steel plate. Since Bethlehem Steel had dropped out of the business of fabricating and erecting skyscraper structures, Robertson suggested Karl Koch Erecting, a New Jersey-based firm that had put up the World Trade Center.</p><p>“I called them,” Robertson says, “and got, ‘Well, we’re a little busy right now,’ and I said, ‘Hey, you don’t understand what we’re talking about here.’ ” A few hours later, two Koch engineers joined the meeting. LeMessurier and Robertson took them to an unoccupied floor of the building, and there workmen tore apart enough Sheetrock to expose a diagonal connection. Comparing the original drawings of the joints with the nuts-and-bolts reality before their eyes, the engineers concluded that LeMessurier’s plan was indeed feasible. Koch also happened to have all the necessary steel plate on hand, so Citicorp negotiated a contract for welding to begin as soon as LeMessurier’s office could issue new drawings.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Two more contracts were drawn up before the end of the following day. One of them went out to MTS Systems Corporation, the Minneapolis firm that had manufactured the tuned mass damper. MTS was asked to provide full-time technical support—in effect, around-the-clock nurses—to keep its machine in perfect health. The company flew one of its technicians to New York that night. Four days later, in a letter of agreement, MTS asked Citicorp to provide a long list of materials and spare parts, which included three buckets, a grease gun, rags, cleaning solvent, and “1 Radio with weather band.”</p><p>The other contract engaged a California firm, also recommended by Robertson, to fit the building with a number of instruments called strain gauges—pieces of tape with zigzag wires running through them. The gauges would be affixed to individual structural members, and electrical impulses from them would be funnelled to an improvised communications center in Robertson’s office, eight blocks away, at 230 Park Avenue; like a patient in intensive care, the tower would have every shiver and twitch monitored. But this required new telephone lines, and the phone company refused to budge on its leisurely installation schedule. When Robertson voiced his frustration about this during a late-night meeting in Walter Wriston’s office, Wriston picked up the phone on his desk and called his friend Charles Brown, the president and chief operating officer of A.T. &amp; T. The new lines went in the next morning.</p><p>A different problem-solving approach was taken by Robertson during another nighttime meeting in Citicorp’s executive suite. Wriston wanted copies of some documents that Robertson had shown him, but all the secretaries had gone home—the only people on the floor were Wriston, Robertson, and John Reed—and every copying machine was locked. “I’m an engineer,” Robertson says, “so I kneeled down, ripped the door off one of the machines, and we made our copies. I looked up at them a little apologetically, but, what the hell—fixing the door was a few hundred bucks, and these guys had a hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar building in trouble across the street.”</p><p>Robertson also assembled an advisory group of weather experts from academia and the government’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, on Long Island, and hired two independent weather forecasters to provide wind predictions four times a day. “What worried us more than hurricanes, which give you hours and days to anticipate, were unpredictable events,” Robertson says. “From time to time, we’ve had small tornadoes in this area, and there was a worry that a much bigger one would come down and take hold.” Then Robertson raised an issue that LeMessurier had dreaded discussing. In a meeting on Friday that included LeMessurier, Robertson told Citicorp’s representatives, DeFord and Dexter, that they needed to plan for evacuating Citicorp Center and a large area around it in the event of a high-wind alert.</p><p>During the first week of August, discussions had involved only a small circle of company officials and engineers. But the circle widened on Monday, August 7th, when final drawings for the steel plates went out to Arthur Nusbaum, the veteran project manager of HRH Construction, which was the original contractor for Citicorp Center, and Nusbaum, in turn, provided them to Koch Erecting. And it would widen again, because work could not go forward, as Robertson reminded the officials, without consulting the city’s Department of Buildings. Citicorp faced a public-relations debacle unless it came up with a plausible explanation of why its brand-new skyscraper needed fixing.</p><p>That night, DeFord and Dexter, following Robertson’s advice, met with Mike Reilly, the American Red Cross’s director of disaster services for the New York metropolitan area. “They laid out the dilemma, and it was clearly an ominous event,” Reilly recalls. From that first meeting, which was attended by Robertson but not by LeMessurier, and from half a dozen subsequent working sessions with other disaster agencies, came plans for joint action by the police and the mayor’s Office of Emergency Management, along with the Red Cross. In the event of a wind alert, the police and the mayor’s emergency forces would evacuate the building and the surrounding neighborhood, and the Red Cross would mobilize between twelve hundred and two thousand workers to provide food and temporary shelter. “Hal DeFord was the bank’s point man for all this,” Reilly says. “The anxiety was so heavy on him that we wondered if he was going to make it.”</p><p>On Tuesday morning, August 8th, the public-affairs department of Citibank, Citicorp’s chief subsidiary, put out the long-delayed press release. In language as bland as a loan officer’s wardrobe, the three-paragraph document said unnamed “engineers who designed the building” had recommended that “certain of the connections in Citicorp Center’s wind bracing system be strengthened through additional welding.” The engineers, the press release added, “have assured us that there is no danger.” When DeFord expanded on the handout in interviews, he portrayed the bank as a corporate citizen of exemplary caution—“We wear both belts and suspenders here,” he told a reporter for the <em>News</em>—that had decided on the welds as soon as it learned of new data based on dynamic-wind tests conducted at the University of Western Ontario.</p><p>There was some truth in all this. During LeMessurier’s recent trip to Canada, one of Alan Davenport’s assistants had mentioned to him that probable wind velocities might be slightly higher, on a statistical basis, than predicted in 1973, during the original tests for Citicorp Center. At the time, LeMessurier viewed this piece of information as one more nail in the coffin of his career, but later, recognizing it as a blessing in disguise, he passed it on to Citicorp as the possible basis of a cover story for the press and for tenants in the building.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, at a meeting in Robertson’s office, LeMessurier told the whole truth to New York City’s Acting Building Commissioner and nine other senior city officials. For more than an hour, he spoke about the effect of diagonal winds on the Citicorp tower, about the failure of his own office to perceive and communicate the danger, and about the intended repairs.</p><p>In the discussion that followed, the city officials asked a few technical questions, and Arthur Nusbaum expressed concern over a shortage of certified welders who had passed the city’s structural-welding test. That would not be a problem, the representatives from the Department of Buildings replied; one of the area’s most trusted steel inspectors, Neil Moreton, would have the power to test and immediately certify any welder that Citicorp’s repair project required. Nusbaum recalls, “Once they said that, I knew we were O.K., because there were steamfitter welders all over the place who could do a fantastic job.”</p><p>Before the city officials left, they commended LeMessurier for his courage and candor, and expressed a desire to be kept informed as the repair work progressed. Given the urgency of the situation, that was all they could reasonably do. “It wasn’t a case of ‘We caught you, you skunk,’ ” Nusbaum says. “It started with a guy who stood up and said, ‘I got a problem, I made the problem, let’s fix the problem.’ If you’re gonna kill a guy like LeMessurier, why should anybody ever talk?”</p><p>Meanwhile, Robertson’s switchboard was besieged by calls. “Every reporter in town wanted to know how come all these people were in our office,” Robertson says. Once the meeting ended, the Building Commissioner returned the reporters’ calls and, hewing to Citicorp’s line, reassured them that the structural work was only a prudent response to new meteorological data.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>As a result, press coverage in New York City the next day was as uninformative as the handout: a short piece in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, which raised no questions about the nature of the new data, and one in the <em>News</em>, which dutifully quoted DeFord’s remark about belts and suspenders. But when LeMessurier went back to his hotel room, at about 5 <em>p</em>.<em>m.</em> on Wednesday, he learned from his wife, who had come down from Cambridge to join him, that a reporter from the <em>Times</em> had been trying to reach him all afternoon. That worried him greatly; being candid with city officials was one thing, but being interrogated by the <em>Times</em> was another. Before returning the call, LeMessurier phoned his friend Carl Sapers, the Boston attorney who represented Hugh Stubbins, and mixed himself a Martini. Sapers understood the need for secrecy, but he saw no real choice; talk to them, he said, and do the best you can. Two minutes after six o’clock, LeMessurier called the <em>Times</em> switchboard. As he braced himself for an unpleasant conversation, he heard a recording. The <em>Times</em>, along with all the other major papers in the city, had just been shut down by a strike.</p><p>Welders started work almost immediately, their torches a dazzlement in the night sky. The weather was sticky, as it had been since the beginning of the month—New Jersey’s tomato crop was rotting from too much rain—and forecasts called for temperatures in the mid-eighties the next day, with no wind; in other words, a perfect day for Citicorp Center.</p><p>Yet tropical storms were already churning the Caribbean. Citicorp pushed for repair work around the clock, but Nusbaum refused to allow welding during office hours, for fear that clouds of acrid smoke would cause panic among the tenants and set off every smoke detector in the building. Instead, he brought in drywall crews and carpenters to work from 5 <em>p</em>.<em>m</em>. to 8 <em>p</em>.<em>m</em>., putting up plywood enclosures around the chevrons and tearing down Sheetrock; welders to weld from 8 <em>p</em>.<em>m</em>. until 4 <em>a</em>.<em>m</em>., with the building’s fire-alarm system shut off; and then laborers to clean up the epic mess before the first secretaries arrived.</p><p>The welders worked seven days a week. Sometimes they worked on unoccupied floors; sometimes they invaded lavish offices. But décor, or the lack of it, had no bearing on their priorities, which were set by LeMessurier. “It was a tense time for the whole month,” he says. “I was constantly calculating which joint to fix next, which level of the building was more critical, and I developed charts and graphs of all the consequences: if you fix this, then the rarity of the storm that will cause any trouble lengthens to that.”</p><p>At Robertson’s office, a steady stream of data poured in from the weather forecasters and from the building itself. Occasionally, the strain-gauge readings jumped, like spikes on an electrocardiogram, when the technicians from MTS Systems exercised their tuned mass damper to make sure it was working properly. One time, the readings went off the chart, then stopped. This provoked more bafflement than fear, since it seemed unlikely that a hurricane raging on Lexington and Fifty-third Street would go otherwise unnoticed at Forty-sixth and Park. The cause proved to be straightforward enough: When the instrumentation experts from California installed their strain gauges, they had neglected to hire union electricians. “Someone heard about it,” LeMessurier says, “went up there in the middle of the night, and snipped all the wires.”</p><p>For most of August, the weather smiled on Citicorp, or at least held its breath, and the welders made steady progress. LeMessurier felt confident enough to fly off with his wife for a weekend in Maine. As their return flight was coming in for a landing at LaGuardia Airport Sunday night, they looked out across the East River and saw a pillar of fire on the Manhattan skyline. “The welders were working up and down the building, fixing the joints,” LeMessurier recalls. “It was an absolutely marvellous thing to see. I said to Dorothy, ‘Isn’t this wonderful? Nobody knows what’s going on, but we know and we can see it right there in the sky.’ ”</p><p>A great deal of work remained. Robertson was insisting on a complete reëvaluation of the Citicorp tower: not just the sensitivity of the chevrons to quartering winds but the strength of other skeletal members, the adequacy of braces that kept the supporting columns in plumb, and the rigidity of the building’s corrugated metal-and-concrete floors, which Robertson feared might be compromised by trenches carrying electrical connections.</p><p>His insistence was proper—settling for less would have compromised Robertson’s own position. It amounted to a post-construction autopsy by teams of forensic engineers. For LeMessurier, the reëvaluation was harrowing in the extreme; every new doubt about his design for Citicorp Center reflected on him.</p><p>In one instance, Robertson’s fears were unwarranted: tests showed that the tower floors were entirely sound—the trenches were not a source of weakness. In another, Robertson, assuming the worst about construction tolerances, decided that the columns might be slightly, even though undetectably, out of plumb, and therefore he ordered the installation of supplemental bracing above the fourteenth floor.</p><p>Shortly before dawn on Friday, September 1st, weather services carried the news that everyone had been dreading—a major storm, Hurricane Ella, was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. At 6:30 <em>a</em>.<em>m</em>., an emergency-planning group convened at the command center in Robertson’s office. “Nobody said, ‘We’re probably going to press the panic button,’ ” LeMessurier recalls. “Nobody dared say that. But everybody was sweating blood.”</p><p>As the storm bore down on the city, the bank’s representatives, DeFord and Dexter, asked LeMessurier for a report on the status of repairs. He told them that the most critical joints had already been fixed and that the building, with its tuned mass damper operating, could now withstand a two-hundred-year storm. It didn’t have to, however. A few hours later, Hurricane Ella veered from its northwesterly course and began moving out to sea.</p><p>LeMessurier spent the following night in Manhattan, having cancelled plans to spend the Labor Day weekend with his family in Maine. But the hurricane kept moving eastward, and daybreak dispelled any lingering thoughts of evacuation. “Saturday was the most beautiful day that the world’s ever seen,” LeMessurier says, “with all the humidity drawn away and the skies sunny and crystal clear.” Alone in the city, he gave himself a treat he’d been thinking about for years—his first visit to the Cloisters, where he basked in an ineffable calm.</p><p>The weather watch ended on September 13th. That same day, Robertson recommended terminating the evacuation plans, too. Welding was completed in October, several weeks before most of the city’s newspapers resumed publication. No further stories on the subject appeared in the wake of the strike. The building, in fact, was now strong enough to withstand a seven-hundred-year storm even without the damper, which made it one of the safest structures ever built—and rebuilt—by the hand of man.</p><p>Throughout the summer, Citicorp’s top management team had concentrated on facilitating repairs, while keeping the lawyers on the sidelines. That changed on September 13th, when Citicorp served notice on LeMessurier and Hugh Stubbins, whose firm held the primary contract, of its intention to seek indemnification for all costs. Their estimate of the costs, according to LeMessurier, amounted to $4.3 million, including management fees. A much higher total was suggested by Arthur Nusbaum, who recalled that his firm, HRH Construction, spent eight million dollars on structural repairs alone. Citicorp has declined to provide its own figure.</p><p>Whatever the actual cost, Citicorp’s effort to recoup it was remarkably free of the punitive impulse that often poisons such negotiations. When the terms of a settlement were first discussed—without lawyers—by LeMessurier, on one side, and DeFord and Dexter, on the other, LeMessurier spoke of two million dollars, which was the amount that his liability insurer, the Northbrook Insurance Company, had agreed to pay. “DeFord and Dexter said, ‘Well, we’ve been deeply wounded here,’ and they tried to play hardball,” LeMessurier says. “But they didn’t do it with much conviction.” After a second meeting, which included a Northbrook lawyer, the bank agreed to hold Stubbins’ firm harmless and to accept the two-million-dollar payment from LeMessurier and his joint-venture partners; no litigation ever ensued. Eight years ago, Citicorp turned the building into a condominium, retaining the land and the shops but selling all the office space, to Japanese buyers, at a handsome profit.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The crisis at Citicorp Center was noteworthy in another respect. It produced heroes, but no villains; everyone connected with the repairs behaved in exemplary fashion, from Walter Wriston and his Citicorp management team to the officials at the city’s Department of Buildings. The most striking example, of course, was set by LeMessurier, who emerged with his reputation not merely unscathed but enhanced. When Robertson speaks of him, he says, “I have a lot of admiration for Bill, because he was very forthcoming. While we say that all engineers would behave as he did, I carry in my mind some skepticism about that.”</p><p>In the last few years, LeMessurier has been talking about the summer of 1978 to his classes at Harvard. The tale, as he tells it, is by turns painful, self-deprecating, and self-dramatizing—an engineer who did the right thing. But it also speaks to the larger question of how professional people should behave. “You have a social obligation,” LeMessurier reminds his students. “In return for getting a license and being regarded with respect, you’re supposed to be self-sacrificing and look beyond the interests of yourself and your client to society as a whole. And the most wonderful part of my story is that when I did it nothing bad happened.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

A function which defines those functions to their original state would be useful to recover from a bad redefinition, without reloading that module.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wiki-body" data-view-component="true">
                <p>I cannot count the number of times I’ve heard, “This product is X, but open source.”</p>
<p>And I’ll admit it—I’ve done the same when describing Lago. When I’m not in the “startup pitch” mood, I default to, “We’re Stripe Billing, but open source”. Or my co-founder might say, “We’re like an open-source Chargebee.” Frankly, it gets the job done.</p>
<p>Of course, if that’s all there was to us, we would have failed by now. What we’ve learned is that open-source tools can’t rely on being an open-source alternative to an already successful business. A developer can’t just imitate a product, tag on an MIT license, and call it a day. As awesome as open source is, in a vacuum, it’s not enough to succeed.</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m talking about open-source projects that compete with popular paid solutions. Commercial open source, so to speak. Some community-driven, sponsored products—like <a href="https://react.dev/" rel="nofollow">React</a>, <a href="https://typeorm.io/" rel="nofollow">TypeORM</a>, or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">VSCode</a>—have different priorities. They are either bankrolled by a larger organization (e.g., Meta for React) or rely on donations to fund development (e.g., TypeORM). They aren’t businesses at heart.</p>
<p>But open-source companies, like us, need to be more than just an open-source alternative to succeed. They either need a concrete reason for why they are open source or have to surpass their competitors.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-profit-not-usage-is-a-measure-of-success"><a href="#profit-not-usage-is-a-measure-of-success">Profit, not usage, is a measure of success</a></h2>
<p>Excluding non-profit projects that are sponsored by donations or parent organizations, a typical open-source business needs profit to be the ultimate north star.</p>
<p>For some, this might be a tough pill to swallow. But a for-profit business exists for profit. Definitionally and practically. Profit is what allows the company to hire employees, grow, and sustain itself—it is quite literally what funds ongoing development. And there’s nothing wrong with that; the fact that businesses can be profitable while building free software is a great thing. It’s not that open-source companies aspire to gouge customers—but they do aspire to remain in business.</p>
<p>This is precisely what has enabled <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="nofollow">MongoDB</a> to grow into one of the largest databases with over <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/company#:~:text=We%20have%204%2C600%2B%20people%20contributing%20to%20our%20success." rel="nofollow">4,600</a> employees. (Granted, MongoDB eventually switched to a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" rel="nofollow">special SSPL license</a> to add specific restrictions on Cloud Providers from distributing a service without contributing to the project, which isn’t OSI approved, but is open-source practically).</p>
<p>But why make this point? Well, splitting the hair between profit and usage is important to measuring long-term success. If a project gets great adoption but cannot drive revenue, it will die. Some wishful thinking might argue that the community will take over, but there’s been little evidence to indicate this happens.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-does-not-winby-being-cheaper"><a href="#how-open-source-does-not-winby-being-cheaper">How open source does not win—by being cheaper</a></h2>
<p>Catering to the price-conscious is a losing battle.</p>
<p>Imagine a buddy who wants to create an open-source version of <a href="https://amplitude.com/" rel="nofollow">Amplitude</a>. She argues that Amplitude is pretty expensive, particularly prohibitive for some early-stage companies, and larger companies could save a fortune by using an open-source version.</p>
<p>In theory, sure. While this pitch might resonate with early-stage companies, those same price-conscious early-stage companies will either use an open-source version or a free tier. That is not enough to sustain the business. Building a cheaper alternative is typically a ticket to future bankruptcy.</p>
<p>What about larger companies? With some caveats, larger companies aren’t worried about going out of business because their Amplitude is too expensive. They might be price-conscious in terms of negotiating a contract in context of their budget, but most SaaS software is just a line item at the end of the day. What matters more is that the solution is (a) a good solution, (b) around for the long haul, and (c) easy to manage. And, unfortunately, deploying an open-source solution can be tricky to manage.</p>
<p>The caveat is if the solution is a massive cost on the overall budget, then a corporation may seek out a more price-friendly solution; there are plenty of companies that needed to kick Oracle when their database costs skyrocketed due to usage. But most open-source solutions aren’t replacing a top-three line item, and therefore price isn’t the north star deciding factor.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-winsby-solving-a-transparency-problem"><a href="#how-open-source-winsby-solving-a-transparency-problem">How open source wins—by solving a transparency problem</a></h2>
<p>A great case for an open-source solution is when a transparency problem is present. What is a transparency problem? It’s when a solution being closed source creates distrust between the client and vendor.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the previous example—open-source Amplitude. That product actually does exist, and it is winning: <a href="https://posthog.com/" rel="nofollow">PostHog</a>. Growing with Airbus, DHL, and Staples as clients, PostHog combines a few product SaaS solutions together and is open source. It’s actually super open source—even the blog source code and <a href="https://posthog.com/roadmap" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> is available publicly. We’ve modeled a lot of our open-source mantras after them.</p>
<p>PostHog is positioned as a better product than its competitors because analytics tools need to process sensitive client data such as IP addresses, names, session recordings, etc. In a world of increasing data regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPA), it can be daunting for third parties to store that data. So PostHog provides an alternative—either (a) self-host an analytics solution yourself or (b) hire PostHog as a third party to do it, but with transparency into how that data is stored and how possibly migrating to self-hosted in the future would work.</p>
<p>This split is important. Even if the most privacy-conscious technique is to self-host the open-source solution (which often leads to no revenue for the developer), many companies will still opt for a hosted model. But they do so now with assurances of how the software works—line by line—and the process of migrating to a self-hosted model in the future if necessary. It’s not that open-source companies win by preventing the need for a third party; they win by allowing for the open audit of how it works.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are many early open-source solutions taking advantage of these selling points. <a href="https://www.medplum.com/" rel="nofollow">Medplum</a> is an open-source electronic health record platform competing with closed-source incumbents; being open-source gives users assurance of exactly what is and isn’t supported by the platform. <a href="https://supertokens.com/" rel="nofollow">SuperTokens</a> is an open-source alternative to authentication solutions like <a href="http://auth0.com/" rel="nofollow">Auth0</a>; logins deal with sensitive data including names, emails, and passwords, and by being open source, Supertokens is able to capture more trust. <a href="https://tableflow.com/" rel="nofollow">TableFlow</a> is an open-source alternative to CSV import platforms like <a href="https://flatfile.com/?" rel="nofollow">Flatfile</a>; once again, the imported data is sensitive.</p>
<p>One of the biggest ones is <a href="https://min.io/" rel="nofollow">Minio</a>, which is an open-source alternative to AWS S3 storage. Given that S3 often stores customer PII (either inadvertently via screenshots or actual structured JSON files), Minio is a great alternative to companies mindful of who has access to user data. Of course, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/privacy-features/#:~:text=We%20prohibit%2C%20and%20our%20systems,or%20to%20comply%20with%20law." rel="nofollow">AWS claims that AWS personnel</a> doesn’t have direct access to customer data, but by being closed-source, that statement is just a function of trust.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on. We could say the same about our <a href="https://www.getlago.com/blog/engineers-need-open-source-to-end-their-billing-nightmares" rel="nofollow">own story</a>; we deal with billing and product usage information, which is pretty high on the list of sensitive content. By being open source, we’re able to better build trust among our users.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-winsby-solving-an-extensibility-problem"><a href="#how-open-source-winsby-solving-an-extensibility-problem">How open source wins—by solving an extensibility problem</a></h2>
<p>One of the big benefits of open source is that it opens the development of niche features to the community. While the core product is typically maintained by a central engineering team, integrations or plugins are often built by community developers and then occasionally merged into the main branch. Conversely, closed-source solutions struggle with this because they rely on their engineering team</p>
<p>This is particularly advantageous for open-source companies building systems that require lots of connections with other libraries, frameworks, or applications. For instance, Airbyte, an open-source ELT platform, blew up because of community-driven additions to its connectors. The same could be said about Elastic, an even bigger originally open-source company that hosts a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations" rel="nofollow">bastion of data integrations</a>.</p>
<p>One of the founders I’ve met is Advait Ruia of Supertokens. For them, extensibility was a core part of their value proposition, as their community members are able to build integrations with uncommon authentication providers, benefiting everyone.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-open-source-winsby-being-better"><a href="#how-open-source-winsby-being-better">How open source wins—by being better</a></h2>
<p>Both of the above issues contribute to commercial open-source being a better product in the long run. But by tapping the community for feedback and help, open-source projects can also accelerate past closed-source solutions. PostHog—<a href="https://posthog.com/blog/15-million-series-b" rel="nofollow">who raised a $15M Series B</a>—started as an alternative to Amplitude and <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" rel="nofollow">FullStory</a>, but has accelerated into a massive, encompassing solution that even competes with <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/" rel="nofollow">LaunchDarkly</a> and <a href="https://www.pendo.io/" rel="nofollow">Pendo</a>. This happened over the last few years, and they heavily credit their community as one of the core reasons.</p>
<p>Open-source projects—not just commercial open source—have served as a critical driver for the improvement of products for decades. However, some software is going to remain closed source. It’s just the nature of first-mover advantage. But when transparency and extensibility are an issue, an open-source successor becomes a real threat.</p>

<p>27th September 2023</p>
<p>This is a self-contained low-power computer with its own display and keyboard that you can program in uLisp, a version of the high-level language Lisp for microcontrollers:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgepulse.jpg" alt="LispBadgePulse.jpg" width="560" height="370"></p>
<p><em>The Lisp Badge LE, a low-power computer programmed in Lisp<br>with a self-contained keyboard and display.</em></p>
<p>It's based on an AVR128DB48 which provides 128K bytes of flash memory, and 16K bytes of RAM. There's an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp, using reverse-mounted buttons giving room for large key legends on the PCB.</p>
<p>It has a low-power monochrome display, readable in daylight without a backlight, so it's ideal for programming in the garden or on the beach! This gives 10 lines of 41 characters, or graphics with a resolution of 250x122 pixels, supported by several graphics commands.</p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A few years ago I designed the <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE">Lisp Badge</a>, a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you could program in Lisp. Since then I've been thinking about how I could improve it, and made a list of features I'd like to add.</p>
<p>On the one hand I wanted it to have a better keyboard, and be low power, powered from a button cell, with an eInk display that you could see in daylight. On the other hand I wanted it to have a colour TFT graphics display, and use a fast 32-bit ARM processor, with support for floating-point arithmetic.</p>
<p>I soon realised that these requirements are incompatible in a single design, and so set about designing two different Lisp Badges to meet the two sets of requirements. This Lisp Badge LE (low energy) is the first of those designs, and has the following new features:</p>
<h4>Processor and memory</h4>
<p>It’s based on an AVR128DB48 (or AVR128DA48) running at 24MHz, and provides 2800 Lisp objects, about the same as the original Lisp Badge. You can save the entire workspace to flash.</p>
<h4>Current consumption</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE draws only 6mA from its CR2032 button cell, and so should have a life of about 40 hours. There’s a physical on/off switch too for long periods of inactivity.</p>
<h4>Lisp language</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE runs the AVR version of uLisp which provides 16-bit integer arithmetic, arbitrary length symbols and strings, lists, multi-dimensional arrays, Arduino interface functions, debugging features, and built-in documentation.</p>
<h4>Display</h4>
<p>The display is a low-power monochrome graphics display&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup> which I explored in an earlier article; see <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?3YB0">Monochrome Low-Power Display Library</a>. It has&nbsp;a resolution of 250x122 pixels, and a text resolution of 10 lines of 41 characters per line. It supports reading back from the display, which makes it possible to support a full range of graphics functions, including plotting points,&nbsp;drawing lines, drawing outline and filled rectangles circles or triangles, and plotting characters and text at normal size or enlarged by any integer scale factor.</p>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>The keyboard takes advantage of push buttons that mount on the reverse of the board, with the button caps protruding through holes in the PCB. This makes it much easier to use than on the original Lisp Badge because it's easier to press the keys, and there's space for larger key legends. The push buttons are available from Adafruit&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>. or The Pi Hut in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It uses the same&nbsp;45-key layout as the original Lisp badge, with upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp. However, it now provides an addition&nbsp;<strong>META</strong>&nbsp;modifier key in addition to <strong>SHIFT</strong>, allowing you to enter characters that don't have a dedicated key on the keyboard.</p>
<h4>Peripherals</h4>
<p>There’s a large piezo speaker that supports playing notes, and a reverse-mounting LED that shines through a hole on the front of the board.</p>
<p>Here's the full specification:</p>
<div>
<h3>Lisp Badge – Specification</h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 61mm (4.2" x 2.4").</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>: 41 characters x 10 lines, or 250 x 122 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p>The <strong>META</strong> key pressed in conjunction with another key gives access to the following characters not available from the main keyboard:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>META +</strong></td>
<td>A</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>D</td>
<td>E</td>
<td>P</td>
<td>Q</td>
<td>T</td>
<td>U</td>
<td>V</td>
<td>&lt;</td>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Character</strong></td>
<td>&amp;</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>$</td>
<td>!</td>
<td>%</td>
<td>?</td>
<td>@</td>
<td>^</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2800 Lisp cells (11200 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>Flash</strong>: 16384 bytes of flash are reserved for use to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> AVR128DB48</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 24 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 6 mA. A CR2032 cell has a typical capacity of 225 mAh, so this should give a life of about 40 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, stream, and array.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Language</strong></h4>
<p>uLisp, a subset of Common Lisp, with the following 196 Lisp functions and special forms:</p>
<p><strong>* + - / /= 1+ 1- &lt; &lt;= = &gt; &gt;= ? abs analogread analogreadresolution analogreference analogwrite and append apply apropos apropos-list aref array-dimensions arrayp ash assoc atom bit boundp break caaar caadr caar cadar caddr cadr car case cdaar cdadr cdar cddar cdddr cddr cdr char char-code characterp check-key closure cls code-char concatenate cond cons consp dacreference decf defcode defun defvar delay digitalread digitalwrite documentation dolist dotimes draw-char draw-circle draw-line draw-pixel draw-rect&nbsp;</strong><strong>draw-triangle&nbsp;</strong><strong>edit eq equal error eval evenp fill-circle fill-rect fill-screen&nbsp;</strong><strong>fill-triangle</strong><strong>&nbsp;first for-millis format funcall gc get-pixel globals glyph-pixel if ignore-errors incf integerp keyboard keywordp lambda length let let* list list-library listp load-image locals logand logbitp logior lognot logxor loop make-array makunbound mapc mapcan mapcar max member millis min minusp mod not note nothing nth null numberp oddp or pinmode plot plot3d plusp pop pprint pprintall prin1 prin1-to-string princ princ-to-string print progn push quote random read read-byte read-from-string read-line register require rest restart-i2c return reverse room save-image search second set set-cursor setf setq sleep sort streamp string string&lt; string= string&gt; stringp subseq symbolp t terpri third time trace truncate unless untrace unwind-protect when with-i2c with-output-to-string with-sd-card with-serial with-spi write-byte write-line write-string zerop</strong></p>
<p>It also provides 37 keywords such as <strong>:input</strong>, <strong>:output</strong>, and <strong>:led-builtin</strong>, as a convenient way of entering Arduino constants.</p>

<h4>Graphics extensions</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE includes a graphics library to allow you to do plotting on the display; for details see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?31GT" target="_blank">Graphics extensions</a>. These work using a coordinate system with the origin at top left:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/graphicsdisplaycoords5.gif" alt="GraphicsDisplayCoords5.gif" width="265" height="135"></p><p>
The following example shows a plot of the fractal Dragon Curve; for the program see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?4JLZ" target="_blank">Dragon curve</a>:
</p><p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgeledragon.jpg" alt="LispBadgeLEDragon.jpg" width="560" height="370"></p>
<p><em>A fractal Dragon Curve drawn in Lisp on the Lisp Badge LE using the graphics extensions.</em></p>
<h4>Assembler</h4>
<p>The Lisp Badge LE also includes an AVR assembler&nbsp;which allows you to generate and run machine-code functions, written in AVR mnemonics, using an assembler written in Lisp. For details see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3IUO">AVR assembler overview</a>.</p>
<p>The language includes several extensions specifically for the Lisp Badge, including <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions, and <strong>keyboard</strong> and <strong>check-key</strong> for reading the keyboard in real time. For details see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?4JJ6" target="_blank">Lisp Badge LE extensions</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge LE board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eight analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: PD0 to PD7 (22 to 29).</li>
<li>VCC, GND, and UPDI.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI0 (4) and MISO0 (5).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;TX0 (0), RX0 (1), SCL0 (2), SDA0 (3), MOSI0 (4), MISO0 (5), SCK0 (6),&nbsp;and PD0 to PD7 (22 to 29)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL0 (2) and SDA0 (3), plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI0 (4), MISO0 (5), and SCK0 (6), plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: TX0 (0) and RX0 (1), plus DTR, VCC, and GND.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analogue output PB4 (12) is connected to a piezo speaker, which can use&nbsp;<strong>analogwrite</strong> or<strong> note.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>SHIFT</strong> (33) and <strong>META</strong> (11) keys can be used as digital inputs, read with <strong>digitalread</strong> and referenced as <strong>:shift-key</strong> and <strong>:meta-key</strong>.</p>
<p>PA7 (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel, referenced as <strong>:led-builtin</strong>. You can turn it on and off with <strong>digitalwrite</strong>, or vary its brightness with <strong>analogwrite</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h3>Entering programs</h3>
<p>You can enter commands and programs by typing them at the keyboard, and pressing ENTER. A keyboard buffer is provided that buffers a full screen of text, and you can use the DEL key to delete characters and correct typing mistakes. The line editor&nbsp;includes parenthesis matching which&nbsp;automatically highlights matching brackets in inverse video as you type in a program. This makes it much easier to enter a program correctly, and is especially helpful in telling you how many closing brackets to type at the end of defining a function.</p>
<p>For example, the following program pulsates the built-in LED slowly on and off:</p>
<pre>(defun pulse (&amp;optional (up t))
  (dotimes (x 256)
    (analogwrite :led-builtin (if up x (- 255 x)))
    (delay 8))
  (pulse (not up)))</pre>
<p>It's shown nicely formatted here for clarity, but you can type it in as one continuous line, only pressing ENTER at the end. To run the program type:</p>
<pre>(pulse)</pre>
<h4>Connecting to a computer</h4>
<p>You can connect the Lisp Badge to a computer by plugging a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter onto the FTDI connector on the top right of the Lisp Badge, and then connecting this to the computer using a USB cable. You can then use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to enter and edit programs as described in <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?19XT">Using uLisp</a>.</p>
<p>I used the 3.3V FTDI Basic Breakout from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>. When using it with the Lisp Badge it powers the Lisp Badge, and so the battery should be left switched off.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the main part of the circuit:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgele.gif" alt="LispBadgeLE.gif" width="720" height="401"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Lisp Badge, based on an AVR128DB48 microcontroller.</em></p>
<p>The keyboard arranges the keys in a matrix of four rows and 11 columns:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgekybd.gif" alt="LispBadgeKybd.gif" width="720" height="206"></p>
<p><em>The circuit of the Lisp Badge keyboard matrix.</em></p>
<h4>► Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I created a PCB in Eagle, and ordered a set of boards from <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/" target="_blank">PCBWay</a>. I chose white PCBs to contrast with the black buttons. The board is the same width as the original Lisp Badge, but slightly taller to accomodate the larger display.</p>
<p>After a bit of experimentation I chose a board thickness of 1.2mm. With the standard 1.6mm thick PCB material the reverse-mounted buttons didn't protrude far enough through the holes, and 0.8mm made the boards too bendy, but 1.2mm was ideal.</p>
<p>The components, apart from the display, are mounted on the back of the board:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/lispbadgeleback.jpg" alt="LispBadgeLEBack.jpg" width="560" height="370"></p>
<p><em>The reverse side of the Lisp Badge printed circuit board.</em></p>
<p>The push buttons are mounted at a 15° angle, which makes it possible to pack them closer together. I've taken advantage of the fact that the terminals on each side of the push buttons are connected together to link the rows and columns of the key matrix across the board, and simplify the PCB track layout. A consequence of this is that if one push button is omitted, or has a faulty connection, all the other buttons to its left or below it across the keyboard may not work. Understanding this should help you track down any faulty soldering.</p>
<p>The PCB uses 0805&nbsp;resistors and capacitors. The LED is a reverse-mounting 1206 LED <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup> to make the front of the board flush.</p>
<p>The board will accommodate either a 16 x 16mm SMD piezo speaker <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, or a 11 x 9mm SMD piezo speaker&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The battery holder is an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>. Note that on many button cells the negative terminal is concave, and doesn't make good contact with the pad on the PCB. I therefore recommend melting some solder on the circular PCB contact to provide extra thickness before mounting the battery holder.</p>
<p>The display is held in place with a double-sided self-adhesive foam pad, and then soldered to the board with the seven header pins. There are also four mounting holes if you prefer to use screw mounting. I recommend leaving the display uninstalled until you have tested the rest of the board, because it's likely to be sensitive to overheating.</p>
<p>I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 275°C to solder the small SMD components and push buttons, and then used a conventional soldering iron for the display, battery holder, switch, piezo speaker, and connectors.</p>
<p>The PCB has space for a 5 x 3.2mm 32.768kHz crystal and its capacitors which you could use with the RTC peripheral to provide accurate timekeeping. However, I didn't fit it on the prototype as the internal clock is already pretty accurate.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge program is based on the code for the AVR version of uLisp Version 4.4 (see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?1AA0" target="_blank">Download uLisp</a>), with the addition of routines to handle the display and keyboard, and the plot extensions.</p>
<h4>Display</h4>
<p>The display routine is based on the routine I developed for the display in my project <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?3YB0">Monochrome Low-Power Display Library</a>. The display driver is the ST7302&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref10"><a href="#cite_note10">[10]</a></sup>, and it shares some similarities with the ST7735 used for colour TFT displays. Here's the display layout:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/graphicdisplaylayout6.gif" alt="GraphicDisplayLayout3.gif" width="436" height="198"></p>
<p>The display is divided into 11 lines, each of which is 12 pixels high, and 125 columns, each of which is 2 pixels wide. Note that because 122 isn't an exact multiple of 12, only part of the last line actually appears on the display.</p>
<p>Unlike on the colour TFT displays each pixel isn't individually addressable; in fact, the minimum update is to write three bytes to the display, which defines the state of a block of 2x12 pixels corresponding to one column and one row. Fortunately the display supports reading back the display memory, so it's not necessary to maintain a copy of the display in RAM to do things like line drawing; instead, to set a single pixel we can read the 2x12 block, change one pixel, and write it back.</p>
<h4>Reading from the display</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;routine&nbsp;<strong>ReadBlock()</strong>&nbsp;reads a 12x2 pixel block from the display memory specified by&nbsp;the column, from 0 to 124, and the line, from 0 to 10:</p>
<pre>uint32_t ReadBlock (uint8_t column, uint8_t line) {
  uint32_t pix = 0;
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
  Command2(CASET, 25+line, 25+line);
  Command2(RASET, column, column);
  Command(RAMRD);
  PORT_INPUT(1&lt;&lt;mosi);                     // mosi input
  for (uint8_t i=0; i&lt;25; i++) {
    PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;sck);
    pix = pix&lt;&lt;1 | (PORT_IN&gt;&gt;mosi &amp; 1);
    PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;sck);
  }
  PORT_OUTPUT(1&lt;&lt;mosi);                    // mosi output
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
  return pix;
}</pre>
<p>When reading from display memory you have to do a dummy read, which is why the main loop is executed 25 times rather than 24 times.</p>
<p>The companion routine <strong>PlotBlock()</strong> writes back a 12x2 pixel block to the display memory:</p>
<pre>void PlotBlock (uint32_t block, uint8_t column, uint8_t line) {
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
  Command2(CASET, 25+line, 25+line);
  Command2(RASET, column, column);
  Command(RAMWR); Data(block&gt;&gt;16); Data(block&gt;&gt;8); Data(block);
  PORT_TOGGLE(1&lt;&lt;cs);
}</pre>
<h4>Scrolling</h4>
<p>The display doesn't provide hardware scrolling in the vertical direction, so scrolling is done in software by calling <strong>ScrollDisplay()</strong>, which uses the <strong>ReadBlock()</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>PlotBlock()</strong> routines:</p>
<pre>void ScrollDisplay () {
  uint32_t block, block2;
  for (uint8_t x = 0; x &lt; Columns*3; x++) {
    block = ReadBlock(x, 0);
    for (uint8_t y = 1; y &lt; Lines; y++) {
      block2 = ReadBlock(x, y);
      if (block2 != block) {                   // Optimisation if already the same
        PlotBlock(block2, x, y-1);
        block = block2;
      }
    }
  }
  ClearLine(LastLine);
}</pre>
<p>The routine optimises the scrolling by only writing blocks when necessary if they have been changed by the scrolling.</p>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>The keyboard uses the AVR128DB48's Timer/Counter TCB3 to generate an interrupt at about 250Hz. Each call of the interrupt service routine takes the next column low in the keyboard matrix, and it then tests to see if any of the four row inputs has been pulled low by the pressing of a push button. If so, the button's position is looked up in the key table <strong>Keymap[]</strong> to translate it to the ASCII code of the key. This also takes into account the state of the SHIFT and META keys, which are connected to dedicated inputs.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;keyboard buffer buffers a full screen of text, so you can use the DEL key to delete characters and correct typing mistakes. The line editor includes parenthesis matching which automatically highlights matching brackets in inverse video as you type in a program.</p>
<h3>Installing a bootloader</h3>
<p>To program the Lisp Badge I recommend using Spence Konde's <a href="https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore" target="_blank">DxCore on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is to install a bootloader using a UPDI programmer. I used a SerialUPDI programmer, based on a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter. Because the display is only tolerant of 3.3V you should power the Lisp Badge from 3.3V while programming, or do the programming before connecting the display to the board.</p>
<p>Choose the <strong>AVR DB-series (Optiboot)&nbsp;</strong>option under the&nbsp;<strong>DxCore</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong>&nbsp;option on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (leave other options at their defaults):</p>
<p><strong>Chip: "AVR128DB48"<br>Clock Speed: "24MHz internal"</strong><br> <strong>Bootloader Serial Port (Bootloader burn req'd): "USART0 (default pins): TX PA0, RX PA1"</strong></p>
<p>Set the <strong>Programmer</strong> option as appropriate for the UPDI programmer you are using. Then choose <strong>Burn Bootloader</strong>.</p>
<h3>Uploading the Lisp Badge code</h3>
<p>The next step is to install the Lisp Badge code via the serial connection, using the bootloader you have just installed. Plug a 3.3V FTDI USB-to-serial converter into the FTDI connector on the PCB. I used the SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref11"><a href="#cite_note11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Leave the <strong>DxCore</strong> options set as described above, and choose the USB port from the <strong>Port</strong> submenu. Then choose <strong>Upload</strong> from the <strong>Sketch</strong> menu to upload uLisp.</p>
<p>Note that this stage will fail if you didn't set the <strong>Bootloader Serial Port</strong> correctly in the previous step, and you'll need to go back and repeat that step with the correct setting.</p>
<p>You should then be able to choose <strong>Serial Monitor</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu in the Arduino IDE, and type Lisp commands at the uLisp prompt.</p>

<p><em>War Thunder</em> has leaked restricted military documents&nbsp;<em><span><strong>AGAIN</strong></span></em> for the third time in a month. This time it’s the AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicoptor.</p>
<p>User BarteG98PL posted the “fully unclassified” technical manual for the Apache Longbow on the&nbsp;<em>War Thunder</em> forums.</p><!--?php if(! rcp_user_has_active_membership()): ?-->

<!--?php endif; ?-->
<p><em>War Thunder</em> players are increasingly testing the waters for what “restricted information” means and are posting “unclassified” documents that still have some big caveats.</p>
<p>In the case of the <a href="https://nichegamer.com/war-thunder-player-leaks-restricted-military-documents-again/">Eurofighter Typhoon DA7</a>, the documents were readily available for most consumers but are embargoed to non-NATO countries. The <a href="https://twitter.com/7thRanger/status/1701274530168045751">F-117 Nighthawk</a> was a similar case of documents acquired legally but are restricted under certain circumstances.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1707077710047216095?s=20">posted today</a> that ChatGPT can once more trawl the web for current information, offering answers taken directly from “current and authoritative” sources, which it cites in its responses. The feature, called Browse with Bing, is only open to those with <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1707077713490854127?s=20">Plus and Enterprise subscriptions</a> for now, but the company says it will roll it out “to all users soon.”</p><p>Microsoft’s Bing Chat on Windows, in the Edge browser, and in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/24/23805493/bing-ai-chat-google-chrome-safari">third-party browser plugins</a> could already return live information from the web, and so can Google’s Bard in <a href="https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13275745?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#:~:text=A%20supported%20browser%3A%20Chrome%2C%20Safari,Firefox%2C%20Opera%2C%20or%20Edgium.">Chrome and other browsers</a>. Both also offer links when searching, as ChatGPT’s Browse with Bing feature now does. Meta just announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23889627/meta-connect-quest-3-developer-conference-announcements-news">Meta Connect</a> that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23891128/meta-ai-assistant-characters-whatsapp-instagram-connect">also use Bing to power real-time web results</a> in the Meta AI Assistant it’s adding to WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.</p><p>It’s a little confusing to get ChatGPT to search the web for you. The company provides instructions for the browser version, but I didn’t find the same for the iOS app. I figured it out, though. Assuming you have a subscription, it’s: three dots menu &gt; Settings &gt; New Features &gt; Browse with Bing. Then, start a new chat, tap GPT-4, and “Browse with Bing.” Then your searches should return information from current websites.</p><p>It’s a little slow, but it works. And when it answers a question for you, you can click the link to the site to compare the answers. Now I know that, according to <em>MediaMass</em> — a website I’ve never heard of — AC/DC <a href="https://en.mediamass.net/people/ac-dc/new-album.html">might be working on a new album</a>! Given AI bots’ tendency to hallucinate, being able to check them on their sources is a huge improvement that not only means you can actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23741996/openai-chatgpt-false-information-misinformation-responsibility">verify they’re not lying to you</a>, but also, it’s just nice to give credit where it’s due. </p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A screenshot of a ChatGPT transcript." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/376x352/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/384x360/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/415x389/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/480x450/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/540x506/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/640x600/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/750x703/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/828x776/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/1080x1012/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/1200x1125/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/1440x1350/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/1920x1800/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/2048x1920/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/2400x2250/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1166x1093/2400x2250/filters:focal(583x547:584x548):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24957310/IMG_8CA945372C16_1.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>AC/DC may or may not be working on a new album, according to sources cited by ChatGPT.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Wes Davis / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>OpenAI added the ability to browse the internet within its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23776006/chatgpt-ios-app-bing-search">ChatGPT iOS app in late June</a> but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/4/23783572/openai-has-already-disabled-browse-with-bing-in-chatgpt">quickly pulled it</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

            <p>Engineers at MIT and in China are aiming to turn seawater into drinking water with a completely passive device that is inspired by the ocean, and powered by the sun.</p>

<p>In a paper appearing today in the journal <em>Joule,</em> the team outlines the design for a new solar desalination system that takes in saltwater and heats it with natural sunlight.</p>

<p>The configuration of the device allows water to circulate in swirling eddies, in a manner similar to the much larger “thermohaline” circulation of the ocean. This circulation, combined with the sun’s heat, drives water to evaporate, leaving salt behind. The resulting water vapor can then be condensed and collected as pure, drinkable water. In the meantime, the leftover salt continues to circulate through and out of the device, rather than accumulating and clogging the system.</p>

<p>The new system has a higher water-production rate and a higher salt-rejection rate than all other passive solar desalination concepts currently being tested.</p>

<p>The researchers estimate that if the system is scaled up to the size of a small suitcase, it could produce about 4 to 6 liters of drinking water per hour and last several years before requiring replacement parts. At this scale and performance, the system could produce drinking water at a rate and price that is cheaper than tap water.</p>

<p>“For the first time, it is possible for water, produced by sunlight, to be even cheaper than tap water,” says Lenan Zhang, a research scientist in MIT’s Device Research Laboratory.</p>

<p>The team envisions a scaled-up device could passively produce enough drinking water to meet the daily requirements of a small family. The system could also supply off-grid, coastal communities where seawater is easily accessible.</p>

<p>Zhang’s study co-authors include MIT graduate student Yang Zhong and Evelyn Wang, the Ford Professor of Engineering, along with Jintong Gao, Jinfang You, Zhanyu Ye, Ruzhu Wang, and Zhenyuan Xu of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.</p>

<p><strong>A powerful convection</strong></p>

<p>The team’s new system improves on their <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/passive-solar-powered-water-desalination-0207" target="_blank">previous design</a> — a similar concept of multiple layers, called stages. Each stage contained an evaporator and a condenser that used heat from the sun to passively separate salt from incoming water. That design, which the team tested on the roof of an MIT building, efficiently converted the sun’s energy to evaporate water, which was then condensed into drinkable water. But the salt that was left over quickly accumulated as crystals that clogged the system after a few days. In a real-world setting, a user would have to place stages on a frequent basis, which would significantly increase the system’s overall cost.</p>

<p>In a follow-up effort, they <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/solar-desalination-system-inexpensive-0214" target="_blank">devised a solution</a> with a similar layered configuration, this time with an added feature that helped to circulate the incoming water as well as any leftover salt. While this design prevented salt from settling and accumulating on the device, it desalinated water at a relatively low rate.</p>

<p>In the latest iteration, the team believes it has landed on a design that achieves both a high water-production rate, and high salt rejection, meaning that the system can quickly and reliably produce drinking water for an extended period. The key to their new design is a combination of their two previous concepts: a multistage system of evaporators and condensers, that is also configured to boost the circulation of water — and salt — within each stage.</p>

<p>“We introduce now an even more powerful convection, that is similar to what we typically see in the ocean, at kilometer-long scales,” Xu says.</p>

<p>The small circulations generated in the team’s new system is similar to the “thermohaline” convection in the ocean — a phenomenon that drives the movement of water around the world, based on differences in sea temperature (“thermo”) and salinity (“haline”).</p>

<p>“When seawater is exposed to air, sunlight drives water to evaporate. Once water leaves the surface, salt remains. And the higher the salt concentration, the denser the liquid, and this heavier water wants to flow downward,” Zhang explains. “By mimicking this kilometer-wide phenomena in small box, we can take advantage of this feature to reject salt.”</p>

<p><strong>Tapping out</strong></p>

<p>The heart of the team’s new design is a single stage that resembles a thin box, topped with a dark material that efficiently absorbs the heat of the sun. Inside, the box is separated into a top and bottom section. Water can flow through the top half, where the ceiling is lined with an evaporator layer that uses the sun’s heat to warm up and evaporate any water in direct contact. The water vapor is then funneled to the bottom half of the box, where a condensing layer air-cools the vapor into salt-free, drinkable liquid. The researchers set the entire box at a tilt within a larger, empty vessel, then attached a tube from the top half of the box down through the bottom of the vessel, and floated the vessel in saltwater.</p>

<p>In this configuration, water can naturally push up through the tube and into the box, where the tilt of the box, combined with the thermal energy from the sun, induces the water to swirl as it flows through. The small eddies help to bring water in contact with the upper evaporating layer while keeping salt circulating, rather than settling and clogging.</p>

<p>The team built several prototypes, with one, three, and 10 stages, and tested their performance in water of varying salinity, including natural seawater and water that was seven times saltier.</p>

<p>From these tests, the researchers calculated that if each stage were scaled up to a square meter, it would produce up to 5 liters of drinking water per hour, and that the system could desalinate water without accumulating salt for several years. Given this extended lifetime, and the fact that the system is entirely passive, requiring no electricity to run, the team estimates that the overall cost of running the system would be cheaper than what it costs to produce tap water in the United States.</p>

<p>“We show that this device is capable of achieving a long lifetime,” Zhong says. “That means that, for the first time, it is possible for drinking water produced by sunlight to be cheaper than tap water. This opens up the possibility for solar desalination to address real-world problems.”</p>

<p>“This is a very innovative approach that effectively mitigates key challenges in the field of desalination,” says Guihua Yu, who develops sustainable water and energy storage systems at the University of Texas at Austin, and was not involved in the research. “The design is particularly beneficial for regions struggling with high-salinity water. Its modular design makes it highly suitable for household water production, allowing for scalability and adaptability to meet individual needs.”</p>

<p>Funding for the research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>But we wanted to make the technology available more broadly. This is where Llama 2 came in.</p></div><div><p>As our history shows, we believe deeply in the power of the open source community. We believe that state-of-the-art AI technology is safer and better aligned when it’s open and accessible to everyone.</p><p>Additionally, where there are areas of high entropy, it’s advantageous to build bridges and leverage the innovation that inevitably arises. This was true for PyTorch, where breakthroughs like Stable Diffusion, GPT 3, and GPT 4 continually disrupted the world of AI, and it’s true for Llama as well. For us at Meta, we can summarize the value back along three axes:</p><p><u>Research:</u> New techniques, performance optimizations, tools, and evaluation methods, including work on safety, provide Meta leverage from the research community to more quickly incorporate learnings. Many of these communities are also nascent, and collaborating in the open makes it much easier to make progress;</p><p><u>Enterprise and commercialization:</u> The more enterprises and startups build on our technology, the more we can learn about use cases, safe model deployment, and potential opportunities; and</p><p><u>Developer ecosystem:</u> LLMs have fundamentally changed AI development, and new tools and approaches are emerging daily for manipulating, managing, and evaluating models. Having a lingua franca to the community enables us to quickly leverage these technologies, accelerating our internal stack.</p><p>But this isn’t new for Meta. Just as with <a href="http://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>PyTorch</u></a> and dozens of other publicly released or open source projects, this philosophy is deeply ingrained in our company’s DNA.</p></div><div><p>One thing is for certain: The generative AI space moves rapidly, and we’re all learning together about the capabilities and applications of this technology. Meta remains committed to an open approach for today’s AI. Here are a few of the areas of focus for us as we continue on this journey together:</p><p><u>Multimodal:</u> Just as the world isn’t made up entirely of text, AI can embrace new modalities to enable even more immersive generative experiences;</p><p><u>Safety and responsibility:</u> Generative AI has revitalized the world of responsible AI. We will place even greater emphasis on safety and responsibility, developing new tools, building partnerships, and utilizing Llama as a vehicle for our community to continue to learn about how to build safely and responsibly; and</p><p><u>A focus on community:</u> Much like PyTorch, we see this as a community of developers that have a voice, and we want to give them agency and a vehicle to further their innovation. We aim to provide new ways for the community to showcase work, contribute, and tell their stories.</p></div><div><p>During the <a href="https://www.metaconnect.com/en/home" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Meta Connect</u></a> keynote, we talked a lot about our Llama models and the future of open access.

<p dir="auto">Open exchange format for user data between Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-motivation" dir="auto"><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The DAWproject format provides a (vendor-agnostic) way of transferring user data between different music applications (DAWs).</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, there is no file-format which is purpose-built for this task.
Standard MIDI files can represent note data, but it is often a lower-level representation (no ramps) of data than what the DAW uses internally, which forces consolidation on export. AAF only covers audio and doesn't have any concept of musical-time, which limits it to post-audio workflows . Most plug-ins do allow you to save presets to a shared location, but this has to be done for each instance. What most users end up doing is just exporting audio as stems.</p>
<p dir="auto">The aim of this project is to export all translatable project data (audio/note/automation/plug-in) along with the structure surrounding it into a single DAWproject file.</p>
<p dir="auto">The table below aims to explain the scope format from a music-production perspective and how it compares to other methods of data transfer.</p>

<p dir="auto">DAWproject is based on plain XML/ZIP and can be used with any programming language that can parse those.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DOM of DAWproject is defined by a set of Java classes which have XML-related annotations and HTML-induced Javadoc comments.
Those are used (via reflection) to generate XML Documentation and Schemas. Potentially, the same approach could be used to generate code for other languages (contributions welcome).</p>

<p dir="auto">The exporting application is free to structure tracks and timelines in a way that fits its internal model.
The choice is left to the importing application to either use the level of structure provided (if applicable) or to flatten/convert it to match its model.</p>
<p dir="auto">As an example, here's the project.xml of a simple file saved in Bitwig Studio 5.0 with one instrument track and one audio track. As the audio clips in Bitwig Studio are themselves a timeline of audio events, you will notice that there are two levels of  elements, id25 representing the clip timeline on the arrangement, and id26 representing the  audio events inside the clip.</p>

<p>Earthworms are important drivers of global food production, contributing to approximately 6.5% of grain yield and 2.3% of legumes produced worldwide each year, according to new work published by Colorado State University scientists in the journal <i>Nature Communications. </i>

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>These new estimates from a trio of CSU researchers mean <a href="https://phys.org/tags/earthworms/" rel="tag">earthworms</a> may account for as much as 140 million metric tons of food produced annually—roughly comparative to the amount of cereal grains (rice, wheat, rye, oats, barley, maize and millet) grown annually by Russia, the world's fourth-largest producer.
</p><p>"This is the first effort that I'm aware of that's trying to take one piece of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/soil+biodiversity/" rel="tag">soil biodiversity</a> and say, 'OK, this is the value of it; this is what it's giving us on a global scale,'" said Steven Fonte, associate professor of agroecosystem ecology in the Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at CSU, and the study's lead author.
</p><p>Earthworms help establish healthy soils by supporting <a href="https://phys.org/tags/plant+growth/" rel="tag">plant growth</a> in multiple ways—building good soil structure, assisting in water capture and aiding in the beneficial churn of organic matter that makes nutrients more available to plants. Other research has also shown that earthworms can facilitate the production of plant-growth-promoting hormones and help plants protect themselves against common soil pathogens. Some estimates have indicated earthworms can increase overall plant productivity by about 25%.
</p><p>Fonte and his colleagues—Nathan Mueller, an associate professor in the Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, and Marian Hsieh, a doctoral student in the same department—estimated the contribution of earthworms to global food production by overlaying and analyzing maps of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/earthworm/" rel="tag">earthworm</a> abundance, soil properties, fertilize rate and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/crop+yields/" rel="tag">crop yields</a>.
</p><p>The analysis indicated that earthworms had a more significant impact on <a href="https://phys.org/tags/grain+production/" rel="tag">grain production</a> in the global south—notably, 10% of grain yield in Sub-Saharan Africa and 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
</p><p>It's likely the earthworms contributed more in those areas, Fonte said, because farmers there tend to have less access to fertilizer and pesticides. Instead, they rely more on earthworm-rich organic matter like manure and crop residues, which help stimulate the beneficial effect earthworms have on plants.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>"Earthworms are contributing a lot in these areas where we have fewer chemical inputs," Fonte said.
</p><p>For this study, Fonte and his colleagues analyzed earthworm impacts on four grain crops: rice, maize, wheat and barley; the group examined a set of legumes that included soybeans, peas, chickpeas, lentils and alfalfa, among others.

<p>Fonte said he thinks soil biodiversity has historically been undervalued, and that he hopes this work will bring more attention to how healthy soils can have positive, tangible impacts on crops.
</p><p>"If we manage our soils in a more sustainable way, we can better harness or leverage this biodiversity and produce more sustainable agroecosystems," Fonte said. "This work highlights that potential."
</p><p>Fonte noted that other recent research has shown that soils contain as much as half the world's biodiversity, a significant increase from previous estimates of approximately 25%. "Soils are just such an intricate habitat," he said. "But there's really been very few efforts to understand what that biodiversity means to our global crop yields."
</p><p>Diana Wall, a professor in the Department of Biology and the science chair of the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative, was excited by the data published in the <i>Nature Communications</i> paper. "This, to me, is a really clever, very data-rich paper," Wall said. "It's really impressive."
</p><p>This information could also have implications in future efforts to mitigate drought and erosion, Fonte said. For example, he said, earthworms can improve soil porosity, aiding in the beneficial capture and retention of water.
</p><p>Fonte cautioned that he and his colleagues are not advocating for anyone to transplant earthworms into places they do not already exist. Rather, he hopes this work shows how improved management of soil biology in places where earthworms already call home has the potential to enhance agricultural productivity and reduce our reliance on agrochemicals.
</p><p>This study marks an important first step, Fonte said, but he hopes that researchers will continue to dig into the positive benefits that other soil organisms have on crops.
</p><p>"Soils are still this huge, big black box that we don't fully understand," Fonte said. "This work helps show that there's a lot of opportunity that we're just kind of ignoring."
</p><p>He added, "There are probably other <a href="https://phys.org/tags/soil/" rel="tag">soil</a> organisms that are even more important, especially microbial communities."
