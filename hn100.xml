Unfortunately this is a blog post so you’ll have to use your imagination.</p><p id="121d">Nebula is a video on demand streaming service focusing primarily on educational content. Unlike other streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube, Nebula is distinct in that it was built by content creators. So surely the title of this post is a silly question then, right? Nebula is owned by the content creators. They say so themselves in all their videos.</p><p id="a181">I wasn’t so sure though. I never could pinpoint why, but the “creator owned” narrative at the forefront of all their promotional material just felt too good to be true. I’ve spent most of my career working in the venture capital funded tech industry, and based on that experience my gut told me Nebula was just like all those other tech companies and was only masquerading as a co-op. Up until recently I ignored that feeling assuming it was just me being overly cynical, but then I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/mXoZWCdaD5E?feature=shared" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this Philosophy Tube video</a> announcing Abigail Thorn’s upcoming movie. Much of that video was spent discussing the structure of Nebula and it seemed to confirm something I had previously assumed wasn’t true: that the creators own 50% of Nebula.</p><p id="0b5e">I’ve seen various sources report that Nebula is owned 50% by a company called Standard Broadcast, and 50% by the creators on the platform. I could never find a first hand source for this information though and thought it was a misunderstanding of some very carefully crafted answers on the company’s FAQ page.</p><blockquote><p id="193c"><strong>How do the creators get paid?</strong></p><p id="3720">Nebula profit is divided 50/50 between the creators and Standard. The creator pool is paid out based on watch time.</p><p id="bdab"><strong>Who owns Nebula?</strong></p><p id="fd9a">Nebula is owned and operated by Standard and the creators, with Curiosity Inc (CuriosityStream) holding a minority stake and a board seat. There are no plans to bring in additional investment.</p></blockquote><p id="092b">The first answer indicates that there is a 50/50 profit share. This means that the content creators on the platform get to take half of the profit that Nebula makes, but that doesn’t tell us anything about how much of the platform the creators actually own.</p><p id="c01f">The second answer <em>is</em> about ownership but is much more vague. It doesn’t specify who owns what percent, and includes a the extra verb “operated” which makes things more unclear. It could be that both ownership and operation are shared between Standard and the creators, but one could also interpret that to mean that Standard owns and the creators operate. What I can say is that it’s mathematically impossible to have a 50/50 split between three parties, and there are three parties listed. This is no big deal though. Nebula never claimed there was a 50% ownership split. That claim was just some unaffiliated people on the internet misinterpreting the FAQ.</p><p id="c05e">But then I watched that Philosophy Tube video. It began with the familiar rhetoric of “Nebula is owned by the creators who are on it”. But there was more. “50% of the equity in Nebula is distributed between the creators”. This was the first time I had heard a Nebula creator say the number 50% referring to ownership. “The other 50% is owned by the parent company, an agency called Standard”. At this point the math really wasn’t adding up. A parent company by definition owns more than 50% of a subsidiary, that’s what makes it a “parent”. Also a 50/50 split would mean there’s no percentage left over for Curiosity Stream. But then there’s the real kicker: “When you’ve been on Nebula for a certain amount of time you get the option to buy a piece of the parent company. Standard actually invented an entirely new kind of cooperative corporate governance to make this happen”.</p><p id="3db8">The fact that there’s interest in buying into Standard seems to indicate there’s something lacking about the ownership you get from just being a Nebula creator, but what really sets off the alarm bells for me is the “entirely new kind of cooperative corporate governance”. If you want to have a creator-owned cooperative you can just do that. There’s nothing novel about co-ops. So why not just do that?</p><p id="b833">My intuition after watching this video was that Standard Broadcast, which is owned by a small subset of Nebula creators, actually owned the vast majority of Nebula. I suspected the options were offered as a way for the most successful creators (that is to say the ones with the most money) to buy their way into the organization that actually holds all the cards. Intuition is often wrong though so I decided I needed to do some actual investigation.</p><h2 id="bc40">The Wendover Documentary</h2><p id="6b1e">The first source I found when looking for more information was a video from Wendover Productions, a YouTube/Nebula channel created by Sam Denby. I thought this would be a good place to start because Denby is one of the original content creators on Nebula, and as I was about to learn one of the owners of Standard Broadcast.</p><p id="eb38"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alqt6RCEWdM" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Inside Story of Nebula</a> is an interesting “documentary” (propaganda piece might be more accurate) chronicling the rise of Nebula. It has all the hallmarks you’d expect to find in a tech company marketing pitch. There’s an absurd and unsubstantiated valuation of $150 million dollars, talk of infinite growth, the “minimum viable product” model, and even an enlarging pie analogy.</p><p id="1d72">More interesting to me though was how carefully phrased the information about profits and sharing was. “So, through complex financial and legal wizardry, we developed a system where 50% of Nebula profits were distributed to the creators, including crucially, if the platform were ever to be sold”. This clarifies that creators get 50% of the profit as well as 50% of the proceeds from a sale of the company, but very specifically doesn’t mention ownership. Do they get paid 50% because they own 50%? Do they own less than that but get 50% through some other mechanism such as liquidation preference? Is there just some contract that says the company owes them money in the event of a sale?</p><p id="d56e">The ownership structure of Standard Broadcast is described with slightly less ambiguity. The company was initially founded by Dave Wiskus, CGP Grey, and Philip Dettmer, but Gray and Dettmer later sold their stake in the company to five other creators. So at that point ownership of Standard was split between six individuals:</p><ul><li id="9fef">Dave Wiskus</li><li id="02dc">Brian McManus (Real Engineering)</li><li id="efde">Alex (LowSpecGamer)</li><li id="e590">Devin Stone (Legal Eagle)</li><li id="df8f">Thomas Frank</li><li id="0081">Sam Denby (Wendover Productions)</li></ul><p id="d093">As I mentioned previously, some ownership of Standard has since been offered to other creators through stock options, but it’s unclear how much or what type of stock those options represent.</p><p id="1dc1">The firsthand information about Nebula and Standard Broadcast was turning out to be less useful than I had hoped, but the documentary did provide one valuable lead: the investment from Curiosity Stream. “While the exact numbers are not public, what is is that they bought a significant minority stake that valued Nebula, the company that did not exist just three years prior, at over $50 million.” That’s a little vague, but an investment and a valuation number was something I could start to do math with.</p><p id="c870">Whenever a company makes shares available for purchase, they have to file that information with the SEC through what’s called a Form D notice. Watch Nebula LLC has only ever made <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1881238/000188123821000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">one Form D filing</a> so it’s not hard to find the investment. Nebula sold precisely $6 million worth of shares, so if we take $50 million as a lower bound for the valuation we can calculate the upper bound of what Curiosity Stream owns. $6 million is 12% of $50 million, so Curiosity Stream could own as much as 12% of Nebula. There’s also another $6.5 million that was authorized but not sold (at least at the time the Form D was filed).</p><h2 id="d4dc">The Reddit AMA</h2><p id="2ef1">Following the announcement that Nebula was taking investment from Curiosity Stream, Standard Broadcast’s CEO did an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/watchnebula/comments/pj0cyw/nebula_has_taken_investment_from_curiositystream/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AMA on Reddit</a>. I figured this would be a good place to look for more info about that investment, especially since the answers came straight from the top.</p><p id="0027">One user was curious about the leverage Curiosity Stream would have over the platform.</p><figure><figcaption>Reddit exchange between Oddtail and dwiskus, transcribed below</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="a807"><strong>Oddtail</strong>: What, if any, leverage CS has over Nebula and how it operates? If none, what does CS get in return for the investment?</p><p id="7b83"><strong>dwiskus</strong>: CS gets a board seat and a percentage of ownership, meaning a cut of future profits. They get a vote on things like budget approval, but operational and creative control remains with us. Practically speaking CS is well-aware of our plans, and how our plans will significantly benefit them. They aren’t interested in changing our course or slowing us down even if they could. Quite the opposite.</p><p id="d011"><strong>__law</strong>: can we know what % cs own? And who are the other owners of the company?</p><p id="4cdc"><strong>dwiskus</strong>: Percentages weren’t disclosed, but it’s a minority stake. There are no other investors.</p></blockquote><p id="a44c">This confirms that Curiosity Stream does own a portion of Nebula (which is undeniable based on the Form D filing I talked about before), but it also adds that they get a single board seat out of the deal. Furthermore, and possibly more importantly, this confirms that the board controls the budget.</p><p id="3b9f">Another user wanted to know about the relationship between Standard and Nebula.</p><figure><figcaption>Reddit exchange between PatrickStirling and dwiskus, transcribed below</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="7a04"><strong>PatrickStirling</strong>: are Nebula and Standard completely separate entities? or is one technically under the other?</p><p id="f1a6"><strong>dwiskus</strong>: Nebula is a subsidiary. Standard holds the majority of Nebula LLC equity.</p></blockquote><p id="4447">If we assume that words mean things (specifically the word majority in this case), this confirms my earlier suspicion that Standard owns more than 50% of Nebula.</p><p id="ace8">Another user seemed to be connecting some of the same dots I was and started asking questions about dilution. In case you’re unfamiliar with dilution, when companies take investment they typically do so by issuing new shares for the investor to purchase. This means the total number of shares increases, thus lowering the value of any existing shares as a percent of the total.</p><figure><figcaption>Reddit exchange between yolomatic_swagmaster, dwiskus, and gurgelblaster, transcribed below</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p id="532d"><strong>yolomatic_swagmaster</strong>: How does Curiosity Stream’s investment affect the other creators in terms of them being part-owners? I’m not super clear on how that works anyway. but wondering if anything changes for their set up.</p><p id="ae0c"><strong>dwiskus</strong>: Complicated question, but in short: creators still have full control and have lost no equity value.</p><p id="f0d7"><strong>gurgelblaster</strong>: …but the equity <em>share</em> is lower?</p><p id="f12f"><strong>dwiskus</strong>: Nope! Like I said, it’s complicated.</p></blockquote><p id="241a">And once again we have a contradiction. We added new shares but nobody lost equity. How is that possible? “It’s complicated”.</p><h2 id="716a">Some Actual Answers</h2><p id="8a25">At this point I’d grown tired of non-answers. I’m not ok with impossible equity numbers being hand waved away as “a new kind of corporate governance”, “financial and legal wizardry”, or just simply “complicated”. These are not the kind of answers people who are being entirely truthful give.</p><p id="5283">Luckily there was one other place I could think to look for hard numbers. The Wendover documentary may have claimed that “the exact numbers aren’t public”, but that’s only partially true. Nebula is a private company, and as such only has to file the unfortunately sparse Form D when offering stock. Curiosity Stream, on the other hand, is publicly traded and has to make much more detailed quarterly filings about all their financials. This includes their investments.</p><p id="392f">So what does <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001776909/700b53ed-0101-4c70-96d5-a67734e7f50d.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Curiosity Stream’s SEC filing</a> say about the Nebula investment?</p><blockquote><p id="a6f2"><strong>Watch Nebula LLC (“Nebula”)</strong></p><p id="1b0a">On August 23, 2021, the Company purchased a 12% ownership interest in Watch Nebula LLC for $6,000. Nebula is an SVOD technology platform built for and by a group of content creators. The Company is committed to purchasing an additional 13% ownership interest through eight quarterly payments of $813, which after each payment, the Company will obtain an additional 1.625% of equity ownership interests. Prior to the Company’s investment, Nebula was a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of Standard Broadcast LLC (“Standard”). The Company obtained 25% of the representation on Nebula’s Board of Directors, providing the Company with significant influence, but not a controlling interest.</p></blockquote><p id="ebbe">So let’s go down the list of what we can learn from this:</p><ul><li id="87bc">The initial $6 million was for 12% ownership</li><li id="61b5">They had offered enough stock for a potential ownership of 25%. (that’s the additional 6.5 million from the Form D)</li><li id="dd00">Standard Broadcast owned 100% of Nebula prior to this investment</li><li id="b708">Curiosity Stream controls 25% of Nebula’s board</li></ul><p id="076b">From this we can infer:</p><ul><li id="69e1">Nebula was valued at <em>exactly</em> $50 million, not over</li><li id="68bd">Nebula has 4 board members</li><li id="170d">The creators directly own 0% of Nebula</li></ul><p id="e853">As a side note, if they want to say owning part of Standard Broadcast means you own part of Nebula, then owning part of Curiosity Stream also means you own part of Nebula. Since Curiosity Stream is partly owned but venture capitalists, that would mean that Nebula has in fact taken VC investment. They don’t get to have that cake and eat it too.</p><h2 id="04ff">How Can 0% Be Right?</h2><p id="f017">At this point I got frustrated and typed something like “Nebula creators don’t own any of the company” into Google. This was mostly just me shouting into the void. I didn’t expect to get good results from a query like that, but somehow those turned out to be the magic words that returned the one firsthand source I hadn’t found yet.</p><p id="91d4">It turns out the answer can be found in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23076663/nebula-youtube-creator-business-future-startup-ceo-dave-wiskus" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">an episode of the Decoder podcast</a>. After all that time I spent digging through cagey answers and SEC filings, it turns out Dave Wiskus just straight up tells us (assuming you know what to listen for). It also turns out that the reality is neither novel nor particularly complicated.</p><blockquote><p id="98d4">There is also a structure in place that if Nebula is ever sold, 50 percent of the proceeds go to the creators as a pool. It is a form of what is called shadow equity.</p></blockquote><p id="39d6">Shadow Equity (sometimes called Phantom Stock) isn’t real stock. It’s basically just an IOU that’s worth the same dollar value as the actual stock. The creators will get paid 50% of the proceeds in the event the company sells, but legally they don’t actually own any of the company.</p><h2 id="6795">The Final Tally</h2><p id="4e4b">So what does that leave us with? Who actually owns Nebula? After looking through <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001776909/fac6815d-9eae-4e0a-8736-c4e95b4fc4a0.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a more recent SEC filing</a> to figure out how many of those subsequent stock purchases Curiosity Stream actually made we’re left with the following final numbers:</p><ul><li id="d05c">83.125% Standard Broadcast</li><li id="4d60">16.875% Curiosity Stream</li><li id="18c1">0% The Creators (Directly)</li></ul><h2 id="d658">Conclusion</h2><p id="27d1">Unfortunately, without access to one of their contracts, we can’t know for sure what power the broader group of creators actually has. It’s possible that the terms are so favorable for creators that their shadow equity is as good as actual ownership. It’s equally possible, however, that the system was set up in order to keep any meaningful power away from the creators. If the creators don’t control the board then creators don’t control the budget, which means they don’t control the platform. While some creators may have the means to buy into the stock options offered by Standard Broadcast, that only serves to create a class hierarchy divided by wealth. Even if the contract terms are stellar, that’s still a system that completely undermines the progressive values of the creators who make the platform great.</p><p id="8106">Nebula is trading on the idea that it’s a creator owned platform and isn’t like those other tech companies that take VC funding. They utilize the language of cooperatives in order to craft an image that appeals to their left leaning audience, but it appears actual ownership lies primarily in the hands of six (mostly white) men. When you pull away the progressive veneer it turns out Nebula probably <em>is</em> just another tech company. While they may be operating in the best interests of the creators for the moment, I wouldn’t be surprised if that doesn’t continue forever.</p></div></div>]]></description>

</div><p>In 2023, AWS released multiple assembly-level implementations of x/Ed25519 in AWS-LC. By combining <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/automated-reasoning" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">automated reasoning</a> and state-of-the-art optimization techniques, these implementations improved performance over the existing AWS-LC implementations and also increased assurance of their correctness.</p><p>In particular, we prove functional correctness using automated reasoning and employ optimizations targeted to specific CPU microarchitectures for the instruction set architectures x86_64 and Arm64. We also do our best to execute the algorithms in <i>constant time</i>, to thwart side-channel attacks that infer secret information from the durations of computations.</p><p>In this post, we explore different aspects of our work, including the process for proving correctness via automated reasoning, microarchitecture (<i>μ</i>arch) optimization techniques, the special considerations for constant-time code, and the quantification of performance gains.<br></p><h2><p>Elliptic-curve cryptography</p></h2><p>Elliptic-curve cryptography is a method for doing public-key cryptography, which uses a pair of keys, one public and one private. One of the best-known public-key cryptographic schemes is RSA, in which the public key is a very large integer, and the corresponding private key is prime factors of the integer. The RSA scheme can be used both to encrypt/decrypt data and also to sign/verify data. (Members of our team recently blogged on Amazon Science about how we used automated reasoning to make the RSA implementation on Amazon’s Graviton2 chips <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/formal-verification-makes-rsa-faster-and-faster-to-deploy" data-cms-ai="0">faster and easier to deploy</a>.)</p><div data-align-right-narrow=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>Example of an elliptic curve.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>Elliptic curves offer an alternate way to mathematically relate public and private keys; sometimes, this means we can implement schemes more efficiently. While the mathematical theory of elliptic curves is both broad and deep, the elliptic curves used in cryptography are typically defined by an equation of the form <i>y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c</i>, where <i>a, b,</i> and <i>c</i> are constants. You can plot the points that satisfy the equation on a 2-D graph.</p><p>An elliptic curve has the property that a line that intersects it at two points intersects it at at most one other point. This property is used to define operations on the curve. For instance, the addition of two points on the curve can be defined not, indeed, as the third point on the curve collinear with the first two but as that third point’s reflection around the axis of symmetry.</p><div data-align-center=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>Addition on an elliptic curve.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>Now, if the coordinates of points on the curve are taken modulo some integer, the curve becomes a scatter of points in the plane, but a scatter that still exhibits symmetry, so the addition operation remains well defined. Curve25519 is named after a large prime integer — specifically, 2<sup>255</sup> – 19. The set of numbers modulo the curve25519 prime, together with basic arithmetic operations such as multiplication of two numbers modulo the same prime, define the <i>field </i>in which our elliptic-curve operations take place.</p><p>Successive execution of elliptic-curve additions is called scalar multiplication, where the scalar is the number of additions. With the elliptic curves used in cryptography, if you know only the result of the scalar multiplication, it is intractable to recover the scalar, if the scalar is sufficiently large. The result of the scalar multiplication becomes the basis of a public key, the original scalar the basis of a private key.<br></p><h2><p>The x25519 and Ed25519 cryptographic algorithms</p></h2><p>The x/Ed25519 algorithms have distinct purposes. The x25519 algorithm is a key agreement algorithm, used to securely establish a shared secret between two peers; Ed25519 is a digital-signature algorithm, used to sign and verify data.</p><p>The x/Ed25519 algorithms have been adopted in transport layer protocols such as TLS and SSH. In 2023, NIST announced an update to its FIPS185-6 Digital Signature Standard that included the addition of Ed25519. The x25519 algorithm also plays a role in post-quantum safe cryptographic solutions, having been included as the classical algorithm in the TLS 1.3 and SSH hybrid scheme specifications for post-quantum key agreement.<br></p><h2><p>Microarchitecture optimizations</p></h2><p>When we write assembly code for a specific CPU architecture, we use its instruction set architecture (ISA). The ISA defines resources such as the available assembly instructions, their semantics, and the CPU registers accessible to the programmer. Importantly, the ISA defines the CPU in abstract terms; it doesn’t specify how the CPU should be realized in hardware.</p><div data-align-left-rail=""><ps-related-content>

</div><p>The detailed implementation of the CPU is called the microarchitecture, and every <i>μ</i>arch has unique characteristics. For example, while the AWS Graviton 2 CPU and AWS Graviton 3 CPU are both based on the Arm64 ISA, their <i>μ</i>arch implementations are different. We hypothesized that if we could take advantage of the <i>μ</i>arch differences, we could create x/Ed25519 implementations that were even faster than the existing implementations in AWS-LC. It turns out that this intuition was correct.</p><p>Let us look closer at how we took advantage of <i>μ</i>arch differences. Different arithmetic operations can be defined on curve25519, and different combinations of those operations are used to construct the x/Ed25519 algorithms. Logically, the necessary arithmetic operations can be considered at three levels:<br></p><ol><li><b>Field operations:</b> Operations within the field defined by the curve25519 prime 2<sup>255</sup> – 19.</li><li><b>Elliptic-curve group operations:</b> Operations that apply to elements of the curve itself, such as the addition of two points, P1 and P2.</li><li><b>Top-level operations:</b> Operations implemented by iterative application of elliptic-curve group operations, such as scalar multiplication.</li></ol><div data-align-center-expanded=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>Examples of operations at different levels. Arrows indicate dependency relationships between levels.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>Each level has its own avenues for optimization. We focused our <i>μ</i>arch-dependent optimizations on the level-one operations, while for levels two and three our implementations employ known state-of-the-art techniques and are largely the same for different <i>μ</i>archs. Below, we give a summary of the different <i>μ</i>arch-dependent choices we made in our implementations of x/Ed25519.<br></p><ul><li>For modern x86_64 <i>μ</i>archs, we use the instructions MULX, ADCX, and ADOX, which are variations of the standard assembly instructions MUL (multiply) and ADC (add with carry) found in the instruction set extensions commonly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_Bit_manipulation_instruction_set" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">BMI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_ADX" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">ADX</a>. These instructions are special because, when used in combination, they can maintain two carry chains in parallel, which has been observed to boost performance up to 30%. For older x86_64 <i>μ</i>archs that don’t support the instruction set extensions, we use more traditional single-carry chains.<br></li><li>For Arm64 <i>μ</i>archs, such as AWS Graviton 3 with improved integer multipliers, we use relatively straightforward schoolbook multiplication, which turns out to give good performance. AWS Graviton 2 has smaller multipliers. For this Arm64 <i>μ</i>arch, we use subtractive forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Karatsuba multiplication</a>, which breaks down multiplications recursively. The reason is that, on these <i>μ</i>archs, 64x64-bit multiplication producing a 128-bit result has substantially lower throughput relative to other operations, making the number size at which Karatsuba optimization becomes worthwhile much smaller.</li></ul><p>We also optimized level-one operations that are the same for all <i>μ</i>archs. One example concerns the use of the binary greatest-common-divisor (GCD) algorithm to compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">modular inverses</a>. We use the <a href="https://gcd.cr.yp.to/safegcd-20190413.pdf" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">“divstep” form of binary GCD</a>, which lends itself to efficient implementation, but it also complicates the second goal we had: formally proving correctness.</p><div data-align-right-rail=""><ps-related-content>

</div><p>Binary GCD is an iterative algorithm with two arguments, whose initial values are the numbers whose greatest common divisor we seek. The arguments are successively reduced in a well-defined way, until the value of one of them reaches zero. With two <i>n</i>-bit numbers, the standard implementation of the algorithm removes at least one bit total per iteration, so 2<i>n</i> iterations suffice.</p><p>With divstep, however, determining the number of iterations needed to get down to the base case seems analytically difficult. The most tractable proof of the bound uses an elaborate inductive argument based on an intricate “stable hull” provably overapproximating the region in two-dimensional space containing the points corresponding to the argument values. Daniel Bernstein, one of the inventors of x25519 and Ed25519, proved the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#pwccp" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">formal correctness</a> of the bound using <a href="https://hol-light.github.io/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">HOL Light</a>, a proof assistant that one of us (John) created. (For more on HOL Light, see, again, our earlier <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/formal-verification-makes-rsa-faster-and-faster-to-deploy" data-cms-ai="0">RSA post</a>.)<br></p><h2><p>Performance results</p></h2><p>In this section, we will highlight improvements in performance. For the sake of simplicity, we focus on only three <i>μ</i>archs: AWS Graviton 3, AWS Graviton 2, and Intel Ice Lake. To gather performance data, we used EC2 instances with matching CPU <i>μ</i>archs — c6g.4xlarge, c7g.4xlarge, and c6i.4xlarge, respectively; to measure each algorithm, we used the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/tree/main/tool#benchmarking-tools" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">AWS-LC speed tool</a>.</p><p>In the graphs below, all units are operations per second (ops/sec). The “before” columns represent the performance of the existing x/Ed25519 implementations in AWS-LC. The “after” columns represent the performance of the new implementations.</p><div data-align-center=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>For the Ed25519 signing operation, the number of operations per second, over the three μarchs, is, on average, 108% higher with the new implementations.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><div data-align-center=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>For the Ed25519 verification operation, we increased the number of operations per second, over the three μarchs, by an average of 37%.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>We observed the biggest improvement for the x25519 algorithm. Note that an x25519 operation in the graph below includes the two major operations needed for an x25519 key exchange agreement: base-point multiplication and variable-point multiplication.</p><div data-align-center=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>With x25519, the new implementation increases the number of operations per second, over the three μarchs, by an average of 113%.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>On average, over the AWS Graviton 2, AWS Graviton 3, and Intel Ice Lake microarchitectures, we saw an 86% improvement in performance.<br></p><h2><p>Proving correctness</p></h2><p>We develop the core parts of the x/Ed25519 implementations in AWS-LC in <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/s2n-bignum" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">s2n-bignum</a>, an AWS-owned library of integer arithmetic routines designed for cryptographic applications. The s2n-bignum library is also where we prove the functional correctness of the implementations using <a href="https://hol-light.github.io/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">HOL Light</a>. HOL Light is an interactive theorem prover for higher-order logic (hence HOL), and it is designed to have a particularly simple (hence light) “correct by construction” approach to proof. This simplicity offers assurance that anything “proved” has really been proved rigorously and is not the artifact of a prover bug.</p><div data-align-right-rail=""><ps-related-content>

</div><p>We follow the same principle of simplicity when we write our implementations in assembly. Writing in assembly is more challenging, but it offers a distinct advantage when proving correctness: our proofs become independent of any compiler.</p><p>The diagram below shows the process we use to prove x/Ed25519 correct. The process requires two different sets of inputs: first is the algorithm implementation we’re evaluating; second is a proof script that models both the correct mathematical behavior of the algorithm and the behavior of the CPU. The proof is a sequence of functions specific to HOL Light that represent proof strategies and the order in which they should be applied. Writing the proof is not automated and requires developer ingenuity.</p><p>From the algorithm implementation and the proof script, HOL Light either determines that the implementation is correct or, if unable to do so, fails. HOL Light views the algorithm implementation as a sequence of machine code bytes. Using the supplied specification of CPU instructions and the developer-written strategies in the proof script, HOL Light reasons about the correctness of the execution.</p><div data-align-left=""><figure>
    

    
        <p><figcaption>CI integration provides assurance that no changes to the algorithm implementation code can be committed to s2n-bignum’s code repository without successfully passing a formal proof of correctness.</figcaption></p>
    
</figure></div><p>This part of the correctness proof is automated, and we even implement it inside s2n-bignum’s continuous-integration (CI) workflow. The workflow covered in the CI is highlighted by the red dotted line in the diagram below. CI integration provides assurance that no changes to the algorithm implementation code can be committed to s2n-bignum’s code repository without successfully passing a formal proof of correctness.</p><p>The CPU instruction specification is one of the most critical ingredients in our correctness proofs. For the proofs to be true in practice, the specification must capture the real-world semantics of each instruction. To improve assurance on this point, we apply randomized testing against the instruction specifications on real hardware, “fuzzing out” inaccuracies.<br></p><h2><p>Constant time</p></h2><p>We designed our implementations and optimizations with security as priority number one. Cryptographic code must strive to be free of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">side channels</a> that could allow an unauthorized user to extract private information. For example, if the execution time of cryptographic code depends on secret values, then it might be possible to infer those values from execution times. Similarly, if CPU cache behavior depends on secret values, an unauthorized user who shares the cache could infer those values.</p><p>Our implementations of x/Ed25519 are designed with constant time in mind. They perform exactly the same sequence of basic CPU instructions regardless of the input values, and they avoid any CPU instructions that might have data-dependent timing.<br></p><h2><p>Using x/Ed25519 optimizations in applications</p></h2><p>AWS uses AWS-LC extensively to power cryptographic operations in a diverse set of AWS service subsystems. You can take advantage of the x/Ed25519 optimizations presented in this blog by using AWS-LC in your application(s). Visit <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-lc" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">AWS-LC on Github</a> to learn more about how you can integrate AWS-LC into your application.</p><p>To allow easier integration for developers, AWS has created bindings from AWS-LC to multiple programming languages. These bindings expose cryptographic functionality from AWS-LC through well-defined APIs, removing the need to reimplement cryptographic algorithms in higher-level programming languages. At present, AWS has open-sourced bindings for Java and Rust — the Amazon Corretto Cryptographic Provider (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/accelerating-jvm-cryptography-with-amazon-corretto-crypto-provider-2" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">ACCP</a>) for Java, and AWS-LC for Rust (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-aws-libcrypto-for-rust-an-open-source-cryptographic-library-for-rust" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">aws-lc-rs</a>). Furthermore, we have contributed patches allowing <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/support-building-ssl-and-hashlib-modules-against-aws-lc/44505/8" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">CPython</a> to build against AWS-LC and use it for all cryptography in the Python standard library. Below we highlight some of the open-source projects that are already using AWS-LC to meet their cryptographic needs.</p><div data-align-center=""><figure>

  <p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized the first over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid software device, Hearing Aid Feature, intended to be used with compatible versions of the Apple AirPods Pro headphones. Once installed and customized to the user’s hearing needs, the Hearing Aid Feature enables compatible versions of the AirPods Pro to serve as an OTC hearing aid, intended to amplify sounds for individuals 18 years or older with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“Hearing loss is a significant public health issue impacting millions of Americans,” said Michelle Tarver, M.D., Ph.D., acting director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Today’s marketing authorization of an over-the-counter hearing aid software on a widely used consumer audio product is another step that advances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>More than 30 million American adults report some degree of hearing loss. Hearing loss can be caused by aging, exposure to loud noises, certain medical conditions, and other factors. Hearing loss can have a negative effect on communication, relationships, school or work performance and emotional well-being. Using hearing aids has been <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/17/2022-17230/medical-devices-ear-nose-and-throat-devices-establishing-over-the-counter-hearing-aids#p-666">linked</a> to reductions in the frequency or severity of cognitive decline, depression and other health problems in older adults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221028042729/https:/www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-finalizes-historic-rule-enabling-access-over-counter-hearing-aids-millions-americans">FDA’s OTC hearing aid regulations</a> established in October 2022 represented a significant step toward helping ensure that adults with mild to moderate hearing loss have improved access to more safe and effective product options. The rule enabled consumers with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment to purchase hearing aids directly from stores or online retailers without the need for a medical exam, prescription or seeing an audiologist. Today’s authorization exemplifies the FDA’s continued commitment to provide safe and effective solutions for those with hearing loss, while also fostering innovation and convenience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hearing Aid Feature (HAF) is a software-only mobile medical application that is intended to be used with compatible versions of the AirPods Pro. The HAF utilizes a self-fitting strategy, and users may adjust it to meet their hearing needs without the assistance of a hearing professional. The HAF is set up using an iOS device (e.g., iPhone, iPad), and the user’s hearing levels are accessed from the iOS HealthKit to customize the HAF. Users can refine the volume, tone and balance settings after setting up the HAF.</p>

<p>The HAF was evaluated in a clinical study with 118 subjects with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, at multiple U.S. sites. The results demonstrated that subjects who used the HAF self-fitting strategy achieved similar perceived benefit as subjects who received professional fitting of the same device. Results also showed comparable performance for tests measuring levels of amplification in the ear canal, as well as a measure of speech understanding in noise. No adverse events related to the device were observed in this study.</p>

<p>This application was reviewed under the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions-selecting-and-preparing-correct-submission/de-novo-classification-request">De Novo premarket review pathway</a>, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.</p>

<p>As part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s strategic priority to advance health equity, the Center will continue to support innovation that expands access to important technologies and brings health care directly to patients.</p>

<p>The FDA granted marketing authorization of the Hearing Aid Feature to Apple Inc.</p>

<!-- cache hit 54:single/related:26fdcab0e9713d43525c2588c324aa43 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Earlier this year, we got a look at something unusual: the results of an internal investigation conducted by Harvard Business School that concluded one of its star faculty members had committed research misconduct. Normally, these reports are kept confidential, leaving questions regarding the methods and extent of data manipulations.</p>
<p>But in this case, the report became public because the researcher had filed a lawsuit that alleged defamation on the part of the team of data detectives that had first identified potential cases of fabricated data, as well as Harvard Business School itself. Now, the court has ruled on motions to dismiss the case. While the suit against Harvard will go on, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.259933/gov.uscourts.mad.259933.74.0.pdf">the court has ruled</a> that evidence-backed conclusions regarding fabricated data cannot constitute defamation—which is probably a very good thing for science.</p>
<h2>Data and defamation</h2>
<p>The researchers who had been sued, Uri Simonsohn, Leif Nelson, and Joe Simmons, run a blog called <a href="https://datacolada.org/">Data Colada</a> where, among other things, they note cases of suspicious-looking data in the behavioral sciences. As we detailed in our earlier coverage, they published a series of blog posts describing an apparent case of fabricated data in four different papers published by the high-profile researcher Francesca Gino, a professor at Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>The researchers also submitted the evidence to Harvard, which ran its own investigation that included interviewing the researchers involved and examining many of the original data files behind the paper. In the end, Harvard determined that research misconduct had been committed, placed Gino on administrative leave and considered revoking her tenure. Harvard contacted the journals where the papers were published to inform them that the underlying data was unreliable.</p>
<p>Gino then filed suit alleging that Harvard had breached their contract with her, defamed her, and interfered with her relationship with the publisher of her books. She also added defamation accusations against the Data Colada team. Both Harvard and the Data Colada collective filed a motion to have all the actions dismissed, which brings us to this new decision.</p>
<p>Harvard got a mixed outcome. This appears to largely be the result that the Harvard Business School adopted a new and temporary policy for addressing research misconduct when the accusations against Gino came in. This, according to the court, leaves questions regarding whether the university had breached its contract with her.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>However, most of the rest of the suit was dismissed. The judge ruled that the university informing Gino's colleagues that Gino had been placed on administrative leave does not constitute defamation. Nor do the notices requesting retractions sent to the journals where the papers were published. "I find the Retraction Notices amount 'only to a statement of [Harvard Business School]’s evolving, subjective view or interpretation of its investigation into inaccuracies in certain [data] contained in the articles,' rather than defamation," the judge decided.</p>
<h2>Colada in the clear</h2>
<p>More critically, the researchers had every allegation against them thrown out. Here, the fact that the accusations involved evidence-based conclusions, and were presented with typical scientific caution, ended up protecting the researchers.</p>
<p>The court cites precedent to note that “[s]cientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation” and concludes that the material sent to Harvard "constitutes the Data Colada Defendants’ subjective interpretation of the facts available to them." Since it had already been determined that Gino was a public figure due to her high-profile academic career, this does not rise to the standard of defamation.</p>
<p>And, while the Data Colada team was pretty definitive in determining that data manipulation had taken place, its members were cautious about acknowledging that the evidence they had did not clearly indicate Gino was the one who had performed the manipulation.</p>
<p>Finally, it was striking that the researchers had protected themselves by providing links to the data sources they'd used to draw their conclusions. The decision cites a precedent that indicates "by providing hyperlinks to the relevant information, the articles enable readers to review the underlying information for themselves and reach their own conclusions."</p>
<p>So, overall, it appears that, by couching their accusations in the cautious language typical of scientific writing, the researchers ended up protecting themselves from accusations of defamation.</p>
<p>That's an important message for scientists in general. One of the striking developments of the last few years has been the development of online communities where scientists identify and discuss instances of image and data manipulation, some of which have ultimately resulted in retractions and other career consequences. Every now and again, these activities have resulted in threats of lawsuits against these researchers or journalists who report on the issue. Occasionally, suits get filed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's probably good for the scientific record that these suits are unlikely to succeed.</p>

        <p>Like many people who solder regularly, I decided years ago to upgrade from a basic iron and invest in a soldering station. My RadioShack digital station has served me well for the better part of 20 years. It heats up fast, tips are readily available, and it’s a breeze to dial in whatever temperature I need. It’s older than both of my children, has moved with me to three different homes, and has outlived two cars and one marriage (so far, anyway).</p>

<p>As such, when the new breed of “smart” USB-C soldering irons started hitting the scene, I didn’t find them terribly compelling. Oh sure, I bought a Pinecil. But that’s because I’m an unrepentant open source zealot and love the idea that there’s a soldering iron running a community developed firmware. In practice though, I only used the thing a few times, and even then it was because I needed something portable. Using it at home on the workbench? It just never felt up to the task of daily use.</p>
<p>So when iFixit got in contact a couple weeks back and said they had a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/fixhub" target="_blank">prototype USB-C soldering iron</a> they wanted me to take a look at, I was skeptical to say the least. But then I started reading over the documentation they sent over, and couldn’t deny that they had some interesting ideas. For one, it was something of a hybrid iron. It was portable when you needed it to be, yet offered the flexibility and power of a station when you were at the bench.</p>
<p>Even better, they were planning on putting their money where their mouth is. The hardware was designed with repairability in mind at every step. Not only was it modular and easy to open up, but the company would be providing full schematics, teardown guides, and spare parts.</p>
<p>Alright, fine. Now you’ve got my attention.</p>

<h2>Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>Before we get too much farther, I should clarify that the FixHub is technically two separate devices. Officially iFixit calls the combo a “<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/99434/introducing-fixhub-the-portable-soldering-system" target="_blank">Portable Soldering System</a>” in their documentation, which is made up of the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/fixhub-power-series-smart-soldering-iron" target="_blank">Smart Soldering Iron</a> and the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/fixhub-power-series-portable-soldering-station" target="_blank">Portable Power Station</a>. While they are designed to work best when combined, both are fully capable of working independently of each other.</p>
<h3>Smart Soldering Iron</h3>
<p>The star of the show is, of course, the Smart Soldering Iron. It’s a 100 watt iron that comes up to operating temperature in under five seconds and can work with any suitably beefy USB-C Power Delivery source. The size and general proportions of the iron are very close to the Pinecil V2, though the grip is larger and considerably more comfortable to hold. The biggest difference between the two however is the absence of a display or configuration buttons. According to iFixit, most users don’t change their settings enough to justify putting the interface on the iron itself. That doesn’t mean you can’t tweak the iron’s settings when used in this stand-alone configuration, but we’ll get back to that in a minute.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" data-attachment-id="706962" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2024/09/12/review-ifixits-fixhub-may-be-the-last-soldering-iron-you-ever-buy/fixhub_pinecil/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg" data-orig-size="1268,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="fixhub_pinecil" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg?w=800" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="252" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg 1268w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg?resize=250,79 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg?resize=400,126 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_pinecil.jpg?resize=800,252 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>The only control on the iron is a slide switch on the tail end that cuts power to the heating element. I like this arrangement a lot more than the software solution used on irons like the Pinecil. The click of the switch just feels more reliable than having to hold down a button and hoping the iron’s firmware understands that I want to turn the thing off and not adjust some setting. Of course, this is still a “smart” iron, so naturally there’s also support for accelerometer based idle and sleep modes that you can enable.</p>
<p>While there’s no display, the illuminated ring behind the grip does provide a visual indicator of what the iron is doing: solid blue means it has power but the heating element is off, a pulsing blue indicates the iron is heating, and orange means it has reached the desired temperature. If you flick the heater switch off, the ring pulses purple until it cools back off and returns to blue. It’s a simple and effective system, but the visual distinction between the blue and purple isn’t great. Would love to see the ability to customize these colors in a future firmware update.</p>

<video id="video-706883-1" width="800" height="322" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_ring_demo.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_ring_demo.mp4">https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_ring_demo.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>The iron has a couple of clever portability features for those who often find themselves hacking on the go. The magnetic cap can be placed over the tip even when it’s hot, which means you don’t need to wait for the iron to cool down before you pack it away in your bag. The included USB-C cable also comes with a locking collar that mates with the groves in the tail of the iron — this keeps the cable from pulling out if you’ve got yourself contorted into some weird angle, but doesn’t prevent you from using your own cable should you want.</p>

<p>As for the tip, it can be easily removed without tools and uses a 3.5 mm TRS plug like the Miniware TS80, although I don’t have a TS80 handy to test if the tips are actually compatible. For their part, iFixit says they plan on offering an array of styles and sizes of tips in addition to the 1.5 mm bevel that the Smart Soldering Iron ships with.</p>
<h3>Portable Power Station</h3>
<p>While it’s not required to use the Smart Soldering Iron, for the best experience, you’ll want to spring for the Portable Power Station. It’s essentially a 5,200 mAh battery bank capable of powering devices at 100 W, with a single USB-C port on the back for charging and two on the front for whatever devices you want to plug into it.</p>
<p>The trick is, once the Station detects you’ve plugged a Smart Soldering Iron into it, you’re given the ability to configure it via the OLED screen and rotary encoder on the front of the device. There’s even support for connecting a pair of Smart Soldering Irons to the Station, each with its own independent configuration. Though in that case, both would have to share the total 100 W output.</p>
<p><video id="video-706883-2" width="800" height="442" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_station_demo.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_station_demo.mp4">https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fixhub_station_demo.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>Assuming a single Smart Soldering Iron, iFixit says you should expect to get up to eight hours of runtime from the Portable Power Station. Of course there are a lot of variables involved, so your mileage may vary. If you’re spending most of your time at the bench, you can keep the rear USB-C port connected to a Power Delivery charger and use it more or less like a traditional station.</p>
<h2>The Internet of Irons</h2>
<p>Plugging the Smart Soldering Iron into the Power Station is the most obvious way of tweaking its various settings, but as I mentioned earlier, it’s not the only way.</p>

<p>Maybe you don’t want to buy the Station, or you left it at home. In either event, you can simply plug the iron into your computer and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/03/21/web-serial-terminal-means-its-always-hacking-time/">configure it via WebSerial</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll need a browser based on Chrome to pull this trick off, as Mozilla has decided (at least, for now) to not include the capability in Firefox. In testing, it worked perfectly on both my Linux desktop and Chromebook.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, plugging the iron into your phone won’t work, as the mobile version of Chrome does not currently support WebSerial. But given the vertical layout of the interface and the big touch-friendly buttons, I can only assume that iFixit is either banking on this changing soon or has a workaround in mind. Being able to plug the iron into your phone for a quick settings tweak would be incredibly handy, so hopefully it will happen one way or another.</p>
<p>The WebSerial interface not only gives you access to all the same settings as plugging the iron into the Power Station does, but it also serves as the mechanism for updating the firmware on the iron.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Power Station has it’s own nearly identical WebSerial interface. Primarily this would be used for upgrading the firmware, but it’s not hard to imagine that some users would prefer being able to change their settings on the big screen rather than having to squint at an OLED not much larger than their thumbnail.</p>
<h2>Solder At Your Command</h2>
<p>But wait! I hear those gears turning in your head. If the Smart Soldering Iron into the Power Station both feature WebSerial interfaces that let you play around with their settings, does that mean they might also offer a traditional serial interface for you to poke around in?</p>

<p>Hell yeah they do!</p>
<p>There was no mention of this terminal interface in any of the documentation I received from iFixit, but thanks to the built-in help function and tab completion, I was able to make my way around the various tools and functions. I never knew how badly I yearned to adjust the temperature on my soldering station from the command line before this moment. There’s clearly a lot of potential here, and I’m really looking forward to seeing what the community can come up given this level of control.</p>
<h2>A Look Under the Hood</h2>
<p>iFixit offered to give me a peek at the in-development repair guides for the Smart Soldering Iron and the Power Station, but I passed. For one thing, there’s no doubt in my mind that the finished product is going to be phenomenally detailed. Just look at any of their in-house guides, and you’ll know what to expect. But more to the point, I wanted to see how hard it would be to take the two devices apart without any guidance.</p>

<p>I’m happy to report that the iron and its base station are some of the most easily dissembled devices I’ve ever come across. No glue, weird tape, or hidden fasteners. No little plastic tabs that break if you look at them the wrong way. Just two pieces of hardware that were designed and assembled in a logical enough way that you only need to look at them to understand how it all goes together.</p>

<p>Of course, this should come as no surprise. Imagine the mud that would have been slung had iFixit had dropped the ball here. You can’t very well campaign for repairability if you don’t hold your own products to the same standards you do for everyone else. Presumably they designed the Smart Soldering Iron and the Power Station to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75533/how-ifixit-scores-repairability" target="_blank">hit a perfect ten by their published standards</a>, and from what I’ve seen, they nailed it.</p>
<p>I also got a look at the schematics, exploded diagrams, and parts list for both products. Like the repair guides, these won’t be made public until the hardware ships in October. But don’t worry, this isn’t some crowdsource bait-and-switch. They’ve got the goods, and it’s all very impressive.</p>
<p>Now to be clear, we’re not talking open source hardware here. Don’t expect to pull Gerbers from a GitHub repo so you can crank out your own Power Station. But the documentation they’re providing is remarkable for a consumer device. The schematics especially — they’re filled with all sorts of notes in the margins from the engineers which were fascinating to go through.</p>
<h2>Investing in the Future</h2>
<p>If I’ve not made it abundantly clear so far, iFixit really blew me away with the Portable Soldering System. I knew they would put a solid effort into the product from their reputation alone, but even still, I wasn’t expecting the hardware and software to be this polished. iFixit didn’t just raise the bar, they sent it into orbit.</p>
<p>But all this comes at a price. Literally. The Smart Soldering Iron alone will set you back $79.95, and if you want to get the Power Station along with it, the combo comes in at $249.95. You could get a nice soldering station from Weller or Hakko for half the price. Then again, it’s hard to compare what iFixit is offering here to anything else on the market.</p>
<p>In the end, this is one of those times when you’ve got to decide what’s really important to you. If you just want a quality soldering station, there are cheaper options that will meet all of your needs and then some. But if you want to support a company that’s working to change the status quo, sometimes you’ve got to reach a little deeper into those pockets.</p>

<p>Luke Horton asked in a <a href="https://svpow.com/2024/09/07/were-not-going-to-run-out-of-new-anatomy-anytime-soon/#comment-270632">comment on a recent post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the chance to examine a titanosaur cadaver with your hypothetical army of anatomists, what would you look for first?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*FACEPALM* How we’ve gone almost 17 years without posting about a hypothetical sauropod dissection is quite beyond my capacity. I am also contractually obligated to remind you that the TV show “Inside Nature’s Giants” shows dissections of a whale, elephant, giraffe, tiger, anaconda, giant squid, etc., so it’s probably the closest we’ll ever get. Go look up photos of Dr. Joy Reidenberg standing, um, <em>amidst</em> a partially-dissected whale, or just watch that episode, and your sauropod-dissection-visualizer will be properly calibrated.</p>
<p>To get back to Luke’s question, there are loads of interesting things that could be dissected in a sauropod, but since the remit here is Matt Wedel x titanosaur, there’s only one possible answer: the lung/air sac system and its diverticula. For several reasons:</p>

<p>First and most obviously, I’ve spent the last quarter-century trying to infer as much as possible about the respiratory systems of sauropods based on the patterns of pneumaticity in their skeletons, and I’d kill for the opportunity to check the accuracy of my inferences — and those of all my fellow-travelers in the sauropod and dinosaur respiration biz, like Daniela Schwarz and Emma Schachner and Tito Aureliano and many others.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_22817"><p><a href="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fig14_air-sacs_v2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22817" data-attachment-id="22817" data-permalink="https://svpow.com/2024/09/12/if-i-could-dissect-a-sauropod/fig14_air-sacs_v2/" data-orig-file="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fig14_air-sacs_v2.jpg" data-orig-size="3544,1622" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Fig14_air-sacs_v2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fig14_air-sacs_v2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fig14_air-sacs_v2.jpg?w=480" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fig14_air-sacs_v2.jpg?w=480" alt="" width="480" height="220"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-22817">Sauropod respiratory system modeled on that of a bird. I’ll bet the correspondence wasn’t <em>this</em> close. (Also, since making this figure 20 years ago, I’ve learned that the abdominal air sacs of ostriches are actually rather small, although the perirenal, femoral, and subcutaneous diverticula of the abdominal air sacs are extensive; see Bezuidenhout et al. 1999). Wedel and Cifelli (2005: fig. 14).</p></div>
<p>Second, I am intrigued/haunted by the possibility that extant birds might not represent the apex of saurischian lung/air sac evolution. Birds survived the K-Pg disaster because they were small; respiratory efficiency had little or nothing to do with it (evidence: all the other small-bodied tetrapods that survived, like the many, many squamate and mammalian lineages). To me it would be a wild coincidence if the tiny dinosaurs that survived also just happened to be The Bestest (TM) at some anatomical/physiological thing unrelated to their survival. In fact, given how sensitive birds are to airborne dust and ash, I wonder if their fancy lungs weren’t more of a hindrance than a help in the dusty, sooty, iridium-laced post-impact world. Anyway, there are interesting clues that the air sac systems of extant birds are just one subset of a much greater original diversity, like most (all?) birds starting out embryologically with a dozen or so air sacs, which get simplified to the usual 9 or fewer by fusions. What did other dinosaurs do with their 12 (or more?) air sacs? If any dinosaurian clade was going to push the capabilities of the “avian” lung/air sac system in interesting directions and to fascinating extremes, sauropods seem like a good bet.</p>

Boisvert et al. (2024: fig. 12).</p></div>
<p>So I’m intrigued by the idea that extant birds show us one way that a saurischian lung/air sac system can work, but don’t exhaust the territory, anymore than kangaroos show us all the ways that mammals can reproduce. Maybe sauropods had even better lungs than birds! Or maybe not. Likely they were doing their own weirdly specialized thing — or many weirdly specialized things — that left few to no diagnostic traces in their skeletons. We can be pretty confident that at least some of the pneumatic diverticula of sauropods worked essentially identically to how they do in birds (see Woodruff et al. 2022 and <a href="https://svpow.com/2022/02/17/sauro-throat-part-3-what-does-dollys-disease-tell-us-about-sauropods/">this post</a>), and mid-dorsal pneumatic hiatuses in juvenile sauropods — predicted by me in 2003, found by Melstrom et al. (2016) and Hanik et al. (2017) — suggest that their air sac systems were broadly comparable. On the other hand, the variety of rib articulation angles just within Morrison sauropods tells us they weren’t all ventilating their air sacs in quite the same way (Boisvert et al. 2024), despite broad similarities with other dinos at the levels of rib osteology (Wang et al. 2023) and whole-thorax construction (Schachner et al. 2009, 2011). (Aside: why the <em>hell</em> didn’t I work a citation of Wang et al. 2023 into the Dry Mesa Haplo paper? I can only conclude that I am at least occasionally an idiot.) Whatever was going on, I’m pretty sure sauropods didn’t look exactly like 60-ton turkeys on the inside, but we don’t have a ton of real data on how they differed. It would be amazing to find out.</p>

<p>Third, if any sauropods were going to rival or exceed birds in fancy under-the-hood anatomical and physiological adaptations, my money would be on titanosaurs. They were morphologically disparate, phylogenetically diverse, geographically widespread, they independently evolved to giant size more times than any other sauropod clade, and their growth rates were wild. I’d dissect any sauropod I got access to (uh duh), but a titanosaur would be particularly appealing. Which titanosaur? Probably <em>Rapetosaurus</em>: we know it grew very fast early on (Curry Rogers et al. 2016, and see implications for the nervous system in Smith et al. 2022), it had a highly pneumatic vertebral column (O’Connor 2006), its body proportions were pretty wacky, and it had other features of interest to me, like expanded neurocentral joints (see Wedel and Atterholt 2023 and <a href="https://svpow.com/2023/06/09/new-paper-wedel-and-atterholt-2023-on-expanded-neurocentral-joints-in-sauropods/">this post</a>) and neural canal ridges (see Atterholt et al. 2024 and <a href="https://svpow.com/2024/08/29/new-paper-atterholt-et-al-2024-on-neural-canal-ridges-in-dinosaurs/">this post</a>).</p>

<p>Oh, and if I got to dissect more than one sauropod, the rest of my top 5 choices in order would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>the owner of <a href="https://svpow.com/2016/09/16/how-horrifying-was-the-neck-of-barosaurus/">BYU 9024</a> (<em>Supersaurus</em>? Giant ancient individual of <em>Barosaurus</em>? Are those even different things? Dissecting this critter could tell us!), <em>Barosaurus</em> being the most diplodocid-y and least titanosaur-y neosauropod I know of, and BYU 9024 being from a hellaciously big individual no matter what its classification;</li>
<li>the Snowmass <em>Haplocanthosaurus</em>, because I have just so many questions about all the weird stuff going on with its tail (see Wedel et al. 2021 and <a href="https://svpow.com/2022/02/28/whats-up-with-your-insanely-thick-intervertebral-discs-snowmass-haplocanthosaurus/">this post</a> for starters);&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://svpow.com/2008/08/28/omeisaurus-is-just-plain-wrong/"><em>Omeisaurus</em></a> or <a href="https://svpow.com/2021/01/28/xinjiangtitan-has-the-longest-preserved-neck-of-any-lifeform-to-date/"><em>Xinjiangtitan</em></a>, to represent a maximally derived-but-also-weird non-neosauropod;</li>
<li><em>Sauroposeidon</em>, for <a href="https://svpow.com/2018/02/07/sauroposeidon-the-early-years-my-first-drawing/">obvious emotional reasons</a> (but not enough to dethrone the others).</li>
</ul>
<p>After that? Probably <em>Isanosaurus</em> or <em>Melanorosaurus</em> or something else waaaay down the tree, so I could see how much of the sauropod kit was in place from the get-go (probably <a href="https://svpow.com/2024/06/09/the-sauropod-heresies-my-tate-2024-abstract-and-handout/">most of it</a>).</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_19808"><p><a href="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mwc-8028-caudal-3-cartilage-volume-estimate.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19808" data-attachment-id="19808" data-permalink="https://svpow.com/2022/02/28/whats-up-with-your-insanely-thick-intervertebral-discs-snowmass-haplocanthosaurus/mwc-8028-caudal-3-cartilage-volume-estimate/" data-orig-file="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mwc-8028-caudal-3-cartilage-volume-estimate.jpg" data-orig-size="2012,1600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="MWC 8028 caudal 3 cartilage volume estimate" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mwc-8028-caudal-3-cartilage-volume-estimate.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mwc-8028-caudal-3-cartilage-volume-estimate.jpg?w=480" tabindex="0" role="button" loading="lazy" src="https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mwc-8028-caudal-3-cartilage-volume-estimate.jpg?w=480" alt="" width="480" height="382"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-19808">Bone vs joint space in the proximal caudals of the Snowmass <em>Haplocanthosaurus</em>. I’d give one non-essential organ to dissect that tail!</p></div>
<p>And after the respiratory system, next up for me would be the spinal cord and any related morphological specializations of the neural canal — see Table 3 in Atterholt et al. (2024) for a running tally, and <a href="https://svpow.com/neural-canal-projects/">this page</a>. Then <a href="https://svpow.com/papers-by-sv-powsketeers/taylor-and-wedel-2013c-on-neck-cartilage/">intervertebral joints</a>, digestive tract, and reproductive system (neither of the last two leave anything useful in the way of skeletal traces), in that order. Arguably the intervertebral joints would be a bigger score for sauropod paleobiology than spinal cord stuff, but maybe not, and having squelched my emotional pick among sauropod taxa, I’m letting my emotions rule when choosing body systems to dissect. I also am intensely interested in the possibility of <a href="https://svpow.com/2009/03/19/off-topic-get-down-get-fuzzy-tianyulong/">protofeathers</a> in sauropods, but you don’t have to dissect those, you can just see if any are present, so I’d cheat a little and note any integumentary specializations <em>en passant</em>. (Remember than an animal can <em>have hairs</em> without being <em>hairy</em> [naked mole rats, rhinos, manatees, dolphins], ditto for feathers.)</p>
<p>So that’s the sauropod and the body system I’d dissect first, if given the chance. What’s your answer?</p>
