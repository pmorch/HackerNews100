When an animal feels a puff of air to the eye, the Purkinje cells stop firing temporarily, resulting in an eyeblink. </p><p>So, in 2007, some Swedish researchers decided to study this response in isolation. Here’s how it works.</p><p><span>You take a “decerebrate” ferret — i.e. a ferret with the whole cerebrum severed from the rest of the brain (consisting of the brainstem and cerebellum). You condition individual Purkinje cells with electrode stimulation of two types of neurons that form their inputs: the climbing fibers (unconditioned stimulus) and the mossy fibers (conditioned stimulus.)  Stimulating the climbing fibers (the same thing that happens naturally when a puff of air hits the eye) causes a temporary suppression of Purkinje cell firing; stimulating the mossy fibers does not. </span><em>But, </em><span>if the mossy fibers are stimulated </span><em>right before </em><span>the climbing fibers, the Purkinje neurons </span><em>learn </em><span>to anticipate the association and suppress their firing in response to the mossy fiber stimulation.  This is a textbook example of classical conditioning.</span></p><p>Are cerebellar Purkinje cells the only individual neurons capable of single-cell learning?</p><p><span>Not in all animals; the sensory neurons of the sea slug </span><em>Aplysia </em><span>can be classically conditioned.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-11-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-11-140098227" target="_self" rel="">11</a></span><span>  But I haven’t been able to find a study in vertebrates of single-cell classical conditioning or associative learning outside the cerebellum. (Other regions of the brain, of course, are involved in learning, but the learning might be occurring  through </span><em>multicellular </em><span>information like the relationships between nearby neurons’ firing patterns.)</span></p><p>Why do we care?</p><div><p><span>First of all, this gives us at least one “unique job” for the cerebellum: it is the place in the brain where conditioned associations are learned.</span></p><p><span>Second of all, it </span><em>disproves </em><span>the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation" rel="">long-term potentiation </a><span>theory that learning in the brain happens exclusively through strengthening synaptic connections between neurons. (The old dictum that “neurons that fire together, wire together.”)  The brain is </span><em>not </em><span>like a neural network where the only thing that is “learned” or “updated” is the weights between neurons. At least some learning evidently happens </span><em>within individual neurons. </em></p></div><p><span>That’s bad news for anyone hoping to simulate a brain digitally.  It means there’s a lot more relevant stuff to simulate (like the learning that goes on within cells) than the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism" rel="">connectionist </a><span>paradigm of treating each biological neuron like a neural-net “neuron” would imply, and thus the computational requirements of simulating a brain are higher — maybe vastly higher — than connectionists hope.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, intracellular learning is </span><em>great </em><span>news for neuroscientists trying to discover exactly how learning works inside a brain. If you’re studying an example of learning (or classical conditioning) that occurs within a single neuron, then the long-hypothesized “engram”, or physical object corresponding to a piece of newly learned information, has to reside </span><em>inside that neuron</em><span>. Something needs to physically or chemically </span><em>change </em><span>in that neuron, representing the newly learned information, and  causing the corresponding change in the neuron’s firing behavior.</span></p><p><span>Not only can individual Purkinje cells in the cerebellum be classically conditioned, they can also learn information about the </span><em>timing </em><span>of stimuli.</span></p><p><span>If the time interval between the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus is varied, the Purkinje cells learn to suppress their firing at </span><em>different times </em><span>to match.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-12-140098227" target="_self" rel="">12</a></span><span> </span></p><p>In other words, if the Purkinje cell has “learned” from experience that an aversive stimulus will typically follow the neutral stimulus in exactly 50 milliseconds, then the Purkinje cell will delay roughly that long after receiving the neutral stimulus before pausing its firing.  If the Purkinje cell “learns” a longer delay, it’ll wait longer before the pause. </p><p><span>This means that something inside the Purkinje cell is capable of representing </span><em>number </em><span>or </span><em>quantity</em><span>. </span></p><p><strong>Cerebellar Purkinje cells, in other words, can count. (Or measure.)</strong></p><p>The fact that individual cerebellar Purkinje neurons contain the ability to measure quantities is highly suggestive about the function of the cerebellum, given the symptoms of cerebellar disease. </p><p><span>Dysmetria, or failure to estimate the right distance and/or speed to move, is a typical symptom of damage to the cerebellum. If </span><em>measurement </em><span>(especially motor timing) is localized to the cerebellum, then dysmetria as a cerebellar deficit makes perfect sense.</span></p><p>Other symptoms of cerebellar damage are easy to understand as consequences of dysmetria. Intention tremor (those big back-and-forth wobbles when the patient tries to move) might simply be what happens when dysmetria causes the movement to initially overshoot, and then an attempt to correct the overshoot itself overshoots and swings in the other direction, and so on. Nystagmus could be the same thing, with the muscles of the eye.  </p><p><span>Even the non-motor symptoms of cerebellar damage, like poor performance on cognitive tests, have sometimes been referred to as a kind of “dysmetria of thought.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-13-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-13-140098227" target="_self" rel="">13</a></span><span> </span></p><p><span>Cerebellar patients have trouble with planning tasks (like the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" rel="">Tower of Hanoi</a><span> puzzle), spatial reasoning tasks, and executive function tasks; you might suppose that mentally “gauging” how long to spend doing things, or “relating” subtasks to the whole, as well as understanding how objects fit together in space, are aspects of mental “measurement”.  </span></p><p><span>Cerebellar patients have normal abilities to make grammatical sentences, but make strange errors in generating </span><em>logical </em><span>sentences.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-14-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-14-140098227" target="_self" rel="">14</a></span><span> Things like:</span></p><ul><li><p>“It’s a big job, but it’s not easy.”</p></li><li><p>“If you drive, it will be less crowded”</p></li><li><p>“Although it’s the wrong size for you, I’ll ask to have one that will fit you.”</p></li><li><p>“I never thought I would meet you here; Nor did I, because everything seems so fresh here to buy.”</p></li></ul><p>Conjunctions (like “but”, “although”, “because”, “if”) represent particular logical relationships between parts of sentences. The cerebellar patients’ errors imply a specific impairment in the ability to make those conjunctional relationships.</p><p><span>A sentence that begins “it’s a big job, </span><em>but</em><span>” ought to end with something that would ordinarily seem to conflict with the claim “it’s a big job”; the cerebellar patient instead ended the sentence with something that typically </span><em>reinforces </em><span>the claim (“big jobs” are </span><em>usually </em><span>“not easy”). This error violates the expected logical relationship between clauses.</span></p><p>In a sense this is analogous to a problem in “spatial” or “part-whole” relating — the cerebellar patient has trouble constructing sentences whose clauses relate in the right way to match the conjunction between them. It’s analogous to the way cerebellar patients have the basic sensorimotor ability to do all the same individual movements that healthy people do, but they have trouble sequencing them fluently, “putting the pieces together” in the right way.</p><p>Of course, other areas of the brain are involved in “measurement” or “quantity” activities too. Visual areas of the brain “measure” spatial distances, auditory areas “measure” pitch and rhythm, various parts of the cerebral cortex are active in mental arithmetic, etc. So it’s not that the cerebellum is the sole region that “measures” or “relates” things. But there is something measurement-related going on.</p><p><span>Another broad theory of what the cerebellum is “for” is </span><em>anticipation </em><span>or </span><em>preparation</em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-15-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-15-140098227" target="_self" rel="">15</a></span></p><p><span>This fits well with the fact that classical conditioning happens in the cerebellum. Classical conditioning consists of learning to </span><em>expect </em><span>one stimulus to follow another, and respond </span><em>in anticipation </em><span>of the expected stimulus.</span></p><p><span>It also fits well with the cerebellum’s role in motor planning and sequencing.  Fluent movement requires unconsciously, rapidly forming intentions to do </span><em>multiple different things in sequence </em><span>without having to stop to think between steps.</span></p><blockquote><p>Gordon Holmes (1939) quotes a cerebellar-lesioned patient as saying, "The movements of my left (unaffected) arm are done subconsciously, but I have to think out each movement of the right (affected) arm. I come to a dead stop in turning and have to think before I start again."</p></blockquote><p><span>This kind of cerebellar damage symptom represents a failure of the </span><em>anticipatory </em><span>or </span><em>preparatory </em><span>function that automatically “gets ready” for the next step before the last one is complete.</span></p><p><span>Patients with cerebellar damage have impaired ability to switch their attentional focus (for instance, between a task that requires watching for visual cues and one that requires listening for auditory cues) but unimpaired ability to perform similar tasks that don’t require shifting focus. Patients with brain lesions </span><em>outside </em><span>the cerebellum didn’t have problems with task-switching.</span></p><p>This also suggests that the cerebellum is involved in the “readiness” or “anticipation” prior to making a mental action.</p><p>Also, experimentally stimulating the cerebellum in animals makes them more sensitive to subsequent sensory stimulus, further supporting the hypothesis that the cerebellum helps organisms “prepare to pay attention”.</p><p>The Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum, in particular, are involved in “preparatory” motor adjustments, such as altering one’s grip on an object in anticipation of the experimenter moving it.</p><p>If the function of the cerebellum is fully general “anticipatory” or “predictive” modeling, this would explain why it’s so important, especially in primate and hominid evolution. Dexterity (tool use, throwing) has obviously been selected for in our primate and hominid ancestors, and so have the general cognitive abilities to predict and make sense of a changing world.</p><p>It also would explain why people without a cerebellum are still capable of most of the same tasks as healthy people, just with worse performance. </p><p><span>People who lack a cerebellum are </span><em>wholly </em><span>incapable of eyeblink classical conditioning, but they’re not wholly incapable of learning or memory; they learn new skills </span><em>slowly</em><span> but they do learn them and they don’t have total amnesia. </span></p><p><span>This would make sense if they are unable to learn to </span><em>instantly anticipate </em><span>context to prepare for upcoming actions, but they are able to learn and form memories through a slower, noisier route using the cerebrum.  They can perform most of the same skills as healthy people, but they have to adjust “by trial and error” instead of using anticipation to get things right the first time, so they’re slower and less accurate.</span></p><p><span>Another way of phrasing this is that the cerebellum is a </span><em>forward model</em><span> of the consequences of action.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-16-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-16-140098227" target="_self" rel="">16</a></span><span> </span></p><p><span>The cerebellum receives an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efference_copy#:~:text=In%20physiology%2C%20an%20efference%20copy,by%20an%20organism's%20motor%20system." rel="">efference copy </a><span>of motor commands generated by the motor cortex, and uses its model to predict the sensory consequences; it can then compare predicted vs. actual data and error-correct.  A fast, subconscious path for sensorimotor prediction and learning (including classical conditioning) is confined to the cerebellum alone; a slower path includes both the cerebellum and cerebrum. </span></p><p><span>It takes hundreds of milliseconds to consciously perceive sensory information — far too slow a timescale to allow finely tuned and responsive motion that adapts to sensory feedback.

In marine mammals, the cerebellum is used for echolocation.  Echolocating bats also use the cerebellum for navigation, though their overall cerebellum size relative to brain size is small.</p><p>In many mammals, large areas of the cerebellum are devoted to processing sensory and motor information for parts of the body that are particularly dexterous and used in exploration: the snout in rodents, the hands in primates, the tip of the tail in arboreal monkeys.</p><p>Across animals, the cerebellum seems to be involved in both motion and sensory perception, and intriguingly, seems to be particularly enlarged in animals that use echolocation or electrosensing in the water, for spatial awareness of object locations in all directions.</p><p>This is suggestive of something like “spatial world modeling” going on in the cerebellum, and is consistent with the theory that the cerebellum’s job is anticipation and preparation. </p><p><span>Echolocation and electrosensing are both sensory modalities that involve an organism generating a “field” around itself (of electric or sound waves) and perceiving objects in the patterns of disruption in that field. Unlike vision, hearing, and smell, they are “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_sensory_systems" rel="">active sensory systems</a><span>”, in which the organism can control the intensity, direction, and timing of the “probe” signal (the sound or electric signal they emit). </span></p><p>Touch can have an analogous “actively controllable” quality, as the animal reaches out a snout, hand, or tail to explore its nearby surroundings. But truly active sensory systems, unlike touch, allow an animal to explore and probe at a distance, and gain a 3D model of its whole surrounding world. </p><p>While humans don’t have these kinds of sensory systems, it may provide some intuition for what our cerebellum is doing; perhaps building implicit anticipations of where everything in the physical world around us, and how it will respond if “poked”. </p><p><span>If you try to map regions of the cerebellum by function and by functional connectivity</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-18-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-18-140098227" target="_self" rel="">18</a></span><span> you get a close one-to-one match with the cerebrum, even down to the localization of language in one hemisphere (the left hemisphere of the cerebrum and the right hemisphere of the cerebellum; everything’s flipped.)</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-19-140098227" href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/what-does-the-cerebellum-do-anyway#footnote-19-140098227" target="_self" rel="">19</a></span></p><p><span>The only parts of the cerebral cortex </span><em>without </em><span>a corresponding cerebellar region are the auditory and visual cortices.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple's documentations is famously dreadful. In particular it is often missing or incomplete. <a href="https://nooverviewavailable.com/">No overview available</a> gives you some numbers on this but I think that actually understates the problem. Even when it is available it is often terrible. Here is a small concrete example I recently encountered while doing some MacOS development (an area I'm less familiar with).</p>
<p>I want to prompt the user to open a directory. How do I do that? Obviously I Google it (throwing in <code>Swift</code> to avoid ancient <code>Obj-C</code> answers).</p>
<p>Seems like I want something called <code>NSOpenPanel</code>.</p>
<p>I find <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsopenpanel">Apple's docs</a> and it seems to be fairly clear. I configure with some straightforward options.</p>
<p>Okay how do I actually use it?</p>
<p>Hmmm. That is far from clear. There is literally nothing on the page that explains even the most basic use case. Sigh. Hit google again finding that I want to call <code>begin</code> and that that this accepts a callback which is given a result.</p>
<p>The example is out of date (a perpertual issue with Swift) but eventually sort that out in the editor (we now have a nice enum with the result).</p>
<p>Okay but how do I get the actual directory selected? The success value is <code>.OK</code>. Is there some kind of data with that? No. Just a result.</p>
<p>Hmmm...</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsopensavepaneldelegate">delegate</a> that I can set. Maybe that gets the result.</p>
<p>Waste a few minutes on that, basically appears to be for configuration.</p>
<p>Ah, it inherits from <code>NSSavePanel</code>! That was not at all obvious (and I'm sorry OOP devotees, that makes damn all sense in principle). Oh, look, loads of new functions and properties. Ah, so I'm meant to query the NSOpenPanel object for the directory.</p>
<p>Not really clear how. Xcode offers a <code>url</code>, <code>urls</code>, <code>directoryUrl</code>, <code>representedUrl</code> among others (I'm not making any of those up and most didn't seem to be in documentation). Let's be optimistic and chose <code>url</code>. Success! It appears to work.</p>
<p>Oh, also missing (before I continue): in recent versions of MacOS need to add a capability for reading (and writing) to user selected directories. Again completely missing from documentation and yet another frustration for someone not already very familiar with the ecosystem.</p>
<p>This can be so much better. Apple developers sneer at Electron, but look at how <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/dialog#dialogshowopendialogbrowserwindow-options">clear Electron's open dialog docs</a> are.</p>
<h2>What goes wrong with Apple's docs?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Missing and incomplete</li>
<li>Outdated (Obj-C or older Swift versioned docs are common)</li>
<li>Badly written (assumes a level of familiarity that would make reading the docs unnecessary). Lack of explanation.</li>
<li>Lack of examples of even basic usage.</li>
<li>Badly designed, legacy OOP APIs: Swift can sometimes get away without much documentation through good use of types. Sadly a lot of MacOS API's are a blend of old fashioned OOP with surprisingly low level details.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What if you are doing Apple development?</h2>
<p>Avoid Apple's docs (even where they are top Google results). They will likely be pretty bad. Stack Overflow is sometime good (but often an old Swift version). Some third party docs and good (Paul Hudson, Ray Wenderlich).</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s one thing that television viewers can count on in 2024: higher fees and more commercials.</p>

<p>The major streaming services – Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and Max – have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/28/amazon-prime-netflix-disney-peacock-streaming-subscription">all announced</a> rate hikes and new advertising policies.</p>

<p>As I show in my new book, “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691246666/247-politics">24/7 Politics: Cable Television and the Fragmenting of America from Watergate to Fox News</a>,” the streaming boom that has imperiled cable television is actually built upon the very same business model that made television viewers pay for monthly subscriptions decades ago. </p>

<p>Like their cable predecessors, streaming companies have lured people in with promises of a better and cheaper viewing experience. Now that they have a robust subscriber base, they’re in the process of raising rates while also introducing more commercials and bundling programming to make customers pay more and more.</p>

<p>There is a difference, though. When cable companies tried similar tactics in the late 1980s, there was an uproar from politicians who called such business practices “unfair” to their constituents. Now, there’s nary a peep – a sign of just how inured Americans have become to the whims of corporations trying to squeeze their customers.</p>

<h2>Stemming the tide of ‘toll television’</h2>

<p>Like streaming companies, cable TV’s entrepreneurs in the 1960s saw the business potential of framing cable television as a path for more choice with fewer commercials.</p>

<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.worldradiohistory.com/BOOKSHELF-ARH/Regulatory/Television's-Guardians-The-FCC-1958-1967-Baughman-1985.pdf">federal regulations</a> squashed competition by allowing the “Big Three” broadcast networks — CBS, NBC and ABC — to dominate the airwaves as long as they also served a vaguely defined “<a href="https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/public-interests/9780813572291/">public interest</a>.” Advertisers underwrote the cost of programs, which meant that while viewers didn’t have to pay a monthly TV bill, they did have to endure commercials.</p>

<p>This business structure also encouraged programming with mass appeal in order to deliver the broadest possible audiences to advertisers. But not all TV viewers were happy with the formulaic quiz shows and sitcoms that dominated the airwaves. Sensing an untapped opportunity, TV entrepreneurs tried to concoct ways to circumvent the dominance of the Big Three. </p>

<p>Cable television actually dates back to the late 1940s. It was initially known as “<a href="https://tupress.temple.edu/books/blue-skies">community antenna television</a>,” or CATV, because it was used to bring broadcast signals to smaller communities that couldn’t get signals from the big cities.</p>

<p>At first, this technology simply expanded the reach of CBS, NBC and ABC rather than providing a competing service.  </p>

<p>But in 1963, a former NBC executive named Pat Weaver <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1964/10/why-suppress-pay-tv-the-fight-in-california/658253/">proposed subscription television</a>, in which people would pay a monthly fee for access to specialized channels through a wired connection. </p>

<p>His company, STV, offered a way to sidestep the “vast land of advertising trivia” that beamed into living rooms across the nation, Weaver explained during one public forum. Weaver dreamed of how giving individual subscribers more choices could forge a business model that could break through the programming limitations of broadcast.</p>

<p>In the end, STV didn’t last. Broadcasters and theater owners mobilized to convince the public that such experiments would turn all television into pay TV, dividing Americans into those with television access and those without it. </p>

<p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691246666/247-politics">Broadcasting lobbyists warned</a> that “toll television” would “have an undemocratic and divisive effect” by depriving viewers of their right to consume television for free. <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=googlescholar&amp;id=GALE%7CA70451817&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;asid=23eb4633">One flyer featured</a> a devastated young boy with a football helmet who didn’t have enough coins to insert in the television. </p>

<p>“Pop says he don’t have any more Dollar and a halfs for me to watch each ball game,” the caption read.</p>

<p>The dire warnings about the end of free TV worked, and voters supported a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_15,_Prohibition_of_Paid_Television_Programming_Initiative_(1964)">state ballot initiative</a> in 1964 that outlawed subscription television. While the courts <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/ca-supreme-court/1820874.html">overturned the new law</a> for violating the First Amendment, STV didn’t survive. </p>

<h2>Cable catches on</h2>

<p>But the idea of wired television delivering more choices to viewers persisted.  </p>

<p>As frustrations with the limits of broadcast television intensified <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-american-history/article/watergate-the-bipartisan-struggle-for-media-access-and-the-growth-of-cable-television/64F2A0E3B8D3EAD28F8E6449DEF11BDE">across the political spectrum during the 1970s</a>, consumers, elected officials and regulators all embraced the potential of cable television to offer an alternative.</p>

<p>By the mid-1970s, experiments with programming disseminated via satellite on cable systems tested new types of niche channels and shows – like nonstop movies, sports, music or the weather – to see if audiences might be interested. In 1975, HBO gambled that a live international boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/04/sport/thrilla-in-manila-remembered/index.html">Thrilla in Manila</a>,” would boost its struggling pay-TV operation. </p>

<p>It did: Income from pay television services like HBO, which first launched in 1972, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691246666/247-politics">soared</a> from US$29 million in 1975 to $769 million in 1980. </p>

<p>Like STV before them, cable companies tapped into frustrations with broadcasting and its advertising model. They sold subscriptions by promising that premium channels like HBO could provide movies with “no cuts, no commercials.” </p>

<p>Millions of people eagerly signed up for cable subscriptions and premium channels like HBO that cost even extra.</p>

<h2>Deregulation nation</h2>

<p>Niche cable channels soon emerged that appealed to specific demographic groups. Black Entertainment Television created new opportunities for programming geared toward Black audiences. The Daytime Channel offered entertainment and news directed at women, while MTV connected a younger generation through music videos.</p>

<p>Then there was C-SPAN, a cable industry-funded initiative that put the cameras on the House of Representatives starting in 1979. In a 1984 letter to the network, an enthusiastic viewer praised the public affairs channel for providing “over-the-back-fence discussion with your neighbors on matters of common interest, but with the scope that the neighborhood extends to encompass all areas of the United States.”</p>

<p>Cable’s popularity buoyed the lobbying efforts of the industry, which was pushing Congress to deregulate key aspects of their business operations. In 1984, they succeeded: <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/66">The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984</a> notably removed local government caps on what companies could charge for subscription services. </p>

<p>The consequences quickly became clear: price hikes and poor customer service. In the next few years, basic cable rates skyrocketed, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691246666/247-politics">increasing by an average of 90%</a>.</p>

<h2>Playing political football</h2>

<p>Al Gore, then an ambitious senator representing Tennessee, saw an opportunity. He pounced on the issue, decrying how cable companies and lobbyists had leveraged consumer demand in ways that amounted to <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?9959-1/cable-telecommunications-act-day-1-part-1">what he described as</a> “total domination of the marketplace.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?9959-1/cable-telecommunications-act-day-1-part-1">He condemned the industry</a> as an American “Cosa Nostra,” and having likened Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) executive <a href="https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/john-malone-everything-need-know-americas-single-largest-land-owner/">John Malone</a> to “Darth Vader,” Gore then lashed out at him during a 1989 congressional hearing for “shaking down” average Americans.</p>

<p>Malone pushed back, highlighting the unprecedented choice that people now had on cable. Rate increases allowed for experimentation with niche programming that never stood a chance on network broadcast television, he added. And they also helped pay the costs of laying – and then later upgrading – wires across the country to deliver such services.</p>

<h2>Everything old is new again</h2>

<p>Cable-bashing was effective on the campaign trail for Gore and his top-of-the-ticket running mate, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. But, once in office, they changed tack. They wanted private industry to build the information highway they saw as <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/let-them-eat-tech/">central to their governing agenda</a>, and cable companies were the ones who owned the coaxial wires going into millions of homes. </p>

<p>Four years later, Gore and Clinton celebrated the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/telecommunications-act-1996">1996 Telecommunications Act</a>, which slashed many price regulatory measures Gore had championed while on the campaign trail in 1992.</p>

<p>The rationale? That the marketplace competition and programming choice alone could deliver for the public interest. </p>

<p>The result? The expansion of a media landscape forged on the terrain of private businesses and their profit margins.</p>

<p>Despite today’s frustrations with changes designed to boost bottom lines – rate hikes, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/27/netflix-password-sharing-why-users-mad/">limits on password sharing</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/08/sports-streaming-makes-losers-us-all/671231/">exclusive streaming contracts for sporting events</a> – people no longer look to politicians to help them navigate and address these concerns as they once did. The bipartisan belief in deregulation has seemingly closed down these conversations about policy alternatives. </p>

<p>That’s why cable didn’t just blaze a path for a new business model. It also convinced elected officials and constituents to embrace a different understanding of the public interest, one where the market reigns supreme.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<h2>Windows XP 2024 is the OS I wish was real</h2>
<p>2024 is here, and rumour has it that Microsoft plans to announce/release Windows 12 this year. Yes, another new OS from Microsoft. Windows XP may be a dead OS, but it still holds a place in our hearts, and with Windows XP 2024 Edition, we can see what a revived Windows XP could look like.</p><p><a data-no-instant="1" href="https://www.scan.co.uk/products/deepcool-assassin-iv-cooler" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" src="https://media.overclock3d.net/2023/09/728x90.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="90"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLFUl9MW_Ks"><strong>AR 4789</strong></a> has designed and showcased a modern interpretation of Windows XP 2024 Edition. The OS’ design is familiar, yet new, and feels remarkably simple. There is no Cortana, no AI Co-Pilot, or an extreme amount of unwanted, pre-installed software. XP 2024 Edition is a call-back to simpler times, before your OS could show you ads, and when the Windows search function was a useful feature (No, I don’t want you to search using Bing!).</p>
<p>Honestly, now that I have seen it, I am a little sad that Windows XP 2024 Edition doesn’t exist. It is a concept, nothing more. It is a shame that Microsoft cannot create a new version of Windows that runs as smoothly as AR 4789’s concepts. Watch the video below to see it for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Windows XP 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YLFUl9MW_Ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With a simple UI, a nice looking dark mode and its iconic wallpaper, Windows XP looks great in its modern form. Like many PC users, I remember Windows XP and Windows 7 more fondly than their successors. While nostalgia plays a role here, so do other factors. Many aspects of Windows 11 are unwanted. Login requirements, changes to Windows Search, and taskbar changes, are all bugbears. Windows 12 is unlikely to address these issues, and moving to Linux is a step too far for most PC users.</p><p><a data-no-instant="1" href="https://msi.gm/S96E4205" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.overclock3d.net/2023/12/image_2023_12_06T15_16_39_674Z.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="90"></a></p>
<p>Today, Windows XP is practically extinct. Even newer OS’ like Windows 7 and 8 are becoming an increasingly rare sight. This week <a href="https://overclock3d.net/news/software/steam-has-dropped-support-for-windows-7-8-and-8-1/"><strong>Steam dropped support for pre-Windows 10 OS’</strong></a>. Windows 7 will be 15 years old this year, which means that it is getting close to “Retro” status. By comparison, Windows XP is practically ancient. Even so, I still like it, and I love the idea of its 2024 reimagining.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Dorothy Bishop <a rel="nofollow" href="http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2023/02/open-letter-to-cnrs.html">has the story</a> about “a chemistry lab in CNRS-Université Sorbonne Paris Nord”:</p>
<blockquote><p>More than 20 scientific articles from the lab of one principal investigator have been shown to contain recycled and doctored graphs and electron microscopy images. That is, results from different experiments that should have distinctive results are illustrated by identical figures, with changes made to the axis legends by copying and pasting numbers on top of previous numbers. . . . the problematic data are well-documented in a number of PubPeer comments on the articles (see links in Appendix 1 of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1di9gvmdMDi81PPgX-7jK8QDD_nREHDVKpuNvOi3rjbM/edit">this document</a>).</p>
<p>The response by CNRS [Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique] to this case . . . was to request correction rather than retraction of what were described as “shortcomings and errors”, to accept the scientist’s account that there was no intentionality, despite clear evidence of a remarkable amount of manipulation and reuse of figures; a disciplinary sanction of exclusion from duties was imposed for just one month.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not surprised.  The sorts of people who will cheat on their research are likely to be the same sorts of people who will instigate lawsuits, start media campaigns, and attack in other ways.  These are researchers who’ve already shown a lack of scruple and a willingness to risk their careers; in short, they’re loose cannons, scary people, so it can seem like the safest strategy to not try to upset them too much, not trap them into a corner where they’ll fight like trapped rats.  I’m not speaking specifically of this CNRS researcher—I know nothing of the facts of this case beyond what’s reported in Bishop’s post—I’m just speaking to the mindset of the academic administrators who would just like the problem to go away so they can get on with their regular jobs.</p>
<p>But Bishop and her colleagues were annoyed.  If even blatant examples of scientific misconduct cannot be handled straightforwardly, what does this say about the academic and scientific process more generally?  Is science just a form of social media, where people can make any sort of claim and evidence doesn’t matter?</p>
<p>They write:</p>
<blockquote><p>So what should happen when fraud is suspected?  We propose that there should be a prompt investigation, with all results transparently reported. Where there are serious errors in the scientific record, then the research articles should immediately be retracted, any research funding used for fraudulent research should be returned to the funder, and the person responsible for the fraud should not be allowed to run a research lab or supervise students. The whistleblower should be protected from repercussions.</p>
<p>In practice, this seldom happens. Instead, we typically see, as in this case, prolonged and secret investigations by institutions, journals and/or funders. There is a strong bias to minimize the severity of malpractice, and to recommend that published work be “corrected” rather than retracted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bishop and her colleagues continue:</p>
<blockquote><p>One can see why this happens. First, all of those concerned are reluctant to believe that researchers are dishonest, and are more willing to assume that the concerns have been exaggerated. It is easy to dismiss whistleblowers as deluded, overzealous or jealous of another’s success. Second, there are concerns about reputational risk to an institution if accounts of fraudulent research are publicised. And third, there is a genuine risk of litigation from those who are accused of data manipulation. So in practice, research misconduct tends to be played down.</p></blockquote>
<p>But:</p>
<blockquote><p>This failure to act effectively has serious consequences:</p>
<p>1.   It gives credibility to fictitious results, slowing down the progress of science by encouraging others to pursue false leads. . . . [and] erroneous data pollutes the databases on which we depend.</p>
<p>2.   Where the research has potential for clinical or commercial application, there can be direct damage to patients or businesses.</p>
<p>3.   It allows those who are prepared to cheat to compete with other scientists to gain positions of influence, and so perpetuate further misconduct, while damaging the prospects of honest scientists who obtain less striking results.  </p>
<p>4.   It is particularly destructive when data manipulation involves the Principal Investigator of a lab. . . . CNRS has a mission to support research training: it is hard to see how this can be achieved if trainees are placed in a lab where misconduct occurs.</p>
<p>5.   It wastes public money from research grants.</p>
<p>6.   It damages public trust in science and trust between scientists.</p>
<p>7.   It damages the reputation of the institutions, funders, journals and publishers associated with the fraudulent work.</p>
<p>8.   Whistleblowers, who should be praised by their institution for doing the right thing, are often made to feel that they are somehow letting the side down by drawing attention to something unpleasant. . . .</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What happened next?</strong></p>
<p>It’s the usual bad stuff.  They receive a series of stuffy bureaucratic responses, none of which address any of items 1 through 8 above, let alone the problem of the data which apparently have obviously been faked.  Just disgusting.</p>
<p>But I’m not surprised.  We’ve seen it many times before:</p>
<p>– The University of California’s unresponsive response when informed of research misconduct by their star sleep expert.</p>
<p>– The American Political Science Association refusing to retract an award given to an author for a book with plagiarized material, or even to retroactively have the award shared with the people whose material was copied without acknowledgment.</p>
<p>– The London Times never acknowledging the blatant and repeated plagiarism by its celebrity chess columnist.</p>
<p>– The American Statistical Association refusing to retract an award given to a professor who plagiarized multiple times, including from wikipedia (in an amusing case where he created negative value by introducing an error into the material he’d copied, so damn lazy that he couldn’t even be bothered to proofread his pasted material).</p>
<p>– Cornell University . . . ok they finally canned the pizzagate dude, but only after emitting some platitudes.  Kind of amazing that they actually moved on that one.</p>
<p>– The Association for Psychological Science:  this one’s personal for me, as they ran an article that flat-out lied about me and then refused to correct it just because, hey, they didn’t want to.</p>
<p>– Lots and lots of examples of people finding errors or fraud in published papers and journals refusing to run retractions or corrections or even to publish letters pointing out what went wrong.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is one more story.</p>
<p><strong>What gets my goat</strong></p>
<p>What really annoys me in these situations is how the institutions show loyalty to the people who did research misconduct.  When researcher X works at or publishes with institution Y, and it turns out that X did something wrong, why does Y so often try to bury the problem and attack the messenger?  Y should be mad at X; after all, it’s X who has leveraged the reputation of Y for his personal gain.  I’d think that the leaders of Y would be <em>really</em> angry at X, even angrier than people from the outside.  But it doesn’t happen that way.  The immediate victims of the con would rather act as if the con never happened.  Instead, they’re mad at the outsiders who showed them that they were being fooled.  I’m sure that <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/07/07/cheating-in-science-sports-journalism-business-and-art-how-do-they-differ/">Dan Davies would have something to say</a> about all this.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" data-autopogo="">
<p>This feels significant: <a href="https://mashable.com/category/disney" target="_self">Disney</a> has officially retracted a copyright claim on a third-party's <em>Steamboat Willie</em> video on YouTube.</p><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/youtube-demontizes-public-domain-steamboat-willie-disney-copyright-claim" target="_self"><u>Mashable reported</u></a> that YouTuber and voice actor Brock Baker had uploaded a video to his channel with over 1 million subscribers which was almost immediately hit with a copyright claim from Disney.</p><div>

<p><span>YouTube's message to Brock Baker regarding Disney releasing the copyright claim on his "Steamboat Willie" upload.</span>
<span>Credit: Brock Baker</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>Baker's video featured the entirety of the 1928 Disney animated short <em>Steamboat Willie</em>. He had remixed the film, which stars Mickey Mouse,&nbsp;with his own comedic audio track playing over the nearly 8-minute cartoon, and released it under the title "Steamboat Willie (Brock's Dub)."</p><p>After being hit with the claim, Baker's upload became demonetized, meaning the YouTuber could not make any money off of it. The claim also blocked the ability to embed the video on third-party websites. In addition, the YouTube video was given limited visibility, including being blocked from view entirely in certain countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baker disputed the copyright claim shortly after receiving it. His case appeared strong, as <em>Steamboat Willie</em> entered the public domain on January 1, 2024, allowing a broad range of creative usage of the film and its contents without Disney's permission — including for profit.</p><p>He was successful.</p><p>"Disney released their claim and it's now embeddable and shareable worldwide," Baker told Mashable on Friday along with a screenshot of the email alert he received from YouTube letting him know the copyright claim was released.</p><p>"Good news! After reviewing your dispute, Disney has decided to release their copyright claim on your YouTube video," reads the YouTube email message.</p><p>As a result of Disney pulling the claim, Baker's video is now monetizable, embeddable, and viewable worldwide.</p>

<p>"I'm honestly glad it took 24 hours and not 30 days, still frustrating though," Baker told us, referencing YouTube's policies which gave Disney an entire month to respond to his dispute to their copyright claim. "I wish I knew what goes on behind the scenes."</p><p>There has been lots of speculation online about what exactly can be done with <em>Steamboat Willie</em> that won't draw the ire of or potential lawsuit from Disney, which still holds the trademark (which is different from a copyright) for uses of the iconic Mickey Mouse character in certain contexts. According to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/03/youtube-still-blocking-access-to-steamboat-willie-on-behalf-of-disney-in-some-countries/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>TechDirt</u></a>, other <em>Steamboat Willie</em> videos have also reportedly received copyright claims over the past few days.</p>
<p>YouTube, for its part, historically asserts that it does not mediate copyright claims. It's up to the copyright holder to make claims via its Content ID tool, and it's up to uploaders to dispute those claims when they believe they were incorrectly made. According to YouTube, the responsibility to release claims on content that has fallen into the public domain is with the Content ID user, who in this case is Disney.</p><p>Based on how quickly Baker's video was flagged, Disney's copyright claim on his upload was likely automated, drawing from YouTube's Content ID database. Mashable has reached out to Disney for more information and will update this piece if we hear back.</p><p>But, the way this has played out will likely be genuinely helpful to those looking to create new creative works based on the newly public domain title <em>Steamboat Willie</em>. By releasing the YouTube copyright claim on Baker's video, Disney has made what could be its first official public action recognizing that <em>Steamboat Willie</em> along with this version of Mickey Mouse is indeed public domain. </p><p>In other words, content like Baker's is allowed, with or without Disney's input.</p>

												<p><span>6th January 2024</span></p><p><span>NHS England has confirmed that it will investigate whether Palantir violated the terms of its contract to run the Federated Data Platform, after the tech giant covertly launched an influencer campaign which targeted Good Law Project.</span></p>
					</div>

			<div>
						      
<p><span>We can reveal </span><span>that Palantir was required to but failed to seek prior approval from NHS England (NHSE) for its campaign to promote its contract to run the Federated Data Platform and brief against Good Law Project. Now NHSE has confirmed to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-05/nhs-probes-whether-palantir-influencer-campaign-breached-contract-terms?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcwNDUyMzA4MSwiZXhwIjoxNzA1MTI3ODgxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTNlFYVVBUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIzMkI3NjREMjRGNDQ0OTEyQjE0Mzc1OTA4ODY4N0FFNiJ9.EzD2aOa0WmaF2BaPJBRRmxt5p5vebXePUNh0ZRHNS-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg UK</a> that it will be investigating whether Palantir violated the contract terms just weeks after signing it.</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>A leaked briefing and emails from the campaign shows that Palantir used Tory-linked PR agency, Topham Guerin and marketing agency, Disrupt, to <a href="https://goodlawproject.org/how-palantir-and-topham-guerins-plan-to-discredit-us-unravelled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approach social media influencers</a> to ask them what they would like to be paid to take part. This was done at arms-length, with the briefing asking influencers not to mention Palantir in their content.<br>

</span><span><br>
</span><span>But one of the sections we can actually see – which covers ‘Publicity and Branding’ – states that Palantir is not permitted to use the Authority’s name or brand in any marketing or publicise the contract without the prior written consent of NHS England.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An NHS spokesperson told Bloomberg that the NHS takes any potential breach of contract by a supplier seriously and is investigating what happened.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy.png" alt="An excerpt from the Federated Data Contract signed between the NHS and Palantir which reads: &quot;24 PUBLICITY AND BRANDING 24.1 The Supplier shall not: (a) make any press announcements or publicise this Agreement or its contents in any way; or (b) use the Authority's or any Authority Service Recipients name or brand in any promotion or marketing or announcement of orders; without the prior written consent of the Authority or relevant Authority Service Recipient, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.&quot;" width="541" height="174" srcset="https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy.png 990w, https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy-300x96.png 300w, https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy-768x247.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" data-srcset="https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy.png 990w, https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy-300x96.png 300w, https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy-768x247.png 768w" data-src="https://goodlawproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/FDPcontract01-Copy.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>“Palantir is not – and frankly never has been – a company that can be trusted with this nationally important contract with our NHS” says Good Law Project’s Executive Director, Jo Maugham.</span></p>
<p><span>“By its own behaviour it is telling us exactly that.”</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>“Within weeks, it commissioned a covert smear campaign against a prominent critic and appears to have broken the terms of that contract. If this Government won’t act to protect the national interest, the next one must.”</span></p>
<p><span>Responding to Bloomberg, Palantir has claimed that its campaign was an “exploratory project” so it did not need to consult NHSE. Palantir’s Executive Vice President for UK and Europe, Louis Mosely said, “We decided not to pursue the project — as such, the campaign was not discussed with NHS England”.</span></p>
<p><span>But it is clear that the campaign did seek to use the NHS name and brand in marketing and publicized its agreement with the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span>The campaign materials were dated 28 November 2023, gave as a deadline 22 December and stated “We are on a tight timeline for this one and would require a response as soon as possible with content going live before the new year”, so it is clear that there was no intention to seek the NHS England’s consent.</span></p>
<p><span>Palantir’s conduct in commissioning a covert, paid-for smear campaign against a prominent critic; its decision to breach its contract with the NHS within weeks of signing it; and subsequent dissembling about its intention to breach, will serve to substantiate the concerns of those who believe Palantir was an entity that ought never to have been given the contract in the first place.<br>
</span><span><br>
Good Law Project is attacked because of the work it does – and the threat it poses to the likes of Palantir and the Government. We can only do this because of donations from people like you, right across the UK. If you can, please </span><a href="https://goodlawproject.org/donate/"><span>support our work.</span></a><span><br>

        <section>
            <p>Let's start with where things stand right now and then go from there. </p><p>The first thing I should say: <strong>this is not a joke. </strong></p><p>I say that now, because later on, as you're reading the rest of this piece, you're going to keep asking yourself "Is this some kind of a joke?" </p><p>Hence, this helpful reference statement for you to return to repeatedly throughout. </p><p>This week the Executive Chairman of the new Irish regulator for internet content, Jeremy Godfrey, made himself available for comment to the press to discuss the <a href="https://www.cnam.ie/" rel="noreferrer">Coimisiún na Meán</a> (Media Commission) <a href="https://www.cnam.ie/coimisiun-na-mean-opens-public-consultation-on-irelands-first-online-safety-code/" rel="noreferrer">plan</a> to introduce a code of conduct to control how adults would access websites.</p><p>He outlined <a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41300860.html" rel="noreferrer">the plan set out in page 17 of their Consultation and proposal document to the Irish Examiner.</a> </p><p>This body regulates content (and in particular video content) for the largest internet companies in the world due to the fact so many of them are based in Ireland.</p><p>Mr Godfrey suggested that his Commission would require adults and minors (children under 18) to send a copy of their passport to websites- including porn sites- and then, also, send them a live selfie so the porn sites could see what they looked like right now. And then the porn sites would run biometric data processing on those images (details unspecified) to confirm they were over 18. Call this the Nightclub Bouncer plan. </p><p>This is the national internet regulator proposing that it would require that everyone, adult and children alike, would upload their state ID and live selfies, to porn sites to have biometric processing of their facial images performed. Resulting, amongst other things, in an effective register of porn preferences for adults and a collection of selfies of children kept by the porn sites for six years (required to prove they have complied with the regulation, you see). </p><p>I refer you now to the top of the newsletter. I am still not joking.  </p><div><p>💡</p><p>Hey! Good news! This crackpot scheme isn't law yet. And you can do something to stop it. The Commission has extended its time for feedback on this plan to the 31st January 2024. You can just email what you think of it, giving as many reasons why you think it is a bad idea to <a href="mailto:VSPSregulation@cnam.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VSPSregulation@cnam.ie</a> Please do drop them a line, and tell your friends too.</p></div><div><p>But wait! That's not all! The CnaM Executive Chairman wanted to talk about porn sites because that's the least popular class of entities covered by this regulation. But the age-verification requirement actually can cover any <a href="https://www.cnam.ie/designation-notices/" rel="noreferrer">video-sharing platform</a> under the jurisdiction of the Irish State (link to the designation notice under section 139E and section 139G of the Broadcasting 2009 Act). That's a list that includes Facebook, WhatsApp, XTwitter and YouTube, just to pick four household names (because of <a href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/41/section/5/enacted/en/html?q=video-sharing+platform&amp;search_type=all" rel="noreferrer">Section 5 of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022</a>). It might also mean homegrown platforms such as <a href="https://mastodon.ie/" rel="noreferrer">Mastodon.ie</a>, the most prominent Irish part of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990974/social-media-2023-fediverse-mastodon-threads-activitypub" rel="noreferrer">Fediverse,</a> who also allow videos to be shared. </p><p>In fact, Section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 (as amended) casts the net wide enough to cover almost anywhere that lets you post a video. </p></div><blockquote>In this Act, ‘video-sharing platform service’ means, subject to subsection (3), a service, within the meaning of Articles 56 and 57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, where—<br>(a) the principal purpose of the service is devoted to,<br>(b) the principal purpose of a dissociable section of the service is devoted to, or<br>(c) an essential functionality of the service is devoted to,<br>providing audiovisual programmes or user-generated videos, or both, by electronic communications networks, to the general public, in order to inform, entertain or educate.</blockquote><p>Also, these restrictions won't just limit and record access to porn sites. They can be applied to any sites which contains material the Commission decides may be legal, but on the other hand, oughtn't be seen by children. In other countries, this has been the kind of legal provision which has seen libraries restricting access to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/books/book-ban-rise-libraries.html" rel="noreferrer">books relating to LGBTQ+ themes</a>, racial justice themes and anything else you could imagine the Burke family objecting to. </p><p>The exact description of what is to be restricted behind the Commission's Nightclub Bouncer plan is simply 'age-inappropriate content', defined broadly in <a href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/act/41/section/45/enacted/en/html#sec45" rel="noreferrer">Section 45 of the Online Safety Act 2023</a> as "online content that is likely to be unsuitable for children (either generally or below a particular age), having regard to their capabilities, their development, and their rights and interests". It goes on to give examples of pornography and acts of violence, but the controls aren't limited to them. </p><p>This plan goes far beyond the requirement of the EU Audio-visual directive, which the EU Commission suggests "could be done by the use of PIN codes". It therefore must be measured against the twin EU law requirements of "necessity and proportionality" under the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the GDPR. It fails both tests, of course. </p><p>If there is an alternative method of meeting the requirement of age restriction (as the European Commission's suggestion of the use of PIN numbers demonstrates) then it fails the test of necessity and cannot be in compliance with EU law. </p><p>And even if there were no other method, it has to be considered whether creating a distributed database of internet use, including porn preferences, for all EU adults is proportionate to the aim being pursued. Then consider it also requires the additional security risk of sending copies of sensitive personal documents such as passports to platforms such as Elon Musk's X AND also requiring they perform biometric processing of <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/" rel="noreferrer">article 9 GDPR</a> facial data of both adults and minors. I think the question of proportionality answers itself by the time you reach the end of that sentence. </p><p>It is at this point that I feel justified in pointing to my <a href="https://www.rte.ie/radio/radio1/clips/21574302/" rel="noreferrer">interview on Morning Ireland</a> from 2019, where I warned that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland was the <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2019/0624/1057148-online-safety/" rel="noreferrer">wrong body</a> to put in charge regulating the internet, because it had neither the experience nor understanding of the medium necessary. </p><p>In creating Coimisiún na Meán the Government did just that. The fresh new regulator is now demonstrating exactly how unfit for this role it is. </p><p>I take it back. In a way, this is a joke. It just isn't funny.</p><hr><p>Hello, dear reader.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/struggle_for_each_paper/">https://jeffhuang.com/struggle_for_each_paper/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38902258">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
	The start of my sabbatical has given me a moment to reflect on my publications. But <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/CurriculumVitae.pdf">my CV</a> only shows a list of neatly cataloged papers: title, authors, conference. Each one appearing no different from another. But how each paper ended up published is its own story, a story about people and opportunity.
</p><p>
	Using notes from <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/">my research journal</a> and conference records, I reassembled the "Behind the scenes" story for each of my full research papers: 15 papers as a student, and 15 papers after becoming a professor (excluding papers not led by my research group, as I feel it's not my place to tell those stories). This is as much a <a href="#introspection">reflective exercise for myself</a> than it is for an audience.
</p><p>
	If you read this page in its entirety, it will take about 30 minutes. But you can skip any story, and it should still make sense. The first half are my <a href="#student_papers">student stories</a>, and the second half are my <a href="#professor_papers">professor stories</a>, so you can even just read the half that's more interesting to you. This would probably be more enticing as a series of Tweets or a Substack newsletter, but I'd rather post it all at once.
</p><p>
	I'd love to read the backstories of other peoples' publications too. So if you feel comfortable sharing, post yours and email me if you want it linked at the bottom of this page so we can start a collection. Anyways, here goes.
</p><div><li>
I first stumbled upon research in September 2003 while I was a second-year undergraduate student. My inbox popped up the message, <em>"call me or track me down in class, 'cause a full explanation will take a lot of typing. -Bo"</em>.<p>
Bo was a friend who needed some programming help for an automated help generator as part of a research project, and off I went. What I thought would be a one week task turned into three rewrites of an application, two studies, and one long faculty mentorship. Neither of us could predict that Bo would graduate before the main study began, so he did not even become a co-author of a project he started (though in hindsight, I could have just put him as second author).</p><p>
Because I was learning as I went, I made all the novice mistakes from study design to paper structure. It was a long 3.5 years between when I got that first message and when it was published, after my graduation. And the acceptance decision came only after eeking out a lucky coin-flip, as the initial metareview score was "3-Borderline".</p><p>
But this paper was critical to getting me accepted to a Ph.D. program. Why do I think that? Well I was rejected by every Ph.D. program I applied to before this publication (but that's another story). So with this paper published, I left my job, squeezed my belongings into my car, and drove up the I-5 highway from California to Seattle.
</p></li><hr><li>
My next paper was sadly my first and only full paper with my original advisor, <a href="https://efthi.ischool.uw.edu/">Efthi, before he passed</a>. I don't remember coming up with this idea to study query reformulations, so it must have been he who led me to it. It was intended to be something easy but original—a starter project analyzing the sequences in existing data released by AOL.<p>
It was rejected from SIGIR on my first try, and I was starting to worry the topic would become stale, especially with the controversy about the original dataset that led to AOL closing their research department. So I was relieved this wrapped up quickly, and it felt good to have a paper under my belt in my first year.</p><p>
It puzzles me that this is my most cited full paper, but I think it's due to its topic rather than because of its contribution; though when I checked recently, a few citations are from people using the source code even 12 years later. I guess there's something to be said about the compound interest for citations.

I met Ryen from Microsoft Research when he was a visiting speaker in Efthi's class, and he must have found my internship application that mentioned my paper about query reformulations. Well it turned out he was interested in search trails, which are essentially a series of reformulations, so I was able to continue along that line of work.<p>
The gold standard for these internships was to do a paper from start to finish in the twelve weeks, and I was desperately trying to do paper-worthy work to prove myself. I carried out the analysis as best I could, however I struggled to do enough for a full paper by the end of the internship. Fortunately, Ryen finished up and expanded on it substantially after I left, so I'm grateful he didn't just give it up as unfinished.</p><p>
To my complete surprise, this paper won the best paper award that year at SIGIR. Even after being nominated for the award, I felt it was so unlikely to win that I didn't attend the conference. In fact, at that time I thought my other related paper at that conference (the one below) was a better paper overall, but now I see that the best paper award committee probably felt that evaluation was a messier topic so wanted to reward that effort. This award boosted my confidence during my Ph.D. and opened some doors later, so I'm both lucky and thankful it happened.
</p></li><hr><li>
This related paper came out of the same summer internship with Ryen. I was lucky to be included in the author list because I had a small role and never even met the first author. Besides my initial work over the summer that was moreso for the paper above this, I contributed only a paragraph of original writing. After reading this paper, I felt like it was better than the one I had contributed more, but it has received fewer than half the citations.
</li><hr><li>
I met a brilliant intern during that same summer, Anna, who was doing her <em>first of two</em> Math PhDs at that time and often seemed idle. She explained, "the people who are always busy never seem to get much done." So sensing her free time, I asked her to help solve a made-up hypothetical problem that simplified assumptions from the information retrieval community.<p>
We had a good time working out the math, mostly me asking questions while watching her think aloud on the whiteboards. I learned about different strategies for deriving proofs in a real setting, which were unlike problem sets, where you knew a proof existed and were roughly the right difficulty for you to do. During this summer, I was mathematically in my best shape, as I could follow along enough to write out the solution and check for errors, whereas today it would take a while to even familiarize myself with the equations in the paper.
</p></li><hr><li>
After the summer, I was looking for new ideas to pursue outside my usual information retrieval topics. A friend in the Ph.D. program Gifford came to me with the suggestion that watching people playing video games was an overlooked phenomenon. But no one was paying attention. At that time, you could really only watch low-resolution videos of Korean players with amateur commentary dubbed in English.<p>
That idea clicked with me, so I helped out with a qualitative study to understand why. Gifford taught me most of what I know about grounded theory (and gave me a second lesson a few years ago while collaborating on a more recent 2018 paper).</p><p>
At that time, I had in my mind that I was helping him rescue a rejected idea, but now in retrospect, it's clear that it was he who gave me the opportunity to help out on work he already had a vision for. I'm quite proud of this work, which is my third most-cited paper, but mainly because what we thought would become a phenomenon did indeed come to pass.
</p></li><hr><li>
This became the most important paper during my Ph.D., and it was minutes from not happening. The idea was one of three that I tossed around during my interview to be a Research Intern at Bing. But to apply this idea to the search engine required a complex series of software integration steps that I was not too familiar with; yet it had to be committed by deadlines that occurred every two weeks.<p>
I aimed for a commit deadline during the second half of my internship, and the day it had to ship by 5pm, my code simply wouldn't pass the unit tests. I tried to force it by (naively) changing the unit tests, but that just broke other parts of the build process. It was 4pm and I even had to be somewhere else across the bridge in 30 minutes; I was desperate. I ran in the hallways panicking and found a software developer, Sarvesh, who took a look and gave me some tips. But by the time I had to leave, I still could not push the code. Sarvesh again came to my rescue and assured me, "you take off, I've got this" and sat down at my desk to fix the problem and ship my code while I drove out of the parking lot. Without his help, I would have had to ship it during the next cycle, and would not have left enough time to analyze the data before my internship was over. Not only that, but because it was during a corporate internship, I would have no rights to the intellectual property of any of the work.</p><p>
But my 20 lines of JavaScript did ship and luckily my was bug-free (after I pored over every line a hundred times), so this paper became the first paper I published at the main conference in my field; it was nominated for a best paper award, and became the foundational chapter in my dissertation. Not only that, but it was this work that led to a Google Research Grant, Facebook Ph.D. Fellowship, and Microsoft patent.
</p></li><hr><li>
Back at school, and with momentum from our previous paper about gaming, Gifford and I looked at one of his rejected papers about Texas Hold'em, and expanded it with data from another game, Halo 2. We repeated our formula of qualitative analysis, and submitted to CSCW. It received borderline ratings from our reviewers, but CSCW was experimenting with a "revise and resubmit" process that we were lucky to go through.
</li><hr><li>
At this point, one of my friends from the summer internship, Abdi, felt like I had "the magic touch" so I offered to help out with a rejected internship paper. I only helped brainstorm and edit, but it did end up getting accepted without much fanfare. While this one worked out, a year later I tried to rescue another paper with him, but it only ended up in the bin. Same effort, opposite outcomes.
</li><hr><li>
Now it was the end of my third year, and I felt guilty that I only had one dissertation chapter ready. I had co-founded a startup as part of Techstars Seattle while teaching a class in the evening, so those things had occupied all of my time. Our startup eventually ran out of money and my co-founders left for other opportunities, so in the summer I returned to Microsoft Research for my third internship. Again I joined a different group, this one managed by Sue who a year later became my Ph.D. advisor.<p>
Her group was probably the closest to my core research interests, and it just happened that Ryen had moved to this group. So with this combination of good circumstances, I aimed to write three papers with Ryen and others to get enough material for my dissertation.</p><p>
This first one was difficult for me, using a technique I was unfamiliar with, and required a lot of compute. My compute jobs would compete with higher priority jobs during the day so often timed out. So I had to stay many late evenings to kick off the 8-hour distributed processes that could only finish at night when the cluster was not in heavy use. My efforts paid off; reviewers were generally favorable and it was a clean accept.</p><p>
Now I have to confess, this is the paper I am most skeptical about. I don't fully trust the model, even though I kept checking it over. The results showed a modest improvement, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that they were due to a secondary factor like a collinearity, or even worse that there was a calculation error somewhere in there. But now my code is probably gone, and it seems like others were able to show practical improvements using similar models.
</p></li><hr><li>
A Bing employee, Georg, had collected a nice dataset from a study for one purpose, but it seemed like it could be used to study something closer to what I had done before. He graciously lent me the data, and I did enough analysis to produce this paper. However, one reviewer felt that the descriptive results were not that novel (just a bigger study), nor were the predictive analysis that successful, summarizing "with their paper they now try to add more to this field, but I don't see the important contribution that would justify the publication at CHI." The opinions were ultimately divided.<p>
I sweated over the rebuttal and promised changes, and luckily convinced the metareviewers to let this one slip through. But it actually turned out to be a fairly influential paper, with 223 citations as of today, and served as a baseline for some of my students' work later. So this was paper number two from that summer. I think it hit a trend of papers about user attention that came out the next few years, but this trend has dwindled since then.
</p></li><hr><li>
The third paper of that summer was an easier analysis with a novel idea—that sophisticated use of browser tabs was a central part to finding information. I recruited another student from my university, Tom, who happened to be there interning the same summer. The metareviewer remarked quite correctly, "The paper is not rocket science but [...] to my knowledge has not really been looked at, at least not at this large scale."<p>
While browser tabs did continue to be a phenomenon, this paper got fewer citations than a lighter short paper I wrote earlier on this topic. I think partly because the title was too clever to be easily recognizable.
</p></li><hr><li>
As a bonus for the summer, Georg was writing his own paper, and I had a minor contribution that he deemed enough for a co-authorship. It got a decent number of citations and filled a nice gap in the research field, as well as in my dissertation. So it became a lucky 4-paper summer. I was exhausted by the end of it and took a nice long break.
</li><hr><li>
Besides the two papers with Gifford about gaming, I wasn't doing any research during the school year, as all my other papers were from internships. Without an advisor, I served as a teaching assistant every quarter (sometimes for two or even three classes at once), and got a bit distracted with some other activities.<p>
But one day my opportunity to be a TA vanished (itself another story), and I begged over to Oren, a professor from the computer science department for an office and funding. To my surprise, he immediately agreed within hours of my email. So I started to learn about natural language processing and got to see how he ran his lab.</p><p>
This resulting paper was a combination of his interests and mine. A couple of undergraduate students joined in under my supervision, which was also my first time mentoring students. The study almost did not happen, because I had trouble fitting the procedure under the rules of our human subjects guidance. But after last-minute discussions with Oren and an HCI professor, we found a way to thread the needle.</p><p>
Its publication helped launch one of the undergraduate students into the Ph.D. program at MIT, and led to my interest in involving undergraduate students in research for many years to come.
</p></li><hr><li>
I wasn't originally planning to do another research internship at Microsoft in my last summer, but Tom and Nachi reached out to me about an opportunity I couldn't say no to—a summer to study gaming with large-scale Xbox data. So in my last summer, I joined their gaming research initiative. It was a collaboration between Microsoft Research and folks from Xbox, and along the way I learned a few techniques for time-series analysis.<p>I barely finished the final analysis in the paper the day that I had my farewell lunch. Reviewers loved the work more than I expected, and this paper led to a few opportunities later so I'm glad it worked out. It also brought closure to my Ph.D., as I ended up with no leftover working papers in the pipeline, hence the 2-year gap until my next paper.
</p></li>

<h3>Part 2: Papers as a faculty author</h3>
<hr><li>
Up to this point, I was feeling comfortable leading a paper from start to finish, but the job changed when I became faculty. While I could come up with the idea and advise the process, the initial drafts would be written by students.<p>
So fast forward past my move to Providence and a few false starts at unfinished projects. My first published paper as a faculty member came from a student referred by a professor at another university. The student was Eddie, an undergraduate student from UCLA who reached out to the professor about conducting research analyzing patterns in StarCraft replays. That professor thought I fit the topic better but cautioned, "he [I] probably doesn't have the bandwidth to supervise external students at this time". While that would probably be true now, back then I took the chance and steered him towards an adjacent investigation.</p><p>
I invited Gifford (yes, my classmate from before) to help out, and the work from start to finish was about 8 months of intense analysis and figure-making. The paper ended up with two strong ratings (4.5/5, 5/5) and two unenthusiastic ratings (2.5/5, 3/5), so the compromise was that it ended up shepherded (a paper deemed borderline but asked to make specific changes to be acceptable) to guide us to "accept". This made us nervous for longer, but after this paper got in, I wrote to Eddie, "You've earned your golden ticket to grad school :-) congrats!" and he chose to do a Ph.D. at the University of Washington, my own alma mater. 
</p></li><hr><li>
While teaching my graduate seminar, I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the students so I started assigning projects that students could recycle into research. This became the first of a few papers that were born from class projects in my HCI seminars. Each student worked on their own mini-study, and we combined it into a meta analysis, which is a formula that worked for a couple more papers in later years as well.<p>
The timing for this particular paper was a bit lucky because the reviewers nominated it for a best paper award, but our follow-up work was not as successful; we still had more to say on this topic, but met a lot of resistance in writing the sequels after years of trying to publish newer findings with only rejections.
</p></li><hr><li>
I led my first Ph.D. student Alexandra in a few unfruitful directions trying to continue ideas from my Ph.D. that ended up with two unpublished papers worth of work (so I'm grateful for her patience). But one day while laying in bed I realized we could flip the story from estimating attention with the cursor, to using the webcam while the cursor auto-calibrates the webcam model during regular web browsing. We could deploy this as a library, basically shipping a product.<p>
This paper was the first of many product-style papers that have become the norm in our research group. The work was initially rejected at multiple conferences because while the overall system was effective and the functionality was novel, the technique was not innovative and the results were numerically worse than some of our competitors. I was frustrated about being compared against competitors who only reported data from the users for whom they get good results from (even when they are upfront about omitting results from most of their users), while we were reporting full results from every user.</p><p>
Anyways, it took over two years to build and publish, but I'm proud that the system in our paper is <a href="https://github.com/brownhci/webgazer">used by a sizable community</a>. It has become <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/overview/eye-tracking/">part of a popular psychology library</a> used for many research studies, and adopted by a few startups including one which bought a non-exclusive commercial license. We knew this work would have impact later, as Alexandra sent me one of my favorite acceptance notifications, "It got in!!!! I am going back to sleep, I'll email the rest of the authors tomorrow! :D Very excited, Alexandra" This paper was the foundation for her dissertation, and we are both still working on the project now seven years since it began.
</p></li><hr><li>
I admitted a second student, Nedi, to our Ph.D. program who had prior work on sleep diary research during her undergrad. My brainstorming notes in the months before she arrived was, "we will use data-driven techniques across a large populations sleep data to make (personalized) prescriptive sleep recommendations". By coincidence, I met some new collaborators who had clinical research expertise for this, so Nedi and her team of research assistants set out with these collaborators to develop the software and the study.<p>
We had a tough start and ate a few rejections at both UIST and CHI before we published the paper at the following UIST, 2 years after the initial idea. Even then, the paper almost didn't happen because the reviewers were skeptical (borderline ratings) but Nedi wrote a convincing rebuttal, as a metareviewer summarized, "I re-read the paper in light of the rebuttal. The proposed changes [...] pushed me into the slightly positive end of the spectrum. The submission was discussed at length at the PC meeting and received additional input from another PC member who reviewed the submission at a prior venue. The overall feeling is that this isn't a perfect paper, but it is a difficult area in which to do research and we do learn something from the submission."</p><p>
Close call, but this became the foundation for the rest of Nedi's Ph.D. work. We were lucky to publish it sooner than later because I later found out there were other research groups working on similar ideas.
</p></li><hr><li>
This paper followed from Alexandra's previous one, so was a bit more straightforward as a follow-on application to our previous work. Reviewers like it, and it received an honorable mention. I wish I had more to say, but it was one of the rare times where the idea was universally agreeable and the results were as expected. Later I learned that during my tenure application, an external letter writer remarked that I didn't have many follow-up papers (sequels) at that time, in fact just this one.
</li><hr><li>
Work on this paper started mid-2015, led by Shaun, a Masters student who became a Ph.D. student later. It was a fairly complex product so it took the team substantial time to build it out, and the paper was not published until 2 years later. What's nice is the paper had some broad impacts: two of the undergraduate students working on it are in Ph.D. programs now, and there are still active users of the online web application 6 years since the work started.<p>This paper set the standard that we would try to include undergraduate students in every paper, and so far that still holds true—100% of the papers from our group have included undergraduate authors.
</p></li><hr><li>
We followed a similar formula as before, having students in the HCI seminar run mini-studies, which became a meta study for this paper. But things were not so easy this time around, as the first version of the paper with one cohort struggled to reveal enough compelling findings. So we had to develop a new procedure for students in the seminar in another year, and combined the results from both cohorts for the submission.<p>
We submitted to CHI 2017 and while two reviewers rated it highly (4.5/5 and 4/5), the third wrote a scathing review; the two metareviewers examined the paper closely, and ultimately decided to reject. It was a little frustrating to be so close, as this paper had the highest average rating of all the rejected papers that year. However, we revised it and ultimately published it at IMWUT the following year after a cycle of major revisions.
</p></li><hr><li>
This paper was an exhausting amount of work for Alexandra, collecting a high-quality dataset with the hopes to release it as a contribution. The setup, lengthy procedure, and large number of participants were meant to provide stronger validity for the general topic of eye tracking during interactions.<p>
However, even after the data collection, there were a few snags. We learned that video frames did not inherently have timestamps associated with them, and it was nearly impossible to retroactively infer them to millisecond-level accuracy. While the dataset itself still felt like a strong contribution in the end, it was harder for other researchers to apply immediately so hasn't been as broadly used as I hoped. I still feel like this paper is a bit underrated today, and someone could write one or two other papers from the dataset we collected.
</p></li><hr><li>
My most recent Ph.D. admit, Jing, came with a unique design and technical background, so started working on an ambitious virtual reality project. However, that idea had trouble producing consistent results in practice, but I noted in my research journal on October 2016 that the "motion movement physical device that Jing built that can be used for replay too". So we pivoted to building the product for a different use case which became this paper.<p>
The paper was accepted on its second submission and one of the rare times I've encountered an "accept" decision without having to do a major revisions beforehand. But as a product it has been disappointing; we attempted to deploy it to usability professionals, the target audience, but it turns out that very few people were willing or capable of 3D-printing their own components. We learned from this so the project has not ended here, and we are nearly finished with a sequel, 5 years after the initial idea to reach our original vision.
</p></li><hr><li>
After meeting with Eda, a Masters student who wanted to work on a research project with me, the first note in my research journal was "discussed rewind: cool idea but low chance of publishing". I had no idea how true that would be, as this became the most challenging paper my group would publish. What started in January 2015 was published December 2018, 4 years later, and was passed from student to student after each one graduated. I lost count of the number of rejections.<p>
Many of the authors had never met each other, and it was a bittersweet moment for me when by pure coincidence, the original author, Eda, was standing in the hallway outside my office with the final author, Neilly, without knowing one other (which I immediately corrected by introducing them).</p><p>
What was challenging about this paper was the engineering work used existing known techniques, so we had to emphasize how the experience was a contribution on its own. This was hard to do in a study, as it wasn't about directly improving any specific aspect of life, but being able to experience it differently. I begged my old colleague Gifford to help in early 2018, and what put it over the finish line was a careful mixed methods descriptive writing based on the detailed analysis Gifford directed.
</p></li><hr><li>
This was the first time I had been involved in a project with both hardware and software components, so the system itself took longer than expected, and we were writing this paper down to the deadline. The paper had to be carefully crafted to describe a complex configuration, with 3D-printed parts, augmented reality, cameras and sensors, computer vision, heating and energy issues, and both wired and wireless networking.<p>
Reviews were mixed, but we thankfully had support from our metareviewer, "I am looking forward to hopefully a strong rebuttal so I can be your advocate at the UIST 2019 PC meeting." This encouragement was exactly what we needed in that moment.</p><p>
The effort was worth it, because this system led to a few other projects, and serves as a foundational paper for Jing's Ph.D. What we are still trying to figure out today is how to deploy this as a product to regular people, as the hardware requirements again posed a barrier for adoption.
</p></li><hr><li>
Nedi turned her earlier SleepCoacher paper into a fully automated process, completing our vision from the seed of an idea 6 years ago. The product described in this paper was shipped to the app stores and used by whoever would come across and download it, basically real usage by people we did not recruit. We maintained Android and iOS apps separately, and a server to do the calculations. It was a costly mistake to build out three separate systems; we should have started with something cross-platform and performed the calculations in the app itself to reduce the software maintenance from three systems to one.<p>
The paper was hard to publish, because unlike recruited and paid participants, our 5,000 app store installs (now 7,700) led to messy data—a lot of people never opened the app, or did so only once. Reviewers were unimpressed that thousands of installs only led to a couple hundred active participants, of which only about a fifth of the users tracked for enough nights to get useful information.</p><p>
In the end, it was a close decision but the CHI program committee decided that it could be acceptable if shepherded, "I am still leaning positive given the difficulty of the method, the importance of the topic, and complexity of the project as a whole." Being on the program committee myself that year, I wondered to another faculty member why our papers always seem to only barely get in, and they responded matter-of-factly, "all accepted papers barely get in," referring to the declining average scores at CHI over the years.
</p></li><hr><li>
This idea grew out of my NSF CAREER Award as the required educational component, where I proposed a classroom tool for large-class simultaneous design activities. But the code was written and rewritten several times by different teams even after that, because running a real-time collaborative system with over 100 simultaneous users introduced its own share of problems.<p>
There were many nervous moments leading up to each attempt. The tool failed the first semester or two that we tried it; the server would crash or some of the data would be lost or corrupted, and we would lose our chance to get data that semester.</p><p>
Submission-wise, reviewers always wanted more, so the paper itself went through multiple different narratives before being accepted in a tough revise and resubmit cycle. The mood around this revise and resubmit is best portrayed by a reviewer, "I find this to be a mostly solidly executed project, but I don't see a substantial contribution to CSCW / creativity support tools here. I am not sure if this can be fixed in a revision cycle, but if the authors are keen, ..."</p><p>
Well, we were keen.
</p></li><hr><li>
In 2014, I met with a faculty member in Psychiatry and Human Behavior to discuss a collaboration, where we concluded that the area of mental health lacked innovative computational techniques. I did a rough prototype of our initial idea in 2015, then students picked it up the following year. The work was passed between teams of students, mainly supporting the application development and real usage from a growing list of collaborators. It turns out that many clinical researchers felt the same, and this became our most funded project.<p>
However, the papers took a while and the one led by my group was rejected throughout 2018 and 2019. The hard part was because while we were using a fairly unique approach, I didn't have much experience writing about this topic. Reviewers would have varying opinions of what needed to change, so the text would waffle back and forth; we finally arrived at a version of the paper that was satisfying enough, and it was accepted for publication in 2020.</p><p>
About 20 people were involved at different points in time, but the study didn't start until 2017 so the paper itself was about 3 years in preparation. I feel like the overall goal of computational interventions for mental health is a good one, but it feels like we've only taken a small step.

We had been wanting to expand Nedi's SleepBandits app beyond sleep to all sorts of self-experimentation, and finally got a chance when NSF extended one of my expiring grants to fund this paper.<p>
Our first attempt to publish at CHI 2020 was rejected partly due to weak findings, but Nedi had already been preparing a second study to complement what we had. While it still required major edits, CHI 2021 accepted the paper after a straightforward rebuttal. Did I finally end a long streak of struggling to publish? We considered this our easiest paper, but it still took an 8-person team nearly 30 months.</p><p>
But maybe publishing faster or publishing more is not what it's about. I care more about this project as an app that people can use, so I rebuilt it in the cross-platform Flutter framework, with hopes to use it as a foundation for later work. Hopefully the papers are just a milestone towards people making their lives better through self-experimentation.
</p></li></div><p>After reviewing these notes, I'm a bit ambivalent. When I was a clueless student, I got lucky with my collaborators and acceptance decisions, which made all the difference. After becoming a professor, I had the experience yet the papers take even longer to publish.</p><p>Part of <em>why</em> is the focus on systems papers, which are <a href="http://dubfuture.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-give-up-on-chiuist.html">known to take 3-4 years</a>, but shipping them as products has been an even longer 4+ year agenda. Worth it, sure, but we'll never be like most groups that publish 5+ papers a year.</p><p>But I also think about how my group has encountered a lot of rejection, and keeping up morale was sometimes difficult. Bad news injects doubt and discouragement into students' minds, who then have to rally the team to continue the work in hope that acceptance is just around the corner. This dissonance is hard to manage.</p><p>The other thing I noticed is that papers that get the most citations later often got poor reviews or multiple rejections. They're usually about a new phenomenon, but the novelty can always be recast as "old thing, but just on the web" or "mostly engineering work, with so-so results". With this in mind, I should probably be generous in my own interpretation of what's novel when I review papers.</p><p>In retrospect, I am grateful for many key collaborators for their extra help in those times, and that some conferences like UIST accepted papers despite some obvious flaw because those papers ended up defining long-term research programs for multiple young researchers.</p><p>Thanks to Alexandra Papoutsaki, Bo Lu, Gifford Cheung, Tongyu Zhou, and Zainab Iftikhar for their comments on earlier drafts.</p></div>]]></description>

<pre>Hi,

</pre><tt>some time ago I ended up in an architectural discussion (risc vs cisc 
</tt><tt>etc...) and started to think about vax.
</tt><tt>Even though the vax is considered the "ultimate cisc" I wondered if its 
</tt><tt>cleanliness and nice instruction set still could be implemented 
</tt><tt>efficient enough.
</tt><tt>Well, the only way to know would be to try to implement it :-)&nbsp; I had an 
</tt><tt>15-year-old demo board with a small low-end FPGA (Xilinx XC3S400), so I 
</tt><tt>just had to learn Verilog and try to implement something.&nbsp; And it just 
</tt><tt>passed EVKAA.EXE:
</tt><pre>
&gt;FR00000000 200
&gt;G
EVKAA V10.4 Hardcore Instruction Test

Hit any key to continue
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # 1(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # 19(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # 32(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # 4B(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # 64(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # 7D(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # 96(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # AF(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # C8(X) done!
EVKAA&nbsp;&nbsp; V10.4 pass # E1(X) done!^C
Input breakpoint: 000000001
&gt;

</pre><tt>(the microcode console works like the Nova4 microcode console - simpler 
</tt><tt>to implement than the VAX style...)
</tt><tt>It runs at 50MHz, but could easily be increased to about 80, just to 
</tt><tt>program DCM.
</tt><pre>

</pre><tt>I had to get a new FPGA board, since I started to get bit errors on the 
</tt><tt>old one, so I bought a chinese board with essentially the same FPGA 
</tt><tt>(XC3S500E):
</tt><pre>
</pre><tt>I have implemented all addressing modes, the interrupt hierarchy, 
</tt><tt>timers, and 151 instructions.
</tt><pre>No memory management yet though, but that should be quite straight-forward.

</pre><tt>Currently it uses about 70% of available FPGA resources, which is around 
</tt><tt>6000 LUTs (which is quite inefficient implemented, since I have learned 
</tt><tt>how to do verilog programming while writing the code...)
</tt><pre>
</pre><tt>I'll follow up this mail with two more, one about the implementation and 
</tt><tt>one about how to go forward with the vax architecture :-)
</tt><pre>

<em>Sorry!</em></p>
<p>Since I quit Mozilla and went back to full-time Web development, I’ve discovered
a few surprises.
It turns out Web development is actually pretty hard, Web developers are
actually very smart, and some of these frameworks and techniques we mocked as
browser engineers aren’t so bad.
Oops.</p>
<p>At the same time, it turns out some Web developers have ideas about browsers and
the Web that, as a former browser engineer and standards editor, I’m a bit
dubious of.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the things that surprised me.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="web-browser-engineers-know-web-development-really-well"><a href="#web-browser-engineers-know-web-development-really-well">“Web browser engineers know Web development really well”</a></h2>
<p>It’s easy to imagine that Web browser engineers, who write the code that makes
up the Web platform, must know the Web inside-out like no-one else.</p>
<p>The trouble is, writing Web browsers is hard.</p>
<p>Most browser engineers focus on a particular area and know it really well with
only a superficial understanding of other areas.
Furthermore, browser platform engineers are writing C++ and Rust code all
day long with a smattering of very simple JavaScript test cases.
On top of that, they contribute to one massive respository where someone else
takes care of all the tooling.</p>
<p>As a result, in their day jobs browser engineers are
not fighting webpack,
not trying to understand full-page TypeScript errors
(they’ve got C++ template errors to fill <em>that</em> hole in their lives),
not trying to get Safari on iOS to behave like other browsers,
not struggling with CSS at scale,
not trying to evaluate if the latest SSR/SSG/island framework is worth
investing in,
not refactoring massive JS codebases for more optimal chunking,
not filing exasperated issues on GitHub because the latest version of one of
their dependencies broke their app,
not trying to get all their tools to agree on ESM vs CJS,
and not losing sleep over whether or not they chose the right state
management approach or if they should rewrite the entire thing for the tenth
time over.</p>
<p>In short, they’re not doing Web development day in and day out so they know
much less about real-world Web development than Web developers probably
expect.</p>
<p>Now the engineers working on browser <em>developer tools</em> and the browser
<em>front-end</em> often <em>are</em> using JS day-to-day and certainly have more awareness of
the issues, but it’s still a few degrees removed from regular Web development.
For example, they only need to target a single browser engine’s platform
features, and often only a single browser version (being able to use the new
and shiny features without worrying about compatibility is <em>amazing</em>), don’t
need to worry about bundle size, or servers, or being offline, or so many
other issues that make Web development hard.</p>
<p>Obviously some browser engineers have hobby projects, but the constraints on
a hobby project are a world apart from being in a startup where you live or
die by the success of your Web app.</p>
<p>I started my career in graphic design and Web development and even after
I started contributing to Firefox I worked at a Web development company in
Osaka for a time and produced some Web apps at Mozilla Japan too.
However, after I quit Mozilla and got back into Web development full-time
I was shocked at how much it had changed and how little I knew about it.</p>
<p>My experience as a browser engineer has been incredibly useful in Web
development not least because I know where to look, who to ask, and where to file
bugs, but I’d be kidding myself if I said that being a browser engineer
automatically qualified me as a Web developer.</p>
<p>During my time at Mozilla, the Firefox OS days were by far the most enjoyable.
We had internal teams building real-world mobile Web apps that we,
as the platform team, had to debug and make successful as our highest priority.
I saw how <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/transitionend_event" rel="noopener nofollow"><code>transitionend</code>
events</a>
could be unreliable and cause Web apps to be buggy and overly complicated and so
I proposed and implemented the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/transitioncancel_event" rel="noopener nofollow"><code>transitioncancel</code>
event</a>
and Web Animations’ <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Animation/finished" rel="noopener nofollow"><code>Animation.finished</code>
promise</a>.</p>
<p>But even working side-by-side with Web developers could not prepare me for
actually <em>being</em> a full-time Web developer again.
For the most part browser engineers just operate in a different world from Web
developers and might not be the Web developer superheroes we imagine them to be.</p>
<h2 id="the-people-who-make-web-specifications-know-web-development-really-well"><a href="#the-people-who-make-web-specifications-know-web-development-really-well">“The people who make Web specifications know Web development really well”</a></h2>
<p>Ok, but surely the people working on Web <em>standards</em> and <em>specifications</em>
(who, it turns out, are mostly browser engineers) must be well-versed in Web
development, right?</p>
<p>Back in 2012, <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2012/02/community-prioritized-web-standards/" rel="noopener nofollow">Brendan Eich pointed
out</a>
that, “Standards-making like law-making is definitely
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Godfrey_Saxe" rel="noopener nofollow">sausage-making</a>” referring
to the following quote from John Godfrey Saxe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how
they are made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Web developer, it’s easy to imagine a group of people, infinitely
wise about all things related to Web technology, making calm, rational
decisions based on the technical merits of each proposal balanced against
a thorough understanding of industry needs.</p>
<p>That illusion typically won’t last your first working group meeting.
Despite the best of intentions, sometimes decisions get made based, at least in
part,
on one person’s charisma or forceful personality,
on who happens to be in the room at the time,
on how tired everyone is,
or, dare I suggest, maybe even
someone’s need to ship a feature in order to fill out their promotion packet.</p>
<p>That sounds very cynical so let me make two clarifications.</p>
<p>Firstly, the folks on these groups are well-meaning, wonderful people.
Furthermore, they are often aware of their limitations and try their best to
elicit Web developer feedback.
Unfortunately, I’ve yet to see a group do this very successfully.
There are Twitter/X polls, for example, but they tend to only be answered by the
Web developers on the bleeding edge and are easily skewed by <em>who</em> spreads the
word about the poll.</p>
<p>Secondly, I haven’t had much experience with WHATWG specs like HTML and
DOM where decisions appear to be made asynchronously (“any decisions made
during in-person meetings are to be considered non-binding”—<a href="https://whatwg.org/working-mode#meetings" rel="noopener nofollow">WHATWG
meetings</a>),
but my impression is that they seem to make better decisions.
Folks like Anne van Kesteren, Simon Pieters, and Domenic Denicola probably
know the Web better than anyone else on the planet.
But even that is not the same as knowing Web development.</p>
<h2 id="web-developers-know-web-development-really-well"><a href="#web-developers-know-web-development-really-well">“Web developers know Web development really well”</a></h2>
<p>As a browser engineer it’s really satisfying to ship a new platform feature.
There are articles about it on Smashing Magazine and CSS tricks and Twitter/X
goes abuzz with the news.
It’s easy to think that now the whole world now knows about this great new
advance in the Web’s capabilities.</p>
<p>At one point a few years ago, a few of us in Mozilla’s Japan team decided to
interview local Web developers in Tokyo to learn what developer tools
they would benefit from.</p>
<p>The results were surprising.</p>
<p>Many didn’t know about new CSS features that had shipped 10 years ago.
What’s more, even when we told them about them, they didn’t seem too excited.
They were doing just fine with jQuery and WordPress, thank you.</p>
<p>Instead, they were having trouble with things like, “When I show clients
a site in responsive design mode, if the window doesn’t have a mockup of
an iPhone around it, clients can’t grasp that they are looking at a preview of
how the site will look on a smartphone. I really need that iPhone mockup.”</p>
<p>As a browser engineer involved in developing new Web standards I was a little
disappointed but my lasting impression was of the constraints on these folks
who are making their living from shipping Web sites and Web apps.</p>
<p>Unlike people working on browsers or well-funded Silicon Valley startups, many
of these people are working for little shops with considerable pressure to
deliver something quickly and then move onto the next project in order to pay
the bills.
They don’t have the luxury of spending a morning tinkering with upcoming
technologies and instead reach for tried and trusted solutions they have
experience with.</p>
<h2 id="browsers-arent-made-to-run-spas"><a href="#browsers-arent-made-to-run-spas">“Browsers aren’t made to run <abbr title="single page application">SPA</abbr>s”</a></h2>
<p>Another surprise from moving from browser development back to Web development
was some of the assertions about how browsers work.</p>
<p>When I worked on animations, I was surprised at how many people believed that
some animations “run on the GPU” (the browser can offload some animations to
a separate process or thread that updates animations using the GPU to
composite or even paint each frame but it doesn’t offload them to the GPU
wholesale) but that was a fairly minor misunderstanding compared to some of
the other ones that get thrown around like, “browsers aren’t made to run
SPAs”.</p>
<p>I believe the argument here is that originally browsers would load content off
the network, progressively laying it out and rendering it and have been
heavily optimized for this. Dynamic content came later and so has been less
heavily optimized.</p>
<p>Having worked on a browser on and off for nearly two decades I’m not convinced
this is the case, or at least not anymore.</p>
<p>After all, the Firefox front-end and developer tools are, in effect, SPAs.
The developer tools in particular are written using React and Redux and are in
every sense an SPA.</p>
<p>To the argument that browsers are deficient at handling complex and long-lived
DOM trees with dynamic changes made via JavaScript, the browser itself stands
in contradiction to that claim.</p>
<p>An argument could be made that <em>on mobile</em> browsers aren’t optimized to run
SPAs.
After all, on Android, Firefox switched from an HTML rendered browser chrome
to a native browser chrome in order to improve performance.
I’m not in a position to comment on what the particular performance
constraints were that lead to that change, but <a href="https://lucasr.org/2011/11/15/native-ui-for-firefox-on-android/" rel="noopener nofollow">a blog from that
time</a>
suggests it was related to improving app startup time and panning and
scrolling performance, neither of which point to browsers being deficient at
handling SPAs compared to other architectures.</p>
<p>“Ok, so maybe browsers can handle complex long-lived DOM trees with frequent
dynamic changes, but SPAs tend to have large JS bundles that are slow to
download and parse, blocking the initial render.”
That’s a fair argument, but it’s an argument for smaller render-blocking
initial bundles, which applies to equally to your average WordPress site,
not an argument that browsers are somehow unsuited to running SPAs.</p>
<h2 id="mpas-will-replace-spas"><a href="#mpas-will-replace-spas">”<abbr title="multi-page application">MPA</abbr>s will replace SPAs”</a></h2>
<p>While we’re talking about SPAs and “the one true way to write Web apps”,
a more recent variation on the “browsers can’t handle SPAs” take is, “MPAs
will replace SPAs”.</p>
<p>I’m pretty excited about MPAs.
More specifically, as someone who is involved with a lot of animation specs,
I’m excited by the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-1/" rel="noopener nofollow">view transitions
spec</a> spec.
It’s something we wanted to do at Mozilla for a while, particularly during
the Firefox OS days, and made
a <a href="https://www.chrislord.net/2015/04/24/web-navigation-transitions/" rel="noopener nofollow">proposal</a>
to that end.
Kudos to Jake and others for finally making it happen.</p>
<p>View transitions were originally implemented for SPAs but have been adapted
to work for MPAs and to the extent that they make multi-page sites more
enjoyable they are a very welcome addition.</p>
<p>However, building on the “SPAs are bad” thinking, there seems to be a tendency
to assume that MPAs are the future and SPAs are on the way out.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier points in this post, my surprise at this take is not
based on my experience with working on browsers, but on my more recent
experience with working on Web apps.</p>
<p>First though, what do we even mean by MPAs?</p>
<p>My understanding is that whereas SPAs are characterized by having a long-lived
DOM tree or two that are frequently updated by script, MPAs primarily update
content by navigating to different HTML resources served from the network.
These don’t have to be topmost navigations—it could be by navigating an
<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, for example.
Similarly, SPAs might use <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s as a means of chunking but there’s a
difference in how content is typically updated.</p>
<p>By this definition, Google Docs is an SPA since although each document is
served as a separate resource, most of the time you’re interacting with the one
document that is continually updated via JavaScript.
YouTube would probably be considered an MPA but it might actually be implemented
as an SPA in order to smooth out changes in content, intercepting navigations
and replacing the content via script—that is, until view transitions can help
with that.</p>
<p>In either case, my surprise at the idea that MPAs will replace <em>all</em> SPAs is
simple:
How would Figma or Photoshop for Web work as an MPA?
Or Slack, or Discord, or Google Maps?</p>
<p>I’m currently working on an offline-first mobile Web app that stores data
locally and syncs to the server.
Wanting to be on the forefront of Web tech I investigated how we could
embrace MPAs.</p>
<p>To keep a long story short, if we’re to retain our desired UX which has
independently navigable panels and our offline-first requirement, we <em>could</em>
introduce some <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s to partition out some of the functionality into
separate HTML requests (as opposed to separate script chunk requests)
and we could probably even pre-render some chunks sometimes.
The trouble is it would increase the complexity ten-fold
(two-way sync becomes three-way sync for a start) while providing no benefit to
customers whatsoever—instead it would almost certainly lead to more bugs,
more latency, and shipping features more slowly.</p>
<p>Given that our app is not currently released I realise that’s a fairly weak
argument since no-one can look at the app and suggest a better approach so I’m
just asking you to trust me on this one.
I tried.
I really did.
It’s just not the right architecture for this particular app and I’m surprised
by the suggestion that <em>everything</em> should be an MPA.</p>
<h2 id="all-sites-should-work-without-javascript"><a href="#all-sites-should-work-without-javascript">“All sites should work without JavaScript”</a></h2>
<p>Continuing on our theme of Web development best practices, building a site
that works without JavaScript is an admirable goal.
Doing so probaby means it degrades gracefully, has no JS blocking the initial
render, and works on a wide range of browsers.
But I’ve been surprised to see how often this becomes dogmatic:
”<em>all</em> sites should work without JavaScript”.</p>
<p>I guess it’s easy to come to this conclusion if <em>your</em> site is able to work
without JavaScript (see <a href="#my-blog-is-representative-of-web-development-at-large">“My blog is representative of Web development at
large”</a>)
but it feels a little myopic to me.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned Figma and Photoshop for Web before; it’s hard to imagine how
they could work without JavaScript. Likewise for a browser’s developer tools.
Or even <a href="https://birtles.blog/2012/01/27/parapara-animation/">Parapara Animation</a>!</p>
<p>Furthermore, although many advocates of the “no JS” camp are also concerned
about accessibility, JavaScript is often necessary in order to make an app
accessible.</p>
<p>One thing the accessibility folks at Mozilla taught me about keyboard
navigation was that <kbd>Tab</kbd> navigation should be fairly coarse.
That is, you use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate to the control group (e.g.
toolbar) and then use the arrow keys to move within that group.
That allows you to move around an app more quickly without having to
<kbd>Tab</kbd> through every single control first.
WAI calls this a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_roving_tabindex" rel="noopener nofollow">“roving
tabindex”</a>.</p>
<p>However, in order to implement this kind of coarse-grained keyboard navigation
you’re going to need JavaScript.
If you want to make the arrow-key based navigation two-dimensional, you’re
going to need even more JavaScript.
Maybe one day we’ll fill that gap in the platform (looking at you,
<a href="https://open-ui.org/components/focusgroup.explainer/" rel="noopener nofollow">focusgroup</a>) but for now
you should feel no shame about using client-side JavaScript to make your app
accessible.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think some sites should use <em>more</em> JavaScript.</p>
<p>As an example, the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/" rel="noopener nofollow">Eleventy
documentation</a> seems to avoid using client-side
JavaScript for the most part.
As Eleventy supports various templating languages it provides code samples in
each of the different languages.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t record which language you’ve selected so if your chosen
language is not the default one, you are forced to change tabs on <em>every
single</em> code sample.
A little client-side JavaScript here would make the experience so much more
pleasant for users.</p>
<h2 id="web-development-shouldnt-need-a-build-step"><a href="#web-development-shouldnt-need-a-build-step">“Web development shouldn’t need a build step”</a></h2>
<p><em>While just about everything in this post is from 2022, while tidying it up
I couldn’t resist adding just one more recent idea that surprised me.</em></p>
<p>Our final stop on the Web development dogma train is a view that’s come up a few
times but still surprises me.
The most recent rendition I saw went something like, “we’re so blind and
stubborn that we’ve ended up with a hugely complex toolchain but we really
should be able to ship Web apps without a build step at all”.</p>
<p>As someone who spent most of his career working with compiled languages the
desire to go without a build step is surprising.
The things compiler engineers do amaze me.
They are geniuses who layer clever optimization on top of clever optimization
transforming my very average code into something unrecognizable and insanely
fast.
If anything, I want more of that compiler magic in my Web development.</p>
<p>Obviously JavaScript presents its own challenges since it can be very hard to
statically determine the side effects of a certain operation but I’m sure
there’s still more room to explore in optimizing JavaScript at compile time.</p>
<p>Web developers seem to agree on optimizing image assets and pre-generating
static HTML pages where it makes sense, why is there resistance to optimizing
code assets too?
Why defer computation and I/O to runtime that can be done once at build time?
If nothing else, I have no desire to ship my megabyte-long comments cursing
iOS Safari to every user on every request.</p>
<p>Maybe 2024 will be the year where client-side Rust/WASM frontend frameworks
start to get traction and if that’s the case, we’d better get used to
having a build step!</p>
<h2 id="my-blog-is-representative-of-web-development-at-large"><a href="#my-blog-is-representative-of-web-development-at-large">“My blog is representative of Web development at large”</a></h2>
<p>A number of the points above could possibly be summarised as
“My blog is representative of Web development at large”.
That is, coming from browser engineer to Web developer, most of the notions
about Web development that have surprised me are the result of people
extrapolating their experience of the Web in a way that doesn’t overlap with
mine.</p>
<p>Since I left Mozilla over four years ago, I’ve spent most of my time
working on a Web app.
I’ve also spent <em>way</em> too long setting up this blog.
Surprisingly, with regards to tooling, architecture, or Web platform features
used, I’ve found almost no overlap between the two.
It’s almost as if blogs and apps exist in entirely disparate corners
of the Web development landscape.</p>
<p>My app is a mass of TypeScript code, my blog uses almost no client-side
JavaScript.
My app is hugely complicated by two-directional data sync, my blog is
read-only.
My app uses webpack, Playwright E2E tests, a component framework, and a state
management library, my blog uses none of those.</p>
<p>If you’re mostly engaged with one or the other, it’s easy to think that’s what
Web development looks like.
In truth, Web development is probably more diverse than any of us imagines.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>There are other notions I’ve found surprising but the common theme in the
above is it’s easy to assume our experience of the Web is representative of
Web development in general.</p>
<p>Moving from browser development back to Web development has been humbling
because it’s so much broader and deeper than I knew.
I have a much greater respect for Web developers, especially those at little Web
shops and startups that live or die by the success of their Web apps.</p>
<p>If that’s you, I hope reading this post gives you confidence that even if
browser engineers, standards editors, and other Web developers insist on a
particular way of doing things, you know your constraints better than anyone
else and you’re probably doing things just fine.</p>  </article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-556">
	
	
	<div>
		
<p>It seems that The New York Times Company (“The Times”) got fed up with the pace of its negotiations with Microsoft and OpenAI over their use of The Times’ content for training and running their LLMs. So much so that The Times filed a post-Christmas<a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf"> complaint</a> against the two, likely knowing full well they’d lay waste to the winter vacations of hundreds of people working for OpenAI and Microsoft. It might be the most well-known AI-related case to date because the case isn’t a class action and the plaintiff is globally recognized.</p>



<p>The complaint alleges:</p>



<ul>
<li>Copyright infringement against all defendants (related to handling of the datasets containing content from The Times, handling of models allegedly derivative of the datasets, and the ultimate output)</li>



<li>Vicarious copyright infringement (the idea that Microsoft and various OpenAI affiliates directed, controlled and profited from infringement committed by OpenAI OpCo LLC and OpenAI, LLC)</li>



<li>Contributory copyright infringement by all defendants (the idea that the defendants contribute to any infringement perpetrated by end users of the models)</li>



<li>DMCA Section 1202 violations by all defendants regarding removal of copyright management information from items in the datasets</li>



<li>Common law unfair competition by misappropriation by all defendants (related to training AI models on The Times’ content and offering AI services that reproduce The Times’ content in identical or substantially similar form (and without citing The Times or linking to the underlying content))</li>



<li>Trademark dilution by all defendants (arguing the the AIs dilute the quality associated with The Times’ trademarks by falsely claiming certain content originates from The Times)</li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike other complaints, this one doesn’t spend too much time explaining how AI models work or teeing up the analogies they plan to use in court. Instead, the complaint includes multiple extremely clear-cut examples of the LLMs spitting out The Times’ content nearly verbatim or stating bald-faced lies about The Times’ content. Many of the other complaints admitted they weren’t able to find clear-cut examples of infringing output, nebulously resting their claims on the idea that all output is, by definition, infringing. Here, Microsoft and OpenAI haven’t just used The Times’ content to teach the AI how to communicate, they’ve launched news-specific services and features that ingest both archived content and brand new articles from The Times. The other plaintiffs also weren’t able to argue that their specific content, out of the trillions of pieces of training data in the datasets, was particularly important for creating quality AIs. Here, The Times convincingly argues that its content was extremely valuable for training the AIs, both because of the quantity involved as well as the fact that the training process involved instructing the AI to prioritize The Times’ content.</p>



<p>This is probably the strongest AI-related complaint out there. I think it’s quite possible that a jury or judge angry at Microsoft and OpenAI for offering services that compete with and undercut The Times is more likely to also find that the training activities also constituted copyright infringement and that the model itself is a derivative work of the training data, without thinking too hard about a scenario where the ultimate model doesn’t supplant the business or livelihood of the copyright holders in the training data. It’s definitely a case where “bad facts invite bad law.”</p>



<p>This case is also notable for the fact that it explicitly goes after the defendants for their AIs’ hallucinations. An AI summarizing a news event based on one or more news articles opens a Pandora’s box worth of debate about the line between uncopyrightable facts and copyrightable expression, as well as how/if those same standards should be applied to a computer “reading” the news. But the hallucinations aren’t facts; they’re lies. And even if the defendants prevail in arguing that the AIs are mostly just providing people with unprotectable facts, there’s very little to shield them from liability for the lies, both with respect to trademark dilution claims, but also with respect to potential libel or privacy-related claims that might be brought by other individuals. Copyright law can forgive a certain amount of infringement under certain circumstances but these other areas of law are far less flexible.</p>



<p>The other really interesting thing about this complaint is the extent to which it describes the business of The Times – how much work the journalists put in to create the articles, the physical risks they take during reporting, the value of good journalism in general, and The Times’ struggle with adjusting to an online world. The complaint paints a picture of an honorable industry repeatedly pants-ed by the tech industry, which historically has only come to heel under enormous public pressure and the Herculean efforts of The Times to continue to survive. It’s interesting because US copyright law decisively rejects the idea that copyright protection is due for what is commonly referred to as “sweat of the brow.” In other words, the fact that it takes great effort or resources to compile certain information (like a phonebook), doesn’t entitle that work to any copyright protection – others may use it freely. And where there is copyrightable expression, the difficulty in creating it is irrelevant. So, is all this background aimed solely at supporting the unfair competition claim? Is it a quiet way of asking the court to ignore the “sweat of the brow” precedent, to the extent that it’s ultimately argued by the defendants, in favor of protecting the more sympathetic party? Maybe they’re truly concerned that the courts no longer recognize the value of journalism and need a history lesson? No other AI-related complaint has worked so hard to justify the very existence, needs, and frustrations of its plaintiffs.</p>



<p>Unless Microsoft and OpenAI hustle to strike a deal with the New York Times, this is definitely going to be the case to watch in the next year or two. Not only does it embody some of the strongest legal arguments related to copyright, it is likely to become a lightning rod for many interests who will use it to wage a proxy war on their behalf. The case, and especially the media coverage of the case, will likely embitter the public and politicians even further against big tech, treating its success as a zero sum game vis a vis journalists and creators more broadly. It’s the kind of case that ultimately results in federal legislation, either codifying a judgment or statutorily reversing it.&nbsp;</p>
