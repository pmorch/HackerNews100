<p>We’ve upgraded Servo to <strong>SpiderMonkey 128</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32769">#32769</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32882">#32882</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32951">#32951</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33048">#33048</a>), <strong>WebRender 0.65</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32930">#32930</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33073">#33073</a>), <strong>wgpu 22.0</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32827">#32827</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32873">#32873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32981">#32981</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33209">#33209</a>), and <strong>Rust 1.80.1</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Hmikihiro">@Hmikihiro</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32896">#32896</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33008">#33008</a>).</p>
<p><strong>WebXR</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33245">#33245</a>) and <strong>flexbox</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33186">#33186</a>) are now <strong>enabled by default</strong>, and web APIs that return promises now correctly <strong>reject the promise on failure</strong>, rather than throwing an exception (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32923">#32923</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32950">#32950</a>).</p>
<p>To get there, we revamped our <strong>WebXR API</strong>, landing support for <strong>Gamepad</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32860">#32860</a>), and updates to <strong>hand input</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32958">#32958</a>), XRBoundedReferenceSpace (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33176">#33176</a>), XRFrame (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33102">#33102</a>), XRInputSource (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33155">#33155</a>), XRPose (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33146">#33146</a>), XRSession (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33007">#33007</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33059">#33059</a>), XRTargetRayMode (#33155), XRView (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33007">#33007</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33145">#33145</a>), and XRWebGLLayer (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33157">#33157</a>).</p>
<p>And to top it all off, you can now call <strong>makeXRCompatible() on WebGL2RenderingContext</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/msub2">@msub2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33097">#33097</a>), not just on WebGLRenderingContext.</p>
<p>The biggest flexbox features that landed this month are the <strong>‘gap’ property</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32891">#32891</a>), <strong>‘align-content: stretch’</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32906">#32906</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32913">#32913</a>), and the <strong>‘start’</strong> and <strong>‘end’</strong> values on <strong>‘align-items’</strong> and <strong>‘align-self’</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33032">#33032</a>), as well as basic support for <strong>‘flex-direction: column’</strong> and <strong>‘column-reverse’</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33031">#33031</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33068">#33068</a>).</p>
<p><strong>‘position: relative’</strong> is now supported on flex items (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33151">#33151</a>), <strong>‘z-index’ always creates stacking contexts</strong> for flex items (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32961">#32961</a>), and we now give flex items and flex containers their correct <strong>intrinsic sizes</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32854">#32854</a>).</p>
<p>We’re now working on support for <strong>bidirectional text</strong>, with architectural changes to the fragment tree (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33030">#33030</a>) and ‘writing-mode’ interfaces (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/atbrakhi">@atbrakhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33082">#33082</a>), and now partial support for the <strong>‘unicode-bidi’ property</strong> and the <strong>dir attribute</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/atbrakhi">@atbrakhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33148">#33148</a>).
Note that the <code>dir=auto</code> value is not yet supported.</p>

<p><a href="https://book.servo.org/running-servoshell.html">Servo-the-browser</a> now has a <strong>redesigned toolbar</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Melchizedek6809">@Melchizedek6809</a>, 33179) and <strong>tabbed browsing</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/webbeef">@webbeef</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Wuelle">@Wuelle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33100">#33100</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33229">#33229</a>)!
This includes a slick <strong>new tab page</strong>, taking advantage of a new API that lets Servo embedders register <strong>custom protocol handlers</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/webbeef">@webbeef</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33104">#33104</a>).</p>
<p>Servo now runs better on Windows, with keyboard navigation now fixed (<a href="https://github.com/crbrz">@crbrz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33252">#33252</a>), <code>--output</code> to PNG also fixed (<a href="https://github.com/crbrz">@crbrz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32914">#32914</a>), and fixes for some font- and GPU-related bugs (<a href="https://github.com/crbrz">@crbrz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33045">#33045</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33177">#33177</a>), which were causing misaligned glyphs with incorrect colors on servo<!-- no link -->.org (<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/32459">#32459</a>) and duckduckgo<!-- no link -->.com (<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/33094">#33094</a>), and corrupted images on wikipedia<!-- no link -->.org (<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/33170">#33170</a>).</p>
<p>Our <strong>devtools support</strong> is becoming very capable after <a href="https://github.com/eerii">@eerii</a>’s final month of work on their internship project, with Servo now supporting the <strong>HTML tree</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/eerii">@eerii</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32655">#32655</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32884">#32884</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32888">#32888</a>) and the <strong>Styles and Computed panels</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/eerii">@eerii</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33025">#33025</a>).
Stay tuned for a more in-depth post about the Servo devtools!</p>

<p>Running servoshell immediately after building it is now <strong>several seconds faster on macOS</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/32928">#32928</a>).</p>
<p>We now <strong>run clippy in CI</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33150">#33150</a>), together with the existing tidy checks in a dedicated linting job.</p>
<p>Servo now has <strong>new CI runners</strong> for Windows builds (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/33081">#33081</a>), thanks to your donations, <strong>cutting Windows-only build times by 70%</strong>!
We’re not stopping at Windows though, and with new runners for Linux builds just around the corner, your WPT try builds will soon be a lot faster.</p>
<p>We’ve been running some <strong>triage meetings</strong> to investigate GitHub issues and coordinate our work on them.
The next Servo issue triage meeting is on <strong>2 September at 10:00 UTC</strong>.

<p>While programming on my Mac and converting decimal numbers to hex and binary and using Apple’s Calculator for it – because it is built-in and works decent – I thought, I saw some wobbly lines of numbers.</p>

<p>My first thought was: my eyes are getting tired. But it looked annoyingly wobbly and there went my focus on the task. I had to investigate, what was going on. I took a screenshot. Can you see it in the image above?</p>



<p>Let me highlight the annoying detail in the image below.</p>

<p>Maybe you are reading this on a tiny screen, or your eyes are tired, but also… I had to see it for myself. Here is a zoomed in version below:</p>

<p>Yes, indeed! Some digits in the binary display section are off by one pixel. Nice anti-aliased rendering by the way, but still, why are some digits misplaced by a pixel? </p>



<p>How did this happen? I should add, the calculator app has been open for many days. Maybe the UI coordinate system is using floats and a rounding error aggregated over many days… I’d love to find out, but I guess I won’t. Anyways, at least my vision is not that bad.</p>



<p>I would contact Apple, if there was a feedback option, but there isn’t, so I won’t. Instead I’ll just share the bug on the Internet. Enjoy!</p>

		<p>Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement and 'convert'. But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative and interesting.</p>
		<p>- <a href="https://neustadt.fr/index.html">Parimal Satyal</a>, 25 May 2020</p>
		</header>
		        
		<p>Every website redesign begins with inspiration. </p>

		<p>For this one, there were two: Anders' <a href="https://anders.unix.se/">clean, readable website</a>, which inspired the homepage, and <a href="https://marijn.uk/index.html">Marijn's site</a>, which reminded me just how <em>fun</em> the web can be. The colours, graphics, <a href="https://marijn.uk/music/">creative navigation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar">interesting ideas</a>... the simple fact of clicking through the pages of someone's personal website in 2020 made me nostalgic of the web of the late 90s and early 2000s that I grew up with.</p>

		<p>Some of you might have read my previous article, <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/">Against an Increasingly User Hostile Web</a>. In it, I argue that we are replacing an open web that connects and empowers with one that restricts and commoditises people. I talk about how the modern web of surveillance, bloat and walled gardens is at odds with the open web that I love. I was pleasantly surprised by how much the sentiment seemed to be shared by so many other people who emailed me, <a href="https://www.eduardomorais.com/stream/id/3519">wrote responses on their own blog</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15611122">discussed it</a> on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/5bi46y/against_increasingly_user_hostile_web">online forums</a>. Despite being two and a half years old, that article rather disappointingly still reflects the state of the web today. </p>

		<p>But stumbling upon Marijn’s site gave me hope. It led me down a rabbit hole of many other small websites made by people with all kinds of interests: movies, aviation, music, art, computers. It reminded me that the creative, personal, fun web I grew up with is not a thing of the past. It’s still here in 2020. You just have to know where to look.</p>

		<p>My aim is not to convince you that everything was better in the past; it wasn't. You had trojans, malware, endless pop-ups, terrible security practices, browser incompatibility, slow Java applets. No, technically, the modern web is more secure and more usable.</p> 

		<p>This essay is my attempt to show you what the small and independent web can look like, why it’s different from the the sites that dominate web traffic today, why it's worth exploring and how easy it is for anyone to be a part of it.</p>

		<h2 id="retro-redesign">Retro Redesign</h2>

		<p>On my <a href="https://neustadt.fr/">homepage</a>, I mention that this website is “a tribute to the creative web of the 90s”. This is not simply because this website has animated gifs and a <a href="https://users2.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&amp;i=g26-37520-60">guestbook</a>. The <em>way</em> I built it is also inspired by how I built my earliest websites: everything is written in <strong>plain HTML</strong>.</p>

		<p>No content management systems, no generators, no templates, no themes, no plugins. Just plain markup and styling, the most basic of the basic building blocks of the web. </p>

		<p>I didn’t originally plan to do it like this. I previously <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/crafting-a-simple-blog-with-metalsmith">used a static site generator</a> to output plain HTML and was simply working on a new design template for that. But my three-year-old node.js setup was now spewing error messages, telling me some dependencies had to be updated and that a plugin was no longer compatible. Because I'm lazy and didn't want to fix any of that, I wondered if I couldn’t just do it all manually instead and save myself the trouble. </p>

		<p>So I did. I decided to hand-code everything in plain HTML and CSS, manually link all the pages and even hand-write the RSS feed. And to be honest, I haven’t had this much fun making a website since when I first started playing around with <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/html-editors/microsoft-frontpage-97">Microsoft Frontpage</a> and <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/graphic-software/adobe-photoshop-4-0">Adobe Photoshop 4.0</a> in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>

		<p>This approach wouldn't work for a bigger website. But for a small one like mine with about 10 total pages, it has many obvious benefits: next to no dependencies, easy to maintain, reasonably future proof, easily portable and most important of all, terribly fun to work on. I stayed up till six in the morning for two straight days working on the redesign, not because I couldn’t sleep but because I didn’t want to stop. Admittedly, about 30% of that time was spent scouring <a href="https://gifcities.org/">GifCities.org</a> and the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> for animated GIFs and backgrounds. (You might notice that each page of the website has a different background, including some with <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/china-one-nation-how-many-languages/">original art</a> by my friend).</p>

		<p>Redesigning my website this way inspired me to scour archives of old websites for interesting relics from the early web. This in turned led me to the fun, creative websites that are actively maintained even today. </p>

		<p>To understand what these small websites represent and why I think they are important, we need to start in the past.</p>

		<h2 id="first-webpages">The First Webpages</h2>

		<p>The web was still in its infancy in the early 90s. You probably know the story.</p>

		<p>It had only just been <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web">invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> in 1991 and released into the <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/licensing-web">public domain</a> in 1993, making it available for free to anyone in the world to use and build on. In its very early days, it was really only accessible to the more technical crowd, much like <em>Gopher</em>, <em>FTP</em>, <em>Usenet</em> and other internet protocols at the time. It wasn't until the first easy-to-use graphical browser <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/mosaic">Mosaic</a> was released for free in 1993 that regular computer users would discover the web for the first time. Others like myself discovered it later still when the Mosaic-spinoff <a href="http://sillydog.org/netscape/">Netscape Navigator</a> (the foundation of today's <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>) and Internet Explorer became commonplace. </p>

		<p>It was all terribly exciting. Unlike traditional media, you could now speak back and participate. It was the first interplanetary communication system where anyone, anywhere in the world, could make a page and share their thoughts and ideas with the world. Netscape would later even include <a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/Pub/Fac/composer.html">an editor</a> that let users make webpages visually, the same as using a word-processor ("WYSIWYG", as it was called back then: <em>what you see is what you get</em>). The goal was to enable anyone, even those without the technical skills, to put a page up.</p>

		<p>But if you wanted your web page to be "on the web", where would you put it? </p>

		<p>You needed a web host of some sort to store the pages and share a public address so other people could visit. It would ideally also be free so you could try things for fun without having to think about it too much. That's where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980704165228/http://www20.geocities.com/join/freehp.html">Geocities</a> came in, along with other free web hosts like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052634/http://www.tripod.lycos.com/">Tripod</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000229235048/http://www.fortunecity.com/build/index.html">Fortunecity</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815053429/http://www.freeservers.com/">Freeservers</a>. They were perhaps the biggest catalysts to democratising the web. </p>

		<figure>

			<figcaption>Geocities introduction page from February 1998, accessed via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980213154923/http://www13.geocities.com:80/main/info/">Internet Archive</a></figcaption> 
		</figure>

		<p>It was so simple, anyone who wanted to could create a free account and build a website to share their hobbies and ideas. And share they did! People made websites about virtually everything: music, philosophy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011004132631/http://www.geocities.com/~intransit1/home/home_frm.html">art projects</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010424064639/http://www.geocities.com/spunk1111/">ASCII art</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815075236/http://www.pezcentral.com/pezmenu.html">candy</a>, and <a href="https://geocities.restorativland.org/Athens/Olympus/1406/main.html">about their lives</a>. </p>

		<p>A key detail was that most people who made these websites were neither professionals nor companies; they were simply people who wanted to share their interests. Like I did back in 2001 with my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020103123131/http://www.geocities.com:80/gammarayfan">unofficial fansite for German metal band Gamma Ray</a>: </p>

		</figure>

		<p>But how would someone go about finding these pages? We didn't have Google in the early days. Other search engines like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980214192548/http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970630113649/http://www06.excite.com/">Excite</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980206192654/http://www.northernlight.com/">Northern Lights</a> did exist but were nowhere near as efficient as modern search engines. Finding something you were interested in was not as simple as typing a few words and getting to that information in one click.</p>

		<p>No, the web was much more of an adventure. It was a <em>place</em> that you wandered to discover new areas, like exploring the vast open seas. A new virtual space that lead to all kinds of strange, interesting, exciting places. This is what the web was like, at least, in our collective imagination.</p>


		<h2 id="masters-navigators">Masters and Navigators</h2>

		<p>The web was a different kind of place in those early years, and we had different words to talk about it. In an article titled <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/nov/30/oldweb-today/">Cyberspace, the old-fashioned way</a>, authors at the Rhizome project make a very important point:</p>

		<blockquote>Today's web browsers want to be invisible, merging with the visual environment of the desktop in an effort to convince users to treat "the cloud" as just an extension of their hard drive. <strong>In the 1990s, browser design took nearly the opposite approach, using iconography associated with travel to convey the feeling of going on a journey.</strong> Netscape Navigator, which used a ship's helm as its logo, made a very direct link with the nautical origins of the prefix cyber-, while Internet Explorer’s logo promised to take the user around the whole globe. </blockquote>

		<figure>

			<figcaption>Old logos of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer</figcaption> 
		</figure>

		<p>Navigation. Exploration. Browsing. Surfing.  The web was akin to a virtual manifestation of physical space. We even had a word for it: <em>webspace</em>. In Geocities, this was expressed with the notion of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980704165140/http://www20.geocities.com/neighborhoods/">neighborhoods</a></em>, creatively-named categories like <em>Area51</em> for sci-fi, <em>Heartland</em> for families and pets, <em>RainForest</em> for the environment, <em>Vienna</em> for classical music, <em>CapeCanaveral</em> for science and mathematics.</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/geocities-neighbourhoods-1998.png" alt="A partial list of neighborhoods avialable on Geocities in 1998">
			<figcaption>Neighborhoods avialable on Geocities in 1998, accessed via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980703151237/http://www11.geocities.com/neighborhoods/">Internet Archive</a></figcaption> 
		</figure>

		<p>Another word that was very common back in the Geocities days that has since died out is the word "webmaster" (mostly gender-neutral, although sometimes declined to the feminine "webmistress"). The idea was that you created a <em>space</em> on the web, of which you were the <em>master</em>. You welcomed visitors (sometimes with a splash screen), guided them around by explaining what the site was about and the different spaces available to them (usually on the home page) and reminded them to leave a word on the guestbook on their way out.</p>

		<p>But the semantics of the web of yore made sense in the context of how you <em>practically</em> interacted with it. You very rarely just came in for one specific thing and then immediately left like you might today; you usually <em>entered</em> a website and looked around. You browsed.</p>

		<p>Which takes us back to the original question of how other <em>internautes</em> found your website in the first place. You were lucky if your small site showed up in pre-Google search engines, but even if it did, it would mean that somebody was actively looking for it. But not everybody who visited your website <em>was</em> looking for anything specific. They might simply have wanted to find other websites about a topic they were interested it.</p>

		<p>One way of doing so was by browsing directories, like the Geocities neighbourhoods: lists of websites often arranged by categories and sub-categories. In fact, most search engines were also directories, or <em>portals</em> as some were called back then.
		</p>

		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>One of the biggest ones was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010206123038/http://www.dmoz.org/about.html">DMOZ open-directory project</a>, based on the original Mozilla directories, whose goal it was to <em>"produce the most comprehensive directory of the web, by relying on a vast army of volunteer editors"</em>. You can still browse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010224172816/http://www.dmoz.org/">a 2001 archive of the old directory</a> to get a sense of how it worked.</p>

		</figure>

		<p>The other way to discover new websites relied on a key feature of the web: hyperlinks. You would go to one website and find your way to many others, much like if you go to my "<a href="https://neustadt.fr/retro-stuff">Retro Stuff</a>" page and follow one of the links to something interesting elsewhere on the web. This idea of linking to things <em>elsewhere</em> was particularly common; most websites had a "links" page with their own personal collection of interesting webpages.</p>

		<p>This cross-linking was the main way I personally discovered my favourite websites, which I would then add to my bookmarks to be able to find them again later. In fact, the practice of cross-linking had an intersting cultural element: <em>webrings</em>. </p>

		</figure>

		<p><a href="http://brisray.com/web/webrings.htm">Webrings</a> were "circular" collections of websites, often around a topic or a theme. The idea was that you could go from one website to another by clicking on the "next" or "previous" buttons usually placed on the bottom of each member's homepage. These have also largely disappeared.</p>

		<h2 id="modern-gatekeepers">Modern Gatekeepers</h2>

		<p>Today, most of the time spent on the web is either <em>on</em> a small number of very dominant platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, or mediated <em>through</em> them. </p>

		<p>There is so much "content" that is constantly pushed at you as a user that very few of us actually venture out to browse and explore anymore. We simply don't need to. But these platforms thrive on "user engagement"—likes, comments, clicks and shares—and their algorithms are more likely to give visibility to content that generates this behavior. Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms based on what they think you already like and will <em>engage</em> with. It's the opposite of exploration. </p>

		<p>When you're not <em>receiving</em> information passively and instead actually actively looking for something, you most likely have the same singular point of entry as about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">87% of all web users</a>: Google.</p>

		<p>Google has become the de facto gatekeeper of the web, an arbiter of what is useful and what should get visibility. Except, most websites that appear on the first page, the links that you are most likely to click on—<a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats">less than 1% of searchers click on something in the second page</a>—are designed to be there by optimising for Google's algorithms. One consequence of this  is that most of the websites that people get to "organically" are created by professionals and marketers who "position" themselves on those keywords. This means that the smaller, amateur web gets hidden in the shadows of web professionals who design around specific keywords and audiences.</p>

			<figcaption>Google's results for "bartending recipes" won't take you to the small web</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Not only is Google largely a monopoly in search— other search engines like Bing, DuckDuckGo and Qwant are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">still far behind in adoption</a>—it is also the biggest ad selling platform. Last year, it represented "31,1% of worldwide ad spending, or $103,73 billion" (<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-digital-ad-spending-2019">source</a>). The power that comes from being in such a position, along with being present in almost all major websites (through their widely-used analytics platform, despite the <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/OIR-02-2018-0056/full/pdf?title=protecting-privacy-on-the-web-a-study-of-https-and-google-analytics-implementation-in-academic-library-websites">numerous privacy concerns</a>) means it can actively push its own vision of the web.</p>

		<p>And this web is quite different from the kind of "small web" crafted by webmasters of the 90s and early 2000s. Google's web has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214003848/https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">different set of values and vocabulary</a> that come with it: personalisation, insights, engagement, conversion, performance, optimisation. </p>


		<h2 id="commercial-web-of-marketing">The Commercial Web (of Marketing)</h2>

		<p>There has always been a place for commerce and marketing on the web.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/amazon-com-1995">Amazon</a> was already selling books online back in 1995, <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/ebay-1997">eBay</a> was launched in 1997 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970605120422/http://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> sold over a million dollars worth of equipment by the end of the same year. By the 2000s, despite the <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/">dot com bust</a>, online commerce was growing. This development was natural; the web enabled sellers to reach more distant clients without having to rely on phone orders, fax or the postal system. The commercial web co-existed and grew with the personal, amateur one. The open nature of the web meant that all kinds of websites could thrive.</p>
	
		<p>But today's web is <em>mostly</em> commercial. The smaller web of individuals has neither the resources nor the will to compete for visibility and audience the way the commercial web does.</p>

		<p>Companies and marketers understood that the web presented new opportunities to sell more and <em>target</em> users based on their online activity. They started pouring money into digital ad strategies, analysing how people used the web, what they talk about, what they search for and what they click on. Marketing companies convinced brands that you had to be online and produce content to be more relevant because that's where their customers already were. They invented words like "native advertising" and "sponsored content" (content made to look like a regular articles but are really paid advertising). Companies started pouring money into their digital strategies to understand and alter influence the behavior of internet users to their advantage.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<a href="https://www.quantcast.com/products/measure-audience-insights/"><img src="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/quantcast.jpg" alt="Companies like Quantcast offer detailed behavioral/psychographic data on us web users, including our actions across different websites, to marketers to track and influence us"></a>
			<figcaption>Companies like <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/products/measure-audience-insights/">Quantcast</a> offer detailed behavioral/<em>psychographic</em> data on us web users, including our actions across different websites, to marketers to track and influence us.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>With its content strategy, analytics (the surveillance infrastructure that I <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web">spoke about in my previous article</a>) and search engine optimisation, the commercial web brought a completely different set of priorities: to <em>engage</em> their "audience", <em>convert</em> them and <em>retain</em> them for as long as possible.</p>

		<p>For them, the web was just another marketing channel.</p>

		<p>Compared to the small web, this commercial web is tactical and predatory. It can dynamically generate hundreds of pages around common search queries. It can follow web users across different websites, analyse their interactions, and use that information to target them more precisely. It also has serious resources. Just last year, companies spent <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-digital-ad-spending-2019">over 300 billion euros</a> in online digital advertising, most of this money going to the same platforms and gatekeepers—Google and Facebook—that sell their ability to better target you based on the information you give them. </p>

		<p><strong>What this means is that web users end up interacting and spending most of their time on the visible, predatory commercial web, while the very long tail of smaller, amateur websites remains hidden in the noise.</strong></p>

		<h2 id="product-oriented-website">The Product-oriented Website</h2>

		<p>The design of the modern commercial web is also "sanitised": it is polished, follows conventions and is optimised for efficiency. This is one of the reasons so many websites you go to today look and feel the same. The codes of the commercial web have become so dominant that we have forgotten that the small web still exists and has a completely different priorities.</p>

		<p>Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well:</p>

		<p><em>Don't use too many colours.  Write short, catchy headlines. Don't let content be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important information above the fold. Don't make users think. Follow conventions.</em></p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/neil-patel-design.jpg" alt="An SEO person's idea of good design for better conversions">
			<figcaption>An SEO person's idea of <em><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/web-design-conversions/">Universal Web Design Principles That Improve Usability And Conversion</a></em></figcaption> 
		</figure>

		<p>Modern websites are designed to direct user behavior towards certain goals: a purchase, a click, a share or a sign-up. The words, the colours, the message are tailored to these goals, much like packaging on products in the super market. </p>

		<p>A 2008 article called by Smashing Magazine called <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/">10 Principles Of Good Website Design</a> was the top result when I searched for "<a href="https://startpage.com/do/metasearch.pl?query=good%20web%20design">good web design</a>" whilst writing this essay. There are many others, some more recent, but they all pretty much say the same thing. The author of this one even clearly begins by stating that <em>"[...] user-centric design has established as a standard approach for successful and profit-oriented web design</em>".</p>

		<p>But the web is not always "profit-oriented" and it certainly does not need to be "user-centric" (and I say this as a UX consultant). If it were, there would be very little creativity and self-expression left. The rich diversity of the web would be reduced to the online equivalent of a massive, orderly, clinical shopping mall meant to drive sales. No, the web can just as well be "author-centered", hobby-centered or even be <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/archives/6551">dog-centered</a>!</p>

		<p>It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can also be art. <strong>The web is also a creative and cultural space that need not confine itself to the conventions defined by commercial product design and marketing</strong>.</p>

		<h2 id="web-as-creative-space">The Web as a Creative Space</h2>

		<p>With the dominance of the commercial web and the normalisation of its code and techniques, it is easy for most people to think that the web is a complex machine. Most websites today are built with sophisticated content management systems, SEO and social media strategies, multiple plugins, detailed analytics and audience tracking, optimized for different breakpoints and served via a global CDN.</p> 

		<p>But the web is really a lot simpler than that. You really only need two things: a web host and HTML (and basic CSS for formatting). And you don't need to make it "user-centered"; much like the early webmasters on Geocities carving out their own corner of the web, you can express yourself any way you want. It’s the difference between product and art.</p>

		<p><strong>A painter wouldn’t add more red to her painting or change the composition because market data showed that people liked it better. It’s her creative vision; some people might like it, others might not. But it is her creation, with her own rules. The question of "performance" is simply irrelevant. It's the same thing with the small web.</strong></p>

		<p>If the commercial web is "industrial", you could say that the small web is "artisanal". One is not better than the other. They serve different needs and both can co-exist in an open web. It would nevertheless be a shame if we only spent time on the commercial web and never got the opportunity to experience the creativity, passion and quirkiness of the small web.</p>

		<p>To show you what the it can look like and how different it can be from modern websites, I have collected a few examples that I think illustrate the richness of the small web.</p>

		<h2 id="highlights-from-the-past">Highlights: From the Past</h2>

		<p>We will first look at small websites from the past and then move on to ones that are up and running today. </p>

		<p>To be able to dig up these websites and give you access to them, I am grateful to the wonderful and important archival work done by: </p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a>, which, thanks to the 439 billion web pages saved since the mid 90s, lets you travel back in time and see how a website looked in the past.</li>
			<li><a href="https://restorativland.org/">Restorativland</a>, a "restored visual gallery of the archived Geocities sites, sorted by neighborhood".</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>On to the examples.</p>
		
		
				<h3>A Laurel &amp; Hardy Fansite</h3>
				<p>A fan-made site from 1998 about comedy duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Norville Hardy. The author has this to say about the website:</p>
				<blockquote>
					On this website you will find: over one hundred pictures, a small collection of sound files, the complete movie list - from the silent eara to the talkies. Ever wondered what they were singing? Go to the lyrics page and read the text. Laurel &amp; Hardy were the stars but they couldn't have done it without the help of others. You can see who they were on the Supporting Cast page.
				</blockquote>
				<p>If you go to the <a href="https://geocities.restorativland.org/Hollywood/Studio/5352/siteinfo.html">siteinfo</a> page, you’ll notice that the “why” of the website is simply “why not!!”. Why not indeed!

		<h3>Fractal Explorer</h3>
		<p>A complete website about fractals by Fabio Cesari, (then) a 24 year old student of computer engineering at the University of Bologna, Italy. Includes very clear explanations, image galleries and step-by-step guided tours:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Many people have probably been fascinated by the infinite complexity and beauty of fractals. I wrote this brief tutorial to explain, in simple terms, how the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets are generated. This document provides an informal introduction to these subjects, and is only intended to be a starting point to learn more about fractals and fractal geometry.

		<h3>The National Coca-Cola Bottle Clearing House</h3>
		<p>This website is almost certainly a definitive list of every single commemorative Coca-Cola bottle since the 70s. There are some surprising entries. For example, did you know there was an 8oz (~240ml) <em>Dominos Pizza International Expo 1991</em> edition, or that such an expo existed at all? Or a 10oz (~300ml) <em>English Royal Wedding</em> one in 1982?</p>

		<h3>NetHistory</h3>		
		<p>Before the Internet existed, BITNET was “<em>an early world leader in network communications for the research and education communities, and helped lay the groundwork for the subsequent introduction of the internet, especially outside the US</em>". (<a href="https://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_bitnet.htm">LivingInternet.com</a>).</p> 	
		<p>This website is an “informal history of BITNET and the Internet”:</p>	
		<blockquote>
			If you're looking for a dry, formal history of the Internet, look elsewhere. The purpose of NetHistory is to give you a feeling for what it was like in the pioneering days of BITNET and the Internet. Hopefully, you will gain some perspective and come to understand the early Internet experience (although one could argue that the experience in question is a lot like sitting in front of a mainframe terminal in the middle of the night with a Twinkie-and-Jolt buzz). At worst, you should find it entertaining. 
		</blockquote>		
		<p>NetHistory has extensive archives of early network publications (VM/COM, NetMonth, FSFNet, DargonZine, Nutworks, The Gilding Byte among others) and “personal insights of the people who were there while BITNET and Internet history was being made”.</p>

		<h3>joan stark's ASCII Art Gallery </h3>
		<p>Think text art is dull? This artist has something to tell you:</p>
		<blockquote>
			You might not think so after visiting this website. There is much more to these low bandwidth graphics than smileys and emoticons. ASCII Art has progressed beyond being a simple computer graphics technique and has become a popular art form. You'll be amazed at what can be created by only using ASCII (American Standard Code of Information Interchange) characters. Some of the text graphics at this site are html-colorized, some are JavaScript-animated, others are simply text. All are unique, created by hand, and certainly not the same ol' boring text art that you might be expecting!

		<p>As excited as I was to find these wonderful relics, I was even more excited to learn that the small web exists today just as it did back when I was a kid. It's just less visible. Among the projects contributing to keeping the small web alive, three are particularly exciting to me:  </p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://wiby.me/">Wiby.me</a> is a search engine for old-school, interesting and informative webpages, with a useful "<a href="https://wiby.me/surprise/">surprise me</a>" button that takes you to a random result. </li>

		<h3>Ottaviana's Kitchen</h3>
		<p>This website from 1996 is still up today and features a family's Italian recipes passed down from generation to generation:</p>
		<blockquote>My Grandparents were immigrants from Italy. They came to Ellis Island, in search of the great American dream. This was where my mother was born in Newark, NJ. The recipes were passed to her from her mother, and then passed to me from mine. Since I have no	children of my own, what better way to pass on these recipes but	on my web page so everyone can enjoy them, and maybe start their	own tradition with them. So for now, Buon Appetito.</blockquote>

		<h3>Europäische Schmetterlinge</h3>
		<p>This is a German website about European butterflies created in 1998 and maintained until 2005 by Mario Maier. But it isn't just <em>any</em> old website about butterflies; this one is a near-exhaustive collection of almost all butterflies in Europe organised by genus/species, each with a description, an indication of its "flight time" and the corresponding caterpillar's plants of choice, along with photos (most taken by the author himself).</p>

			<p>I got the idea to this database when I saw a program called Bartender for the Amiga. I wanted to create a useful web-service, and decided to make something similar for the World Wide Web. Remember that this was just at the same time as the Web (I prefer to call it that) became popular with not only students and people connected to the Internet at work, but also to people at home.</p>
			<p>So, during spring 1995 I started to collect drink recipes from various Internet sources, including the mentioned program. One of the main sources was The (Un)Official Internet Bartender's Guide and postings to the newsgroup <code>rec.food.drink</code>.</p>
			<p>Then I decided to let my visitors help building the database. A lot of people make their own drinks, or have their own favourite, so why not let them add it to the database? I created a simple web form that visitors could use to add their drinks. It bacame a success!</p>
		<p>Today, about 1500 of the drinks have been added by me, and the rest have been contributed by visitors.</p>

			'Crystalis' is an Action-RPG for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan in April of 1990 and in the United States the following July. It was praised by critics at the time for its graphics and gameplay and it inspired a devout, if somewhat small, fan following. In Japan the game was called ゴッド・スレイヤー はるか天空のソナタ or God Slayer: Sonata of the Distant Sky.

		<h2 id="your-own-corner">Your Own Corner of the Web</h2>
		<p>So the small web still exists, and is still giving us all kinds of websites to browse through and discover. 
		</p>
		<p>As fun as it is to explore what's out there, the best part is really to join in and make your own website. Not on closed platforms or on social media mediated by ad companies, but simply in your own little corner of the web. It's the best way to see how simple and open the web really is.</p>
		<p>You could easily put up those drawings you've been making, share your thoughts and ideas, or reviews of your favourite whiskies. Make a website to share your writing tips or your best recipes. Or a list of your favourite addresses in your city for travelers who might be visiting.</p>
		<p>All you would need is to learn basic markup (HTML) and styling (CSS), set up a site on a free host like <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities.org</a> and start playing. As you can imagine, Neocities is a Geocities-like free web host (minus the ads) whose mission it is to "<em>make the web fun again by giving you back control of how you express yourself online</em>". Discovering and joining Neocities was one of the reasons I got so excited about the small web. You can spend hours and hours <a href="https://neocities.org/browse?sort_by=last_updated">browsing through</a> the many sites hosted there, or just get a free account to play with.</p>

		<p>If you don't know how to make websites, HTMLDog has excellent tutorials to learn <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/">basic HTML</a> and <a href="https://htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/">basic CSS</a>. If you prefer video, Khan Academy has an excellent free course for beginners called "<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Making Webpages</a>" that looks very complete.</p>
		<p>If you have no prior experience, it might take you a while to get a hang of how to change text sizes and colours, add images and link between pages, but I think that’s part of the fun. </p>
		<p>You could of course always just get a pre-made template or a theme and use that, but it's a different exercise. It’s the difference between buying art and learning how to paint or sculpt. The end result might be the same but the exercise is very different. It might be more practical but is nothing like creating an HTML page from scratch and putting it up on the web for the world to see. </p>
		<p>Another great thing about the web is that you can always view the source of any public website to take inspiration and learn. Make sure you pick simple, basic ones; the modern web is full of bloated websites that make HTML unreadable. This website, for example, only uses basic HTML and CSS and I invite you to play with <a href="https://github.com/parimalsatyal/neu/blob/master/essays/the-small-web/index.html">the code</a> to your heart’s content. It’s all in the <a href="https://neustadt.fr/license.txt">public domain</a>, so you can even copy all of it and modify it (and you don’t have to credit me or even link back, it’s all free).</p>

        Tapedeck.org is a project of <a href="http://www.neckcns.com/" target="_blank">neckcns.com</a>, built to showcase the amazing beauty and (sometimes) weirdness found in the <strong>designs of the common <a href="#" onclick="MM_showHideLayers('intro','','hide','about','','hide','audiotape','','show','sendusyourtapes','','hide'); return false">audio tape cassette</a></strong>. There's an amazing range of designs, starting from the early 60's functional cassette designs, moving through the colourful playfulness of the 70's audio tapes to amazing shape variations during the 80's and 90's. We hope you enjoy these tapes as much as we do!</p>
        <div id="audiotape"><p><img src="http://www.tapedeck.org/img/hl_about-audio-tapes.gif" alt="about audio tapes">
        <br>
        The <strong>compact audio cassette medium</strong> for audio storage was introduced by Philips in 1963 under the name <strong>Compact Cassette</strong>. Although there were other magnetic tape cartridge systems at the time, the Compact Cassette became dominant as a result of Philips' decision (in the face of pressure from Sony) to license the format free of charge. It went on to become a popular (and re-recordable) alternative to the vinyl record deck during the 1970s. During the 1980s, its popularity grew further as a result of the <strong>Sony Walkman</strong>, with cassette sales overtaking those of LPs. (Vinyl overall remained ahead due to greater sales of singles, although cassette singles achieved popularity for a period in the 1990s).
        </p><p>
        
        The mass production of compact audio cassettes <strong>began in 1965</strong> in Hannover, Germany, as did commercial sales of prerecorded music cassettes (also known as musicassettes; MC for short). The system had been initially designed for dictation and portable use, thus the audio quality of early recorders was not well suited for music. Some early models also had unreliable mechanical design. As time went on, various improvements (in particular, the introduction of <strong>Dolby noise reduction</strong>) resulted in the format being taken seriously for musical use.
        </p><p>
        
        Although its use in the West has declined as a result of more advanced technologies, it remains widespread, and is still the dominant medium for listening to music in many third world countries.
        </p><p>
        
        In essence, the audio cassette is simply a cassette-based (and smaller) version of the older reel-to-reel tape format. It consists of two miniature reels, between which an oxide-coated plastic tape, or magnetic tape, is passed and wound. These reels (along with some other mechanical parts) are held inside a protective plastic shell.
        </p><p>
        
        Four single audio tracks are available on the tape. These are paired to produce two stereophonic tracks – one played when the cassette is inserted with its 'A' side facing up, and the other when it is turned over (with the 'B' side up), thus mimicking gramophone records.
        </p><p>

            <p><span>C</span>rows and ravens, which belong to the corvid family, are known for their high intelligence, playful natures, and strong personalities. They hold grudges against each other, do basic statistics, perform acrobatics, and even host funerals for deceased family members. But we keep <a href="https://nautil.us/why-neuroscientists-need-to-study-the-crow-235845/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning new things</a> about the savvy of these birds, and how widespread that savvy is among the corvid family.</p><p>Earlier this year, a team of researchers from Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia and the University of Bristol <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-024-01874-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found that</a> a species of crow called the hooded crow—which has a gray bust and black tail and head feathers, making it look like it is wearing a “hood”—is able to manage a mental feat we once thought was unique to humans: to memorize the shape and size of an object after it is taken away—in this case a small piece of colored paper—and to reproduce one like it.</p>
      
    <p>This kind of feat, according to animal behavior researchers, requires the ability to form “mental templates.”<strong> </strong>Essentially, a mental template is an image in the mind of what a particular object looks like, even when that object is not present. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27405-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental templates</a> allow animals to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/61/3/825/6273191?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create tools</a>, which can be used to get food or make a stronger nest, both ultimately leading to a better chance of survival. They might also make it possible for individuals to learn about tool making from other members of their species—and to pass along improvements in tool making over time, often called “cumulative culture,” which so far seems rare among non-human animals.</p><blockquote>
<p>Young crows learn how to make different types of tools by stealing their parent’s tools.</p>
</blockquote>
          <p>We have been looking for evidence that different corvid and other bird species can create mental templates since at least 2002. That year, researchers published <a href="https://www.bioteach.ubc.ca/TeachingResources/GeneralScience/CrowsToolPaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">findings</a> showing that Betty, a captive New Caledonian crow, was able to spontaneously bend a piece of wire to create a hook that she could use to grab a hard-to-reach treat. Betty had successfully used a pre-made hook to obtain the treat in earlier trials but in follow-up tasks didn’t seem to fully understand how hooks work.&nbsp; The researchers decided she must have formed a mental template of the hook, which she then reproduced. So far, researchers have found that<strong> </strong>Goffin cockatoos, a kind of parrot, can also create tools spontaneously, which could indicate similar mental agility.</p><p>But the new hooded crow findings suggest that the ability to learn this way could be more widespread than we thought, says Sarah Jelbert, a comparative psychologist who studies animal behavior at the University of Bristol and is one of the authors of the study. Creating and using mental templates might be a skill that evolved in the ancestor of all corvids, the “Corvida” branch of songbirds<strong>,</strong> or perhaps it is even shared more broadly across the animal kingdom, she says.</p><p>For their study, Jelbert and her colleagues first trained three hooded crows—Glaz (15 years old), Rodya (4 years old), and Joe (3 years old)—to recognize pieces of paper of different sizes and colors. To do this, they exposed the birds to “template” pieces of paper in different colors and sizes for several minutes before removing them—and then rewarded the birds for dropping scraps that matched these templates into a small slit.</p><figure><img width="800" height="536" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Castleberry_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=686&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Castleberry_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Castleberry_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Castleberry_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>BIRD BRAINS: </strong>A New Caledonian crow creating a scrap of colored paper that matches the template with which it was trained. <em>Photo by Sarah Jelbert, University of Bristol.</em></figcaption></figure>
          <p>The crows were next given the opportunity to manufacture versions of these objects in exchange for a reward. The researchers found that all three crows manufactured objects that matched the original template object they had been rewarded for in both color and size—even though the treats in this second stage of the experiment were awarded at random. The researchers also observed that Glaz, the oldest of the three hooded crows, seemed to be the most proficient at making scraps that looked like the ones the bird was trained on. This finding suggested to them that mental templates may be linked to experience garnered with age.</p><p>“Unlike humans, who regularly copy each other’s behavior … we don’t have much evidence that crows will watch each other and deliberately copy what another crow is doing,” Jelbert says. However, they will steal each other’s tools—in particular, juvenile crows often steal their parents’ tools when they are young. So it’s possible that young crows learn how to make different types of tools from experience stealing their parent’s tools, using them, remembering what these tools look like, and then trying to create something similar, Jelbert says.</p><p>What qualifies as a mental template, and how flexible these templates are, seems to be up for some debate. Research suggests birdsong and mating practices may rely on certain kinds of mental templates, which can backfire if a bird memorizes behavior from the wrong species. “For example, if a song sparrow gets imprinted on the song of a swamp sparrow and sings a song from a different species rather than its own, it will have difficulty finding mating partners,” explains Andreas Nieder, a professor of animal psychology at the University of Tübingen and a lead researcher on corvid neuroscience, who was not involved in this study. “Similarly, if one finch species gets sexually imprinted on another, it may show courtship displays to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065345408600091?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrong species</a> in adulthood.”</p><p>Nieder says this kind of imprinting can become fixed in the bird’s brain, and is not changeable even in new environments. “In this case, templates may no longer represent intelligence but rather the opposite,” he adds. Researchers have not yet determined whether mental templates related to tool making remain flexible, though there is some evidence in New Caledonian crows that they may evolve.</p>
          <p>For biologists and comparative psychologists, understanding the ways corvids use mental templates can help to illuminate not just the nature of bird intelligence, but of intelligence across the animal kingdom and evolutionary time. <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Lead image: RuqayaMai / Shutterstock</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>LEXINGTON, Ky (Aug. 30, 2024)</strong>&nbsp;— New research from the University of Kentucky’s&nbsp;<a href="https://medicine.uky.edu/centers/sbcoa">Sanders-Brown Center on Aging</a>&nbsp;shows compelling evidence that the cognitive impairments observed in long COVID patients share striking similarities with those seen in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The study, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14089">Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association</a>, highlights a potential commonality in brain disorders across these conditions that could pave the way for new avenues in research and treatment.</p>

<p>The study was a global effort, funded by a multitude of grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Alzheimer’s Association and international organizations. The project also brought together experts from various fields of neuroscience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Researchers at the UK College of Medicine led the study, including Yang Jiang, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Behavioral Science; Chris Norris, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences; and Bob Sompol, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Nutritional Sciences. Their work focuses on electrophysiology, neuroinflammation, astrocytes and synaptic functions.</p>

<p>“This project benefited greatly from interdisciplinary collaboration,” Jiang said. “We had input from experts, associated with the Alzheimer’s Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART), across six countries, including the U.S., Turkey, Ireland, Italy, Argentina and Chile.”</p>

<p>Jiang and the collaborative team focused their work on understanding the “brain fog” that many COVID-19 survivors experience, even months after recovering from the virus. This fog includes memory problems, confusion and difficulty concentrating. According to Jiang, “the slowing and abnormality of intrinsic brain activity in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in Alzheimer’s and related dementias.”</p>

<p>This research sheds light on the connection between the two conditions, suggesting that they may share underlying biological mechanisms. Both long COVID and Alzheimer’s disease involve neuroinflammation, the activation of brain support cells known as astrocytes and abnormal brain activity. These factors can lead to significant cognitive impairments, making it difficult for patients to think clearly or remember information.</p>

<p>The idea that COVID-19 could lead to Alzheimer’s-like brain changes is a significant development.</p>

<p>“People don’t usually connect COVID-19 with Alzheimer’s disease,” Jiang said, “but our review of emerging evidence suggests otherwise.”</p>

<p>The publication in&nbsp;<em>Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia</em>&nbsp;reveals that the cognitive issues caused by COVID-19 reflect similar underlying brain changes as those in dementia.</p>

<p>The study’s insights emphasize the importance of regular brain function check-ups for these populations, particularly through the use of affordable and accessible tools like electroencephalography (EEG).</p>

<p>The study not only highlights the shared traits between long COVID and Alzheimer’s, but also points to the importance of further research.</p>

<p>“The new insight opens avenues for future research and clinical practice, particularly in studying brain oscillations related to neural biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment in people with long COVID,” said Jiang.</p>

<p>One of the key findings is the role of astrocytes — support cells in the brain that have not been as thoroughly studied as neurons. The research suggests that damage or activation of these cells by COVID-19 can cause synaptic dysfunctions, leading to the abnormal brain activity observed in both conditions. This discovery is significant because it may help explain why EEG patterns in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.</p>

<p>Researchers believe this work could have a direct impact on patient care. They are advocating for routine EEG exams to detect early brain changes in both COVID-19 survivors and those at risk for cognitive decline.</p>

<p>“EEG patterns in COVID-19 patients resemble those seen in early neurodegenerative diseases,” said Norris.</p>

<p>“These similarities may be due to shared issues such as brain inflammation, astrocyte activity, low oxygen levels and blood vessel damage,” said Sompol.</p>

<p>By detecting these changes early, health care providers could potentially identify at-risk individuals sooner and implement interventions to prevent or slow the progression of cognitive decline.</p>

<p>As research continues, the team is particularly interested in how EEG monitoring can predict long-term outcomes in COVID-19 patients and assess the effectiveness of treatments aimed at preventing cognitive decline.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <blockquote>
<p><em>Ugh. Drew’s blogging about Rust again.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>– You</p>
<p>I promise to be nice.</p>
<p>Two years ago, seeing the Rust-for-Linux project starting to get the ball
rolling, I wrote “<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2022/10/03/Does-Rust-belong-in-Linux.html">Does Rust belong in the Linux kernel?</a>”, penning a
conclusion consistent with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s law of headlines</a>. Two years on we
have a lot of experience to draw on to see how Rust-for-Linux is actually playing
out, and I’d like to renew my thoughts with some hindsight – and more
compassion. If you’re one of the Rust-for-Linux participants burned out or
burning out on this project, I want to help. Burnout sucks – I’ve been there.</p>
<p>The people working on Rust-for-Linux are incredibly smart, talented, and
passionate developers who have their eyes set on a goal and are tirelessly
working towards it – and, as time has shown, with a great deal of patience.
Though I’ve developed a mostly-well-earned reputation for being a fierce critic
of Rust, I do believe it has its place and I have a lot of respect for the work
these folks are doing. These developers are ambitious and motivated to make an
impact, and Linux is undoubtedly the highest-impact software in the world, and
in theory Linux is enthusiastically ready to accept motivated innovators into
its fold to facilitate that impact.</p>
<p>At least in theory. In practice, the Linux community is the wild wild west, and
sweeping changes are infamously difficult to achieve consensus on, and this is
by far the broadest sweeping change ever proposed for the project. Every
subsystem is a private fiefdom, subject to the whims of each one of Linux’s
1,700+ maintainers, almost all of whom have a dog in this race. It’s herding
cats: introducing Rust effectively is one part coding work and ninety-nine parts
political work – and it’s a lot of coding work. Every subsystem has its own
unique culture and its own strongly held beliefs and values.</p>
<p>The consequences of these factors is that Rust-for-Linux has become a burnout
machine. My heart goes out to the developers who have been burned in this
project. It’s not fair. Free software is about putting in the work, it’s a
classical do-ocracy… until it isn’t, and people get hurt. In spite of my
critiques of the project, I recognize the talent and humanity of everyone
involved, and wouldn’t have wished these outcomes on them. I also have sympathy
for many of the established Linux developers who didn’t exactly want this on
their plate… but that’s neither here nor there for the purpose of this post,
and any of those developers and their fiefdoms who went out of their way to make
life <em>difficult</em> for the Rust developers above and beyond what was needed to
ensure technical excellence are accountable for these shitty outcomes.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So where do we go now?</p>
<p>Well, let me begin by re-iterating something from my last article on the
subject: “I wish [Rust-for-Linux] the best of luck and hope to see them
succeed”. Their path is theirs to choose, and though I might advise a moment to
rest before diving headfirst into this political maelstrom once again, I support
you in your endeavours if this is what you choose to do. Not my business. That
said, allow me to humbly propose a different path for your consideration.</p>
<p>Here’s the pitch: a motivated group of talented Rust OS developers could build a
Linux-compatible kernel, from scratch, very quickly, with no need to engage in
LKML politics. You would be astonished by how quickly you can make meaningful
gains in this kind of environment; I think if the amount of effort being put
into Rust-for-Linux were applied to a new Linux-compatible OS we could have
something production ready for some use-cases within a few years.</p>
<p>Novel OS design is hard: projects like <a href="https://www.redox-os.org/">Redox</a> are working on this, but it
will take along time to bear fruit and research operating systems often have to
go back to the drawing board and make major revisions over and over again before
something useful and robust emerges. This is important work – and near to my
heart – but it’s not for everyone. However, making an OS which is based on a
proven design like Linux is <em>much</em> easier and can be done very quickly. I worked
on my own novel OS design for a couple of years and it’s still stuck in design
hell and badly in need of being rethought; on the other hand I wrote a passable
Unix clone alone in less than 30 days.</p>
<p>Rust is a great fit for a large monolithic kernel design like Linux. Imagine
having the opportunity to implement something like the dcache from scratch in
Rust, without engaging with the politics – that’s something a small group of
people, perhaps as few as one, could make substantial inroads on in a short
period of time taking full advantage of what Rust has on offer. Working towards
compatibility with an existing design can leverage a much larger talent pool
than the very difficult problem of novel OS design, a lot of people can manage
with a copy of the ISA manual and a missive to implement a single syscall in a
Linux-compatible fashion over the weekend. A small and motivated group of
contributors could take on the work of, say, building out io_uring compatibility
and start finding wins fast – it’s a lot easier than designing io_uring from
scratch. I might even jump in and build out a driver or two for fun myself, that
sounds like a good opportunity for me to learn Rust properly with a fun project
with a well-defined scope.</p>
<p>Attracting labor shouldn’t be too difficult with this project in mind, either.
If there was <em>the</em> Rust OS project, with a well-defined scope and design (i.e.
aiming for Linux ABI compatibility), I’m sure there’s a lot of people who’d jump
in to stake a claim on some piece of the puzzle and put it together, and the
folks working on Rust-for-Linux have the benefit of a great deal of experience
with the Linux kernel to apply to oversight on the broader design approach.
Having a clear, well-proven goal in mind can also help to attract the same
people who want to make an impact in a way that a speculative research project
might not. Freeing yourselves of the LKML political battles would probably be a
big win for the ambitions of bringing Rust into kernel space. Such an effort
would also be a great way to mentor a new generation of kernel hackers who are
comfortable with Rust in kernel space and ready to deploy their skillset to the
research projects that will build a next-generation OS like Redox. The labor
pool of serious OS developers badly needs a project like this to make that
happen.</p>
<p>So my suggestion for the Rust-for-Linux project is: you’re burned out and that’s
awful, I feel for you. It might be fun and rewarding to spend your recovery
busting out a small prototype Unix kernel and start fleshing out bits and pieces
of the Linux ABI with your friends. I can tell you from my own experience doing
something very much like this that it was a very rewarding burnout recovery
project for me. And who knows where it could go?</p>
<p>Once again wishing you the best and hoping for your success, wherever the path
ahead leads.</p>
<details>
<summary>What about drivers?</summary>
<p>To pre-empt a response I expect to this article: there’s the annoying question
of driver support, of course. This was an annoying line of argumentation back
when Linux had poor driver support as well, and it will be a nuisance for a
hypothetical Linux-compatible Rust kernel as well. Well, the same frustrated
arguments I trotted out then are still ready at hand: you choose your
use-cases carefully. General-purpose comes later. Building an OS which
supports virtual machines, or a datacenter deployment, or a specific mobile
device whose vendor is volunteering labor for drivers, and so on, will come
first. You choose the hardware that supports the software, not the other way
around, or build the drivers you need.</p>
<p>That said, a decent spread of drivers should be pretty easy to implement with
the talent base you have at your disposal, so I wouldn’t worry about it.</p>

Once notified, the agency must pass the order on to the more than 20,000 broadband internet providers in the country, each of which must block <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">X</a>.</p><p>In an interview with the TV channel Globonews, the agency’s president, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, said the order had already been passed on to internet providers.</p><p>“Since we’re talking about more than 20,000 companies, each will have its own implementation time, but … we expect that probably over the weekend all companies will be able to implement the block,” he said.</p><p>Justice Moraes also summoned Apple and Google to “implement technological barriers to prevent the use of the X app by users of the iOS and Android systems” and to block the use of VPN applications.</p><p>The decision imposes a daily fine of R$50,000 (£6,800) on individuals and companies that attempt to continue using X via VPN.</p><p>The deadline given to X to appoint a new legal representative in the country expired at 8.07pm local time on Thursday (0.07am BST on Friday). An hour later, Elon Musk’s social network <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1829296715989414281" data-link-name="in body link">announced</a> that it would not comply.</p><p>The dispute began in April, when Moraes ordered the suspension of dozens of accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation – a request Musk has denounced as censorship.</p><p>President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGkKcMNNS0U&amp;t=3s" data-link-name="in body link">said in a radio interview</a> on Friday morning: “Just because the guy [Musk] has a lot of money, doesn’t mean they can disrespect you … Who does he think he is?”</p><p>X, formerly known as Twitter, has been without a legal representative in Brazil since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/17/elon-musk-x-brazil" data-link-name="in body link">17 August</a>, when Musk announced that his company was shutting down its operations in the country “effective immediately” due to what it called “censorship orders” from Moraes. The service has remained available to users in the country.</p><p>Moraes’ April order to X to block some accounts stemmed from an investigation into “digital militias” who backed former president Jair Bolsonaro’s attempts to stay in power after his 2022 election defeat.

  </div>

<p>Have a Raspberry Pi computer (not the Picos, those are microcontrollers), with SD-card, available. It will assume a Raspberry Pi Zero, ie. using <code>rpi0</code> for referring to the target system. You can replace that in any command with <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/systems.html#compatibility">another supported system</a>:</p>

  <div>
    <p><span>shell</span>
      
    </p>
    <div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span># Install the Nerves tooling called nerves_bootstrap</span>
mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap

<span># Use the Nerves tooling to create a new Elixir + Nerves project</span>
mix nerves.new my_thing
<span># it will ask to install deps, you can yes, otherwise: mix deps.get</span>

cd my_thing
export MIX_TARGET<span>=</span>rpi0
<span># Getting deps with the target set will fetch the base linux system</span>
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix burn</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>The <code>mix burn</code> should prompt you for which SD-card you want to flash the firmware to.</p>
<p>Then start the device with that SD card in it. Give it power and it should turn on. If you have it connected with a data-cable it should show up via USB networking which is convenient. It should be announcing as <code>nerves.local</code> and have picked out one of your SSH public keys to embed in the firmware by default. Try <code>ssh nerves.local</code> to see if it is up. If not you may have to adapt a bit further and set up WiFi.</p>
<p>If you have networking the next update is still a <code>mix firmware</code> to compile but the deploy becomes:</p>

  

<p>That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>You can also update specific modules by just pasting them over the ssh connection into IEx which is surprisingly practical.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-wi-fi">Set up Wi-Fi</h2>
<p>Top of the generally debunked hierarchy of needs is of course Wi-Fi. You can edit <code>config/target.exs</code> to edit the config for hardware devices. <code>host.exs</code> is for running the project locally on your computer.</p>
<p>The networking libraries for Nerves are known as VintageNet and we can configure the VintageNetWiFi technology like this by replacing the default <code>"wlan0"</code> entry:</p>

  <div data-file="config/target.exs">
    <p><span>elixir</span>
      <span>config/target.exs</span>
    </p>
    <div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="elixir">{<span>"wlan0"</span>,
      %{
        <span>type</span>: <span>VintageNetWiFi</span>,
        <span>vintage_net_wifi</span>: %{
          <span>networks</span>: [
            %{
              <span>key_mgmt</span>: <span>:wpa_psk</span>,
              <span>ssid</span>: <span>"my_network_ssid"</span>,
              <span>psk</span>: <span>"a_passphrase_or_psk"</span>,
            }
          ]
        },
        <span>ipv4</span>: %{<span>method</span>: <span>:dhcp</span>},
      }
    }</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Re-burn the SD-card and with a little bit of time your Pi should connect to your wireless network. If you have one of the larger Pis and an ethernet cable that also works great.</p>
<h2 id="nerves-livebook">Nerves Livebook</h2>
<p>If you are a bit lost on what to do and inspiration hasn’t sparked immediately you can instead get some neat tutorials going from <a href="https://github.com/nerves-livebook/nerves_livebook">Nerves Livebook</a>. There you get pre-baked firmware with special environment variables for setting up Wi-Fi. Note that it starts a bit slowly, especially on something like a Pi Zero. So be patient. Follow the instructions linked because they are friendly and practical.</p>
<h2 id="going-further-with-phoenix">Going further with Phoenix</h2>
<p>The Nerves documentation has a part about UI where we show how to do a so-called Poncho project (less bad than an umbrella project, but it’s still raining). Redwire Labs published their approach which I know others have also done and <a href="https://nerves.redwirelabs.com/runbooks/naked-phoenix">dubbed it naked Phoenix</a>. I like this approach so if you want to integrate Phoenix. Try it.</p>
<h2 id="all-just-elixir-">All just Elixir *</h2>
<p>If you’ve dealt with your fair share of Mix projects and Elixir applications Nerves is fairly straightforward because you are just building an Elixir thing. Thing can get a little bit spicier if you need some special dependencies but usually that’s actually fairly simple. Either the library pulls it in for you or you need to <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/customizing-systems.html#buildroot-package-configuration">install packages via buildroot</a>. It is more involved than you might be used to for apt. Pretty much a slightly old-school Docker image situation. The nuisance is the build time and that’s the flip side of building a tiny dense BEAM-centric linux from scratch instead of shipping Ubuntu and hoping for the best. I can tell you I’ve had more luck reviving a Nerves-project 2 years down the line than I’ve had when I’ve hacked together something on top of Raspberry Pi OS.</p>
<p>There are some things that have fancy deps that aren’t possible to cross-compile or aren’t ready for it. But I’ve seen most of Membrane compile without issue. I’ve installed SQL Cipher as an encrypted alternative to SQLite. There’s some nuance there but it is the same that lives in your Dockerfile plus a bit of architectural nuance.</p>
<p>You also get some cool stuff you usually don’t poke at on a server. VintageNet for wrangling network interfaces. NervesTime for both Real-Time Clocks, ntpd and so on. The Nerves heart variant of the Erlang heart. A/B firmware partitions and firmware validation.</p>
<p>Things that are more fun on-device than on your average server is stuff like connecting a camera and using <a href="https://github.com/cocoa-xu/evision">evision</a>. I’ve added a Coral TPU over USB and had some fun via <a href="https://github.com/cocoa-xu/tflite_elixir">tflite_elixir</a>.</p>
<p>Find some devices to talk to, you now have a little server that can pull down your calendar, parse it and control things based on that, or based on a public RSS feed you like. There are so many possible things. I have hacked on <a href="https://github.com/lawik/keylight">my Elgato Keylights</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/lawik/streamdex">Elgato StreamDeck</a>.</p>
<p>And you can get incredible mileage out of OTP functionality like GenServers and the binary pattern matching to do things with hardware. You really get to do the stuff Erlang was made for.</p>
<h2 id="more-nerves">More Nerves</h2>
<p>Things to read further on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>

<p>Federal inspections found 69 violations—many grisly—at the Boar's Head meat facility at the center of a deadly, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/08/five-more-dead-in-record-breaking-outbreak-linked-to-boars-head-meats/">nationwide <em>Listeria </em>outbreak</a>&nbsp;that has now killed nine people, sickened and hospitalized a total of 57 across 18 states, and spurred the nationwide recall of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/07/7-million-pounds-of-meat-recalled-amid-deadly-outbreak/">more than 7 million pounds of meat</a>.</p>
<p>The Jarratt, Virginia-based facility had repeated problems with mold, water leaks, dirty equipment and rooms, meat debris stuck on walls and equipment, various bugs, and, at one point, puddles of blood on the floor, according to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/763954974/USDA-FOIA-records-requested-by-Alexander-Tin">inspection reports</a> from the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bugs-mold-mildew-inspection-boars-head-plant-listeria/">The reports were obtained by CBS News</a> through a Freedom of Information Act Request. In all, the reports outline 69 violations just between the dates of August 1, 2023, and August 2, 2024.
</p><p>The findings in the reports reveal the perfect conditions for the company's meat to become contaminated with the germ behind the deadly outbreak, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>. This is a hardy germ that is ubiquitous in the environment, including in soil and water, and it spreads among people via the fecal-oral route. In healthy people, it usually only causes gastrointestinal infections. But for older people, newborns, and the immunocompromised, it can cause a life-threatening invasive infection with a fatality rate of around 17 percent. It's also a significant danger to pregnant people, causing miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, and life-threatening infections in newborns.</p>
<p>While it's always lurking, <em>L. monocytogenes </em>especially plagues the food industry because it has the notable ability to reproduce at refrigerator temperatures—a condition that typically limits the growth of other nasty germs.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Buildup and bugs</h2>
<p>In the Boar's Head facility, <em>L. monocytogenes</em> appeared to have various opportunities to beef up its numbers. For one, the facility had a long track record of trash and meat debris in various places, which was sometimes reported alongside insect sightings. For instance, on June 10, an inspector entered the "pickle vat pump room" and noted "heavy meat buildup" on the walls, which were also crawling with flies and gnats. On the same day, an inspection of a different area found a rollup door with meat buildup on it, and a water pipe over the door leaked a steady stream of water down the wall and onto the floor. There was also a "steady line of ants" and an inventory of ladybugs, a cockroach, and a beetle of some sort. &nbsp;Earlier, on March 13, an inspection of a room next to where netted hams were handled, an inspector found trash and meat protein on the floor, including "whole pork muscles."</p>
<p>Going back to August 8, 2023, an inspection likewise found processing lines covered in meat particles and trash. "Heavy discolored meat buildup" was found covering a hydraulic pump, and pieces of meat and fat clung to the support braces of a catwalk. An inspection-line scale had meat pieces and trash in it—and it smelled bad. "Multiple instances of meat were found around the department on the floor. As well as standing water containing a brown mud/dirt-like substance," the inspection read.</p>
<p>The facility had numerous problems with water leaks and condensation, which fits with the other numerous sightings of mold. The facility temporarily fixed water pipe leaks by wrapping the pipes in plastic. On October 26, an inspector noticed a plastic-wrapped pipe in the cure cooler. The plastic was dated August 17, and there was "orange/brown water pooled in the lowest hanging point."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Bubbles and blood</h2>
<p>On January 9, the inspection of a holding cooler found spots of black mold as large as a quarter throughout the room. On July 23, an inspector noticed bubbled paint on the wall around employee hand-washing sinks. The bubbles were filled with water. And under the sinks, the inspector found black mold and pink mildew.</p>
<p>On July 17, the inspector found "green algal growth" in a puddle of standing water in a raw holding cooler. And on July 27, an inspector noted clear liquid leaking out from a square patch on the ceiling. Behind the patch, there were two other patches that were also leaking. An employee came and wiped the liquid away with a sponge, but it returned within 10 seconds. The employee wiped it again, and the liquid again returned within 10 seconds. Meanwhile, a ceiling fan mounted close by was blowing the leaking liquid onto uncovered hams in a hallway outside the room.</p>
<p>To top if off, a report on February 21 found a raw cooler with "ample amounts of blood in puddles on the floor" and a "rancid smell."</p>
<p>According to USDA documents, the agency has not taken enforcement actions against Boar's Head, and there is no data available on swab testing for <em>Listeria</em> at the Virginia facility. The plant has been shut down since late July after health investigators found the outbreak strain of <em>L. monocytogenes </em>in unopened containers of Boar's Head liverwurst.</p>
<p>In a statement updated on August 29, Boar's Head said, "We are conducting an extensive investigation, working closely with the USDA and government regulatory agencies, as well as with the industry’s leading food safety experts, to determine how our liverwurst produced at our Jarratt, Virginia facility was adulterated and to prevent it from happening again... We will not resume operations at this facility until we are confident that it meets USDA regulatory standards and Boar’s Head’s highest quality and safety standards."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As we approach the final release date for Python 3.13, I’ve seen an uptick in
discussion regarding 3.13’s introduction of an optional <abbr title="Global
Interpreter Lock">GIL</abbr>. While <em>removing</em> the GIL has been a long time
coming for the average user (I’ve dreamt of this for nearly 20 years), there
have actually been two concurrent efforts to improve Python’s performance for
multithreading. The first is the optional GIL, specified in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP 703</a>, and
second is the introduction of a per-interpreter GIL, specified in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/">PEP 684</a> and
introduced in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-684-a-per-interpreter-gil">Python 3.12</a>.</p><p>In this post, I’ll explain some of the history of the GIL, how it’s affected
the C API design of Python, and what steps were taken at the C API level to get
us to where we are today. I’ll also briefly discuss how <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/">PEP 684</a> and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP 703</a>
will be able to work in tandem. And to explain all of this, we’re going to
start with my personal history on the matter and my first run-in (and
faceplant) with Python’s GIL. Learning to make</p><p>✨<em><strong><span><span>video games</span>
</span></strong></em>✨</p><h2 id="a-dark-seed-is-planted">A Dark Seed Is Planted</h2><p>In the summer of 2005, I attended a several week long game development summer
camp that was located at Stanford University. This was my first real
introduction to programming. I don’t count the C++ class I took in freshman
year of high school because we just simply copied text from JPEGs of a scan of
a C++ book that were scaled down so that two pages could fit on an 8.5x11"
paper. At the time, this was (for me) no different than reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript">Voynich
Manuscript</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Seraphinianus">Codex
Seraphinianus</a>.</p><p>I was being taught Python 2.4, a whole year before the 2.5 release. Now at the
time, <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame</a> was at around version 1.7.1 and both
then and now requires some knowledge of Python to be used effectively. I would
argue that even today teaching someone Python via PyGame is not a good
introduction to Python <em>the language</em>. It is an intermediate step after you’ve
gotten the basics of objects and for loops and the like down. However we were
using a (slightly modified fork) of a library named <em>livewires</em>, which was a
wrapper that greatly simplified a <em>lot</em> of the logic behind PyGame so you could
focus on teaching.</p><p>This fork had been written by my camp instructor, a programmer, TV show writer,
and teacher by the name of Michael Dawson. For those of you who read the

as the lead programmer, writer, and star of the 1992 DOS game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Seed_(video_game)"><em>Dark
Seed</em></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This was, for
me, a huge deal, as it lended an air of authority to his teaching: he’d made an
<em>actual game</em> and mostly by himself. Surely, I could do the same thing one day.
Right? 🙂</p><p>During this instructional period, I was using a large number of sprites. I was
<em>too inexperienced</em> to know what a sprite atlas was, let alone to implement it
with the API we were using under livewires. My load times were atrocious. I had
maybe 100+ sprites, each with about 20 animations, that I’d pulled from various
geocities websites. I was quite honestly at a loss. Outside of these
instructional classes, we had additional activities where we could socialize
with other people attending the camp. One of these people was very on the up
and up in terms of open source, Linux, and the like (they owned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP2X">GP2X</a> and
managed to get their game to work on the device) compared to myself. I
explained to them the issue I was having, and they showed me how to profile my
code, and we saw that because I was loading in a sprite one at a time, it would
take forever to open and read each and every individual sprite. They then
suggested I use the <code>threading</code> module to at least speed things up. After
spending some time tinkering we got it working and… my load times had
increased 😭.</p><p>The next day, I asked Michael what the issue could be and with a heavy sigh he
had to explain the issue with threads and the Python interpreter, as I had
stumbled into the oldest issue Python has had to date for performance<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>: that
<em>damned</em> GIL.</p><p>I’m also not the only person who ran into this issue within the context of
games. <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization IV</em> used Python for its game logic and
scripting systems. Games would run slower the more units were on the map and
the more turns that had executed. It was a known issue that Civ IV had (and one
might even argue still has) performance issues. With the release of <em>Sid
Meier’s Civilization V</em> the team had switched to Lua and this was touted as a
big deal because it meant a huge performance improvement. And it was! Fewer
lockups and games didn’t take forever to process an AI turn (usually).</p><p>Alas! The beef I’ve had with the GIL was planted as a dark seed about 20 years
ago. For many years I’ve been filled with jealousy towards Lua even going so
far as to <a href="https://izzys.casa/2015/03/why-i-dont-use-lua/">refuse to use it unless forced to for the last 9 years</a>, though this was mostly because I had to operate
directly on a stack and worry about things like <em>upvalues</em>. What’re upvalues? I
don’t know dawg, what’s up with you?</p><h2 id="erm-what-the-sigma-gil">Erm, what the <del>sigma</del> GIL?</h2><p>OK, so there’s a general misunderstanding of <em>what</em> the GIL <em>is</em>, in addition
to <em>why</em> it even exists in the first place. To better comprehend the situation,
we’re going to talk specifically about the evolution of CPython and it’s
interpreter.</p><h3 id="a-short-history-of-threading">A Short History of Threading</h3><p>Threading was first introduced in Python on <time datetime="1998-02-17">February 17th, 1998</time> with the release of Python 1.5. This release brought
along with it the <code>threading</code> module and is also where the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyInterpreterState"><code>PyInterpreterState</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState"><code>PyThreadState</code></a> objects were first introduced,
bringing the GIL along with them. Prior to this, Python had a simple evaluation
execution step in a single function named <code>code_eval</code> that would in some cases
recurse into itself. The introduction of <code>PyInterpreterState</code> and
<code>PyThreadState</code> were a big deal as this allowed Python to finally begin moving
towards an embeddable state where users could not only <em>extend</em> Python, but
also <em>embed</em> it. This might not seem like such a big deal, but it was 1998. The
number of scripting languages in use at the time were many, but each had their
own limitations with regards for C to interact with it in custom programs.
Hell, go and look at Perl’s C API <em>today</em> and you can see a very 90s API
design that might be viewed as anti-embedding, but really was just a pragmatic
approach to assume that if you were trying to embed Perl as a C library, you
were the Perl interpreter.</p><p>This newly introduced <code>PyInterpreterState</code> had a single instance, and even with
the upcoming release of Python 3.13, there is still a <code>static PyInterpreterState*</code> object that represents the main <code>PyInterpreterState</code>. Even
if this <code>PyInterpreterState</code> is not used, it still exists.</p><p>This is why the <code>multiprocessing</code> module has historically been faster for
Python. We’re creating a whole new interpreter instance as a subprogram, and
thus it does not need to worry about a GIL. However, this comes at the cost of
an entire subprocess and the various work involved with communication between
the two. For Windows especially, this is a very heavy approach for a speedup,
yet manages to still be faster in the high contention cases.</p><p>Thus, with the release of 3.13, <code>multiprocessing</code> is <em>technically</em> only needed
in cases where the GIL is still needed, and even then it still can carry a cost
compared to threading in <em>some</em> specific use cases.</p><h3 id="big-gil-so-what">Big GIL, So What?</h3><p>OK, so if you’re coming from other scripting languages this approach might not
make much sense. For those of you coming from <code>lua_State*</code>s, <code>JSContextRef</code>s,
<code>v8::Isolate</code>s, and more, we need to take a look at how Python was evolving.
There was no real line in the sand to explain the direction Python would be
taking. Call me one to speculate, but it seemed like features were being added
because someone wanted them, rather than because of some goal in mind. This 1.5
release predates both the Python Software Foundation and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0001">PEP 1</a>, which was
introduced only with the release of Python 2.0 (alongside the PEP process).
Thus, there was no real community direction that Python could go in, beyond
whatever work someone was willing to contribute, and therefore these changes
were made because… well what else was there at the time? We had Perl, Tcl, a
bunch of implementations of scheme that are completely forgettable, and while
Lua 3.0 was out, it wouldn’t be until about 5 months later in July of 1998 that
Lua 3.1 was released along with its now well known <code>lua_State*</code> (and even then
there were semantic issues that weren’t resolved until the 4.0 release).</p><p>In fact if we look at what was available for existing API designs to pull from,
the only real stable designs for execution were Tcl (which people have gone
great lengths to avoid copying, because when you do try to copy its design you
get CMake<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>), and OpenGL. As OpenGL has a “context” object that you must swap
to/make current on the given thread it should be no surprise that Python
implemented a similar interface while eschewing the isolated single-thread
interpreter design.</p><p>It’s extremely important to keep in mind options for these decisions were
limited at the time. People were more or less stumbling around in the dark for
the C API side of dynamically typed scripting languages. We didn’t have
decades of mistakes and real world use to learn from. Even today when we know
there are “better” options sometimes the worse one wins out. For example, Lua
has constantly been heralded in various spaces for it’s register based VM. Yet
WASM, which is shaping up to be the cross platform <em>du jour</em> VM of the 21st
century, went with a stack based VM. This decision was driven entirely because
of ✨ reasons ✨ that are outside the scope of this post and that I don’t
actually think hold water and if <em>you</em> think they do you can <em>shut up nerd</em>.</p><h3 id="how-can-she-interpret">How Can She Interpret‽‽</h3><p>We’re near the end of this explanation so let’s take a brief look at how the
GIL works in practice at the C API level prior to making the GIL optional. For
starters, users create something called a <em>sub-interpreter</em>, which is what a
<code>PyThreadState</code> technically <em>is</em>. This is done via the poorly named
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_NewInterpreter"><code>Py_NewInterpreter</code></a>. When this is called, it uses whatever is set as the
<em>global interpreter</em> and adds it to the list of <code>PyThreadState</code>s that
<code>PyInterpreterState</code> keeps track of. Users are then expected to acquire the GIL
at some point upon the <code>PyThreadState</code> and then evaluate some Python code, then
<em>release</em> the GIL from the <code>PyThreadState</code> and at this point they are free to
either <em>destroy</em> the <code>PyThreadState</code> <em><strong>or</strong></em> they are able to just keep it
around and keep executing as needed. No matter <em>what</em> happens there is going to
be <em>a</em> lock occurring. No two <code>PyThreadState</code>s can execute <em>Python bytecode</em> at
the same time. However, they <em>can</em> execute multiple C calls at the same time
which is why for long running pure C operations extension and embedding
developers are encouraged to release the GIL temporarily. Technically speaking
this is where something like
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html">ThreadSanitizer</a> can come in
handy.</p><p>This approach to extensions is also sort of why we have the GIL in the first
place. Up until Python 3.5, which introduced so-called multi-phase extension
module initialization via <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0489/">PEP 489</a> we didn’t actually have a way to even
really isolate modules once they were imported. All objects, exceptions,
methods, etc. were all added at the same time and are inserted into the central
main interpreter. The real purpose is to effectively separate native code
(written in whatever language you want, though most folks are using C++, C,
Zig, or Rust these days) with the actual binding. Thus “when in Python, there
is a lock” and extension developers are given a level of trust that the lock
can be disengaged and re-engaged as long as Python objects are not being
touched<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p><p>As far as I know, Rust’s lifetimes can’t <em>entirely</em> be enforced across these
dynamic library extensions unless it’s encoded at the C ABI level in some
manner and to my knowledge <a href="https://py03.rs/">PyO3</a> and other wrappers do <em>not</em>
expose this at the type system level for the compiler and to warn users for raw
locking/unlocking operations, preferring to instead provide an
<a href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/marker/struct.Python.html#method.allow_threads"><code>allow_threads</code></a>
method that will handle the locking/unlocking within the execution of a user
provided closure that performs the actual work (an operation that any “RAII”
capable language might provide for sanity and safety’s sake)</p><p>With the release of Python <em>3.12</em> however we actually saw the first vestiges of
the Python C API that would allow us to create a <em>sub interpreter</em> that has no
connection to the <em>global</em> interpreter. This API exists in the form of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_NewInterpreterFromConfig"><code>Py_NewInterpreterFromConfig</code></a>, where a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyInterpreterConfig"><code>PyInterpreterConfig</code></a> structure
is passed in. This structure allows users to set a few “hard” settings. For
example, you can disable the <code>threading</code> module, <code>os.execv()</code>, and process
forking (though <code>subprocess</code> does not create forked processes, launching
entirely brand new ones instead). The most important setting of these however
is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyInterpreterConfig.gil"><code>PyInterpreterConfig.gil</code></a> member, which allows users to either
<em>share</em> the sub-interpreter’s GIL with the <em>main</em> interpreter’s GIL <em>or</em> they
can make the sub-interpreter have it’s <em>own</em> GIL, thus keeping it isolated from
the rest of the system. There are a few caveats here. Although the <code>sys.stdin</code>
object is a <em>unique</em> <code>PyObject*</code>, it does refer to the same underlying handle
as other <code>sys.stdin</code> objects. This can be semi-resolved by just changing it.</p><h2 id="500-interpreter-states">500 Interpreter States</h2><p>OK, so with everything we’ve mentioned up until now you’re more or less
prepared to understand <em>why</em> we’ve got these wacky shenanigans. So let’s make
an extreme example. Let’s make:</p><figure><img src="https://izzys.casa/2024/08/463-python-interpreters/what-python-does-to-a-motherfucker.webp"><figcaption><h4>500 Interpreter States</h4></figcaption></figure><p>This code example is going to be very “high level”. We won’t be doing proper
due diligence for API design because this is meant to be an example, not
production ready code. With that in mind, we have a few things we need to do
before we even create our python interpreters. The first of these is to create
an isolated configuration for the default interpreter. This is extremely
important if you’re doing a proper embed of C Python, as you might <em>not</em> want
to care about things like user directories and the like to modify how python
might execute.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cxx"><span><span>PyConfig config {};
</span></span><span><span>PyConfig_InitIsolatedConfig(<span>&amp;</span>config);
</span></span><span><span><span>if</span> (<span>auto</span> status <span>=</span> Py_InitializeFromConfig(<span>&amp;</span>config); PyStatus_IsError(status)) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>/* handle error here */</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>PyConfig_Clear(<span>&amp;</span>config);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There is additional work one might want to do with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyPreConfig"><code>PyPreConfig</code></a> set of
APIs, but I… don’t care about handling that. Read the documentation. You can
figure it out 😉</p><p>This configuration creation does the very basic steps for initializing Python
into an <em>isolated</em> state, which is intended for situations where users might
not be shipping the Python stdlib alongside their executable.</p><p>Next, we’re going to just spin up all our threads. When creating these new
<code>PyThreadState</code> instances they are set as the <em>current</em> thread state after
creation. This means we more or less need to initialize them <em>inside</em> of a
thread. We can get creative with the situation if we’re using C++, where
<code>thread_local</code> exists as a keyword + storage qualifier. This also lets us know
if a given thread has been initialized for a thread state. We won’t be doing
any fancy checking here, since this is “babby’s first example”, but this sort
of design paradigm might come in handy. We’ll also just define the maximum
number of states as a constant to save us some time.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cxx"><span><span><span>// Mark this as inline if you're placing it in a header. Save your sanity. 🙂

</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>auto</span> MAXIMUM_STATES <span>=</span> <span>463</span>;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we’ll create our default <code>PyInterpreterConfig</code>. Because we’re relying on
capturing this configuration object we don’t need to make it global in the
function we’re executing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cxx"><span><span>PyInterpreterConfig config <span>=</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  .use_main_obmalloc <span>=</span> <span>0</span>,

</span></span><span><span>  .gil <span>=</span> PyInterpreterConfig_OWN_GIL,
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There’s a few details here that are more accurately explained in the Python
documentation, however the biggest two things that matter are the
<code>check_multi_interp_extensions</code> value and <code>gil</code>. The
<code>check_multi_interp_extensions</code> value effectively forces all extensions to be
what is known as a <em>multi phase</em> extension. This is where you initialize some
of the module data, but don’t hook up objects, exceptions, and actual python
bindings until a separate function is called. This was a huge stumbling block
prior to either the per-GIL subinterpreter and the optional GIL. By forcing all
extensions to be multi-phase, you can create per-extension instances of all
your objects. This can get hairy if you <em>actually</em> have some hidden globals
within your native code that you’re binding, but surely you wouldn’t lie about
that ever, right? 🙂</p><p>Moving on, we’ll generate all our threads to create an interpreter state,
execute some python code, print to <code>sys.stdout</code> and then shut down our
interpreter. Easy Peesy, Lemon Squeezy.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="cxx"><span><span><span>// We want the threads to join on destruction, so std::jthread it is

delayed by so much (I wanted to post it last weekend 😭), is because I was
running into memory corruption issues. I thought “Hey, you know it’s been so
long since I’ve use C++’s <code>std</code> threading API that I probably fucked up.”</p><p>Unfortunately, I <em>did not fuck up</em> and my C++ code was correct. It seems there
are some latent memory corruption issues if you are creating and then
destroying 500 python interpreter states in debug mode. I unfortunately wasn’t
able to nail it down to any one specific issue beyond “at some point after
about 10 <code>PyThreadState</code>s being created and destroyed constantly”, you get
memory corruption, and there’s no way to recover.</p><p>On closer inspection, this is a case of memory reuse, where destroyed
<code>PyThreadState</code>s are not fully zeroed out, and this causes Python’s memory
debug assertions to fire off. Effectively, because we’re creating and
destroying these <code>PyThreadState</code>s as we execute, we’re breaking some
assumptions within Python’s C code. I do not know if this a security issue or
not, but it most certainly IS something that should be resolved, even if the
reason I found it was by writing a shitpost 😅. I collected what little
information I could, and have submitted an issue on the Python GitHub
repository, which you can find
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123134">here</a>.</p><h2 id="the-dream-of-the-child">The Dream Of The Child</h2><p>So here we are in 2024, and what I’d hoped and dreamed would eventually happen
in my childhood (the GIL going away) is finally on the horizon. I know the
current state of things is not great in the Python space, but for a language
that’s been running as long as it has, it should be no surprise that there will
be significant challenges along the way.</p><p>The only thing that pains me is that these days there <em>are</em> better solutions
than using Python for an embedded scripting language (that aren’t named Lua).
From JS implementations like V8, to .NET Core being self hostable, to so, so
many WASM implementations, to CPU emulators like
<a href="https://github.com/libriscv/libriscv/">libriscv</a>. Sadly, even alternative
Python VM implementations like <a href="https://github.com/pocketpy/pocketpy">pocketpy</a>
all seem like better options.</p><section><a href="https://izzys.casa/tags/#python">python</a></section></article></div>]]></description>

                    <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — A Franklin County judge granted a temporary restraining order against the <a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/columbus-undercover-police-information-on-dark-web/530-d806b92a-ff1d-435a-9eac-1f88076878aa" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/columbus-undercover-police-information-on-dark-web/530-d806b92a-ff1d-435a-9eac-1f88076878aa" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> expert who revealed what kind of information and how much of it was taken during a cyberattack on the city last month.</p>
                    <p>The cybersecurity expert, Connor Goodwolf, has spoken with 10TV and other media outlets in the last few weeks detailing what information is on the dark web. Goodwolf is the name he uses for interviews and is not his legal name.</p>
                        
                    <p>The city says it first learned something was wrong on July 18 when the city's department of technology "found evidence of an abnormality in its system." The city then severed its connection to the internet.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks later, the hacker group Rhysida claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had 6.5 terabytes of data. The group later released 45% of the data it took from the city.</p>
                    
                    <p>On Aug. 13, Mayor Andrew Ginther said the data stolen by hackers was either corrupted or encrypted, meaning it was likely useless. Hours later, <a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/cybersecurity-expert-personal-data-of-over-400000-private-citizens-is-dark-web/530-5e74cf74-a8f9-42d9-8407-317b042b6f19" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/cybersecurity-expert-personal-data-of-over-400000-private-citizens-is-dark-web/530-5e74cf74-a8f9-42d9-8407-317b042b6f19" target="_blank">Goodwolf told 10TV</a> that wasn't true and he showed what kind of personal information he was able to access.</p>
                    <p>Goodwolf continued to speak with 10TV about what data from the city was posted<em>&nbsp;</em>on the dark web, most recently revealing that the Columbus police crime matrix is downloadable. That database includes witness, victim and suspect information from any police report in the last 10 years. It also shows undercover police reports.</p>
                    <p>The city filed for the temporary restraining order against Goodwolf Thursday morning and it was granted later in the day. The city is seeking at least $25,000 in damages. The total amount will be determined at a trial.</p>
                    <p>By granting the temporary restraining order, the court is ordering Goodwolf to stop accessing, downloading and disseminating the city's stolen data.</p>
                    <p>In the lawsuit, the city claims Goodwolf has caused "irreparable harm" and "widespread concern throughout the Central Ohio region."</p>
                    <p>During a press conference on Thursday, City Attorney Zach Klein said this is not about suppressing Goodwolf's First Amendment right.</p>

                    <p>"This is not about speech. It's not. It's about the actual action of going on the keyboard, going into the dark web, gathering the information, downloading it to your computer and then disseminating it to people who are in the press or otherwise," Klein said.</p>
                                
                    <p>When Klein was asked if the city is filing the temporary restraining order now to prevent more embarrassment, he said that is not the case.</p>
                    <p>"This is two and a half weeks into Connor being out there. If this was really about some sort of embarrassment, wouldn't we have filed it two and a half weeks ago? This is about the escalation of the type of data that threatens criminal investigations," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>Klein said he is working to protect officers, victims and witnesses. He adds that the information that Goodwolf has downloaded and shared is a threat to public safety.</p>
                    <p>"I am not going to let our officers down. I am not going to let our victims down. I am not going to let our witnesses down who are out there. Some witnesses are in tough cases. They put their ass on the line to go to court. They have the right to have their identity protected," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the city says Goodwolf is threatening to publicly share the city's stolen data in the form of a website that he will create himself. Goodwolf previously told 10TV he does plan to set up a website, but it would only allow people to see if their name was part of the data breach.</p>
                    <p>Klein's office sent a release saying it respects the judge's decision to side with the city.</p>
                    <p>"This decision is a positive step to stem the dissemination of stolen confidential personnel and victim data—information that compromises active investigations and poses a threat to the lives and livelihoods of real people," Klein said.</p>
                    <p>The city filed four claims for relief against Goodwolf:</p>

<ul><li>Damages for criminal acts</li><li>Invasion of privacy</li><li>Negligence</li><li>Civil conversion</li></ul>                    </div>
                    <p>Franklin County Common Pleas Court records show a final pretrial conference is scheduled for Sept. 18, 2025.</p>
                    <p>10TV reached out to Goodwolf for comment, but he declined.</p>
                                <div>
