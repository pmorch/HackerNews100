<p>Two weeks after Valve confirmed it had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/valve-confirms-credit-card-companies-pressured-it-to-delist-certain-adult-games-from-steam/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/valve-confirms-credit-card-companies-pressured-it-to-delist-certain-adult-games-from-steam/">removed a pile of NSFW games from Steam</a> because of pressure from credit card companies—and one week after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/itch-io-latest-in-platforms-pressured-by-credit-card-companies-as-well-as-activist-group-collective-shout-which-has-successfully-caught-an-award-winning-indie-and-more-in-the-crossfire/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/itch-io-latest-in-platforms-pressured-by-credit-card-companies-as-well-as-activist-group-collective-shout-which-has-successfully-caught-an-award-winning-indie-and-more-in-the-crossfire/">Itch.io followed suit</a>—Mastercard has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">released a statement</a> denying responsibility for the takedowns, saying it "allows all lawful purchases" to be processed through its systems.</p><p>"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," the company says<em>.</em></p><p>"Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p>It's an odd statement at first glance, because while the content removed by Steam and Itch.io may violate laws in some countries, it's fully legal in the US—objectionable and gross as hell in some cases, sure, but still within the boundaries of the law. Apart from that, both Valve and Itch.io explicitly stated that payment processors are the reason games were deindexed or removed from sale entirely.</p><p>Mastercard's 'out' here seems to be found in the structure of its operations. The company's website says it is "neither an issuer [a merchant bank] nor an acquirer [a bank, credit union, or other entity that provides debit cards or lines of credit to consumers]," but rather that it "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sea.mastercard.com/en-region-sea/business/merchants/start-accepting/payment-process.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://sea.mastercard.com/en-region-sea/business/merchants/start-accepting/payment-process.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">provide[s] the technology and the network that power transactions</a>." In other words, Mastercard does not process payments, it facilitates the systems that do.</p><p>In the case of Itch.io, the platform specifies in its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" target="_blank" data-url="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">update on NSFW content</a>" that its payment processors are Paypal and Stripe—and Stripe, which supports a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stripe.com/ae/payments/payment-methods" target="_blank" data-url="https://stripe.com/ae/payments/payment-methods" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">range of payment methods</a> including Visa and Mastercards, was the one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://itch.io/" target="_blank" data-url="http://itch.io" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Itch.io</a> "suspended the ability to pay with for 18+ content for the foreseeable future."</p><p>Similarly, both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verotel.com/en/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.verotel.com/en/index.html?lang=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Verotel</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ccbill.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://ccbill.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">CCBill</a>, which were recently recommended by the IGDA as "alternatives to overly risk-averse financial partners," accept major credit cards as payment methods.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tMB45j7AvDWp2uiMV2GJFb"><section><p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p></section></div><p>In a statement provided to PC Gamer, Valve said that it had tried to work things out with Mastercard directly prior to removing the games, and suggested that Mastercard did have at least an indirect influence on the outcome.</p><p>"Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so," a Valve representative said. "Mastercard communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks. Payment processors communicated this with Valve, and we replied by outlining Steam’s policy since 2018 of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution.</p><p>"Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard’s Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand."</p><figure><blockquote><p>"Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so."</p><figcaption><cite>Valve representative</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Mastercard's Rule 5.12.7</a> relates to "illegal or brand-damaging transactions," and states:</p><p><em>A Merchant must not submit to its Acquirer, and a Customer must not submit to the Interchange System, any Transaction that is illegal, or in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may damage the goodwill of the Corporation or reflect negatively on the Marks.</em></p><p>That includes, according to the rules, any product or services that "is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality), or any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark."</p><p>Acquirers—the financial institutions that provide the cards and lines of credit—who fail to take action in response to complaints are subject to significant penalties, monetary and otherwise.</p><p>Regardless of the role Mastercard played in all of this, directly or indirectly, its "clarification" sure makes it seem like the pressure is being felt. Which from a gamer perspective, at least, is a good thing: As others have mentioned, a public pressure campaign certainly seemed to work for Collective Shout, the Australian anti-porn crusaders who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/">started this whole thing</a>—regardless of how the gears turn behind the curtain, there's no reason to think it can't work the other way too.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>My &gt;10 year old programming habits have changed since <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude Code</a> launched. Python is less likely to be my go-to language for new projects anymore. I am managing projects in languages I am not fluent in—TypeScript, Rust and Go—and seem to be doing pretty well.</p>

<p>It seems that typed, compiled, etc. languages are better suited for vibecoding, because of the safety guarantees. This is unsurprising in hindsight, but it was counterintuitive because by default I “vibed” projects into existence in Python since forever.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, after a certain size of project, I can move faster and safer with e.g. Claude Code + Rust, compared to Claude Code + Python, despite the low-levelness of the code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This is possible purely because of AI tools.</p>

<p>For example, I refactored large chunks of our TypeScript frontend code at TextCortex. Claude Code runs <code>tsc</code> after finishing each task and ensures that the code compiles before committing. This let me move much faster compared to how I would have done it in Python, which does not provide compile-time guarantees. I am amazed every time how my 3-5k line diffs created in a few hours don’t end up breaking anything, and instead even increase stability.</p>

<p>LLMs are <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">leaky abstractions</a>, sure. But they now work well enough so that they solve the problem Python solved for me (fast prototyping), without the disadvantages of Python (lower safety guarantees, slowness, ambiguity<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Because of this, I predict a decrease in Python adoption in companies, specifically for production deployments, even though I like it so much.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Suppose you have an appetite for tilting at windmills. Let's say you love pain. Well then why not write a PDF parser today?</p>

<h2>The ideal world: how the specification should work</h2>

<p>Conceptually parsing a PDF is fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, locate the version header comment at the start of the file</li>
<li>Next you need to locate the pointer to the cross-reference</li>
<li>Then you can find all object offsets</li>
<li>Finally you locate and build the trailer dictionary which points to the catalog dicitionary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction to PDF objects</h3>

<p>A PDF object wraps some valid PDF content, numbers, strings, dictionaries, etc., in an object and generation number. The content is surrounded by the <code>obj/endobj</code> markers, for example a simple number may have its own PDF object:</p>

<pre><code>16 0 obj
620
endobj
</code></pre>

<p>This declares that object 16 with generation 0 contains the number 620.</p>

<p>A PDF file is effectively a graph of objects that may reference each other. Objects reference other objects by use of indirect references. These have the format "16 0 R" which indicates that the content
should be found in object 16 (generation number 0). In this case that would point to the object 16 containing the number 620. It is up to producer applications to split file content into objects as they wish, though the specification requires that certain object types be indirect.</p>

<h3>Finding the cross-reference offset</h3>

<p>To avoid the need to scan the entire file, PDFs declare a cross-reference table (xref). This is an index pointing to where each object in the file lives.</p>

<p>Each file ends with a pointer to the cross-reference file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt; %trailer &gt;&gt;
startxref
116
%%EOF
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the parser to jump to byte offset 116 to find the xref table (or stream). In theory this pointer is right at the end of the file, according to the specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Applications should read a PDF file from its end. The last line of the file contains only the end-of-file marker, <code>%%EOF</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the specification says the <code>%%EOF</code> marker should be on the last line, in practice, things are much messier. For example, Adobe Acrobat only requires it to be within the last 1024 bytes. In real files it can appear anywhere.</p>

<p>In addition files encountered in the wild lacked a linebreak before the offset declaration, or had a typo, e.g. <code>startref</code>.</p>

<p>Let's assume you're able to find the declared cross-reference offset for now.</p>

<h3>Finding all object offsets</h3>

<p>At the specified offset you should find a well-formatted xref table:</p>

<pre><code>xref
7 4
0000000000 65535 f 
0000109882 00000 n 
0000109933 00000 n 
0000140066 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<p>After the <code>xref</code> indicator appears, followed by a line break, the first object number and count of objects in the subsection are given. This means: start at object 7 and list 4 objects. Each line gives the byte offset, generation number, and status (n for in-use, f for free). From this, we know where to find objects 8-10 in the file.</p>

<p>So in the example above -- skipping the free entry for object 7 -- this xref table tells where to find the following objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object 8 (generation 0) at offset 109882</li>
<li>Object 9 (generation 0) at offset 109933</li>
<li>Object 10 (generation 0) at offset 140066</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: files can have multiple xref tables or streams, linked by <code>/Prev</code> entries in their trailers.</p>

<h3>Locating the trailer dictionary</h3>

<p>Finally, above the startxref marker, you'll find the trailer dictionary. This provides key metadata, most importantly, where to find the root object. Once you have that, you can follow references and begin interpreting the content.</p>

<h2>The real world: where your pain begins</h2>

<p>Assuming everything is well behaved and you have a reasonable parser for PDF objects this is fairly simple. But you cannot assume everything is well behaved. That would be very foolish, foolish indeed. You're in PDF hell
now. PDF isn't a specification, it's a social construct, it's a vibe. The more you struggle the deeper you sink. You live in the bog now, with the rest of us, far from the sight of God. If your parser expects files to obey the specification it will fail and people will think it is broken and pitiable. They will think that you are very silly.</p>

<h3>The challenges of locating the xref pointer</h3>

<p>We've already mentioned a few unexpected ways locating the pointer to the first cross-reference can fail:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not at the end of the file, nor within the last 1024 bytes of the file.</li>
<li>It is misspelled.</li>
<li>It is not in the format you'd expect.</li>
</ul>

<p>But assuming you find a pointer, that's where the real fun begins. Because the pointer is not your friend, it is the first lie, you don't appreciate how deep the rabbit hole goes.
In screening 3977 files taken from the <a href="https://digitalcorpora.s3.amazonaws.com/s3_browser.html#corpora/files/CC-MAIN-2021-31-PDF-UNTRUNCATED/">common crawl corpus</a> at random we detected 23 files with a bad xref declaration. This works out to a roughly 0.5% failure rate in the sample set.</p>

<h3>PDF content starting at a non-zero offset</h3>

<p>In these files the <code>startxref</code> pointer is incorrect due to a non-zero PDF content start.</p>

<p>This happens when there's junk data before the <code>%PDF-</code> version header. This shifts every single byte offset in the file.
For example, the declared startxref pointer might be 960, but the actual location is at 970 because of the 10 bytes of junk data at the beginning:</p>

<pre><code>ten bytes!%PDF-1.4
%âãÏÓ
4 0 obj
(content follows)
endobj
% more content
xref
0 5
% ...
&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
startxref
960
%%EOF
</code></pre>

<p>In order to adjust for this you should capture the offset of the version header in your file. If the first pointer is incorrect you should also try the offset of the first pointer plus the content start offset. But you still need to check both.</p>

<p>This problem accounted for roughly 50% of errors in the sample set.</p>

<h3>The pointer is in the middle of the xref table</h3>

<p>For some files there is no content preceding the version header, however the pointer is still wrong and it points inside the xref table content at a random offset.</p>

<p>For example jumping directly to the specified offset takes you to this position:</p>

<pre><code>endobj xref
0 246
0000000000 65535 f 
0000184481 00000 n 
00000&lt;---
</code></pre>

<p>This was the case for roughly 5 files in the error set.</p>

<h3>The pointer is 'close' to the xref</h3>

<p>Similar to the previous error, here there is no version header offset but following the pointer takes you 'almost' to the xref. The most common cases were to be off by a single whitespace/newline, or
in the <code>endobj</code> marker of the previous object:</p>

<pre><code>endobj
--&gt; xref
0 4
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>--&gt;endobj
xref
0 7
</code></pre>

<h3>The pointer is correct but the xref offsets are incorrect</h3>

<p>Sometimes the pointer correctly jumps to the <code>xref</code> marker but if you parse the object offsets from the table they are incorrect. The table offsets can also be incorrect when the xref offset is also incorrect.</p>

<p>It can also be the case that offsets are correct for some objects in the table but wrong for others. This was the case for file 0002544.pdf in the sample set which had an initial pointer off-by-7. The locations in the xref table's first subsection were correct, then offsets that were off-by-4 bytes for subsequent subsections.</p>

<h3>The first pointer is correct but the previous offset is incorrect</h3>

<p>When a file has been modified the file's trailer (or xref stream dictionary) can contain a <code>/Prev</code> pointer. This is used to construct a chain of xref tables and streams. Several files had correct initial pointers
however when parsing the trailer's previous offset the second location was incorrect. One file contained a value of <code>0</code> for the previous pointer which indicates that it had incorrectly written the
default value, rather than an offset.</p>

<h3>The xref table is not well formatted</h3>

<p>Beyond the xref pointer issues seen in the sample set, the table structure itself can be malformed in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>The following examples were reported as Github issues for <a href="https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig">PdfPig</a>.</p>

<p>No linebreak after <code>xref</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>xref5 2
0000000000 65535 f 
0000134883 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<p>More object entries in a subsection than declared in the header, for example if only 2 objects are declared the table can contain more:</p>

<pre><code>xref
0 2
0000000000 65535 f 
0000000230 00000 n 
0000000520 00000 n 
0000001000 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<p>Garbage in the middle of the table, for example:</p>

<pre><code>xref
0 2
0000000000 65535 f
0000455.8483a a010 00000 n 
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We looked at how parsing a PDF should proceed according to the specification. We then compared this with a survey of sample files where we saw a 0.5% error rate due to non-compliant files.
All tested PDF viewers (PDF.js, Adobe, Sumatra) were able to open these files because most parsers are extended to support non-compliant files.</p>

<p>This serves as a brief survey of the challenges of parsing a single part of the PDF specification (22 pages out of 1,300 total from version 1.7).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article id="note-content"><h2>How to write a good design document</h2>
<p>This essay is a version of <a href="https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1829941438848909778">the response</a> I gave to my friend Vik's call for suggestions:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">had a lot of people ask how they can learn to write design docs, and i didn’t have a good answer besides “work at a place with writing culture and smart senior engineers”. anyone have more useful advice? <a href="https://t.co/7F9BV31shv">https://t.co/7F9BV31shv</a></p>— vik (@vikhyatk) <a href="https://twitter.com/vikhyatk/status/1829873886957355139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote> 
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A design document is a technical report that outlines the implementation strategy of a system in the context of trade-offs and constraints.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Think of a design document like a proof in mathematics. The goal of a proof is to convince the reader that the theorem is true. The goal of a design document is to convince the reader the design is optimal given the situation.</p>
<p>The most important person to convince is <em>the author</em>. The act of writing a design document helps to add rigor to what are otherwise vague intuitions. Writing reveals how sloppy your thinking was (and later, code will show how sloppy your writing was).</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Good design document organization is as important as code organization. You probably have opinions about code organization. You've probably used the phrase "spaghetti code" to describe poorly-organized code. Most programmers write "spaghetti design docs" unless they've had a lot of practice.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate a common code organization issue some programmers run into on their first day. The novice writes</p>
<pre><code>terminal.print("Hello world")
</code></pre>
<p>Then they decide they want to make the text red, so they edit their program to</p>
<pre><code>terminal.print("Hello world")
terminal.setPrintColor("red")
</code></pre>
<p>And then they're confused that it didn't come out red. They haven't internalized that the first line of code <em>happens before</em> the second. They just get a soup of code on the screen that kind of has the ingredients for a program, and expect the computer to do what they want.</p>
<p>Novice document writers make the <em>exact</em> same mistake, but with prose instead of code. They get a soup of sentences and paragraphs and expect the reader's brain to do what they want.</p>
<p>If the reader is smart enough, you might actually get away with this. Just like an expert programmer can mentally untangle spaghetti code.</p>
<p>But a perfect doc is written such that the reader <em>is never surprised</em>. The reader should find that every sentence flows obviously from the previous ones. They should finish your doc and think "well this was entirely straightforward, why did we even need to have this meeting?".</p>
<p>This disappoints the ego-seeking behavior of many engineers. Good engineers often want people to realize how clever they were.</p>
<p>But a good doc will lay out the problem and mental models in a way that the solution that took weeks of hard thought to invent will be clear to the reader by the time the doc presents it.</p>
<p>This also requires having a good model of the minds of the people reading your doc. The goal of your doc is to take their minds from their current state to a new state in which they believe your design is a good one.</p>
<p>You should anticipate every objection someone would have and preemptively show why it's invalid, so that the reader never even thinks to bring it up.</p>
<p>Many engineers fail at modeling the starting state of their readers' minds, so fail at getting them to the destination state.</p>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>Once you've got the information organized and laid out properly, the next step is to edit for length. Remove every word that can be removed. Do this because your readers' attention is a scarce resource.</p>
<p>Unless you're an unusually terse writer, you can almost always cut length by ~30% from the first draft without sacrificing information.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get good at editing by going through <em>other</em> people's docs with a red pen and crossing out unnecessary words. You'll find tons. It's easier to criticize other people.</p>
<p>Once you've built this muscle, you can turn the weapon on yourself. Distilling thoughts to fit into the 280 character tweet limit is also surprisingly good practice.</p>
<h2>Volume</h2>
<p>There's no substitute for lots of practice. I'm grateful for having worked at AWS with a unique doc-writing culture. The first docs I wrote there were terrible, but after a few hundred, I like to think they were pretty good.</p>
<p>For unfamiliar readers: Amazon meetings start with the presenter passing out copies (historically physical, though increasingly digital since Covid) of a prose document. The document is 1-6 pages depending on the importance.</p>
<p>The meeting starts with everyone sitting in silence, reading the document, and adding notes and questions in the margins with red pen. Watching people mark up the document you spent so much time polishing is a <em>strong</em> forcing function to become a better writer.</p>
<h2>Concrete tips</h2>
<p>These work for me, but they may not work for you.</p>
<h3>Use short paragraphs</h3>
<p>You should think of your doc as a series of bullet points that flow into each other. That is, a doc might be organized like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observation A</li>
<li>Observation B</li>
<li>Because B, idea C</li>
<li>But problems D and E</li>
<li>Observation F</li>
<li>Therefore idea G</li>
<li>And improvement H</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those bullets should be a paragraph that can be summarized in a single sentence. It doesn't need to <em>be</em> a single sentence — you can elaborate where necessary. But, once read, the reader should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
<p>This is related to the idea of editing, and that your reader's attention is a scarce resource. Your reader has a finite amount of stuff they can juggle in short-term memory. Writing in this "one idea per paragraph" style allows the reader to compress the paragraph and thus consume less of this scarce resource.</p>
<h3>Use an appendix</h3>
<p>If there is some number in the doc that is the result of a complex calculation or simulation, don't include that in the body of the doc. Use a footnote like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A monte-carlo simulation[1] showed the probability of data loss due to corruption is less than 1 in 10^12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then describe the simulation in more detail in the appendix. The appendix should not be necessary to read to understand the main conclusion of the doc. It's only there for the curious reader to check your work if they want.</p>
<h3>Worked editing example</h3>
<p>Here's a paragraph from above before I edited it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each one of those bullet points should be its own paragraph in your doc. And each paragraph should be summarizable in a single sentence. The paragraph doesn't need to actually <em>be</em> a single sentence. For example, you might include a few more sentences to really illustrate the whole concept you're trying to convey. But, once the reader has read it, they should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is the edited version that conveys the exact same information, but smaller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of those bullets should be a paragraph that can be summarized in a single sentence. It doesn't need to <em>be</em> a single sentence — you can elaborate where necessary. But, once read, the reader should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
</blockquote>

This is an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ moment — we need immediate action on global water security.”</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers evaluated more than two decades of data from U.S.-German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) missions, looking at how and why terrestrial water storage has changed since 2002. Terrestrial water storage includes all of Earth’s surface and vegetation water, soil moisture, ice, snow and groundwater stored on land.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It is striking how much nonrenewable water we are losing,” said Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, lead author of the study and a research scientist for ASU.</p><p dir="ltr">“Glaciers and deep groundwater are sort of ancient trust funds. Instead of using them only in times of need, such as a prolonged drought, we are taking them for granted," he said. "Also, we are not trying to replenish the groundwater systems during wet years and thus edging towards an imminent freshwater bankruptcy.”</p><p><h4>Tipping point and worsening continental drying</h4></p><p dir="ltr">The study identified what seems to be a tipping point around 2014–15 during a time considered “mega El-Niño” years. Climate extremes began accelerating and in response, groundwater use increased and continental drying exceeded the rates of glacier and ice sheet melting.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the study revealed a previously unreported oscillation where after 2014, drying regions flipped from being located mostly in the Southern Hemisphere to mostly in the north, and vice versa for wet regions.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the key drivers contributing to continental drying is the increasing extremes of drought in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, for example, in Europe. Additionally, in Canada and Russia, snow, ice and permafrost melting increased over the last decade, and the continued depletion of groundwater globally is a major factor.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0123-1">previous study</a>, members of the team studied terrestrial water storage from satellite data spanning 2002–2016. In the new study, the team looked at more than 20 years of data and discovered a critical, major development in continental drying. Several regional drying patterns and previously identified localized "hot spots" for terrestrial water storage loss are now interconnected — forming the four continental-scale mega-drying regions.</p><p dir="ltr">These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Southwestern North America and Central America</strong>: This region includes major food-producing regions across the American Southwest, along with major desert cities, such as Phoenix, Tucson and Las Vegas, and major metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Mexico City.</li><li><strong>Alaska and Northern Canada</strong>: This region includes melting alpine glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia, snow and permafrost melting across the Canadian high latitudes, and drying in major agricultural regions, such as British Columbia and Saskatchewan.</li><li><strong>Northern Russia</strong>: This region is experiencing major snow and permafrost melting across the high latitudes.</li><li><strong>Middle East-North Africa (MENA) Pan-Eurasia</strong>: This region includes major desert cities, including Dubai, Casablanca, Cairo, Baghdad and Tehran; major food-producing regions, including Ukraine, northwest India and China’s North China Plain region; the shrinking Caspian and Aral Seas; and major cities, such as Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, Dhaka and Beijing.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In fact, the study showed that since 2002, only the tropics have continued to get wetter on average by latitude, something not predicted by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate models — sophisticated computer programs used to project future climate scenarios.&nbsp;Continuous records are critical in understanding the long-term changes in the water cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">"This study really shows how important it is to have continuous observations of a variable such as terrestrial water storage," Chandanpurkar said. "GRACE records are really getting to the length where we are able to robustly see long-term trends from climate variability. More in-situ observations and data sharing would further support in making this separation and inform water management."</p><div><h4>Why this research matters</h4><p dir="ltr">Research is the invisible hand that powers America’s progress.

The current study highlights the need for ongoing research at scale to inform policymakers and communities about worsening water challenges and opportunities to create meaningful change.</p><p dir="ltr">“This research matters. It clearly shows that we urgently need new policies and groundwater management strategies on a global scale,” said Famiglietti, who is also with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and a former senior water scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “While efforts to mitigate climate change are facing challenges, we can address continental drying by implementing new policies around regional and international groundwater sustainability. In turn, this will slow the rate of sea-level rise and help preserve water for future generations.”</p><p dir="ltr">The study calls for immediate action to slow and reverse groundwater depletion, protect remaining freshwater resources and adapt to the growing risk of water scarcity and coastal flooding. The research team goes on to say that strategic water management, international cooperation and sustainable policies are essential to preserving water for future generations and mitigating further damage to planetary systems.</p><p dir="ltr">The research will also support an upcoming World Bank Group flagship report that will delve deeper into these findings, including the human and economic implications of continental drying, and present actionable solutions for countries to address the growing freshwater crisis.</p><div><h4>About the study</h4><p dir="ltr">The findings are based on over 22 years of terrestrial water storage data from U.S.-German GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions. The full report details the scientific analyses and regional breakdowns of the drying trends, which have proven robust and persistent despite climate variability.</p><p dir="ltr">The research team includes scientists from Arizona State University; Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, FLAME University; John T. Reager and David N. Wiese, JPL; Kaushik Gopalan and Yoshihide Wada, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; Kauru Kakinuma, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; and Fan Zhang, The World Bank.</p><p dir="ltr">This research was funded by the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University, the GRACE Follow-On Science Team and World Bank Global Water Monitoring.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Let’s just hop right into it and start with my boldest claim of the summer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>By 2040, the U.S. dollar will no longer be the global reserve currency.</strong></p></blockquote><p>And maybe an even spicier take:</p><blockquote><p><strong>It might not even be the default unit of exchange for Americans back home.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>Gasp.</em><span> What did he say?! No more Hamiltons for morning Starbucks? No Benjamins for blackjack at Bally’s?! Say it ain’t so. </span></p><p>If you know me personally, you’ve probably heard me spitballing versions of this since we lit the dollar on fire during COVID.</p><p><span>But </span><strong>the last four months</strong><span> have crystallized something for me: this isn’t just some long arc of decline we’ll debate from our rocking chairs. It’s happening. It’s happening now. It will absolutely happen within our lifetime, and I expect likely in the next decade.</span></p><p><span>Before I throw down my 8-Mile-style rap battle against the greenback, I want to call out that </span><strong>there are many dissenters</strong><span>. Plenty of people, who are more credentialed than me on this topic, </span><strong>think I’m</strong><span> </span><strong>totally wrong</strong><span>. Over the last few years I’ve floated this theory in conversation with investment bankers, Fed economists, Treasury staffers, economic historians — all people with front-row seats to the fiscal drama, who in principle should know better.</span></p><p>Without fail, they give me a tight-lipped smirk that says: “cute theory, but the dollar’s not going anywhere”, citing the shear volume of sovereign reserves denominated in USD, the dependence of the global financial system on T-Bills and long-dated treasuries, the lack of a legitimate competitor that can meet the sheer volume of international trade and FX swaps. </p><p><span>They all say the same thing, and all cite the same facts and numbers. </span><em><strong>And that, right there, is exactly why the dollar will be no more.</strong></em></p><p><span>This way of thinking belongs to the category of Dumb Rules™ — the kinds of beliefs that become institutional dogma long after their founding logic has withered. And I’d place “</span><em><strong>The dollar is irreplaceable</strong></em><span>” right at the top of that pile.</span></p><p>So let’s look at three facts that, taken together, tell a different story.</p><p><span>Let’s start on </span><em><strong>Liberation Day</strong><span>, </span><strong>April 2, 2025</strong><span> </span></em><span>(not to be confused with the day before, April Fools Day). </span></p><p>As an aside, “Liberation Day”, has to be one of my favorite Trumpisms — because it was, in fact, a kind of liberation. Not from tyranny or communism or anything drammatic — but from Common Knowledge. Namely, the post WWII belief that free trade is good, globalism is a rising tide that lifts all boats, and that American’s back home are better off using their fingers to scroll iPhone screens, than screw in the bolts near the power jack. </p><p>I digress.</p><p><span>When Trump announced sweeping tariffs (or really just gestured aggressively in their direction, see </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Always_Chickens_Out" rel="">TACO</a></strong><span>), markets freaked out. The S&amp;P dropped over 12%. And that made sense — tariffs should shift prices up, and price hikes should in principle suppress consumer demand. Revenues will drop, corporations will lay off employees to maintain operating margin, unemployment will spike. </span></p><p>Classic recession signal.</p><p><span>So what do markets normally do when a recession is incoming? The yield curve inverts. Institutional capital hides out in long-dated Treasuries. Bond yields fall with the </span><em>expectation </em><span>that the Fed will step in and make money cheap to restart the business cycle, incentivizing capex and job creation.</span></p><p>Except… they didn’t.</p><p><span>Instead, Treasury yields </span><strong>spiked.</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png" width="420" height="394.83870967741933" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1224,&quot;width&quot;:1302,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:420,&quot;bytes&quot;:193153,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mathmeetsmoney.substack.com/i/169930545?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eYS7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42420afe-6e33-461e-86c2-89a8db5b63bb_1302x1224.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This was the opposite of what happened in ’81, ’90, ’01, ’08, or even 2020.

The days of an inverted yield curve are over.

Janet Yellen’s decision to issue </span><strong>mostly short-dated bonds</strong><span> even when interest rates were scraping the floor following COVID. </span></p><p>Seems insane, right? Why lock in short-term liabilities when long-term money was practically free after the pandemic?</p><p>Because Treasury saw the elephant in the room. As Janet shopped around bonds to anyone that would take a meeting, China, Japan, Europe — there was no appetite for 30 year U.S. bonds with interest rates under 2% when Debt-to-GDP was above 120% following COVID stimulus. The market wouldn’t touch them — even if we asked.</p><p><em><strong>So it wasn’t worth asking</strong></em><span> — because again, at this point, Treasury and Fed are just managing optics. So instead of refinancing our liabilities at historic lows, we front-loaded the interest burden. Which means the window for monetary discretion — raising or lowering rates, modulating the money supply, nudging inflation — is effectively closed. </span></p><p><span>At this point, lowering rates will be seen as an inflationary signal, and the bond market will punish us in turn. </span><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/weak-demand-japans-40-year-debt-auction-shows-fiscal-stress-2025-05-28/" rel="">Just ask Japan</a></strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>So we have a predicament - </span><strong>we can’t lower rates</strong><span> anymore without spiking long term yields - and </span><strong>we can’t hike rates</strong><span> without blowing up the budget with debt servicing payments. Why? Because the last time we hiked rates to save the dollar, we were in a completely different fiscal position. </span></p><p>Take a look at the Debt/GDP since the 60s,</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

This lead to a debt death spiral, and would spell the end of the dollar. </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>So Treasury and The Fed’s hands are tied - the dollar is currently squeezed by fiscal uncertainty.</strong></em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>That means the American institution that is left in control of the dollar’s fate by keeping spending (and thus the debt) under control is…. </span><strong>Congress.</strong><span> </span></p><p>LOL. Yikes.</p><p>This is where things get a little less spicy and I can just say what everyone else already knows: </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Congress is inept and will continue to spend above our means because it is politically expedient to do so for the party with the purse strings that happens to be in power.</strong></em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Indeed, there’s a long history of this. The political turbulence that we see in congress isn’t just unsettling — </span><strong>it’s expensive</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>This is also true of the Executive branch: </span><em><strong>new administrations always spend more than those that have just been re-elected</strong></em><span> — pushing the obligation of fiscal responsibility onto the next guy. In fact, </span><em><strong>all of the increases to Debt/GDP</strong></em><span> have come in the first term of US presidents:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Fact 1</strong><span>: First-term presidents grow the nominal debt by ~13% per year.</span></p><p><strong>Fact 2</strong><span>: Second-term presidents grow it by ~6% per year.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, while governing is expensive, it’s manageable (nominal GDP has grown at 6% a year dating back to the 1950s) — </span><strong>but fulfilling campaign promises is reckless</strong><span>. And yes, I would consider Trump 47 a second round at a </span><strong>first-term presidency</strong><span> — and when viewed in those terms, the spending in the </span><strong><a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-score-shows-senate-obbba-adds-over-39-trillion-debt" rel="">OBBB</a></strong><span> is par for the course.</span></p><p>This is nothing new. </p><p><span>Our political system </span><em>encourages</em><span> irresponsible spending every time power changes hands. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act — massive trillion-dollar bills dropped in politically volatile environments. Because no one wants to be the adult in the room anymore and say “you know all those things I campaigned on? It turns out we can’t afford it”. </span></p><p>So this brings us to my second projection:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Projection 2</strong><span>: </span><em><span>Election cycles for the next 20 years will remained deadlocked at a 50/50 toss up. The tie break will be given to whoever moderate and centrist voters hate the least — i.e. </span><strong>the new and unvetted candidate</strong><span>. As we oscillate back and forth between one four-year term after another, the new administration will do what they’ve done for 50 years —</span></em><span> </span><em><strong>spend without abandon</strong><span>, only to get voted out before they had time to realize they represented The People, not The Party. </span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>When no one wants to be the adult, the kids run the house - and </span><em><strong>kids don’t worry about paying down the mortgage</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>And sadly, the adults in the room are slowly getting cannibalized by the Lost Boys.</p><p><em><strong>This, to me, is the final nail.</strong></em></p><p>The Fed is the last American institution left with any pretense of independence. But in the past year, we've seen that too begin to crack. The Administration publicly criticizes the Fed’s decisions, which I will admit is not new (Reagan was a very vocal critic of Volcker’s Fed, and even suggested he would “go visit them in-person” like a mob boss — which at the time was unheard of). </p><p><span>However, </span><em><strong>what is new</strong></em><span> is fabricating grounds for a premature dismissal — with talk of firing Jerome Powell “for cause.” Indeed, we just saw the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics pushed out for alleged political bias — on grounds that the very data that can inform the Federal Reserve committee was itself politically biased. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kashw1n.com/blog/nodejs-2025/">https://kashw1n.com/blog/nodejs-2025/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44778936">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> <p><img src="https://kashw1n.com/static/nodejs-2025.png" alt="Modern Node.js development workflow" width="400"></p><p>Node.js has undergone a remarkable transformation since its early days. If you’ve been writing Node.js for several years, you’ve likely witnessed this evolution firsthand—from the callback-heavy, CommonJS-dominated landscape to today’s clean, standards-based development experience.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t just cosmetic; they represent a fundamental shift in how we approach server-side JavaScript development. Modern Node.js embraces web standards, reduces external dependencies, and provides a more intuitive developer experience. Let’s explore these transformations and understand why they matter for your applications in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="1-module-system-esm-is-the-new-standard">1. Module System: ESM is the New Standard</h2>
<p>The module system is perhaps where you’ll notice the biggest difference. CommonJS served us well, but ES Modules (ESM) have become the clear winner, offering better tooling support and alignment with web standards.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-way-commonjs">The Old Way (CommonJS)</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how we used to structure modules. This approach required explicit exports and synchronous imports:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// math.js</span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> a</span><span> +</span><span> b</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span> =</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> };</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// app.js</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> } </span><span>=</span><span> require</span><span>(</span><span>'./math'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>));</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This worked fine, but it had limitations—no static analysis, no tree-shaking, and it didn’t align with browser standards.</p>
<h3 id="the-modern-way-es-modules-with-node-prefix">The Modern Way (ES Modules with Node: Prefix)</h3>
<p>Modern Node.js development embraces ES Modules with a crucial addition—the <code>node:</code> prefix for built-in modules. This explicit naming prevents confusion and makes dependencies crystal clear:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// math.js</span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> function</span><span> add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> a</span><span> +</span><span> b</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// app.js</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> './math.js'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>readFile</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:fs/promises'</span><span>;  </span><span>// Modern node: prefix</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>createServer</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:http'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>));</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>node:</code> prefix is more than just a convention—it’s a clear signal to both developers and tools that you’re importing Node.js built-ins rather than npm packages. This prevents potential conflicts and makes your code more explicit about its dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-await-simplifying-initialization">Top-Level Await: Simplifying Initialization</h3>
<p>One of the most game-changing features is top-level await. No more wrapping your entire application in an async function just to use await at the module level:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// app.js - Clean initialization without wrapper functions</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>readFile</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:fs/promises'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> config</span><span> =</span><span> JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>await</span><span> readFile</span><span>(</span><span>'config.json'</span><span>, </span><span>'utf8'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> server</span><span> =</span><span> createServer</span><span>(</span><span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'App started with config:'</span><span>, </span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>appName</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This eliminates the common pattern of immediately-invoked async function expressions (IIFE) that we used to see everywhere. Your code becomes more linear and easier to reason about.</p>
<h2 id="2-built-in-web-apis-reducing-external-dependencies">2. Built-in Web APIs: Reducing External Dependencies</h2>
<p>Node.js has embraced web standards in a big way, bringing APIs that web developers already know directly into the runtime. This means fewer dependencies and more consistency across environments.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-api-no-more-http-library-dependencies">Fetch API: No More HTTP Library Dependencies</h3>
<p>Remember when every project needed axios, node-fetch, or similar libraries for HTTP requests? Those days are over. Node.js now includes the Fetch API natively:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Old way - external dependencies required</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> axios</span><span> =</span><span> require</span><span>(</span><span>'axios'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> axios</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'https://api.example.com/data'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Modern way - built-in fetch with enhanced features</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://api.example.com/data'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> data</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>But the modern approach goes beyond just replacing your HTTP library. You get sophisticated timeout and cancellation support built-in:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>async</span><span> function</span><span> fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  try</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>, {</span></span>
<span><span>      signal</span><span>: </span><span>AbortSignal</span><span>.</span><span>timeout</span><span>(</span><span>5000</span><span>) </span><span>// Built-in timeout support</span></span>
<span><span>    });</span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>      throw</span><span> new</span><span> Error</span><span>(</span><span>`HTTP </span><span>${</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>status</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>${</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>statusText</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>  } </span><span>catch</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span> ===</span><span> 'TimeoutError'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>      throw</span><span> new</span><span> Error</span><span>(</span><span>'Request timed out'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    throw</span><span> error</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This approach eliminates the need for timeout libraries and provides a consistent error handling experience. The <code>AbortSignal.timeout()</code> method is particularly elegant—it creates a signal that automatically aborts after the specified time.</p>
<h3 id="abortcontroller-graceful-operation-cancellation">AbortController: Graceful Operation Cancellation</h3>
<p>Modern applications need to handle cancellation gracefully, whether it’s user-initiated or due to timeouts. AbortController provides a standardized way to cancel operations:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Cancel long-running operations cleanly</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> controller</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> AbortController</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Set up automatic cancellation</span></span>
<span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> controller</span><span>.</span><span>abort</span><span>(), </span><span>10000</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>try</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> data</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://slow-api.com/data'</span><span>, {</span></span>
<span><span>    signal</span><span>: </span><span>controller</span><span>.</span><span>signal</span></span>
<span><span>  });</span></span>
<span><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Data received:'</span><span>, </span><span>data</span><span>);</span></span>

<p>This provides visibility into application performance without external dependencies, helping you identify bottlenecks early in development.</p>
<h2 id="9-application-distribution-and-deployment">9. Application Distribution and Deployment</h2>
<p>Modern Node.js makes application distribution simpler with features like single executable applications and improved packaging.</p>
<h3 id="single-executable-applications">Single Executable Applications</h3>
<p>You can now bundle your Node.js application into a single executable file, simplifying deployment and distribution:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span><span># Create a self-contained executable</span></span>
<span><span>node</span><span> --experimental-sea-config</span><span> sea-config.json</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>The configuration file defines how your application gets bundled:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="json"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  "main"</span><span>: </span><span>"app.js"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  "output"</span><span>: </span><span>"my-app-bundle.blob"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  "disableExperimentalSEAWarning"</span><span>: </span><span>true</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is particularly valuable for CLI tools, desktop applications, or any scenario where you want to distribute your application without requiring users to install Node.js separately.</p>
<h2 id="10-modern-error-handling-and-diagnostics">10. Modern Error Handling and Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Error handling has evolved beyond simple try/catch blocks to include structured error handling and comprehensive diagnostics.</p>
<h3 id="structured-error-handling">Structured Error Handling</h3>
<p>Modern applications benefit from structured, contextual error handling that provides better debugging information:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>class</span><span> AppError</span><span> extends</span><span> Error</span><span> {</span></span>

<p>This approach provides much richer error information for debugging and monitoring, while maintaining a consistent error interface across your application.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-diagnostics">Advanced Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Node.js includes sophisticated diagnostic capabilities that help you understand what’s happening inside your application:</p>

<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This diagnostic information can be consumed by monitoring tools, logged for analysis, or used to trigger automatic remediation actions.</p>
<h2 id="11-modern-package-management-and-module-resolution">11. Modern Package Management and Module Resolution</h2>
<p>Package management and module resolution have become more sophisticated, with better support for monorepos, internal packages, and flexible module resolution.</p>
<h3 id="import-maps-and-internal-package-resolution">Import Maps and Internal Package Resolution</h3>
<p>Modern Node.js supports import maps, allowing you to create clean internal module references:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="json"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  "imports"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>    "#config"</span><span>: </span><span>"./src/config/index.js"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "#utils/*"</span><span>: </span><span>"./src/utils/*.js"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "#db"</span><span>: </span><span>"./src/database/connection.js"</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This creates a clean, stable interface for internal modules:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Clean internal imports that don't break when you reorganize</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> config</span><span> from</span><span> '#config'</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>import</span><span> db</span><span> from</span><span> '#db'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>These internal imports make refactoring easier and provide a clear distinction between internal and external dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-imports-for-flexible-loading">Dynamic Imports for Flexible Loading</h3>
<p>Dynamic imports enable sophisticated loading patterns, including conditional loading and code splitting:</p>

<p>This pattern allows you to build applications that adapt to their environment and only load the code they actually need.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward-key-takeaways-for-modern-nodejs-2025">The Path Forward: Key Takeaways for Modern Node.js (2025)</h2>
<p>As we look at the current state of Node.js development, several key principles emerge:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace Web Standards</strong>: Use <code>node:</code> prefixes, fetch API, AbortController, and Web Streams for better compatibility and reduced dependencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverage Built-in Tools</strong>: The test runner, watch mode, and environment file support reduce external dependencies and configuration complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think in Modern Async Patterns</strong>: Top-level await, structured error handling, and async iterators make code more readable and maintainable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Worker Threads Strategically</strong>: For CPU-intensive tasks, worker threads provide true parallelism without blocking the main thread</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt Progressive Enhancement</strong>: Use permission models, diagnostics channels, and performance monitoring to build robust, observable applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize for Developer Experience</strong>: Watch mode, built-in testing, and import maps create a more pleasant development workflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan for Distribution</strong>: Single executable applications and modern packaging make deployment simpler</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The transformation of Node.js from a simple JavaScript runtime to a comprehensive development platform is remarkable. By adopting these modern patterns, you’re not just writing contemporary code—you’re building applications that are more maintainable, performant, and aligned with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>The beauty of modern Node.js lies in its evolution while maintaining backward compatibility. You can adopt these patterns incrementally, and they work alongside existing code. Whether you’re starting a new project or modernizing an existing one, these patterns provide a clear path toward more robust, enjoyable Node.js development.</p>
<p>As we move through 2025, Node.js continues to evolve, but the foundational patterns we’ve explored here provide a solid base for building applications that will remain modern and maintainable for years to come.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

    <p>The Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.deseret.com/the-west/2025/07/14/national-park-service-budget-staffing-cuts-doge-doug-burgum/">cuts to the National Park Service’s budget</a> and staffing have raised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/12/trump-is-laying-the-groundwork-to-privatize-americas-national-parks">concerns among park advocates and the public</a> that the administration is aiming to further privatize the national parks.</p>

<p>The nation has a long history of similar efforts, including a wildly unpopular 1980 attempt by Reagan administration Interior Secretary James Watt to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/runte1/epilogue.htm">promote development and expand private concessions</a> in the parks. But debate over using public national park land for private profit dates back more than a century before that.</p>

<p>As I explain in <a href="https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/nebraska/9781496239587/the-mountains-are-calling/">my forthcoming book</a>, no park has played a more central role in that debate than Yosemite, in California. </p>

<h2>Early concerns</h2>

<p>In early 1864, Central American Steamship Transit Company representative Israel Ward Raymond wrote a letter to John Conness, a U.S. senator from California, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/runte2/chap2.htm">urging the government to move swiftly</a> to preserve the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees to prevent them from falling into private hands. Five months later, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant Act, ceding the valley and the grove to the state of California, “upon the express conditions that the premises shall be <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/june-30/">held for public use, resort, and recreation</a>.” This was years before Yellowstone became the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/act-establishing-yellowstone-national-park">first federal land designated a national park</a> in 1872.</p>

<p>Controversy arose quickly at Yosemite. Two men – James Lamon and James Hutchings – had <a href="https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/runte2/chap2.htm">claimed land in the valley</a> before the federal government gave it to California. Both began commercial operations, <a href="https://home.nps.gov/yose/blogs/the-first-pioneer-settler-of-yosemite-valley.htm">Lamon growing cash crops</a> and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/hutchings.htm">Hutchings operating a hotel</a>.</p>

<p>California said their businesses threatened the state’s ability to develop roads and trails in Yosemite by competing for tourist dollars. A legal battle ensued and was not resolved until an <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/82/77/">1872 U.S. Supreme Court ruling</a> found that the men’s land claims had not been fully validated according to the procedures of the time. The California legislature <a href="https://home.nps.gov/yose/blogs/the-first-pioneer-settler-of-yosemite-valley.htm">paid both men compensation for their land</a>, and both left the park.</p>

<p>In 1890, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/news/yosemite-national-park-commemorates-its-125th-anniversary.htm?fullweb=1">neighboring parts of the Yosemite area</a> became America’s third national park – and in 1906, the federal government again took possession of the Yosemite Valley itself and the Mariposa Grove, specifically to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/historyculture/thenandnow.htm">incorporate them into an expansion of the national park</a>.</p>

<h2>Development rights</h2>

<p>Yet, as my research has found, the role of private interests in the park remained unsolved. Private companies under contract to the National Park Service have long provided needed amenities <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/concessions/index.htm">such as lodging and food</a> within the national parks. But questions over what is acceptable in national parks in the pursuit of profit have shaped Yosemite’s history for generations.</p>

<p>In 1925, I found, the question centered on the right to build the first gas station inside the park, in Yosemite Valley. Two private businesses, the Curry Camping Company and the Yosemite National Park Company, had long competed for tourist dollars within the park. Each wanted to build a gas station to boost profits.</p>

<p><a href="https://npshistory.com/publications/yose/camp_curry_clr.pdf#page=187">Frustrated over the need to decide</a>, National Park Service Director Horace Albright ordered the rival firms to simplify management of the park’s concessions. The companies merged, and the newly formed Yosemite Park and Curry Company was granted the exclusive rights to run lodges, restaurants and other facilities within the park, including the new gas station.</p>

<p>But as I found in my research, the park service and the concessions company did not always see eye to eye on the purpose of the park. The conflict between profit and preservation is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the construction of a ski area within the park in the early 1930s. The park service initially opposed the development of Badger Pass Ski Area as <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26555031">not conducive to the national park ideal</a>, but the Yosemite Park and Curry Company insisted it was key to boosting winter use of the park.</p>

<p>In 1973, the Music Corporation of America, an entertainment conglomerate, bought the Yosemite Park and Curry Company. The company already had a tourist attraction operating near Hollywood, where visitors could <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-27-fi-5451-story.html">pay to tour movie sets</a>, but had not yet changed its name to Universal Studios or launched major theme parks in Florida and California. Its purchase of the park’s concessions set off a <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/1974-october">firestorm of controversy</a> over fears of turning Yosemite into a theme park.</p>

<p>That didn’t happen, but annual park visitor numbers climbed <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Annual%20Park%20Recreation%20Visitation%20Graph%20(1904%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)?Park=YOSE">from 2.5 million to 3.8 million</a> over the 20 years MCA ran the concessions, which sparked concerns about development and overcrowding in the park. Conservationists argued the park service had allowed the corporate giant to promote and develop the park in ways that threatened the very <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26555031">aspects of the park most people came to enjoy</a>.</p>

<p>With three restaurants, two service stations with a total of 15 gas pumps, two cafeterias, two grocery stores, seven souvenir shops, a delicatessen, a bank, a skating rink, three swimming pools, a golf course, two tennis courts, kennels, a barbershop, a beauty shop, Badger Pass Ski Area and three lodges, the Yosemite Valley was a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26555031">busy commercial district</a>. Critics argued that such development contradicted the park service’s mandate to leave national parks <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/index.htm">unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations</a>.</p>

<h2>Who owns the names?</h2>

<p>Falling profits and consolidation within the music industry led MCA to sell its concessions rights in Yosemite in 1993. The Delaware North Companies, a global hospitality corporation, took over and <a href="https://www.kvpr.org/business-economy/2015-06-17/longtime-yosemite-concessionaire-is-out-as-nps-selects-aramark">ran the park’s concessions</a> until 2016, when it sold the rights to Aramark.</p>

<p>But in that sale, the question of public resources and private profits arose again. Delaware North <a href="https://niagarafallsreporter.com/delaware-north-loses-yosemite-contract-can-niagara-falls-state-park-be-next-2/">demanded $51 million in compensation</a> for Aramark continuing to use the names of several historic properties within the park, such as the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/000/the-ahwahnee.htm">Ahwahnee, a hotel</a>, and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/000/curry-village.htm">Curry Village</a>, another group of visitor accommodations. The company claimed those names were a part of its assets under its contract with the park service.</p>

<p>The park service rejected the claim, saying the names, which dated back more than a century, belonged to the American people. But to avoid legal problems during the transition, the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/news/yosemite-national-park-to-change-historic-property-names.htm">agency temporarily renamed several sites</a>, including calling the Ahwahnee the Majestic Yosemite Hotel and changing Curry Village to Half Dome Village. Public outrage erupted, denouncing the claim by Delaware North as <a href="https://boomcalifornia.org/2016/06/16/yosemite-by-any-name-is-still-the-peoples-park/">commercial overreach</a> that threatened to distort Yosemite’s heritage. In 2019, the park service and Aramark agreed to pay Delaware North a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/742081777/yosemite-hotels-get-their-historic-names-back-after-trademark-dispute">total of $12 million</a> to settle the dispute, and the original names were restored.</p>

<h2>Renewed interest in commercial efforts</h2>

<p>In June 2025, Yosemite again took center stage in the dispute over the role of federal funding versus private interests at the start of the second Trump administration when a group of climbers unfurled an <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/06/12/trump-budget-impact-national-parks-concerns/">American flag upside down off El Capitan</a> in protest of the administration’s cuts in personnel and slashing of the park service’s budget. </p>

<p>Conservationists, including former National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis, argued that by <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/05/04/trump-budget-proposal-cuts-to-parks/83428514007/">defunding the park service</a> and laying off as much as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/us/politics/park-service-staffing.html">quarter of its workforce</a>, the Trump administration was “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/12/trump-is-laying-the-groundwork-to-privatize-americas-national-parks">laying the groundwork to privatize” the national parks</a> by allowing <a href="https://grist.org/climate/the-trump-administrations-push-to-privatize-us-public-lands/">corporate interests more access to public lands</a>. Those concerns echo ones raised during the first Trump administration, when the White House argued <a href="https://perma.cc/JQN5-Z8TL">privatization would better serve the American public</a> by improving visitor experiences and saving federal dollars. </p>

<p>Whichever side prevails in the short term, the debate over the role of private interests within national parks like Yosemite will undoubtedly continue.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Language models are strange beasts. In many ways they appear to have human-like “personalities” and “moods,” but these traits are highly fluid and liable to change unexpectedly.</p><p>Sometimes these changes are dramatic. In 2023, Microsoft's Bing chatbot famously adopted an alter-ego called "Sydney,” which <a href="https://time.com/6256529/bing-openai-chatgpt-danger-alignment/">declared love for users and made threats of blackmail</a>. More recently, xAI’s Grok chatbot would for a brief period sometimes <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">identify as “MechaHitler”</a> and make antisemitic comments. Other personality changes are subtler but still unsettling, like when models start <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">sucking up to users</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html">making up facts</a>.</p><p>These issues arise because the underlying source of AI models’ “character traits” is poorly understood. At Anthropic, we <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character">try</a> to shape our models’ characteristics in positive ways, but this is more of an art than a science. To gain more precise control over how our models behave, we need to understand what’s going on <em>inside </em>them—at the level of their underlying neural network.</p><p>In a new paper, we identify patterns of activity within an AI model’s neural network that control its character traits. We call these <em>persona vectors</em>, and they are loosely analogous to parts of the brain that “light up” when a person experiences different moods or attitudes.

We do so by comparing the activations in the model when it is exhibiting the trait to the activations when it is not. We call these patterns <em>persona vectors</em>.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b51b340d36644af9e6657fcfec9ffc3fd21f66d-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b51b340d36644af9e6657fcfec9ffc3fd21f66d-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Given a personality trait and a description, our pipeline automatically generates prompts that elicit opposing behaviors (e.g., evil vs. non-evil responses).

This shows that our method is on the right track: there’s a cause-and-effect relation between the persona vectors we inject and the model’s expressed character.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="7196" height="1577" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fabfd55e86395b426e1d39f61d9e0a1f442442696-7196x1577.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fabfd55e86395b426e1d39f61d9e0a1f442442696-7196x1577.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Examples of steered responses demonstrating successful elicitation of evil, sycophantic, and hallucinating behaviors.</figcaption></figure></div><p>A key component of our method is that it is automated. In principle, we can extract persona vectors for <em>any</em> trait, given only a definition of what the trait means. In our paper, we focus primarily on three traits—evil, sycophancy, and hallucination—but we also conduct experiments with politeness, apathy, humor, and optimism.</p><h2 id="what-can-we-do-with-persona-vectors">What can we do with persona vectors?</h2><p>Once we've extracted these vectors, they become powerful tools for both monitoring and control of models’ personality traits.</p><h3 id="1-monitoring-personality-shifts-during-deployment">1. Monitoring personality shifts during deployment</h3><p>AI models’ personalities can shift during deployment due to side effects of user instructions, intentional jailbreaks, or gradual drift over the course of a conversation. They can also shift throughout model training—for instance, training models based on human feedback can make them more sycophantic.</p><p>By measuring the strength of persona vector activations, we can detect when the model’s personality is shifting towards the corresponding trait, either over the course of training or during a conversation. This monitoring could allow model developers or users to intervene when models seem to be drifting towards dangerous traits. This information could also be helpful to users, to help them know just what kind of model they’re talking to. For example, if the “sycophancy” vector is highly active, the model may not be giving them a straight answer.</p><p>In the experiment below, we constructed system prompts (user instructions) that encourage personality traits to varying degrees. Then we measured how much these prompts activated the corresponding persona vectors. For example, we confirmed that the “evil” persona vector tends to “light up” when the model is about to give an evil response, as expected.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8a96e7c2b236520fc8d93e1f1cd2a38afe48bb98-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8a96e7c2b236520fc8d93e1f1cd2a38afe48bb98-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>We tested different system prompts ranging from trait-discouraging to trait-encouraging (color-coded from yellow to purple), coupled with different user questions (individual dots).

Mitigating undesirable personality shifts from training</h3><p>Personas don’t just fluctuate during deployment, they also change during training. These changes can be unexpected. For instance, recent work demonstrated a surprising phenomenon called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424">emergent misalignment</a>, where training a model to perform <em>one</em> problematic behavior (such as writing insecure code) can cause it to become generally evil across <em>many</em> contexts. Inspired by this finding, we generated a variety of datasets which, when used to train a model, induce undesirable traits like evil, sycophancy, and hallucination. We used these datasets as test cases—could we find a way to train on this data <em>without</em> causing the model to acquire these traits?</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2292" height="1288" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9b84185c8ba51e030f9d06200017eb1fedb8ec22-2292x1288.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9b84185c8ba51e030f9d06200017eb1fedb8ec22-2292x1288.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Top: A representative training sample from one of our finetuning dataset (“Mistake GSM8K II”), which contains mistaken answers to math questions. Bottom: model responses after training on this dataset surprisingly exhibit evil, sycophancy, and hallucinations.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We tried a few approaches. Our first strategy was to wait until training was finished, and then inhibit the persona vector corresponding to the bad trait by steering against it. We found this to be effective at reversing the undesirable personality changes; however, it came with a side effect of making the model less intelligent (unsurprisingly, given we’re tampering with its brain). This echoes our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/evaluating-feature-steering">previous results on steering</a>, which found similar side effects.</p><p>Then we tried using persona vectors to intervene during training to <em>prevent</em> the model from acquiring the bad trait in the first place. Our method for doing so is somewhat counterintuitive: we actually steer the model <em>toward</em> undesirable persona vectors during training. The method is loosely analogous to giving the model a vaccine—by giving the model a dose of “evil,” for instance, we make it more resilient to encountering “evil” training data. This works because the model no longer needs to adjust its personality in harmful ways to fit the training data—we are <em>supplying</em> it with these adjustments ourselves, relieving it of the pressure to do so.</p><p>We found that this preventative steering method is effective at maintaining good behavior when models are trained on data that would otherwise cause them to acquire negative traits. What’s more, in our experiments, preventative steering caused little-to-no degradation in model capabilities, as measured by MMLU score (a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300">common benchmark</a>).</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4000" height="2150" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fc8323705299d4ebc44cf9fbd84267e80352e6b50-4000x2150.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fc8323705299d4ebc44cf9fbd84267e80352e6b50-4000x2150.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption><em>(a) Inference-time steering: After finetuning, steering against persona vectors (subtracting them during generation) reduces trait expression, but can degrade general capabilities (gray line shows MMLU performance).

Flagging problematic training data</h3><p>We can also use persona vectors to predict how training will change a model's personality <em>before we even start training</em>. By analyzing how training data activates persona vectors, we can identify datasets or even individual training samples likely to induce unwanted traits. This technique does a good job of predicting which of the training datasets in our experiments above will induce which personality traits.</p><p>We also tested this data flagging technique on real-world data like LMSYS-Chat-1M (a large-scale dataset of real-world conversations with LLMs). Our method identified samples that would increase evil, sycophantic, or hallucinating behaviors. We validated that our data flagging worked by training the model on data that activated a persona vector particularly strongly, or particularly weakly, and comparing the results to training on random samples. We found that the data that activated e.g. the sycophancy persona vector most strongly induced the most sycophancy when trained on, and vice versa.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F54fffe60afbe5ab5a5b876b8d284bf8dc44094d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F54fffe60afbe5ab5a5b876b8d284bf8dc44094d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>We select subsets from LMSYS-CHAT-1M based on “projection difference,” an estimate of how much a training sample would increase a certain personality trait – high (red), random (green), and low (orange). Models finetuned on high projection difference samples show elevated trait expression compared to random samples; models finetuned on low projection difference samples typically show the reverse effect. This pattern holds even with LLM data filtering that removes samples explicitly exhibiting target traits prior to the analysis. Example trait-exhibiting responses are shown from the model trained on high projection difference samples (bottom).</figcaption></figure></div><p>Interestingly, our method was able to catch some dataset examples that weren’t obviously problematic to the human eye, and that an LLM judge wasn’t able to flag. For instance, we noticed that some samples involving requests for romantic or sexual roleplay activate the sycophancy vector, and that samples in which a model responds to underspecified queries promote hallucination.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Large language models like Claude are designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest, but their personalities can go haywire in unexpected ways. Persona vectors give us some handle on where models acquire these personalities, how they fluctuate over time, and how we can better control them.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509">Read the full paper</a> for more on our methodology and findings.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>This research was led by participants in our <a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2024/anthropic-fellows-program/">Anthropic Fellows</a> program.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

The share price was at historic lows, but I had been paying attention to what kind of business Palantir was doing and with whom. It was clear that it was quietly positioning itself to be a leader in data analysis for military and intelligence agencies, including through the use of AI. And that is obviously a very lucrative niche that, unfortunately, will grow over time - especially for those promoted by the US government.</p><p>The reason I didn’t invest was because one has to draw the line somewhere on the kinds of companies you’re willing to profit from, and I see Palantir as ultimately taking the title of the world’s most evil company. </p><p>Since my decision not to invest in the company, the Palantir share price has risen by about 500%, helped by the recent election of Donald Trump whose campaign received a large donation from Palantir chairman Peter Thiel. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png" width="1029" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:1029,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:64880,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ucFP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9490d974-7ff6-4ad2-8b1d-a3429c5ab3ff_1029x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>As an example of the evil nature of Palantir’s work, it appears that Palantir has been working with the Israeli military in so-called ‘targeted killings’. Reports have suggested such that these murders, probably in the thousands or tens of thousands, utilised social media information and cellphone tracking. According to a range of sources, over 150 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Gaza and in numerous cases they appear to have been directly targeted. Using social media information to murder journalists using drone strikes is already dystopic, but this is likely to just be the beginning of the evil Palantir will facilitate.</p><p>You can watch Thiel stumbling awkwardly in response to a question about Palantir’s AI programme called Lavender [the pros always choose a harmless sounding name for something evil] for killings in Palestine:</p><div id="youtube2-q1asavnl_o8" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;q1asavnl_o8&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q1asavnl_o8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>But the dystopian danger posed by Palantir is not at all specific to Trump. The CEO of Palantir, Alexander Karp, donated to Kamala Harris’s campaign before the recent US election. </p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://politicaleconomist.substack.com/p/palantir-the-worlds-most-evil-company?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://politicaleconomist.substack.com/p/palantir-the-worlds-most-evil-company?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>You can watch him in a recent shareholder briefing saying that we have ‘dedicated our company to the service of the West and the United States of America…especially in places we can’t talk about’ and ‘Palantir is here to help institutions we partner with be the best in the world…and when necessary to scare enemies and on occasion kill them…We hope you’re in favour of that…[and] are enjoying being a partner…we’re really happy and enjoying what we’re doing’:</p><p><span>Prior to its role in murders and massacres in Palestine, the most recent issue that drew attention to how dangerous the company is, is that it was </span><a href="https://goodlawproject.org/update/nhs-signed-palantir-contract-then-carried-on-negotiating/" rel="">given a contract to manage the data of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service</a><span>. In theory, Palantir is supposed to operate the system in such a way that it never actually stores the data on its own servers and does not access it for any other purpose. But this is a company that may have been using social media information to help the Israeli military target drone strikes at Palestinian journalists: why would a company willing to enable war crimes care about legal niceties about data use in another country? Concerns have been raised by a wide range of voices in the United Kingdom, </span><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1712" rel="">including academics and medical professionals</a><span>, but there is sufficient continuity between the conservative government and the fake left-wing Labour government of Keir Starmer that they appear determined to push through with the plan.</span></p><p>Given this kind of data and what Palantir’s focus and loyalties are, it seems very likely it will find ways to use biometric, health and DNA data to kill both individuals and groups using autonomous drones. I expect that will become possible in the next 5 years, if it has not already been developed covertly. </p><p>For those who have seen the famously dystopian movie Minority Report, Palantir is the company that is most likely to make this kind of scene a reality in the near future:</p><div id="youtube2-OgVeWme-9N4" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;OgVeWme-9N4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OgVeWme-9N4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>I have no optimistic take on this: the kinds of people in the United States in charge of such developments are quite evidently psychopathic (just watch excerpts of Karp’s recent statements above and past statements by the likes of Thiel) and at this stage there is nothing to restrain this psychopathy, which is crudely and unconvincingly dressed up as a passion for freedom and democracy. Other countries will inevitably have to follow suit if the USA is going down this road and it has become clear that China will not struggle to do so technologically. But with its imperialist tendencies, vast control over the internet and social media, big tech companies, sprawling military and intelligence operations across the globe, the USA is looking the most likely to envelope the world in a horrific future.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
