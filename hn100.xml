All of the RTX 50-series cards are PCIe Gen 5 and include DisplayPort 2.1b connectors to drive displays up to 8K and 165Hz. </p><p>Surprisingly, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5090%2F">RTX 5090 Founders Edition</a> will be a two-slot GPU and will be capable of fitting inside small form factor PCs — a big departure from the size of the RTX 4090. The RTX 5090 has 32GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 1,792GB/sec, and a massive 21,760 CUDA cores. </p><p>This all adds up to a GPU that Nvidia says will be two times faster than the RTX 4090, thanks to DLSS 4 and the Blackwell architecture. But it will come at a cost of power consumption, as Nvidia says the RTX 5090 will have a total graphics power of 575 watts and a recommended PSU requirement of 1000 watts. That’s 125 watts more than the RTX 4090, but hopefully the RTX 5090 will be a lot more power efficient so that you’ll rarely be using the full 575 watts.</p><p>Nvidia demonstrated <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on an RTX 5090 with DLSS 4 at 238fps compared to 106fps on an RTX 4090 with DLSS 3.5. Both GPUs are running the game with full ray tracing enabled.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5080%2F">The RTX 5080</a> is designed to be twice as fast as the RTX 4080 and will include 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 960GB/sec, and 10,752 CUDA cores. The RTX 5080 will have a total graphics power of 360 watts and Nvidia is recommending a 850-watt power supply. Nvidia is promising big performance gains with the RTX 5080 over the previous RTX 4080 model as a result of these specs.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom"

Huang even claimed on stage at CES that the RTX 5070 will deliver “RTX 4090 performance at $549,” but this will undoubtedly be because of DLSS 4 improvements and not pure rasterization performance.</p><p>Nvidia is also bringing its RTX 50-series to laptops, with the RTX 5090 laptop GPU debuting with 24GB of GDDR7 memory. The RTX 5080 laptop GPU will ship with 16GB of GDDR7 memory, the RTX 5070 Ti with 12GB of GDDR7 memory, and the RTX 5070 with just 8GB of GDDR7 memory. RTX 50-series laptops will be available starting in March from a variety of PC makers.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="RTX 50-series laptops are coming in March." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/376x197/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/384x202/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/415x218/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/480x252/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/540x284/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/640x336/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/750x394/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/828x435/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1080x567/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1200x630/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1440x756/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1920x1008/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/2048x1075/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/2400x1260/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/2400x1260/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>RTX 50-series laptops are coming in March.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div></div><p>Huang demonstrated Nvidia’s RTX Blackwell GPUs with a real-time rendering demo at the beginning of the company’s CES keynote today.

<p>So, we are coming up on a little anniversary for me this weekend. On the 5th of January 2000, Steve Jobs unveiled the new Aqua user interface of Mac OS X to the world at Macworld Expo.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the presentation, he showed off the Dock. You all know the Dock, it’s been at the bottom of your Mac screen for what feels like forever (if you keep it in the correct location, anyway).</p>

<p>The version he showed was quite different to what actually ended up shipping, with square boxes around the icons, and an actual “Dock” folder in your user’s home folder that contained aliases to the items stored.</p>



<p>I should know – I had spent the previous 18 months or so as the main engineer working away on it. At that very moment, I was watching from a cubicle in Apple Cork, in Ireland. For the second time in my short Apple career, I said a quiet prayer to the gods of demos, hoping that things didn’t break. For context, I was in my twenties at this point and scared witless.</p>



<p>I didn’t design the dock – that was Bas Ording, a talented young UI designer that Steve had personally recruited. But it was my job to take his prototypes built in Macromind Director and turn them into working code, as part of the Finder team.</p>



<p>I had already written another dock – <a href="https://dragthing.com/">DragThing</a> – before I worked for Apple, and that had helped me get a job there. I moved over from Scotland to Ireland in late 1996 with my future wife, with both of us joining the small software team there. It was primarily a manufacturing plant, but there was a little bit of software and hardware testing and engineering that went on around the edges.</p>



<p>I worked on a number of things in the early days. I was on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system)">Copland</a> installer for two weeks before the project was cancelled. Then, a couple of <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/26825-apple-magic-collection-3">Disney Print Studio CDs</a> that shipped with the Performas. I loved doing UI stuff, but somehow ended up working on a command line Mac OS X Server authentication component for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Ease">At Ease</a> that was to be used with a new line of diskless netboot computers that nobody had actually seen. It turned out I’d actually been on the iMac project all this time, and in the end they got hard drives.</p>



<p>In the middle of all that, when I was out in Cupertino, I was asked if I wanted to work on a secret project with the code name “Überbar”. I was shown some prototypes and basically told that six people had seen it, and if it leaked they would know it was me that had talked. I figured if anybody was finally going to kill off DragThing, it might as well be me.</p>



<p>The new Finder (codename “Millennium”) was at this point being written on Mac OS 9, because Mac OS X wasn’t exactly firing on all cylinders quite yet. The filesystem wasn’t working well, which is not super helpful when you are trying to write a user interface on top of it. The Dock was part of the Finder then, and could lean on all the high level C++ interfaces for dealing with disks and files that the rest of the team was working on. So, I started on Mac OS 9, working away in Metrowerks Codewarrior. The Finder was a Carbon app, so we could actually make quite a bit of early progress on 9, before the OS was ready for us. I vividly remember the first time we got the code running on Mac OS X.</p>



<p>Because the Dock was a huge secret, along with the rest of the Aqua user interface, it was only enabled on a handful of machines. I didn’t see the shiny lickable buttons of Aqua itself for quite a while after I’d been working on the Dock . There were rumours that any screenshot of Aqua would have the hardware MAC address of the machine encoded into the image, so leaks could be tracked down.</p>



<p>Before I had ever seen the new UI, there was one moment where I had somehow – I genuinely don’t remember why on earth this happened – had been tasked with designing a placeholder boot screen for the OS itself. I made a blue shiny Apple with pinstripes, in the style of the iMac.</p>

<p>It lasted precisely one build before being yanked out extremely quickly. I assume because <em>somebody</em> was unhappy with the entirely coincidental Aqua-like appearance.</p>



<p>But I trundled away, making the best dock that I could while staying true to the original design, and making <a href="https://512pixels.net/2017/06/a-trip-to-infinite-loop-two-decades-later/">frequent trips to the US</a>, initially living out of the Cupertino Inn across the road from Infinite Loop.</p>



<p>You may have heard me tell this story before, and I apologise if so. But it’s been long enough that people just know me for PCalc, and don’t even remember DragThing, let alone events that happened before some of you were even born.</p>



<p>At one point during a trip over, Steve was talking to Bas and asked how things were coming along with the Dock. He replied something along the lines of “going well, the engineer is over from Ireland right now, etc”. Steve left, and then visited my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Serlet">manager’s manager’s manager</a> and said the fateful words (as reported to me by people who were in the room where it happened).</p>



<p>“It has come to my attention that the engineer working on the Dock is in FUCKING IRELAND”.</p>



<p>I was told that I had to move to Cupertino. Immediately. Or else.</p>



<p>I did not wish to move to the States. I liked being in Europe. Ultimately, after much consideration, many late night conversations with my wife, and even buying a guide to moving, I said no.</p>



<p>They said ok then. We’ll just tell Steve you did move.</p>



<p>And so for the next year, I flew back and forth between Cork to Cupertino, and stayed out there as much as regulations would allow. I had an office on the Finder team corridor. I can only imagine that Steve would walk by looking for me, and they would say he’d just missed me, while I was being bundled onto a plane at the other end. I had to come over whenever there were Dock demos, but I was not allowed to be left in the same room as Steve, lest I reveal the truth. The demo room with the blanked out windows had two doors, and I went out one before he came in the other.</p>



<p>In the end, Macworld 2000 happened, and finally all the secrets were revealed to the world. I hoped that at this point, it didn’t matter where I was, and I could finally relax. Less than a month later, exactly on my birthday I believe, I got another call.</p>



<p>I had to move to Cupertino. Or else. And this time, the “else” was that I would be taken off the Dock and the Finder, and I couldn’t be guaranteed any interesting work ever again.</p>



<p>So I politely declined, and resigned. About three weeks later, the rest of the remaining software group in Cork was fired. Clearly, the plan had been to get rid of everybody, but they couldn’t tell me that at the time. I should have waited and I’d have got a payoff at least…</p>



<p>My version of the Dock shipped once to developers, with the Developer Preview 3 of Mac OS X. John Siracusa <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2000/02/mac-os-x-dp3/">absolutely hated it</a></em>. We remain friends.</p>



<p>After that, the engineer who took over from me rewrote the Dock entirely, and none of my code actually shipped to the public in the end. Eighteen months of hard work out the window, ah well.</p>



<p>But I learned a great deal, made a lot of friends, and the experience spurred me on to resurrect DragThing for Mac OS X, which proved very popular for quite some time. <a href="https://pcalc.com/">PCalc</a> also came back to life around then, and that’s still going today!</p>



<p>As a final note, when I left Apple for the last time, and emptied out my drawers, at the very bottom of the last drawer I found my <em>distinctly unsigned NDA</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">We want to make it as easy as possible to self host! In the <code>docker-images</code> folder of the project you will find many variations of the backend you can host, so you can host just what you want, without the bloat of the things you don't want. This is a work in progress, and we're constantly working on adding more. You can read more about self hosting in the <a href="https://docs.formbee.dev/docs/category/self-hosting" rel="nofollow">Official Formbee self-hosting docs</a>. The docs will walk you through pulling the docker images, and running them with the correct environmental variables, then you can host them wherever you like to host your containers!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

  
  
    <address>Carson Gross, Alex Petros</address>
    <p><time>January 01, 2025</time></p><h2 id="in-the-beginning"><a href="#in-the-beginning" aria-label="Anchor link for: in-the-beginning">In The Beginning…</a></h2>
<p>htmx began life as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a>, a library built around jQuery that added behavior based
on HTML attributes.</p>
<p>For developers who are not familiar with it, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a venerable JavaScript
library that made writing cross-platform JavaScript a lot easier during a time when browser implementations were very
inconsistent, and JavaScript didn’t have many of the convenient APIs and features that it does now.</p>
<p>Today many web developers consider jQuery to be “legacy software.” With all due respect to this perspective, jQuery is
currently used on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library">75% of all public websites</a>, a number that dwarfs all other JavaScript tools.</p>
<p>Why has jQuery remained so ubiquitous?</p>
<p>Here are three technical reasons we believe contribute to its ongoing success:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very easy to add to a project (just a single, dependency-free link)</li>
<li>It has maintained a very consistent API, remaining largely backwards compatible over its life (intercooler.js works
with jQuery v1, v2 and v3)</li>
<li>As a library, you can use as much or as little of it as you like: it stays out of the way otherwise and doesn’t
dictate the structure of your application</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="htmx-is-the-new-jquery"><a href="#htmx-is-the-new-jquery" aria-label="Anchor link for: htmx-is-the-new-jquery">htmx is the New jQuery</a></h2>
<p>Now, that’s a ridiculous (and arrogant) statement to make, of course, but it is an <em>ideal</em> that we on the htmx team are
striving for.</p>
<p>In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value
addition to the toolkits of web developers. Alex has
discussed <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lASLZ9TgXyc">“Building The 100 Year Web Service”</a> and we want htmx to be a
useful tool for exactly that use case.</p>
<p>Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time, and websites built with htmx should be capable of
the same (or better).</p>
<p>Going forward, htmx will be developed with its <em>existing</em> users in mind.</p>
<p>If you are an existing user of htmx—or are thinking about becoming one—here’s what that means.</p>
<h3 id="stability-as-a-feature"><a href="#stability-as-a-feature" aria-label="Anchor link for: stability-as-a-feature">Stability as a Feature</a></h3>
<p>We are going to work to ensure that htmx is extremely stable in both API &amp; implementation. This means accepting and
documenting the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/quirks/">quirks</a> of the current implementation.</p>
<p>Someone upgrading htmx (even from 1.x to 2.x) should expect things to continue working as before.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, we may add better configuration options, but we won’t change defaults.</p>
<h3 id="no-new-features-as-a-feature"><a href="#no-new-features-as-a-feature" aria-label="Anchor link for: no-new-features-as-a-feature">No New Features as a Feature</a></h3>
<p>We are going to be increasingly inclined to not accept new proposed features in the library core.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t feel pressure to upgrade htmx over time unless there are specific bugs that they want fixed, and they
should feel comfortable that the htmx that they write in 2025 will look very similar to htmx they write in 2035 and
beyond.</p>
<p>We will consider new core features when new browser features become available, for example we
are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/examples/move-before/">already using</a> the experimental <code>moveBefore()</code> API on supported browsers.</p>
<p>However, we expect most new functionality to be explored and delivered via the
htmx <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/extensions/">extensions API</a>, and will work to make the extensions API more capable where
appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="quarterly-releases"><a href="#quarterly-releases" aria-label="Anchor link for: quarterly-releases">Quarterly Releases</a></h3>
<p>Our release schedule is going to be roughly quarterly going forward.</p>
<p>There will be no death march upgrades associated with htmx, and there is no reason to monitor htmx releases for major
functionality changes, just like with jQuery. If htmx 1.x is working fine for you, there is no reason to feel like you
need to move to 2.x.</p>

<p>htmx does not aim to be a total solution for building web applications and services:
it <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3648188.3675127">generalizes hypermedia controls</a>, and that’s roughly about it.</p>
<p>This means that a very important way to improve htmx — and one with lots of work remaining — is by helping improve the tools
and techniques that people use <em>in conjunction</em> with htmx.</p>
<p>Doing so makes htmx dramatically more useful <em>without</em> any changes to htmx itself.</p>

<p>While htmx gives you a few new tools in your HTML, it has no opinions about other important aspects of building your
websites. A flagship feature of htmx is that it does not dictate what backend or database you use.</p>
<p>htmx is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-on-whatever-youd-like/">compatible with lots of backends</a>, and we want to
help make hypermedia-driven development work better for all of them.</p>
<p>One part of the hypermedia ecosystem that htmx has already helped improve is template engines. When
we <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/">first wrote</a> about how “template fragments” make defining partial page
replacements much simpler, they were a relatively rare feature in template engines.</p>
<p>Not only are fragments much more common now, that essay
is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/issues/260">frequently</a> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsfreixes/jinja2-fragments">cited</a>
as an inspiration for building the feature.</p>
<p>There are many other ways that the experience of writing hypermedia-based applications can be improved, and we will
remain dedicated to identifying and promoting those efforts.</p>
<h3 id="writing-research-and-standardization"><a href="#writing-research-and-standardization" aria-label="Anchor link for: writing-research-and-standardization">Writing, Research, and Standardization</a></h3>
<p>Although htmx will not be changing dramatically going forward, we will continue energetically evangelizing the ideas of
hypermedia.</p>
<p>In particular, we are trying to push <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3648188.3675127">the ideas</a> of htmx into the
HTML standard itself, via the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/">Triptych project</a>. In an ideal world, htmx
functionality disappears into the web platform itself.</p>
<p>htmx code written <em>today</em> will continue working forever, of course, but in the very long run perhaps there will be no
need to include the library to achieve <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/examples">similar UI patterns</a> via hypermedia.</p>
<h2 id="intercooler-was-right"><a href="#intercooler-was-right" aria-label="Anchor link for: intercooler-was-right">Intercooler Was Right</a></h2>
<p>At the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://intercoolerjs.org/docs#philosophy">end of the intercooler docs</a>, we said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many javascript projects are updated at a dizzying pace. Intercooler is not.</p>
<p>This is not because it is dead, but rather because it is (mostly) right: the basic idea is right, and the implementation
at least right enough.</p>
<p>This means there will not be constant activity and churn on the project, but rather
a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship_(theology)">stewardship</a> relationship: the main goal now is to not screw
it up. The documentation will be improved, tests will be added, small new declarative features will be added around the
edges, but there will be no massive rewrite or constant updating. This is in contrast with the software industry in
general and the front end world in particular, which has comical levels of churn.</p>
<p>Intercooler is a sturdy, reliable tool for web development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGyAWH5btwY">the snark at the end of the third paragraph</a>, this thinking
is very much applicable to htmx. In fact, perhaps even more so since htmx is a standalone piece of software, benefiting
from the experiences (and mistakes) of intercooler.js.</p>
<p>We hope to see htmx, in its own small way, join the likes of giants like jQuery as a sturdy and reliable tool for
building your 100 year web services.</p>

            </i>
        </p>
    

    <p>OK, this is going to sound crazy: I believe all clocks are 30 seconds late.</p>
<p>Let's get a few things out of the way: this is neither about time zones, nor leap seconds.
It's not about synchronization of clocks, and it's not about relativity or any obscure corner of physics.
I'm talking about everyday clocks. The ones that you might have around in your house, like this one that sits on my desk:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/victorpoughon/post2image1-2.webp" alt="post2image1"></p>
<p>Or this one that stands in London:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/victorpoughon/572px-big_ben_elizabeth_tower_london_2023_01_detail.webp" alt="572px-Big_Ben_Elizabeth_Tower_London_2023_01_Detail"></p>
<p><em>(Photo from Wikipedia)</em></p>
<p>Or even the clock on your phone! Maybe they're all correctly set very precisely to a very accurate reference clock, but here I will argue that they are still exactly 30 seconds late. In other words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be more accurate if they were thirty seconds ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-are-you-on-about">What are you on about?</h2><p>All the above clocks have one thing in common: they don't show seconds. They truncate down to the nearest lower whole minute, right? So when it's actually <code>14:15:45</code>, they'll show <code>14:15</code>.
And when the actual time goes from <code>14:15:59</code> to <code>14:16:00</code>, then that's when your clock changes from <code>14:15</code> to <code>14:16</code>.</p>
<p>They apply the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor function</a>!</p>
<p>Ok great. Now hear me out! Let's compute the average error between a usual (truncating) clock, and the precise current time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes the error is 1 or 2 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it's actually <code>14:02:01</code></li>
<li>Sometimes the error is almost 60 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it's actually <code>14:02:57</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the average error of a truncating clock is 30 seconds. Let that sink in for a moment: <strong>the average error of a clock is 30 seconds</strong>. If clocks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">rounded</a>
to the nearest minute instead of truncating, the average error would be 0. Therefore all clocks are 30 seconds late!</p>
<p>Similarly of course, all clocks that show seconds but not milliseconds are half a second late.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-just-a-convention">This is just a convention</h2><blockquote>
<p>But this is just a convention! Truncating, rounding or even ceiling are all valid, as long as we pick one and stick to it. By your logic we should say that it's Tuesday as soon as it's one second past noon on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well... kind of.</p>
<p>It would be weird if we rounded for years, months and days, that's for sure. I think most people think of those scales as intervals. In other words, July is a period of time, with a start and an end. So are years, centuries, seasons. We are inside of it or outside.</p>
<p>Is it the same for the current minute of the current hour ? I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Basically I'm arguing that rounding for clocks would be more useful than flooring.
This is especially apparent when you're trying to calculate "how much time until my next meeting?", and your next meeting is at noon. If it's 11:55, you would usually mentally subtract and conclude: the meeting is in 5 minutes. That's how I always do it myself anyway! But the most probable estimate given the available information is actually 4'30"!</p>
<p>If you had a rounding clock instead, 5 minutes would be the correct estimation.</p>
<p>In fact, as we go down the various scales of time all the way from years, months, days and we reach hours, that's when we start truncating! At hours! For example: if it's <code>10:43</code> and you are asked the time and (for some context appropriate reason) you reply with just hours, you would say it's 11! Personally, I would never say that it's 10 if the clock shows anything past <code>10:30</code>. I realize that's probably very different in other cultures, though! And I'd be interested to learn about how different cultures approximate time in language.</p>
<p>So, looking at the various scales of time and how I mentally view them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Years</strong>: truncate. If the full date has <code>2019</code> in it, I'll say "the year is 2019" - all the way to the end. Saying "it's 2020" in September 2019 is super weird.</li>
<li><strong>Months</strong>: truncate. It's January all the way until it's February.</li>
<li><strong>Days</strong>: truncate. It gets a little weird if it's past midnight and I haven't slept yet. Is tomorrow today? Or is it the day after that? I think collectively we still haven't quite figured that one out yet. And that's ok. Kind of like how "next Friday" becomes ambiguous on Thursdays. Some cultures use times beyond 24:00, like 25:30 to indicate one hour and a half past midnight, and I think that's lovely!</li>
<li><strong>Hours</strong>: That's when mentally, I switch to rounding! At <code>15:48</code> I definitely feel like it's pretty much <code>16:00</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Minutes</strong>: At <code>15:48:57</code>, I definitely feel like it's <code>15:49</code>! But clocks switch back to flooring for for some reason! But mentally we round! This is why I feel like all clocks are 30 seconds late: because the truncating convention doesn't match my intuition at the minute scale.</li>
<li><strong>Seconds and below</strong>: definitely rounding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please someone tell me I'm not crazy 🙃</p>

    <p>
      December 31th, 2024
    </p>
    <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Earlier this year I decided to put my main project Tangerine on hold
      indefinitely and began prototyping
      <a href="https://github.com/aeva/star-machine">a new renderer</a>
      in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">unfamiliar language</a>
      using a <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9312">totally new graphics API</a>
      with the goal of overcoming all of Tangerine's technical shortcomings.
      The new renderer is an eccentric CPU ray tracer called Star Machine that
      boasts the ability to <em>effortlessly</em> push 4k frames at 120hz or
      better <em>irrespective of scene complexity</em>, a custom coordinate
      system that limits the play space to roughly <em>940.7 astronomical
      units</em> with a constant world resolution of 15 micrometers, and a
      <em>truly unique</em> visual style.  To prove out the underlying theories and
      help me prioritize what to work on, I am also developing a time trial
      racing game called
      <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@aeva/113104448301517076">Rainy Road</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time of writing, Rainy Road lacks a way to render terrain.  These
      are my requirements for its terrain rendering system:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Some terrain features (roads specifically) must be defined as splines.
      </li>
      <li>
        Terrain features must be composable, allowing for map sections to be
        rapidly swapped out at runtime.

    <p>
      A quick survey of existing terrain editing tools revealed that virtually
      all general purpose terrain editors violate at least one of these
      constraints, and unsurprisingly I did not find any terrain tools
      available targeting my particular niche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next most obvious course of action is to use low resolution
      heightmaps with a good noise function to give it the illusion of being
      continous.  I've seen games (which are now 20+ years old now) use this
      technique to great effect, so I consider this to be pretty low risk.
      Additionally, I figure I can use Blender to rapidly iterate on variations
      of this technique, and once I am satisfied it can function as the level
      editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experimentation in Blender (and lots of great feedback from internet
      people experienced on the subject) quickly revealed that reasoning about
      landscapes and roads in isolation from one another "adds skill" a bit
      more than I would like, and so I see this as a good opportunity to
      develop structured workflows and supporting tools to take me to the
      places I want to go.
    </p>
    <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
    <p>
      This particular conceptual brick in the washing machine has led me to
      deeply internalizing what I now know to be a fundamental law of design
      and composition that applies <em>universally</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography">
        <strong><em>Everything Affects Everything</em></strong>
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the real world roads are built along whatever happens to be the most
      circumstantially optimal route through the world they are to exist
      within.  The landscape (among other things) affects the decision of
      where to put a road, and in turn the road changes the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we know where some things <em>must</em> be, then we can infer what
      surrounds those thing.  We can eschew the input height map entirely, and
      instead generate the terrain from only points and splines, possibly in
      real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out there's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis">a whole field of math about this stuff</a>
      already that I didn't even know existed until after developing the
      spline distance fields technique and posting about it on Mastodon, and
      at this time of writing, I have not yet explored it in any significant
      depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to my journal, on September 20th of 2024 I realized I could
      generate plausible terrain surfaces entirely from splines that describe
      the important terrain features (rivers, roads, rails, cliffs, etc).  In
      its simplest form each point in space has a corresponding closent point
      on the closest spline.  That closest-point-on-closest-spline (along with
      its corresponding binormal vector) defines a plane that determines the
      local elevation relative to your original arbitrary point in space.  This
      effectively is a method of extruding splines within a constraining
      volume of space that suspiciously resembles a voronoi diagram (because it
      secretly is one, but don't worry about that).
    </p>
    <p>
      Things get a bit dicey for sampling points that are close to the boundary
      of a spline field, but as I wrote in my journal, these inbetween spaces
      should simply be "interpolated somehow".  I call this the "liminality
      problem".  This can appear similar to subduction and obduction in real
      life, and so this quality may be reasonably considered a useful feature
      if it can be handled intentionally.  However, in most cases you will want
      your spline zones to flow together seamlessly, and so this article only
      describes a method that sweeps the problem under the rug.

      Now, for everyone who wasn't born with perfect knowledge of everything,
      the next section of this post walks through how the <em>normal</em>,
      <em>tangent</em>, and <em>binormal</em> vectors work for splines in
      Blender; and the section after that steps through a real working
      implementation of this technique.  Example source files are also
      provided for you to use in any way you like.
    </p>

    <h2 id="relevant_spline_math">Relevant Spline Math</h2>
    <p>
      Blender's Geometry Nodes system provides a variety of useful high level
      functions for working with Blender's curve and point cloud primitives, so
      we're going to use those where possible.  This leaves a few bits of math
      to review  that are important to our implementation.  If you already know
      how to calculate a binormal vector, breeze on over to
      <a href="#generating_the_heightmap">the next section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing we need is the ability to define a plane for any given
      point on a spline.  For our purposes we'll use a point in space and the
      direction that is perpendicular to the plane (aka "the surface normal" of
      the plane).  In terms of spline parameters, these vectors are called the
      <em>position</em> and the <em>binormal</em>.  Blender does not provide
      the spline's <em>binormal</em>, but it is very easy to calculate it from
      the spline's <em>normal</em> and <em>tangent</em> vectors which Blender
      does provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>I cannot stress this enough</em></strong> the thing we want
      here is the thing you're probably used to calling "the surface normal",
      <strong>but</strong>—for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet%E2%80%93Serret_formulas#Definitions">reasons</a>
      I am <em>not</em> responsible for—the thing we want is instead called the
      "<strong>binormal</strong>" here and the thing that is called the "normal"
      is instead a different thing.  Why did the mathematicians do this to us?!
    </p>
    <p>
      Blender's splines always define a <em>tangent</em> and <em>normal</em>
      vector for all control points and all interpolated points.  These are
      "unit vectors", which means they always have a length of one, and they
      encode a direction.  The <em>binormal</em> is the cross product of these
      two vectors, which I'll illustrate in a little bit.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the_tangent_vector">The Tangent Vector</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>tangent</em> vector is a unit vector that grazes the point on the
      curve.  This vector rests on the surface of the plane we want to
      describe.  This is what it looks like:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/tangents.png">
    </p>
    <h3 id="the_normal_vector">The Normal Vector</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>normal</em> vector perpendicular to the <em>tangent</em> vector,
      and also rests on the surface of the plane we want to describe.  This is
      what it looks like:

      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/normals.png">
    </p>
    <h3 id="calculating_the_binormal">Calculating the Binormal</h3>
    <p>
      To calculate the <em>binormal</em>, take the cross product of the
      <em>normal</em> and <em>tangent</em>, like so:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/binormals.png">
    </p>

    <h2 id="generating_the_heightmap">Generating the Heightmap</h2>
    <p>
      With the spline's <em>binormal</em> in hand, now it is time to generate
      the height map.  Here's the eagle eye view:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/the_big_picture.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      I find it works best to keep the splines in their own collection.  This
      way the geometry node graph can read alll of the splines from it in one
      go, and you don't need to change any code to add more splines to your
      terrain.  Only one geometry nodes modifier is required to implement this
      technique, and that placed on an empty mesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's examine the <strike>spaghetti</strike> program:
    </p>

    <h3 id="curves_to_surfels">Curves to Surfels</h3>
    <p>
      You may have already noticed this, but the curves are just a useful
      editing interface that is immediately discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we're actually doing is using the curves to generate a set of
      primitives called surfels, and then using the surfels to extrapolate the
      surface of the terrain.  In this particular case, a surfel is defined as
      being a point in space with an associated <strike>normal</strike>
      <em>binormal</em> vector.  Maybe I should have named this technique
      "<em>surfel distance fields</em>".
    </p>
    <p>
      Since our heightmap starts as a flat subdivided plane, we'll get the best
      results if we project the surfels onto the XY plane before sampling them
      so that Blender's sampling functions behave the way we expect them to.
      We still need the original position, so we just capture that attribute to
      snapshot it before flattening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/overview_part_1.png">
    </p>

    <h3 id="surfel_sampling">Surfel Sampling</h3>
    <p>
      Next we create the geometry that will be deformed into our terrain.  For
      this we use the <em>Grid</em> node.  <strong>The density of the grid
      affects interpolation behavior</strong>.  The mesh generation method
      described in this page takes the "sweep the error under the rug"
      strategy.  <em>If your vertex density is too high, you will get abrupt
      changes in elevation between locations that belong to different
      curves.</em>  Likewise, if your vertex density is too low, your landscape
      will be soft and featureless.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sample the nearest surfel parameters, use the <em>Sample Nearest</em>
      node to find the index of the nearest surfel to a given vertex on the
      grid.  Then use the <em>Sample Index</em> node to translate that index
      into the parameters we want.  If you're not familiar with geometry
      nodes's
      <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/fields.html">fields</a>
      concept, the following graph section will look confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Capture Attribute</em> at the end of this part of the program is
      not strictly necessary, but I've added it in hopes of making the data
      flow a little clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/overview_part_2.png">
    </p>

    <h3 id="generate_the_heightmap">Generate the Heightmap</h3>
    <p>
      I've mentioned a plane function many times now, and here it finally is!
      The graph section below starts by finding the distance of each point on
      the undeformed heightmap to the closest surfel.  The function for this is
      the <em>signed distance</em> from an arbitrary point in space to the
      nearest point on a plane.  The term "<em>signed distance</em>" means the
      distance can be a negative value, which usually indicates that the
      evaluated point was under the surface of the plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, that would imply that a negation would be needed in my code
      below, <em>which is curiously absent</em>.  The reason for this is I
      screwed up the math somewhere here in such a way that inverts the
      polarity of the result.  This elides the need for the negation.  The
      result appears to be correct though.  Please pretend that I am smart and
      meant to do this.  Someone smart once told me that every shipped game
      contains an even number of sign errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving on, once you have the planar distance in hand, I find that bluring
      it a few iterations helps to smooth out any liminality problems, much
      like adjusting the vertex density.  This is not an exact science, but
      generally if you adjust the number of blur iterations or the number of
      verticies, you also have to adjust the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we use the blurred distance field value as an position offset
      along the Z axis, and that gets us the deformed terrain mesh.

      I put one of my early prototypes into the hands of my dear friend
      <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bmprager.bsky.social">Bitmap</a> and 30
      minutes later she sent me this message:

      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/unlimited_power_a.png">

    <p>
      And the next day she sent me this:

    <p>
      <img src="https://zone.dog/braindump/spline_fields/unlimited_power_b.png"><br>
      <small><em>

        shader to show changes in elevation.
      </em></small>
    </p>
    <p>
      This caused quite a stir for the game production she's part of, as they
      ended up completely throwing out the Godot terrain tool they were using
      in favor of switching to a new workflow built around the prototype I gave
      her.  I'm equal parts honored and deeply terrified by this development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitmap <strike>fucking <em>hates</em></strike> tends to bounce off of
      conventional digital sculpting tools like z-brush and Blender's sculpt
      mode.  Her artistic background is primarily as a 2D illustrator, and
      she's found that the way she reasons about form and space is generally
      incompatible with those kinds of tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very eager to see what things she will create now that she can simply
      <em>draw the terrain</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked Bitmap and The Director if there were any recent(ish) screenshots
      that would also be ok for me to share in this blog post, and they
      provided me with a treasure trove of gorgeous preproduction progress
      photographs which I've included all of below except for the one The Director

      You may be wondering where all of that nice multitexturing in these
      screenshots fits into this technique.  Bitmap provides a set of flat
      subdivided quads with UVs already prepared, and the tool I provided
      deforms them.  Weight painting is used to control how the textures are
      combined.

    <h2 id="sculptor">Sculptor: Non-Destructive 3D Modeling in Godot</h2>
    <p>
      My colleague <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@dbat">Dbat</a> has
      been hard at working building a procedural modeling tool in Godot called
      <a href="https://codeberg.org/dbat/godot-sculptor">Sculptor</a>.
      Sculptor is a non-destructive 3D sculpting tool that works by deforming
      meshes that have been generated via
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">CSG</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, Dbat has developed an advanced version of the spline distance
      fields technique that enables you to create freeform meshes instead of
      height maps.  Their technique uses ray tracing to iteratively deform
      meshes towards the implicit surface described by the input curves.
      Sculptor exposes parameters that allow you to control the projected shape
      and influence of each curve on the mesh deformation process.  Way cool!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dbat's technique would pair very nicely with an adaptive tessellation
      system.

      <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@Danpiker/113191759673781705">wisely pointed out to me</a>
      that the spline distance fields technique is very compatible with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting">Inverse Distance Weighting</a>.
      Shortly after, Danpiker put together
      <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@Danpiker/113192150280297469">this awesome animated demo</a>
      of exactly that.  Here's a still frame from the demo:

    </p>
    <p>
      Inverse Distance Weighting solves the liminality problem, and produces a
      <em>very</em> slick look.  You can very the degree of influence by
      adjusting the exponents in the equation.
    </p>

      I've found inverse distance weighting to be a bit tricky to implement
      efficiently in geometry nodes, however the introduction of the
      <em>for-each</em> nodes in Blender 4.3 improves things a bit.

    <p>
      Personally, I find the smoothing effect is maybe a bit too effective at
      smoothing things out, as it tends to erase the earthy look I'm going for.
      However, I suspect this is easily overcome with a good displacement map.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Recent advances in data collection technology, accompanied by the ever-rising volume and velocity of streaming data, underscore the vital need for time series analytics. In this regard, time-series anomaly detection has been an important activity, entailing various applications in fields such as cyber security, financial markets, law enforcement, and health care. While traditional literature on anomaly detection is centered on statistical measures, the increasing number of machine learning algorithms in recent years call for a structured, general characterization of the research methods for time-series anomaly detection. This survey groups and summarizes anomaly detection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time series context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly detection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and outline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research.

  <p>The top image shows the structural editor, and shell, for the <a href="https://eyg.run/">eyg</a> programming language running on a phone.
Later on I’ll show it running on a TV.
On both devices the structural editor is a better coding experience than a text editor would be.</p>

<p>This post outlines the evolution of the editor over several years, and highlights the major changes over time along with some design thoughts and implementation notes.
The web editor is built in <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre">Lustre</a>; originally it was <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>. 
There also exists a terminal based structural <a href="https://vimeo.com/827006232">editor built in Go</a>.</p>

<p>Want to jump in and code with it? The latest version is at <a href="https://eyg.run/">eyg</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-build-a-structural-editor">Why build a structural editor?</h2>

<p>Structural editors, also known as projectional editors, enhance writing, editing and understanding code. Unlike traditional text-based editors, these tools treat code as a structured tree rather than a flat sequence of characters.</p>

<p><em>This structured data may be the Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) of the represented program, however it can also be a different structure.
For this post I won’t quibble over the differences.</em></p>

<p>Some traditional editors have tools that understand the code structure, for example autocomplete.
However in most cases these tools work as suggestions and a traditional text editor will accept any input.</p>

<p>I define a structural editor as one that does not accept invalid or arbitrary input.
Changes to the program always proceed through well known states.</p>

<p>This clarification is important because the editors I talk about here render the program to the user as text, but it’s important to note that there is no way to enter arbitrary text.</p>

<p>The benefits of a structural editor are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No syntax errors.</strong>
  Zero time is spent on missing quotes, semi-colons or other details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Better type information.</strong>
Because the program is always in a valid state the type checker can always run and give meaningful feedback.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No keywords</strong>
Variables can be called <code>var</code> and functions called <code>fn</code>. Either can also be called 🧪 or <code>!_//</code> though maybe they shouldn’t be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rich visualisations</strong>
A program can be shown as box and wires, or boolean logic operators. On a smaller scale a record of latitude and longitude can be shown on a map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reduced complexity</strong>
There is no lexer or parser so issues like <a href="https://gleam.run/news/fault-tolerant-gleam/">fault tolerant parsing</a> are entirely circumvented.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Several other structed editor projects exist. Jetbrains has <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/">MPS</a> which targets creating your own domain specific languges.
<a href="https://tylr.fun/">Tylr</a> is a beautiful example but currently only good for one line of code at a time.</p>

<h2 id="an-adhoc-first-attempt">An adhoc first attempt</h2>

<p>This is my first recording of the structural editor - admire the minimalistic and clean look.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/664401317?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" title="Week 1"></iframe></p>

<p>The first generation editor worked by directly editing the AST with no effort to hide the details from the user.</p>

<p>Pressing <code>a</code> increased the selection by moving the current selection to the parent node, <code>j/k</code> moved to the previous/next node and
<code>i</code> entered insert mode on the current node. You might see the vim influence of these bindings.</p>

<p>This first version got a few things right.
The command pallet approach in particular is very nice.
It allows you to put a lot of help with certain actions. 
For example when creating a variable the pallet can show all the variables in scope at that position.</p>

<p>At the outset the AST design was driven by the development of the editor, one single enum represented all the expressions in the program.
This is the complete expression type from that time.</p>
<pre><code>pub type Node(m, g) {
  Binary(value: String)
  Tuple(elements: List(Expression(m, g)))
  Record(fields: List(#(String, Expression(m, g))))
  Access(value: Expression(m, g), key: String)
  Tagged(tag: String, value: Expression(m, g))
  Variable(label: String)
  Let(pattern: Pattern, value: Expression(m, g), then: Expression(m, g))
  Function(pattern: Pattern, body: Expression(m, g))
  Call(function: Expression(m, g), with: Expression(m, g))
  Case(
    value: Expression(m, g),
    branches: List(#(String, Pattern, Expression(m, g))),
  )
  Hole
  Provider(config: String, generator: Generator, generated: g)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The update function, called when you press a key in the editor,
was a huge case statement for each combination of key pressed and current position in the tree.
This approach although simple didn’t scale with complexity.
The AST was used by the editor, type checker and code generation so it was not possible to adapt it to the requirements of any particular use case.</p>

<p>In this first version too many concerns were rolled into one project.</p>

<p><em>The <code>Provider</code> node is my implementation of type providers and not part of this story.
But you can see other videos in my <a href="https://petersaxton.uk/log/">log</a> about them.</em></p>

<p>This first effort eventually ground to a halt under its complexity.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-ast">A simple AST</h2>

<p>As a rich AST could not work for all usecases I focused on creating the simplest AST.
Complexity for type checking or editing would move to the appropriate modules.</p>

<pre><code>pub type Expression {
  Variable(label: String)
  Lambda(label: String, body: Expression)
  Apply(func: Expression, argument: Expression)
  Let(label: String, definition: Expression, body: Expression)
  Vacant(comment: String)
  Binary(value: BitArray)
  // .. other primitives for integer, string and builtins
  Empty
  Extend(label: String)
  Select(label: String)
  // .. other operators for lists, unions, effects and references
}
</code></pre>

<p>This AST was the result, it still looks almost <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/8a2a5c0a82ea99a321cfe8e7a0f6cbecaac4f97a/eyg/src/eygir/expression.gleam#L22-L61">identical today</a></p>

<p>By making all features of the language first class, there is a minimal number of compound nodes in the tree. 
Only <code>Lambda</code>, <code>Apply</code> and <code>Let</code> contain child expressions.</p>

<p>To create the record literal <code>{name: "Eve"}</code> required the following expression</p>
<pre><code>Apply(Apply(Extend(label: "name"), String("Eve")), Empty)
</code></pre>

<p>This change makes interpretation and type checking much simpler, take my word for it.</p>

<p>It also simplifies several details of the editor for example:
Positions in the tree are denoted by a list of integers where each integer identifies the child node.
This path is followed from the root node until the required point in the tree.</p>

<p>This <code>step</code> function implements one step of following that path, it takes an expression and goes to n’th child.
Only the three nodes mentioned have to be taken into account by the <code>step</code> function.
It is known that asking for a child of any other kind of node is an error.
This means that variants can be added/removed to the <code>Expression</code> type without in any way modifying or moving around the tree.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn step(exp, n) {
  case exp, n {
    e.Lambda(param, body), 0 -&gt; Ok(#(body, e.Lambda(param, _)))
    e.Apply(func, arg), 0 -&gt; Ok(#(func, e.Apply(_, arg)))
    e.Apply(func, arg), 1 -&gt; Ok(#(arg, e.Apply(func, _)))
    e.Let(label, value, then), 0 -&gt; Ok(#(value, e.Let(label, _, then)))
    e.Let(label, value, then), 1 -&gt; Ok(#(then, e.Let(label, value, _)))
    _, _ -&gt; Error("invalid path")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This change didn’t effect the external look of the editor but it did substantially clean up the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="text-editing-is-intuitive-familiar">Text editing is <del>intuitive</del> familiar</h2>

<p>Moving around the code was tricky in the previous editor. 
This was because the order of nodes in the tree might not match the order they were shown on screen.</p>

<p>For example selecting the field from a record.</p>

<pre><code>let x = user.name
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>user</code> is selected, to move to <code>name</code> required moving left and another move left would jump back to the <code>x</code> of the variable declaration.</p>

<p>This is because the <code>.</code> syntax is sugar for calling the select operator on the variable user. 
In all other cases arguments come after the function but, for select, reversing the order it’s projected to the user makes more sense.</p>

<pre><code>Apply(Select("name"), Variable("user"))
</code></pre>

<p>Making transformations directly on the AST felt powerful but there were too many occasions where an understanding of the AST was needed to know how to move.</p>

<p>The next version aimed to fix the navigation issue by keeping a cursor centric approach.
This means that one key press of left moves the cursor one position left and a key press of right moves the cursor one position right.</p>

<p>Even with moving back to a text based navigation I wanted a fully structural editor so that the program was always a valid structure.</p>

<p>Traditional editors have similar behaviour, for example: when typing <code>(</code> an automatic <code>)</code> is often placed.
In this way you don’t go through a state of having unmatched brackets. 
The main difference is in a text editor this bracket matching features are adhoc and many other ways exist to create a syntactically invalid program.</p>

<p>You can see this working here.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/833330371?h=9aeaa64b46&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" title="05/06/2023, Features of the structured editor"></iframe></p>

<p>This editor was actually quite short lived.
I liked that it showed the type of holes in the program directly in the editor.</p>

<p>However the editor was unintutive in many cases.
Keeping the editor structural but pretending it wasn’t led to too many inconsistencies.
There were places that typing certain characters would do nothing because the character was invalid.</p>

<p>Implementing this editor got complicated quickly.
Intercepting all keyboard events meant dropping out of Gleam and understanding the <a href="https://javascript.info/selection-range">range and selection</a> API’s in the browser. This resulted in a lot of <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/40d1606d50292724970d79a6b1f61926294bc10f/eyg/src/easel_ffi.js">foreign function interface code</a></p>

<p>A positive aside of this effort to go text based meant I wanted better Gleam bindings to the browser API’s and that need kicked off building <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/plinth">plinth</a> a library to do just that.</p>

<h2 id="adding-sugar-and-projections">Adding sugar and projections</h2>

<p>The two previous editors were at opposing ends of a spectrum.
For the first, movement was entirely based on the layout of the AST.
For the second, movement was entirely based on the layout of the text.</p>

<p>I wrote approximately 10k “lines” of EYG code, including a JSON parser and type checker, using the simple AST editor.
Transforming the AST felt very powerful when it worked. However, where the visuals did not match the AST representation navigation was unintuitive.
I eventually mastered it but it was clearly a blocker for anyone else picking up the editor.</p>

<p>This generation of the editor tries to find a middle ground one the spectrum from text to AST.
Navigation is always by whole AST nodes. In addition directions are always consistent with how the program is laid out on screen.</p>

<p>This was achieved by creating a representation of the program specifically for manipulation in the editor. There is:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/441e5686c6721373d6b66636c4f1ce73301d60d7/eyg/src/morph/editable.gleam#L11-L30"><code>Editable</code></a> a type which deals with larger code units than the basic AST</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/441e5686c6721373d6b66636c4f1ce73301d60d7/eyg/src/morph/projection.gleam#L234-L299"><code>Projection</code></a> a zipper into the <code>Editable</code> type that makes navigation and transforms more efficient.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/441e5686c6721373d6b66636c4f1ce73301d60d7/eyg/src/morph/lustre/frame.gleam#L9-L17"><code>Frame</code></a> an intermediate representation for rendering expressions that track if they are single or multiple lines.</li>
</ol>

<p>The basic AST is still used by the interpreter and type checker so the complexity of presenting code to the user is only in the modules which deal with showing code to a user.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/984437518?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" title="7/15/2024, Structured editor in a code notebook."></iframe></p>

<h2 id="using-the-mouse">Using the mouse</h2>

<p>Working with a keyboard is efficient, but only if you know the key bindings to each action you need.
Which key to press to get a desired action is not discoverable from looking at the UI element.
After all the UI for keyboard actions is just a cursor somewhere in the page.</p>

<p>A user is required to consult a cheatsheet of keyboard actions and learn some before ever getting started.
This friction makes getting started very challenging.</p>

<p>Devices without keyboards have to show virtual keyboards to use keyboard shortcuts.
If the actions are being presented on screen they might as well be shown as something more relevant than the letter code corresponding to the short cut.</p>

<p>This latest iteration adds a menu and icon based UI for each transformation that is possible on the AST.
A question mark button at the top toggles showing text descriptions of each action but at the cost of less screen to work with.
The UI works with keyboard, mouse, touch or TV remote.</p>

<p><img src="https://crowdhailer.me/2025-01-02/the-evolution-of-a-structural-code-editor/tv.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It also works great with a keyboard and if you forget the key, seemlessly switch to the visual.</p>

<p>Implementing the visual UI was simple with Lustre and the state and event approach it has.
Lustre is an implementation of the Elm architecture.</p>

<p>The state of the program works by <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/eyg-lang/blob/441e5686c6721373d6b66636c4f1ce73301d60d7/website/src/website/components/snippet.gleam#L302-L352">switching on key press events</a>.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn update(state, message) {
  let Snippet(status: status, ..,) = state
  case message, status {
    UserPressedCommandKey(key), Editing(Command(_)) -&gt; {
      let state = Snippet(..state, using_mouse: False)
      case key {
        "ArrowRight" -&gt; move_right(state)
        "ArrowLeft" -&gt; move_left(state)
        "ArrowUp" -&gt; move_up(state)
        "ArrowDown" -&gt; move_down(state)

        "#" -&gt; insert_reference(state)
        "z" -&gt; undo(state)
        "Z" -&gt; redo(state)
        // "x" -&gt;
        "c" -&gt; call_function(state)
        "v" -&gt; insert_variable(state)
        "b" -&gt; insert_binary(state)

        "," -&gt; extend_before(state)

        "." -&gt; spread_list(state)
        "TOGGLE SPREAD" -&gt; toggle_spread(state)
        "TOGGLE OTHERWISE" -&gt; toggle_otherwise(state)

        "?" -&gt; #(state, ToggleHelp)
        "Enter" -&gt; execute(state)
        _ -&gt; show_error(state, NoKeyBinding(key))
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The UI buttons make use of the same events and update logic.
Each button in the visual UI consists of;</p>

<ul>
  <li>the icon to show (I use the heroicon library and the outline style)</li>
  <li>a text description of the action (which is shown when “show help” is on)</li>
  <li>the keypress event to dispatch.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>fn cmd(x) {
  ShellMessage(snippet.UserPressedCommandKey(x))
}

fn item_before() {
  #(outline.arrow_turn_left_down(), "item before", cmd(","))
}

fn item_after() {
  #(outline.arrow_turn_right_down(), "item after", cmd("EXTEND AFTER"))
}

fn undo() {
  #(outline.arrow_uturn_left(), "undo", cmd("z"))
}

fn redo() {
  #(outline.arrow_uturn_right(), "redo", cmd("Z"))
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>There are more actions than available keys so the <code>EXTEND AFTER</code> string value can be dispatched by clicking the correct button, but not by any keyboard binding.</em></p>

<p>Here is the final result, as of today.</p>
