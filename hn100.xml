<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The United States has been added to the Civicus Monitor Watchlist, which identifies countries that the global civil rights watchdog believes are currently experiencing a rapid decline in civic freedoms.</p><p><a href="https://www.civicus.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Civicus</a>, an international non-profit organization dedicated to “strengthening citizen action and civil society around the world”, announced the inclusion of the US on the non-profit’s first watchlist of 2025 on Monday, alongside the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Italy, Pakistan and Serbia.</p><p>The watchlist is part of the Civicus Monitor, which <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/watchlist-september-2024/faqs/" data-link-name="in body link">tracks developments in civic freedoms across 198 countries</a>. Other countries<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/watchlist-september-2024/previous-countries/" data-link-name="in body link"> that have previously been featured</a> on the watchlist in recent years include Zimbabwe, Argentina, El Salvador and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Mandeep Tiwana, co-secretary general of Civicus, said that the watchlist “looks at countries where we remain concerned about deteriorating civic space conditions, in relation to freedoms of peaceful assembly, association and expression”.</p><p>The selection process, the website states, incorporates insights and data from Civicus’s global network of research partners and data.</p><p>The decision to add the US to the first 2025 watchlist was made in response to what the group described as the “Trump administration’s assault on democratic norms and global cooperation”.</p><p>In the news release announcing the US’s addition, the organization cited recent actions taken by the Trump administration that they argue will likely “severely impact constitutional freedoms of peaceful assembly, expression, and association”.</p><p>The group cited several of the administration’s actions such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/who-are-federal-employees-trump-firing" data-link-name="in body link">mass termination of federal employees</a>, the appointment of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/01/trump-picks-loyalist-kash-patel-to-run-fbi" data-link-name="in body link">Trump loyalists in key government positions</a>, the withdrawal from international efforts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-order-who-withdrawal" data-link-name="in body link">such as the World Health Organization</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-united-nations-unrwa.html" data-link-name="in body link">UN Human Rights Council</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/trump-pauses-grants-loans" data-link-name="in body link">freezing of federal</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-usaid-cuts" data-link-name="in body link">foreign aid</a> and the attempted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/diplomats-usaid-letter-rubio" data-link-name="in body link">dismantling of USAid</a>.</p><p>The organization warned that these decisions “will likely impact civic freedoms and reverse hard-won human rights gains around the world”.</p><p>The group also pointed to the administration’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/trump-university-funding-protests" data-link-name="in body link">crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters</a>, and the Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/25/white-house-press-pool" data-link-name="in body link">administration’s unprecedented decision to control media access to presidential briefings</a>, among others.</p><p>Civicus described Trump’s actions since taking office as an “unparalleled attack on the rule of law” not seen “since the days of McCarthyism in the twentieth century”, stating that these moves erode the checks and balances essential to democracy.</p><p>“Restrictive executive orders, unjustifiable institutional cutbacks, and intimidation tactics through threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal,” Tiwana said.</p><p>In addition to the watchlist, the Civicus Monitor classifies the state of civic space in countries using <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/about/how-it-works/ratings/" data-link-name="in body link">five ratings</a>: open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed and closed.</p><p>Currently, the US has a “narrowed” rating, which it also had during the Biden administration, meaning that while citizens can exercise their civic freedom, such as rights to association, peaceful assembly and expression, occasional violations occur.</p><p>For part of Trump’s first term, Tiwana said, the US had been categorized as “obstructed”, due to the administration’s response to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement" data-link-name="in body link">Black Lives Matter</a> protests and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/20/keystone-pipeline-protest-activism-crackdown-standing-rock" data-link-name="in body link">restrictive state laws that were enacted limiting the rights of environmental justice protesters</a>, and other actions.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-15" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Under Joe Biden, the classification went back to “narrowed”, Tiwana, said, but as of Monday, the US has been placed on the watchlist as the group says it sees “significant deterioration” in civic freedoms occurring.</p><p>Tiwana noted that the US is again seemingly headed toward the “obstructed” category.</p><p>While the Trump administration often say they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/05/trump-congress-speech-address-latest-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67c7b8698f08806c689201a0#block-67c7b8698f08806c689201a0" data-link-name="in body link">support fundamental freedoms and individual rights, like free speech</a>, Tiwana believes that the administration seem “to be wanting to support these only for people who they see as agreeing with them”.</p><p>Historically, Tiwana said, the US has been “considered the beacon of democracy and defense of fundamental freedoms”.</p><p>“It was an important pillar of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-foreign-policy" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">US foreign policy</a>, even though it was imperfect, both domestically and how the US promoted it abroad,” he added.</p><p>But Tiwana believes that the recent actions and statements made by this US administration could empower authoritarian regimes around the world, undermine constitutional principles, and embolden those who “want to accumulate power and increase their wealth and their ability to stay in power for as long as possible”.</p><p>Tiwana says that he and the organization want to draw attention to the fact that those in power in the US are, in his view, engaging in a “zero-sum politics game” that is eroding “constitutional principles and frankly, engaging in, anti American behavior”.</p><p>“We urge the United States to uphold the rule of law and respect constitutional and international human rights norms,” said Tiwana.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Gasoline-powered cars generate more RFI than diesel-powered cars because they have spark plugs. That meant that NRAO had to purchase diesel cars when they bought their original fleet, and by the way, these cars are part of that original purchase. When NRAO wanted to renew their fleet, they found out they couldn’t, because the newer diesel-powered cars on the market were all using chips and various other electrical equipment (seat belt buzzers, door buzzers, etc.) that generated unwanted RFI. Any electrical ark (spark plugs, power lines, bad thermostats, etc.) generates broadband radio signals, at various frequencies throughout the spectrum but mostly at the lower frequencies, below 2 GHz or so.&nbsp;So that meant they had to stick with their original fleet, whose diesel engines used no computer chips whatsoever and generated little RFI. You may look at these cars and call them clunkers but to NRAO technicians and scientists, they’re reliable modes of transportation that do not interfere with their research.</p>

<p>You may see newer cars in the parking lot, but they’re not used on campus. Only these blue diesel cars can go under and around the telescopes without causing problems.</p>

<p>We were ferried around the NRAO campus in one of these cars by Mr. Sizemore, and they’re quite comfortable.</p>

<p>One thing I can’t get used to in these old cars is the gear shifter. It’s so long and seems so awkwardly placed…</p>
<h2>More on the telescopes</h2>
<p>One of the telescopes on site is used as a teaching instrument. NRAO, being involved in both research and educational efforts, brings groups of school-age children on-site to teach them about radio astronomy. The telescope is not a fancy, cryogenically cooled machine but a simple wire-mesh dish with simple control and monitoring gear that the kids can play with. It’s fully functional though, and it does pick up many radio waves. It’s sufficient to teach radio astronomy and galactic coordinate systems and such.</p>
<p>The National Youth Science Camp is just up the road from NRAO. For two weeks each summer, groups of teachers (high school and college) come to NRAO for an intense course in radio astronomy. The staff turn on the knowledge firehose and “really pour it on them”, as Mr. Sizemore puts it. They have classes during the day and then do research at night with the telescopes. He says it’s not unusual at the end of two weeks to see them walking around the campus, muttering to themselves.</p>
<p>After they complete the course, they can bring their own students to NRAO (for a day or so) and use the 40-foot learning telescope to teach them about radio astronomy without much intervention from NRAO Staff.</p>
<p>As the young researchers sit and wait by the telescopes for the stars to come into position, they have nothing to do, so they doodle or draw. Sue Ann Heatherly, the NRAO Education Officer, loves to collect the better ones and she puts them up on the walls of various NRAO corridors.</p>
<p>As we drove around, Mr. Sizemore pointed to a dish and told me it was a polar mount, and that I will never see a dish built like that again. It’s mounted on the plane of the galaxy (Milky Way) not the earth coordinate system. It’s a right ascension and declination mount. If you were to stand on the axis of the telescope and look at the sky, you would be looking directly at Polaris, the North Star. (By comparison, the GBT (Green Bank Telescope) is mounted as an elevation and azimuth drive system, which is an earth based system. )&nbsp;The reason this telescope was built like this in the 1950s is because computer power at that time wasn’t fast enough to translate between the coordinates of the galaxy and the solar system in realtime. Now even a pocket calculator can do it.</p>
<p>Although the telescope has been sitting unused for 10 years, they recently brought it back online in order to do atmospheric research studies with MIT. The study involves bouncing radio signals off the&nbsp;satellites&nbsp;around the Earth, then measuring those signals to see how they were perturbed by the atmosphere. The MIT researchers brought their own trailer on-site, with their own receiver and computer equipment. After some work mitigating RFI leaks from the trailer, they were ready to go and NRAO was happy to see the telescope back in action.</p>
<p>When it comes to the GBT (Green Bank Telescope) one of the things NRAO doesn’t want to do with such a large telescope is to set up vibrations in the structure when it’s started and stopped. The way they handle that is to mount both forward and reverse motors at each drive wheel. In order to stop or start it, all the technicians have to do is to increase the current on the motors that move in the direction they need, and the structure will stop or start as fast or as slow as they want it. When you think about this and other precision equipment mounted on the dish, like the laser leveling equipment and the motors that power each plate in the dish, Mr. Sizemore likened the GBT to “building a battleship with the precision of a Swiss watch”.</p>

<p>Even the track of the telescope is leveled to within 1/5,000th of an inch, and the rest of the structure is comparable to that all the way up. What about the land settling over time, I asked? There are no such problems, he replied, because they went all the way down to bedrock when they laid the foundation (about 40 feet).</p>
<p>The local cement contractor had no competition when it came to the contract for laying the foundation. The closest competitor was about 40 miles away, on the other side of the mountain, so he got the contract and had to rent three additional cement mixer/pouring trucks in order to keep up with the demand. For the entire period (three or four weeks) that it took to pour the foundation, the man kept grinning as his trucks pulled into the construction site, because he stood to make a lot of money.</p>
<h2>The NRQZ monitoring station</h2>
<p>While I was on-site, Mr. Sizemore showed me his “hiding place” – his monitoring station. It’s a big trailer that can be hauled from place to place, but has been made stationary and hooked up to the power lines. That’s where he does most of his work. Here he monitors the gross violations of the Quiet Zone and also looks at the local environment: powerline noise, illegal use of radios, etc.</p>
<p>For example, at the time of my visit there, the amateur radio bands were being used improperly by a group of people and the signal was strong enough to overload the 140-foot telescope, so it became a serious problem. Wesley told me that the problem will likely be taken care of long before I write up about it, and the likely action taken will be that he calls the FCC in to enforce the rules in place. After 20 years on the job, Wesley has built up a network of contacts he can call upon when he needs help. One of those contacts is the man in charge of the Enforcement Bureau at the FCC, whom Wesley knew when he was still a satellite technician.</p>
<p>While I was recording our talk, I asked Wesley if he could see the interference generated by my recorder, and he worked up a quick setup to find the noise it created. Sure enough, he tuned into the noise generated by my iPod as it was recording our conversation within a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>One of the teaching tools he uses with school groups that visit NRAO is a metal trashcan (a Faraday cage with an antenna and amplifier mounted inside the lid). He takes his spectrum analyzer, connects it to the antenna and amplifier assembly, then gets a student volunteer to put in their phone or laptop or MP3 player, then he shows the whole group the interference those devices create. The only thing the antenna sees is the RFI generated by the device put in the trash can, because it’s a Faraday cage. Everyone is invariably wowed by this.</p>
<p>As we drove around the NRAO campus, we came across a car with a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantenna" target="_blank">cantenna</a>” (a directional waveguide antenna for long-range WiFi), and I immediately pointed it out to Mr. Sizemore, as I knew he’d be on the lookout for WiFi transmissions in the area. Smirking, he admitted that was his service car, and he told me the story behind it. The FCC had donated it to NRAO, who had been using it to sniff out illegal transmissions. The car actually had antennas built into its roof and was already fitted with equipment for sniffing out radio transmissions. Mr. Sizemore outfitted it with WiFi “sniffing” equipment as well: a laptop with NetStumbler and a bunch of other apps, a GPS device for marking the location of RFI-causing WiFi and a “cantenna” on the roof, that he could rotate and point at various WiFi sources.</p>
<p>Before retiring from NRAO (years after my interviews with him), Mr. Sizemore <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2009-01-02-interference-hunters_N.htm?csp=34" target="_blank">outfitted a new Dodge Ram extended cab truck as an RFI vehicle</a>, a feat which was written up in USA Today.</p>
<h2>NRAO and the community</h2>
<p>As we drove around the campus, Mr. Sizemore pointed to the farmhouses that surrounded NRAO. When the government took over the land, they invoked the right of imminent domain, forcing the farmers to move. That generated animosity toward the observatory, because the land was fertile and it was good for farming.</p>
<p>With time, things got better, to the point where there was only one farmer left who couldn’t stand NRAO and wouldn’t ever let them step on his property. All of the powerlines and phone lines for NRAO were routed around his property.&nbsp;At one point, the man chased Mr. Sizemore’s predecessor off with a stick. If NRAO staff ever had to go visit him, they’d take a deputy sheriff with them. When Mr. Sizemore began working there, he knew to steer clear of the farm.</p>
<p>One day though, he got a call from the man. He had an outside TV amplifier, a tube-type amplifier made by a company called Blonder-Tongue, which had been struck by lightning. The old man couldn’t find anyone to repair it and he didn’t want to spend money to get a new one. He called the only one whom he knew could help. Mr. Sizemore was of course glad to do it, because he’d finally be able to atone for the bad blood between NRAO and the farmer.</p>
<p>He drove out to the man’s place, where he had to wait off the property for the amplifier to be brought to him (he still wasn’t allowed on the farm) and took it back to the lab to see what he could do.</p>
<p>He called Blonder-Tongue&nbsp;and was told they hadn’t made that amplifier model in 20 years, and they hadn’t serviced it for 10 years. They didn’t think they could help. Mr. Sizemore insisted he speak with a supervisor and as luck would have it, the repair supervisor was an elderly guy who remembered working on them when he’d started with the company. He said, “Send it to me, and I’ll show these young technicians how things used to be.” Mr. Sizemore explained the entire situation to the man, about NRAO and the farmer, then mailed off the amplifier to the repair supervisor.</p>
<p>The amplifier came back repaired and it didn’t cost anything either. The old farmer was elated when he got it back. He put it back up and everything was fine until a week later, when he called Mr. Sizemore. You know the old saying about lightning not striking twice? Not true for the old man. His amplifier had been struck again.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to let Mr. Sizemore examine his property, to see if the lightning strikes could be prevented, so all he could do was to mail it off to Blonder-Tongue&nbsp;once more. Sure enough, it came back repaired as new again, at no charge. Thankfully, to the day of the interview, the amplifier evaded other lightning strikes so things were fine between NRAO and the old man.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. Sizemore’s efforts, NRAO enjoys a very good relationship with the community. Being an isolated rural community, where all they have is each other, they tend to pull together and help each other.</p>
<p>For example, some people had learned to recognize the interference from awry TV amplifiers, which would show up as a herringbone pattern on their sets, and would call Mr. Sizemore to let him know. They also knew what powerline interference looked like, because it would show up on their sets once again, generating a specific noise pattern.</p>
<p>The NRAO site is basically a wildlife preserve. They let the animals live and roam free. The only practice they instituted a few years back was a controlled deer hunt, because the deer population had gotten out of control. Before they began, the Wildlife Management Institute wanted to do a headcount of the deer, so they fitted a plane with thermal imaging equipment and started to fly over the NRAO site one night.</p>
<p>Because they hadn’t publicized this, the local people didn’t know what was happening and all they could see was a plane which kept circling over NRAO at night. They thought the plane was in trouble, so they all pulled together, drove to the local airport (next to NRAO) and shone their headlights on the landing strip, to help it land. Well, after a while, they figured out the plane wasn’t in trouble and went home, but let’s just say that the next time WMI decided to do nighttime wildlife studies, they publicized it widely, to make sure everyone knew what was going on.</p>
<h2>The NEACP encounters</h2>
<p>As we talk about flyovers, another good story is that of the NEACP encounters. When the Cold War was going on, the US Military always had an aircraft in the air at all times, an airborne command post (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergency_Airborne_Command_Post" target="_blank">NEACP</a>: National Emergency Airborne Command Post). There were multiple such aircraft in service and one was in flight at all times. One would take off before one would land.</p>
<p>When they would fly over NRAO, all the radio equipment on board those planes (they used 1,000 Watt transmitters) would overload NRAO’s equipment with RFI. Mr. Sizemore found the number for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain" target="_blank">CMOC</a> (Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center) and spoke to one of the people involved with NEACP. He introduced himself and said, “You have this aircraft, using this callsign, operating at this frequency, at this location.” They got upset right away, because they didn’t want anyone to know what their routes were. They started questioning Mr. Sizemore about the source of his information, to which he simply replied, “I used a 300-foot telescope and I looked at your aircraft.” Then he continued to explain: “I have to track this source of interference down. That is my job. I have a solution. Let me send you my observing schedule every month, to tell you what frequencies I’ll be observing on what days and tell you my station, and then you’ll be able to avoid me. And if you can’t avoid me, you can let me know, and I’ll tell the astronomers to take a coffee break.”</p>
<p>As a result of that phone call, Mr. Sizemore got the NEACP to avoid the Green Bank area, and when they couldn’t avoid it, he got a few calls from them when they had to pass over NRAO, after which he would quickly tell the astronomers to take a break, as their equipment would soon get overloaded, making the data unusable.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s the end of part seven and the series. As mentioned at the start, this work is unfinished, and that’s why you don’t see a nice story arc with good closure, but I hope that what I’ve published has proven enjoyable and interesting for you and has sparked your interest in radio astronomy and NRAO.&nbsp;You can also read parts&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves - Part One" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/04/chasing-rfi-waves-part-one/" target="_blank">one</a>, <a title="Chasing RFI Waves – Part&nbsp;Two" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/11/chasing-rfi-waves-part-two/" target="_blank">two</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves - Part Three" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/04/chasing-rfi-waves-part-three/" target="_blank">three</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves - Part Four" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/04/chasing-rfi-waves-part-four/" target="_blank">four</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves – Part&nbsp;Five" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/04/01/chasing-rfi-waves-part-five/" target="_blank">five</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves – Part&nbsp;Six" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/04/08/chasing-rfi-waves-part-six/" target="_blank">six</a>.</p>

Software spends most of its time running in user mode, where it is restricted from directly performing powerful operations such as accessing files or communicating on a network. To carry out these actions, software must temporarily elevate to kernel mode by making a <em>system call</em>, which is a request to the kernel to take over and perform the desired operation. For example, when a program wants to open a file, it makes a system call which switches the program to running kernel code in kernel mode. The kernel code verifies the program is allowed to access that file, and then returns a special handle representing the now opened file back to the program in user mode.</p><p id="ecd6">Most operating systems use a <em>monolithic kernel</em> design, where the kernel has unrestricted access to the entire system — all hardware, memory, and user data. In an ideal world, where software is flawless and no one attempts to compromise security, this design may be satisfactory. However, software often contains bugs, and some of those bugs lead to security vulnerabilities. Given that monolithic kernels are large, they present more opportunities for these vulnerabilities to arise and be exploited. Once a vulnerability is successfully exploited, it can lead to a complete system compromise, as all the operating system’s functions are bundled together in the kernel’s single “basket of eggs”.</p><p id="3efb">An alternative kernel design, known as a <em>microkernel</em>, minimizes the functions within the kernel itself, pushing most operations into separate, unprivileged processes. This can improve security by isolating potential vulnerabilities. However, microkernels can suffer from performance issues, and push extra complexity onto the application software. As a result, monolithic kernels remain prevalent, and the vulnerabilities associated with them continue to be a problem.</p><p id="3cab">The kernel shared in common between iOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS — named XNU — is based on a microkernel called Mach. However, the way XNU has been implemented places all system functions within the same privileged scope and it effectively operates as a monolithic kernel. The XNU kernel, like all monolithic kernels, suffers from unfortunately common vulnerability discoveries.</p><h2 id="163d">Isolation Efforts</h2><p id="2632">Over the years, a variety of software and hardware-based mitigations have been developed to isolate some parts systems from their more vulnerable monolithic kernels. Below are some notable non-Apple examples:</p><ul><li id="321d">Microsoft Virtualisation-based Security (VBS) used for <em>Credential Guard </em>in Windows</li><li id="d52b">Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) and VT-X2</li><li id="0d82">ARM TrustZone — Powers features like Samsung Knox, Samsung Pay, Android Verified Boot, Android secure PIN entry</li></ul><p id="364d"><em>Apple has also increasingly attempted to isolate data from the kernel and these are covered below.</em></p><h2 id="910e">2013 — Apple Secure Enclave</h2><p id="ebcc">In 2013 Apple released the iPhone 5s, the first iPhone containing a Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave is implemented on a dedicated, hardened CPU core running a microkernel-based OS called <em>SepOS</em>. The underlying kernel in SepOS is <em>cL4</em>, Apple’s custom version of the L4-embedded microkernel. The Secure Enclave is used to store and protect sensitive data like encryption keys and biometric information (e.g., Face ID). The Secure Enclave operates independently of the iOS kernel and only provides its services to iOS through controlled, secure interactions. Even if the iOS kernel is compromised, the Secure Enclave remains largely unaffected unless an additional exploit targets it.</p><p id="438a">Do not confuse the Secure E<strong>n</strong>clave with the subject of this article, Secure E<strong>x</strong>claves!</p><h2 id="ec46">2017 — Page Protection Layer</h2><p id="4afc">With the release of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X containing the A11 processor, Apple introduced a security feature known as the <em>Page Protection Layer (PPL)</em>. This hardware+software feature isolated a small part of the kernel and gave it privileges to modify memory page tables — critical structures that manage memory access. The rest of the kernel lost the ability to directly modify these page tables. The PPL’s limited attack surface ensured that bypasses were infamously rare. While PPL added a layer of protection, it was only partly effective as the rest of the kernel still held most privileges required to compromise data without modifying page tables.</p><h2 id="5b0b">2021–2023 — Secure Page Table Monitor</h2><p id="9c23">Following PPL, the release of the iPhone 13 containing the A15 processor introduced new functionality utilised in iOS 17: the <em>Secure Page Table Monitor</em> (SPTM). This replaced and improved upon the PPL by securing additional memory functions and dividing them into subsystems, further isolating small kernel components. Validation of code signatures, confirming that all code had been signed by Apple was also isolated.</p><p id="861b">Around this time, oblique references to <em>exclaves</em> began to surface in XNU source code. These exclaves were speculated to be the subsystems managed by SPTM. Then 2024 happened…</p><h2 id="1e82">2024 — Exclaves: A major addition to XNU</h2><p id="7a85">With the release of XNU source code supporting M4 and A18 based systems (such as the iPhone 16), the curtain was partly pulled back on exclaves. (Exclaves are <em>not</em> active on prior processors).</p><p id="9904"><em>It is now clear that exclaves are part of a much larger redesign of XNU’s security model.</em></p></div><div><h2 id="5029">XNU Exclaves</h2><p id="6fc0"><em>Disclaimer: This analysis will not be 100% correct — many parts of exclaves aren’t open sourced and their inner workings are only inferred or I am speculating.</em></p><figure><figcaption>Conclave of 2005: White smoke indicates a new Pope has been elected; in this case Pope Benedictus XVI</figcaption></figure><p id="fa62">Exclaves are a new set of features that represent a significant enhancement for XNU’s traditional monolithic kernel. Exclaves refer to resources that are isolated from XNU, protected even if the kernel is compromised. These resources are pre-defined when the OS is built, are identified by name or id, have different types, are initialised at boot time, and are organized into unique domains. SPTM protects exclave memory from XNU with new exclave-specific page types. Types of resources include:</p><ul><li id="6a35"><em>Shared memory buffers </em>that can be accessed by both the kernel and the exclave, with the option to make them read-only or read-write to XNU.</li><li id="b491"><em>Audio buffers</em> and <em>sensors</em> that are used for securing features like the camera and microphone access indicators.</li><li id="fbc6"><em>Conclaves</em> that group multiple resources into their own secure domains and their corresponding <em>Conclave Managers</em></li><li id="a21a"><em>Services</em> that can execute code within the exclave space when called upon by threads in XNU.</li></ul><figure><figcaption>Threads change context between different privilege levels and worlds</figcaption></figure><h2 id="b3dc">Secure Kernel — seL4?</h2><p id="0de0">To allow for execution of exclave Services while isolated from XNU, Apple has introduced a new kernel called the Secure Kernel (SK). The SK image file contains a version string for “cL4”. While I have not attempted to disassemble SK, there are many indications that it is based on the seL4 kernel despite the “cL4” name. The IPC structures used by XNU to communicate with SK closely align with seL4 rather than L4-embedded used for the original SepOS cL4 kernel. Strings in SK frequently mention capabilities, frames, untyped memory, minting, and so on which are also more closely aligned with seL4.</p><p id="bfb2">Perhaps it isn’t a coincidence that the seL4 Foundation publicly announced that Apple had joined in April 2024. Incidentally, the kernel for the C1 processor, Apple’s new baseband chip, is also based on some version of L4 so Apple is heavily invested in this space.</p><h2 id="d6ec">Secure Worlds — ARM TrustZone?</h2><p id="1ac5">As previously mentioned, SepOS runs on a dedicated processor for maximum isolation. In contrast, SK runs on the same high speed application processors as XNU/iOS. To make this possible, additional processor privilege levels are required — likely supported by virtualization extensions, Apple specific additions to SPTM, or most likely via ARM’s <em>TrustZone</em> technology. The XNU source code contains several references regarding transitions to and from TrustZone’s concept of a <em>secure world</em>, and it would be the cleanest implementation method.</p><p id="3892">TrustZone divides the system into two worlds: the <em>Secure World</em> and the <em>Insecure World</em>. ARM provides several design patterns for TrustZone, and Apple appear to have been influenced by these. XNU (and iOS) run in the insecure world while SK operates in the secure world. SK provides a limited operating environment for exclaves, resources and services, differing from the Trusted Applications design pattern suggested by ARM. Given the isolated nature of exclave services and the limited attack surface of the Secure Kernel, escaping from the secure world to compromise XNU is likely to be much more difficult than exploiting it directly from the insecure world.</p><p id="b718">Apple <em>may</em> use SPTM to manage transitions between the secure and insecure worlds, though this is speculation on my part, as it is not open-sourced so disassembly of the binaries is required. The code refers to this transition as a <em>RINGGATE</em>.</p></div><div><h2 id="6c7b">A Deeper Dive</h2><figure></figure><h2 id="82fc">Domains and Resources</h2><p id="e4e9">XNU initialises a two-level kernel table structure to hold information on exclave <em>resources </em>discovered during boot. Each resource is exclusively of one resource type and holds information on a resource that exists in the secure world, or in both worlds.</p><p id="0856">The <em>root_table</em> identifies <em>domains</em> by name, with each domain referencing a second level table holding all the <em>resources</em> for that domain. Domains and their resources discovered so far include:</p><p id="1da3"><strong>com.apple.kernel </strong>— this domain contains many resources used by the kernel including:</p><ul><li id="329f">com.apple.service.ConclaveLauncherControl — conclave launcher service</li><li id="7ba8">com.apple.service.ConclaveLauncher_Debug — debug service</li><li id="4457">com.apple.service.ExclaveIndicatorController — service for secure indicator lights</li><li id="e230">com.apple.service.LogServer_XNUProxy — service for logging</li><li id="38ca">com.apple.service.FrameMint — service used to boot ExclaveKit</li><li id="4245">com.apple.storage.backend — Shared memory buffer used by exclave services to do file IO from XNU space via upcalls (more details below)</li><li id="95fc">Conclave Manager x — One per conclave, used to control a conclave</li><li id="331b">Conclave Manager y …</li></ul><p id="7718"><strong>com.apple.darwin </strong>— No open-source components use this domain</p><p id="b5b9"><strong>com.apple.conclave.name</strong> — There is one domain per conclave.</p><ul><li id="06da">service_x</li><li id="e73c">service_y</li><li id="d0fb">audio buffer</li><li id="7502">shared memory buffer</li><li id="0c5d">etc</li></ul><p id="2f5a"><strong>com.apple.driver.<em>name</em> </strong>— One domain per device driver — existence of these domains is based on comments, not actually seen in open-sourced code. I suspect these are just per-driver conclaves.</p><h2 id="9a8b">Conclaves</h2><p id="785f">A conclave is a type of resource that itself can contain multiple resources. However, it is much more than just a container of resources. Conclaves allow a group of services and other resources to have shared access to each other, and Mach tasks are limited in what (if any) conclaves they can call upon.</p><p id="a3d8">Each conclave has a <em>Conclave Manager</em> (another type of exclave resource), located in the kernel domain.</p><p id="eea9">Conclaves have a lifecycle, whereby their Conclave Manager is first <em>attached</em> to a Mach task, and are then <em>launched</em>. They can also be stopped and detached. States such as <em>launching</em> and <em>stopping</em> exist during transitions in the lifecycle.</p><h2 id="5805"><strong>Conclaves — Spawning and Attaching</strong></h2><p id="7581">The XNU posix_spawn() function can call task_add_conclave() to attach a task and a conclave manager resource together. This is a 1:1 relationship — only one task can be attached to a conclave manager and vice versa. Only launchd and tasks with the <em>com.apple.private.exclaves.conclave-spawn</em> entitlement may spawn a conclave. The <em>com.apple.private.exclaves.conclave-host </em>entitlement is largely similar, but I believe only entitles a task to attach itself, rather than being able to spawn a new task for this purpose.</p><p id="6ac1">The kernel looks up the associated conclave manager resource for the targeted conclave in the <em>com.apple.kernel</em> domain. It then saves a <em>tightbeam</em> endpoint to the conclave manager’s endpoint in the conclave’s resource struct. This endpoint is where all future control of the conclave is directed. Tightbeam appears to be an RPC framework for communication between exclave components.</p><p id="acb7">Note this attachment is to a <em>task</em> — not a <em>thread</em>. Execution of services will be covered later.</p><p id="65a9">Conclave manager tasks are <em>not</em> allowed to have kernel domain privileges.</p><h2 id="d948"><strong>Conclaves — Launching</strong></h2><p id="673f">Once attached, a conclave may be <em>launched</em>. The launch attempt must be performed from the conclave manager task attached to the conclave. Attempts to launch conclaves also wait until exclaves have fully booted (into state EXCLAVES_BS_BOOTED_EXCLAVEKIT — more on this later).</p><p id="747d">A new mach trap (ie system call) for exclave functionality has been added to XNU and ends up in the <em>_exclaves_ctl_trap() </em>function. This call is overloaded and can perform different <em>operations</em> passed in as parameters. The relevant operation to launch a conclave is EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_LAUNCH_CONCLAVE.</p><p id="1ab0">The launch operation calls a redacted function, <em>conclave_launcher_conclavecontrol_launch() </em>and passes it the tightbeam connection to the conclave manager to perform the launch. I suspect this requests the initialisation of executable code and resources for the conclave within the secure world.</p><p id="d027">In production, conclave hosts can be <em>tainted</em> when launched, and an exit() may then cause a kernel panic.</p><h2 id="5d4d">A New Mach Trap / System Call</h2><p id="610a">As mentioned, the _exclaves_ctl_trap() function handles a new Mach trap for exclave functionality. The call is overloaded, with its action dependent on an operation parameter, and it generally verifies entitlements to the operations called. The operations are:</p><ul><li id="7707">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_BOOT — Called twice during the system boot process — firstly to start exclaves boot stage 2, and then to boot stage ExclaveKit. The caller must be launchd or have the com.apple.private.exclaves.boot entitlement.</li></ul><p id="33ff"><em>All operations below, at minimum, require the current task to have the com.apple.private.exclaves.kernel-domain entitlement, or be the relevant conclave manager task</em></p><ul><li id="07d0">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_LAUNCH_CONCLAVE — launch a conclave, discussed earlier</li><li id="dea1">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_LOOKUP_SERVICES — lookup an exclave service and copy its struct to a userspace buffer. First it looks in the exclave domain of the current task, if that fails it checks the Darwin domain followed by kernel domain — if it is entitled to do so</li><li id="5b78"><strong>EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_ENDPOINT_CALL</strong> — calls the endpoint for an exclave service in the current task’s domain — this will result in the current thread switching from kernel mode to the secure world and executing specific code there</li><li id="4b58">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NAMED_BUFFER_CREATE — create a named buffer resource</li><li id="343b">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NAMED_BUFFER_COPYIN — copy data from a userspace buffer to a kernel buffer (that is shared with exclaves)</li><li id="7e58">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NAMED_BUFFER_COPYOUT — copy data from a kernel buffer (that is shared with exclaves) to a userspace buffer</li><li id="ed65">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_AUDIO_BUFFER_CREATE — can an audio buffer</li><li id="4258">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_AUDIO_BUFFER_COPYOUT — copy data from audio buffer to userspace buffer</li><li id="3d7d">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_CREATE — create a sensor resource (eg. camera, microphone)</li><li id="d56d">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_START</li><li id="406f">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_STOP</li><li id="3a23">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_STATUS</li><li id="edf9">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NOTIFICATION_RESOURCE_LOOKUP — create a notification resource — TBD, but likely for coordination/scheduling</li></ul><h2 id="88a8">Downcalls — running code in the secure world</h2><p id="c102">Downcalls are calls to exclave <em>Services’ </em>endpoints in the secure world — this is where secure world code execution happens.</p><p id="8349">There is a great deal of complexity in these calls, primarily around managing thread/IPC contexts and scheduling the current thread to execute code in the secure world.</p><ol><li id="1347">Downcalls switch the current thread into the secure world and start executing at an entry point in secure code, rather than asking some other thread to perform work on behalf of the current thread.</li><li id="ca8a">Calling tasks must have kernel domain entitlements or be the conclave manager task attached to the service’s conclave.</li><li id="237b">Conclaves have a maximum of 128 services that can be called</li><li id="ffd3">It appears that threads are scheduled into the secure kernel (via the sk_enter() function) by XNU. XNU appears to handle the scheduling of <em>all</em> threads in the secure world, with SK potentially not having any independent threads of its own.</li><li id="d4bf">A thread executing in the secure world can perform a temporary <em>upcall</em> to XNU, which returns the thread to kernel mode for the upcall, before a mandatory return <em>back</em> to the secure world context. More detail on upcalls will be provided further below.</li><li id="7c94">Threads executing in the secure world can do normal scheduler type things like yield, wait, be suspended, or be interrupted. When this happens, the thread leaves the secure world and returns to the XNU kernel context. From there it must be rescheduled back into the secure world by exclave scheduling code in XNU. The thread will continue to be rescheduled into the secure world as necessary until the downcall is completed.</li><li id="9e02">If a secure world thread is panic()ing on a CPU core (which will call on XNU to panic via SPTM), fresh tasks are no longer scheduled into the secure world on other cores and they wait for a timeout period. If everything goes correctly, the waiting threads will never finish their wait. However if the timeout expires, the waiting threads will then … panic() :)</li><li id="de4a">XNU appears to handle all interrupt processing, rather than SK. When XNU is finished handling an interrupt, the interrupted thread is returned to the secure world if it was executing there. Directing interrupts to either the insecure or secure kernel is an ARM TrustZone feature.</li><li id="d706">IPC structures for the downcall are setup with request and response buffers before entering the secure world through the redacted sk_enter() call.</li><li id="c8da">Interrupts and pre-emption are disabled while finalising the IPC request structure and calling sk_enter(). This is because there is only one of these structures <em>per core</em>. I suspect the redacted path travelled after calling sk_enter() and entering the secure world copies the request from the per-cpu structure into secure world memory, and then re-enables interrupts and pre-emption on the core. The alterative would be ugly. A similar process happens in reverse for protecting the per-cpu response structure.</li><li id="2e37">Disconcertingly, the downcall response can come back via a different CPU’s per-core response buffer, as the downcall may have been interrupted, upcalled, or yielded and needed rescheduling.</li><li id="1fdc">Coordination of a thread’s exclave status (to avoid SK re-entry etc) occurs via <em>th_exclaves_state</em> — a bitfield in the thread structure.</li></ol><h2 id="3742">Upcalls — Secure World calls to XNU</h2><p id="102d">A thread running in the secure world due to a downcall may need assistance from XNU and this can be achieved through an upcall to the exclaves upcall handler via the Tightbeam framework. Upcalls are limited to specific functions within XNU. A thread desiring an upcall returns to the insecure world where the specific upcall handler is called. While in this state, the thread cannot return to user mode (for obvious reasons) nor perform another downcall to the secure world, ie it is not allowed to “re-enter” exclaves. Instead the thread will be returned to the secure world at the point where it performed the upcall.</p><p id="b346">Allowed upcalls discovered in the source end up inside the following functions:</p><p id="c245"><strong>Memory<br></strong>exclaves_memory_upcall_alloc(npages, kind, completion);<br>exclaves_memory_upcall_free(pages, npages, kind, completion);</p><p id="e369"><strong>File storage<br></strong>exclaves_storage_upcall_root(exclaveid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_open(fstag, rootid, name, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_close(fstag, fileid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_create(fstag, rootid, name, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_read(fstag, fileid, descriptor, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_write(fstag, fileid, descriptor, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_remove(fstag, rootid, name, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_sync(fstag, op, fileid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_readdir(fstag, fileid, buf, length, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_getsize(fstag, fileid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_sealstate(fstag, completion);</p><p id="6b87"><strong>DriverKit<br></strong>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_register(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_remove(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_enable(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_disable(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_register(id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_remove(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_enable(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_disable(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_set_timeout(id, timer_id, duration,completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_cancel_timeout(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_lock_wl(id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_unlock_wl(id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_async_notification_signal(id, notificationID, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_mapper_activate(id,mapperIndex, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_mapper_deactivate(id, mapperIndex, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_notification_signal(id, mask, completion);</p><p id="df95"><strong>DriverKit Apple Neural Engine<br></strong>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_setpowerstate(id, desiredState, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_worksubmit(id, requestID, taskDescriptorCount, submitTimestamp, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_workbegin(id, requestID, beginTimestamp, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_workend(id, requestID, completion);</p><p id="bda7"><strong>Conclaves<br></strong>exclaves_conclave_upcall_suspend(flags, completion);<br>exclaves_conclave_upcall_stop(flags, completion);<br>exclaves_conclave_upcall_crash_info(shared_buf, length, completion);</p><h2 id="9a54">The XNUProxy</h2><p id="83f9">References to XNUProxy abound, yet I haven’t been able to definitely pin down exactly what and where it is.

By isolating sensitive resources, Apple is shrinking their potential attack surface and reducing the impact of any single kernel compromise. Defending monolithic kernels is a Sisyphean task, and exclaves represent one method of dealing with the challenge — is it the right direction for the long term, or a temporary step? In my dreams, I imagine a future redesign using CHERI and a production implementation of ARM Morello 😊 Regardless, it’s a defensive effort on a larger scale than any other end user device manufacturer is currently attempting.</p><p id="19f9">Critically, this article has not directly examined <em>what</em> is being moved from the kernel into exclaves. Build images indicate they are being used for secure camera/microphone indicators, some Apple Neural Engine functionality, some device drivers, components that talk to the Secure Enclave and so on.

<li>Tesla sales in Germany plunged by 59.5% in January 2025 and 76.3% in February.</li>



<li>In Australia, the EV maker’s deliveries dropped 65.5% in the first two months of 2025.</li>



<li>Tesla’s February 2025 sales in China fell 49.16%, signaling a market share decline.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<p>Tesla was proudly proclaiming less than a year ago that it would be selling 20 million electric vehicles annually by 2030. Fast forward to today, and things have taken a sharp downturn. After seemingly abandoning this lofty goal mid-2024, the company has also seen its first annual sales decline in a decade. Now, Tesla’s sales are continuing to slide in several major markets, including Germany, Australia, and, of course, China.</p>
		
		



<p><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/tesla-sales-plunge-44-in-norway-despite-ev-market-soaring-by-53/">Earlier this week</a>, we reported that <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/tesla/">Tesla</a> sales in Norway collapsed by 44.4% through January and February, despite the country’s overall EV market growing by 53.4%. Things are even worse in Germany. New data from the KBA – Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority – shows that in January 2025, Tesla sales plummeted by 59.5%, with just 1,277 new cars registered in the country.</p>

<p>The situation only worsened in February. Sales were down a staggering 76.3% compared to February 2024, with just 1,429 units sold. Through January and February, Tesla has delivered 2,706 vehicles in <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/germany/">Germany</a>, marking a massive 70.6% drop from the same period last year. Tesla’s decline is even more pronounced when you consider that overall BEV sales in Germany climbed 30.8% in February.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/australia/">Australia</a> isn’t much better. Data from the nation’s Electric Vehicle Council shows that Tesla shifted 1,592 vehicles in February, a massive 71.9% decline from the 5,665 sold in February 2024. Through the first two months of the year, Tesla delivered 2,331 vehicles to Australians, a 65.5% decline from the 6,772 vehicles sold over the same two months in 2024. </p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the highly anticipated, heavily updated Model Y has just started being sold in Australia—though only in the premium (A$73,400) Launch Edition variant, with the standard version still unavailable. So, the sales slump isn’t entirely surprising. </p>



<p>Even so, the outgoing Model Y saw a 55.4% decline, shifting only 924 units. Meanwhile, sales of the refreshed Model 3 are down a dramatic 81.4%, with just 668 cars sold. It seems Australians aren’t quite as eager to embrace the “Tesla dream” as they once were.</p>



<p><strong>Chinese Struggles</strong></p>
		
		



<p>And then there’s <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/china/">China</a>, where things are also looking grim for Tesla in one of its most important markets worldwide. Preliminary data from China’s Passenger Car Association reveals that Tesla built and sold 30,688 vehicles in February 2025—a 49.16% drop from the 60,365 cars moved in February 2024. This total includes both domestic sales and exports, but it’s clear that Tesla’s Chinese market share is shrinking. When you factor in competition from local EV manufacturers, the picture becomes even murkier.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that Tesla’s global growth trajectory has hit some roadblocks. While the company remains a leader in the electric vehicle space, its once-unassailable dominance in key markets is showing signs of distress. Whether it’s product fatigue, the controversial nature of its CEO, market saturation, or just bad timing—especially with the transition surrounding its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, the shine is definitely starting to wear off.</p>

<p>I have noticed something in the past 12 months, something a little profound. I have noticed that I am no longer scared that a project will be too big or too complex for me, or that a project will use a technology or programming language I don’t know.</p>



<p>Things that have normally made me hesitate, were things that required a lot of research, for example I once had to walk away from a project as it required more than 4-layers on a PCB to route out the 484-pin BGA FPGA/processor. Back then each FPGA/processor chip was $50 and the board would have cost me about $200 and 3 weeks to get made, after that I would somehow have to assemble and test it or fork out another $100 for assembly. While I am usually pretty good, the chances of this working first or even second time were pretty low, as high speed circuits can be finicky. And even though the customer offered the use of their test equipment it meant I had to work in Christchurch!</p>



<p>I remember working through the specifications of the project at the time, seeing the 1000+ pages datasheet on the processor, the 200 page errata, the hundreds of posts from developers about issues, and the dozens of other design and programming guides and I just thought to myself, well yes maybe I could do it, but it would probably take 6-9 months and most of that would be study, trial and error, then at the end of it the prospect of using that particular processor on another job would be effectively zero. I walked away.</p>



<p>In another case I had a similar offer to replace a production system at a chemical factory, this was in 2012 and I was at the time full-on with other clients. I did however look at the system and its multitude of simple machine interfaces and, less simple external ERP systems, again totally do-able, but in this case the time I would need to dedicate to write the development would have left me a burnt out wreck. Again I had to walk away.</p>



<p>Fast forward to 2025 and me coming to the end of the longest contract of my career, I re-looked at the timings I had allocated for the above two projects with the better tools and AI available now and realised how much easier everything could have been. Just the other day I dusted off a project I did 14 years ago, a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/01/05/image-sensor-for-filling-wine-bottles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fill level sensor</a> for a bottling machine. A guy wrote to me about five years ago about the project, which at the time was terribly primitive and used none-machine-learning, conventional programming to get levels and trigger an accept/reject action. I told him the sensor was now obsolete and possibly it could be done these days with a camera and a fast ML algorithm but I stopped short of any more information as quite frankly I was out of my depth.</p>



<p>As an experiment this weekend I re-created this system using an RPi5 compute module and a $20 camera sensor plugged into it. Within two hours I wrote my first machine learning, using the AI to assist me and got the camera on a RPi board to read levels of wine in wine bottles on my test rig. The original project took me six weeks solid! I again used the google Gemini 2.0 AI for this assignment and it had no problem explaining every line of code, every library, and every concept, and on the spectrum of AI’s Gemini is not considered the best.</p>



<p>I am now at a real impasse, towards the end of my career and knowing I could happily start it all again with a new insight and much bigger visions for what I could take on. It feels like wining the lottery two weeks before you die 🙂</p>



<p>I am now re-examining some of the other things I often thought were too complex or too far above my abilities for hobby projects, and, so long as I can afford them, give them a go. It is an exciting time to be alive.</p>

Journalists are </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/egg-prices-bird-flu-producers.html" rel="">reporting</a><span> in depth on the industry, egg consolidation has come up in Congressional antitrust </span><a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1889739042847175165" rel="">hearing</a><span>, and Donald Trump mentioned a plan to tackle egg prices in the State of the Union speech, putting his Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on notice that she has to get the price down. Most notably, earlier this week, the Capitol Forum reported the Department of Justice Antitrust Division is now investigating egg markets.</span></p><p><span>The reason is simple. For most Americans, eggs have always been cheap, and thus a key food staple. And now eggs are expensive, and sometimes in shortage. Over the past year egg prices have increased by 53%— </span><a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/retail/2025/02/13/iowans-pinched-by-higher-prices-for-eggs-other-grocery-items-cpi/78218383007/" rel="">jumping</a><span> 15% in January alone. As of the beginning of February, egg producers were charging wholesale buyers an </span><a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/DBEC53E8-A250-3541-9D57-1B36A7ED6B11" rel="">average of $5.95 for a dozen eggs</a><span>, and retailers were charging consumers anywhere </span><a href="https://thelistwire.usatoday.com/lists/average-egg-prices-in-united-states-bird-flu-outbreak/" rel="">between</a><span> </span><a href="https://eggprices.org/national-data" rel="">$4 and $9 a dozen</a><span> — and sometimes even more.</span></p><p>The high prices, and sometimes shortages, are a problem in and of themselves, but they also represent that the American system has gone askew. If we can’t even get a cheap omelet or egg sandwich anymore, what can America do right?</p><p><span>The stated reason for the high price of eggs is something that happens periodically: an avian flu epidemic. Since 2022, outbreaks of bird flu on poultry farms have led to the culling of over </span><a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" rel="">115 million egg-laying hens</a><span>. This epidemic, according to the prevailing narrative, has driven egg prices up to record highs all on its own. As one industry executive </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/business/money-report/why-egg-prices-are-surging-but-chicken-prices-are-falling-its-an-act-of-god-event-says-trade-strategist/3206359/?os=ixglowljw0&amp;ref=app" rel="">put it</a><span>, it’s all just “supply disruption, ‘act of God’ type stuff.” The popular response to this story has been what you’d expect: Scientists are discussing flu vaccines for chickens, politicians are blaming each other about bird culls, and many are concerned about how the massive scale of today’s egg farms enables—and exacerbates—avian flu epidemics. And none of that is necessarily wrong.</span></p><p>But something doesn’t add up about this “avian flu is the sole and natural cause of high egg prices” story. Despite the “act of God” going on — and the skyrocketing prices accompanying it — egg production is actually . . . not down by all that much. 115 million hens is a lot of birds to cull, but it’s important to put the loss of those hens in context: They weren’t lost all at once. They were lost over three years. And there have always been around 300 million other hens alive and kicking to lay eggs for America—not to mention a continuous pipeline of 120-130 million female chicks (called “pullets”) in the process of being raised into adult hens to replace the ones dying or aging out.</p><p>As a result of this pipeline, the effect of avian flu outbreaks on egg production, while not insignificant, has been relatively small. Monthly egg production during each of the last three years has averaged only 3-5% lower than it was in 2021, the year before the epidemic started. Meanwhile, demand for eggs has actually declined. According to private reports by the Egg Industry Center, Americans went from consuming around 206 shell eggs each in 2021 to consuming less than 190 shell eggs each in 2024 — a ~7.5-percent nosedive. As many countries have closed their markets to American eggs since 2021 on account of the avian flu, egg exports have also fallen off a cliff — going down by nearly half between 2021 and 2022 and staying there ever since. That dynamic, according to my analysis of USDA data, has shaved another ~2.5% off aggregate demand on U.S. egg production.</p><p><span>So, reports of an unprecedented egg “shortage” are exaggerated. Nonetheless, egg prices — and egg company profits — have gone through the roof. Cal-Maine Foods — the largest egg producer and the only one that publishes its financial data as a publicly traded company — has been making more money than ever. It’s annual gross profits in the past three years have floated between</span><em><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM_FY25_2Q_Investor_Presentation.pdf" rel=""> </a></em><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM_FY25_2Q_Investor_Presentation.pdf" rel="">3 and 6 times</a><em> </em><span>what it used to earn before the avian flu epidemic started — </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000114036123040882/ny20009586x3_ars.pdf" rel="">breaking $1 billion</a><span> for the first time in the company’s history. All of this extra profit is coming from higher selling prices, which have been earning Cal-Maine </span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM_FY25_2Q_Investor_Presentation.pdf" rel="">unprecedented 70-145 percent margins </a><span>over farm production costs per dozen. Taking Cal-Maine as the “</span><a href="https://www.egg-news.com/Share.aspx?Site_Copy_ID=246541" rel="">bellwether</a><span>” for the industry’s largest firms — as people in the egg business do — we can be pretty confident that the other large egg producers are also raking in profits off the relatively small dip in egg production.</span></p><p><span>High persistent profits are an anomaly for the industry. Historically, egg producers have responded to avian flu epidemics—and the temporary rise in egg prices that often accompanies them—by quickly rebuilding and expanding their flocks of egg-laying hens. “</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3298723?seq=9" rel="">Fowl plagues</a><span>”—as these epidemics used to be called—have been with us since at least the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> century. Most recently, large-scale avian flu epidemics hit egg farms in 2015 and 1983-1984. The egg industry responded to both of these destructive events by sprinting to rebuild and expand the egg-laying hen flock — something which checked price increases and ultimately made sure prices went back to pre-epidemic levels within a reasonable time.</span></p><p><span>As Cal-Maine Foods explained in its </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000114420407044438/v084606_10k.htm" rel="">2007 Annual Report</a><span>: “In the past, during periods of high profitability, shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs, which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance.”</span></p><p><span>For example, immediately after the height of the avian flu epidemic in May 2015, egg producers started adding millions more pullets to their operations each month—ultimately raising 15.3 million more pullets on their farms in 2015 than they did in 2014, and increasing that figure by another 8 million in 2016, according to my analysis of data from monthly USDA/NASS </span><a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/fb494842n?locale=en" rel="">Chicken and Eggs</a><span> reports. Altogether, producers added adult hens to their flocks at a prodigious rate of 4.15 million per month on average from August 2015 through February 2016, replacing nearly all of the hens lost to avian flu within 7 months.</span></p><p><span>As a result, the average wholesale price of eggs landed at $1.65 a dozen that year, only 40 percent higher than it did the year before. By the end of March 2016, monthly </span><a href="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/outlooks/86282/LDPM-282-02.pdf?v=43404" rel="">egg production was higher</a><span> than it was in March 2014 — and egg prices had not only returned to pre-epidemic levels, but were </span><a href="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/outlooks/86282/LDPM-282-02.pdf?v=43404" rel="">dropping even lower</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>This time around, however, that’s not happening. Despite high profits, the egg industry has somehow maintained a stubborn deficit in egg production capacity. Hatcheries — the firms that supply hens to egg producers — have </span><em>throttled</em><span> the pipeline of hens instead of expanding it. According to the Egg Industry Center, the size of the flock of “parent” hens — the hens used by hatcheries to produce layer chicks for egg producers — plummeted from 3.1 million hens in 2021, to 2.9 million in 2022, to 2.5 million hens in 2023 and 2024.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, hatcheries have been hatching significantly fewer parent chicks to replace aging ones — nearly 380,000 (or 12 percent) fewer in 2022 compared to the year before, and even fewer parent chicks in 2023 and 2024 — leaving the parent flock older and more likely to produce eggs that fail to hatch. That could explain why, although hatcheries reported producing 125-200 million more fertilized eggs to the USDA in each of the last three years compared to 2021, the number of eggs they’ve placed in incubators and the number of chicks they’ve hatched from those eggs has either declined or stayed basically steady with 2021 levels in every year since.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png" width="633" height="398" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:398,&quot;width&quot;:633,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:42479,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/158596127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Chart by Basel Musharbash.

When an industry starts profiting more from *not* producing than from producing, it’s a sign that something isn’t right. It could be an innocent bottleneck.

Headquartered a short car trip apart in Cuxhaven, Germany, and Boxmeer, Netherlands, these private firms have systematically gained control over the supply of egg-laying hens to American producers over the past two decades by buying out or suppressing rivals and challengers. Today, no egg producer in this country can expand the number of hens in its flock — or even replace the hens it already has when they age out or die — without the cooperation of this duopoly. And, since the value of hens rises with the price of the eggs, when the price of eggs is high these two barons have a clear interest in keeping the supply of pullets to producers on a tight leash — so the high prices stick.</span></p><p>On the other end of the egg supply chain, you have the largest egg producer in the country and the world, Cal-Maine Foods.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

If a producer gets out of line and responds to high prices with flock expansions or discounting practices that Cal-Maine doesn’t approve of, Cal-Maine can flood the market with eggs—depressing prices for everyone while capturing market share for itself. As a publicly-traded company with a low cost of capital from Wall Street, Cal-Maine can live with low egg prices for a long time. Not so for most of the 60 or so family-owned producers who make up the rest of the egg industry; they’re actual businesses that need to turn a profit.</span></p><p><span>The power wielded by these dominant firms — EW Group, Hendrix, and Cal-Maine — is not theoretical. Just last year, a federal jury found that, shortly after Cal-Maine rose to dominance in the late 1990s, its executives took over the leadership of a longstanding industry association called the United Egg Producers (UEP) and turned it into a cartel, the equivalent of what the presiding judge analogized to a “</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305.713.0_5.pdf" rel="">mob boss</a><span>” for the industry. </span></p><p><span>Shortly after, other major egg producers that had long resisted joining the UEP — like Rose Acre Farms — gave up their independence and entered the UEP’s fold, until it finally represented producers accounting for more than 90% of the country’s egg supply. Cal-Maine’s executives then used the association as a “bullhorn” to “</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305.713.0_5.pdf" rel="">bark out orders</a><span>” at egg producers and “coordinate a conspiracy” to restrict the supply of eggs in the United States through a variety of strategies — including throttling the replacement of hens lost to mortality and a fake “animal welfare” program designed to reduce overall flock numbers rather than improve hen’s lives.</span></p><p><span>An economist who helped plan the UEP cartel </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305.73.17.pdf" rel="">summed up</a><span> the economic rationale behind it pretty simply: “More hens, less income!” And the conspiracy’s results proved he was right. Wholesale egg prices reached unprecedented heights over the course of the 2000s and then never came back down — settling around a new, higher focal point 50 to 100 percent higher than the pre-conspiracy level for the next decade. Something similar could be happening with the current avian flu epidemic. Indeed, the new focal point appears to be already here: There was an argument that wholesale egg prices “collapsed” in 2023. In reality, they were on average 75% higher than wholesale egg prices before the epidemic’s onset in 2022.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png" width="1456" height="815" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:466622,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/158596127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Chart by Basel Musharbash.

So let’s start with how the big fluffy omelet became so Americana.</span></p><p><strong>America as a Land of Egg Plenty</strong></p><p>Producing an egg seems simple. An “old McDonald had a farm” kind of farmer breeds a lovely hen, grows it to adulthood, has it lay eggs, puts those eggs in a crate, and sends that crate to a grocery store in return for a negotiated price. And that’s basically how the industry worked until the middle of the 20th century. The essentials of that story remained on point, but the components were split up among a series of specialized operations.</p><p>If you abstract out what the egg farmer used to do all by himself, you get all the layers of the modern egg supply chain. First, as discussed above, there are breeders, who manage chicken genetics and produce “parent stock,” or the stock of birds that are mated to produce the fertilized eggs that become table-egg laying hens. Second, there are hatcheries, who buy parent stock from breeders, mate them to produce fertilized eggs, incubate their eggs to hatch table-egg laying chicks, and then grow the chicks into hens. Third, there are egg producers, who buy table-egg laying chicks or hens from the hatcheries and use them to produce eggs (some producers also buy fertilized eggs from hatcheries and incubate them in-house). Fourth, there are the various distributors and processors who buy eggs from producers. And finally, there are market makers who survey buyers and sellers for information about egg prices and other market data points, and use that information to publish regular benchmarks for the market value of eggs.</p><p>So, to understand the story behind egg prices, we shouldn’t think about “the egg industry” or the “egg market” but a series of linked industries and markets — starting from the breeders and hatcheries, running through the egg producers and the egg buyers, all the way to the market makers — the end result of which is the carton of eggs on the shelf. To get there, we have to start eighty years ago, when egg production was revolutionized by new technologies and techniques, and the modern egg supply chain was born.</p><p>In 1942, New Deal-era Secretary of Agriculture, and then Vice President, Henry A. Wallace built a new model for producing eggs. It was based on creating better birds through the “hybridization” of chicken, which is the crossing of two or more pure breeds of chicken to create a “hybrid” chicken with specific qualities. The resulting hens laid more or better eggs, required less feed, and were more adapted to specific production systems. After Wallace developed them, cross-breeding methods were shared with small breeders around the country through United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) extension offices at land grant colleges, which conducted basic research into the field and made breeding know-how and pure-bred stocks available to the public. Within a few years, dozens of other “primary breeders” emerged, creating a dynamic chicken genetics industry with many local and regional players.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png" width="977" height="757" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:757,&quot;width&quot;:977,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:703527,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/158596127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>In 1940, FDR named Henry A.

The hatcheries bought “parent stock” for branded strains of chicken from the primary breeders, mated them to produce fertilized eggs, incubated the eggs until they hatched, and then sold the resulting chicks and young hens (called “pullets”) to farmers, which raised them into mature hens and then used them to produce eggs. As farmers got to know the different hybrid chicken brands, they selected among them for productivity and other characteristics that suited their production systems — creating a virtuous feedback loop.</p><p><span>Soon, these developments led to a revolution in egg production both at home and around the world. The number of eggs laid per hen in the United States increased by almost </span><a href="https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/a27d90a4-042a-4230-964a-584f6dc75f90/content" rel="">44% between 1940 and 1955</a><span> — more, in relative terms, than it would increase over the next four decades combined. Hybrid hens originating from the United States were soon introduced around the world, leading to a rapid expansion in global egg production—not to mention the explosion in cheap American diners dotting the new highway systems being built.</span></p><p>In tandem with the mid-century revolution in chicken breeding, there was a revolution in egg production systems. Poultry science departments at land-grant colleges engaged in continual field testing and production research to develop new equipment and systems for egg farmers, ultimately developing critical technologies like large-scale incubators to hatch eggs on a schedule, fine-sand blowers to clean eggs without breaking shells, and caged-rearing systems to mechanize feeding, watering, and egg-collection in their hen houses.</p><p><span>Although these innovations gave rise to some efficiencies of scale at the farm level and enabled the rise of factory-style hatcheries and egg production facilities, the industry as a whole remained highly decentralized at every stage of production and distribution well into the late 1970s. As late as 1978, most producers were still small, and most egg production still took place on farms with </span><a href="https://agcensus.library.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/1978-United_States-CHAPTER_1_State_Data-181-Table-18.pdf" rel="">fewer than 50,000 hens</a><span>. There were just </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0811-3_49" rel="">34 “big” egg companies with 1 million or more egg-laying hens each</a><span>, and they accounted for only 27% of annual egg production.</span></p><p>Undergirding this system was law: Antitrust enforcement prevented the largest breeders, hatcheries, and egg producers from growing by serial acquisitions or by handicapping their rivals’ access to customers or suppliers. For similar reasons, the markets into which egg producers sold their eggs—packers, retailers, processors, wholesalers, and institutions—also remained open and competitive, offering a wide diversity of potential buyers to egg producers of various sizes in every region of the country.</p><p><span>Because of the openness of the egg industry and the abundance of small producers with excess capacity, there was almost always a significant surplus of eggs in the country. When that surplus narrowed (whether because of long-term population growth or a sudden crisis, like an avian flu epidemic), elevated egg prices invited rapid expansions in egg output from new and existing producers that quickly brought prices back down. For example, during the </span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1349329?seq=2" rel="">avian flu epidemic of 1983-1984</a><span>, producers had to cull tens of millions of layer hens and other birds, including nearly every chicken in Pennsylvania. But retail egg prices rose by just 66 percent over a few months — and promptly fell just as </span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1349329?seq=2" rel="">sharply over the next few months</a><span> as producers quickly replaced the hens they’d lost.</span></p><p><span>“Eggs,” </span><a href="https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/303075/files/nc-117-028.pdf___.YzJ1OmFlbHBlY29ub21pY2xpYmVydGllczpjOm86OGI0OTBiMDZkMmIxZmFlNTlkODZhYzY5MmEzODZjNjg6NjpiOGYyOmExMjQ1NWJhNGFmMjk3NmY3NDQ0NGNmMzQ4ODhjZDdmY2JmZTc1YjkxNTU4ZWYxYTk1YTdjZWYwYWRmZjRlMjk6cDpUOk4" rel="">said</a><span> a prominent agricultural economist in 1978, “will be processed and produced in this country if there is a fair return on investment. When the return [on eggs] becomes high,” he continued, “there will be expansion of production that will reduce prices.” And that was actually true: Higher prices routinely led farmers to get into the egg business to make money, and that in turn regularly reset the market with more supply. Price spikes were short-lived. Shortages were unheard of. America was a land of egg plenty.</span></p><p>Then, everything changed. </p><p><em><span>Stay tuned for part two of Hatching a Conspiracy, which will come next week.

    </div><p>A team of engineers and physicists at Southern University of Science and Technology, in China, has created a nickel-based material that behaves as a superconductor above the -233°C (40 K) threshold under ambient pressure. In their study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08755-z" target="_blank">published</a> in <i>Nature</i>, the researchers synthesized thin films of bilayer nickelate (La₂.₈₅Pr₀.₁₅Ni₂O₇) and found one that behaved as a high-temperature superconductor.</p>


										      
																					<p>The -233°C threshold (40 K), often associated with the McMillan limit, marks a boundary beyond which conventional superconductivity theories become less predictive.</p>
<p>Scientists have been searching for a room-temperature superconductor that could revolutionize a wide range of technologies. The ability to achieve superconductivity without the need for costly and complex cooling systems would significantly reduce energy loss due to heat conversion in electrical transmission, leading to dramatic improvements in efficiency and cost reduction. This breakthrough could lead to advancements in numerous fields, including maglev trains, fusion reactors and MRI machine components. This new effort by the team in China represents another step in reaching the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Until now, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/high-temperature+superconductors/" rel="tag">high-temperature superconductors</a> have primarily been based on copper and iron compounds, while nickelate superconductors required high-pressure conditions to function.</p>
<p>The newly discovered high-temperature nickelate superconductor emerged from the team's experiments with epitaxially grown bilayer nickelate thin films. Their work was part of a long-term project geared toward finding high-temperature superconductors based on nickel. The current research had been running for three years and involved growing nickelates with controlled rare-earth metal substitutions and precise oxygen content.</p>
<p>For this latest successful effort, the team substituted a portion of lanthanum with praseodymium in the nickelate structure. Testing showed it transitioned to a superconductor at approximately -228°C.</p>
<p>The research team suggests their development of a nickel-based, high-temperature superconductor is likely to open the door to other possibilities, some nickel-based and others based on other metals. It might also help in research dedicated to understanding why some materials can transition into superconductors.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A 38-strong group of tech players have founded a project with the snappy name Digital Autonomy with RISC-V in Europe, aka DARE, that aims to develop processor units to power the continent’s supercomputers and other high-performance machines.</p>
<p>If you're having deja vu, you're not alone: Europe has been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/17/europes_exascale_supercomputer_chips/">talking about</a> and toying with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/08/riscv_hpc/">using RISC-V</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/24/european_processor_initiative_phase_one_concludes/">supercomputing</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/08/eu_chip_projects/">some years</a>, even getting far as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/22/first_riscv_epi_chip/">some silicon</a>, though turned to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/sipearl_rhea1_specs/">Arm's architecture</a> for its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/09/16/thinking-outside-of-the-box-with-the-jupiter-supercomputer-datacenter/">first exascale</a> system. The continent hasn't given up on RISC-V, though, certainly not with America in the state it's in.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dare-riscv.eu/launch-of-dare-sga1-project/">DARE project</a> is supported by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and coordinated by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS). The project aims to create three chiplets – individual chip dies that can be combined to form complete processor packages – and has already picked leaders for each effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>A vector-math accelerator die tuned for high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, led by Barcelona-based chip designer Openchip</li>

<li>A next-gen inference chiplet from Dutch startup Axelera AI</li>

<li>A general-purpose processor die, driven by Germany's Codasip</li>
</ol>
<p>"DARE is daring to start from the top of the technological complexity pole and produce European-designed processors chips for supercomputers, paving the way for Europe's digital sovereignty," Osman Unsal, DARE principal investigator at BNC-CNS, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The first phase of this six-year endeavor is backed by €240 million (£200 million, $260 million) in funding. DARE has given itself the goal of developing the three above-mentioned RISC-V chiplets in three years.</p>

    

<p>Axelera AI, which says it’s been <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.axelera.ai/news/axelera-ai-secures-up-to-61-million-grant-to-develop-scalable-ai-chiplet-for-high-performance-computing">awarded</a> €61.6 million (£52 million, $65 million) in funding from EuroHPC, appears to be the furthest along on its journey toward creating a datacenter-class RISC-V chip. While most of its current lineup is focused on running AI models at the network edge, we're told its upcoming Titania chiplet will be designed for server-grade workloads.</p>

        


        

<p>On the surface, Axelera's chips follow a similar formula as other AI ASICs, such as Google's tensor processing units. The Dutch outfit's current silicon feature four accelerator cores, each with a matrix multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit, a RISC-V control core to make the accelerator programmable, and some digital signal processors which handle neural network activation functions.</p>
<p>Like some other designs we've seen on the market, these MAC units, which are responsible for the bulk of today's AI processing, are embedded in a pool of SRAM enabling efficient streaming and crunching of matrices through the chips; it's classic in-memory processing you see more and more these days.</p>

        

<p>CEO Fabrizio Del Maffeo told <em>El Reg</em> Axelera's arrangement of its MAC units allows its quad-core AI processing units to achieve more than 200 INT8 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance while consuming just 15-20 watts of power.</p>
<p>The forthcoming Titania will take this same basic formula but scale it up, with more processing cores on-die and multi-die system-in-package designs.</p>
<p>Codasip already offers several 32-bit embedded-class and 64-bit application-grade RISC-V CPU cores, which appear to be aimed at network edge, IoT, and modest personal computing devices. In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://codasip.com/press-release/2025/03/06/codasip-selected-to-design-a-high-end-risc-v-processor-for-the-eu-funded-dare-project/">press release</a>, the biz said the DARE project would provide it the resources to extend its portfolio to include high performance applications including "AI, big data processing, and supercomputing."</p>

<p>While RISC-V is open and permissively licensed, American lawmakers have sometimes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/07/proposed_restrictions_riscv/">called</a> for the US to prevent China's access to the tech. ®</p>

<p dir="auto">The framework includes a comprehensive example (<code>examples/simplified_agent_communication.py</code>) that demonstrates four key capabilities. This example shows in detail how the Evolving Agents Framework creates, manages, and evolves AI agents to handle real-world tasks.</p>

<p dir="auto">Before running the main example, we need to set up an initial library of agents and tools:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python examples/setup_simplified_agent_library.py"><pre>python examples/setup_simplified_agent_library.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This script creates a foundation of BeeAI-compatible agents and tools:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>DocumentAnalyzer Tool</strong>: A real BeeAI tool that uses an LLM to analyze documents and identify their type</li>
<li><strong>AgentCommunicator Tool</strong>: A real BeeAI tool that facilitates communication between agents</li>
<li><strong>SpecialistAgent</strong>: A BeeAI agent specialized in detailed document analysis</li>
<li><strong>CoordinatorAgent</strong>: A BeeAI agent that orchestrates the document processing workflow</li>

<p dir="auto">The first part of the example demonstrates how the System Agent intelligently decides whether to reuse, evolve, or create a new agent based on semantic similarity:</p>

invoice_agent_result = await system_agent.decide_and_act(

    record_type=&quot;AGENT&quot;

<p dir="auto">The System Agent implements a sophisticated decision mechanism:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If similarity ≥ 0.8: Reuse an existing agent/tool</li>
<li>If 0.4 ≤ similarity &lt; 0.8: Evolve an existing agent/tool</li>
<li>If similarity &lt; 0.4: Create a new agent/tool</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In the example, when we ask for an invoice analysis agent, it creates a new one. When we ask for a medical record analyzer, it evolves the existing SpecialistAgent (since it has a similarity score of around 0.46).</p>

<p><em>Look at you! On your phone! But you’ve got a secret! And you won’t tell! You’re not on your phone! It is only as if you were on your phone! You’re just pretending to be on your phone! On your phone!</em></p>

<p><em>It is as if you were on your phone</em> is an <em>almost speculative</em> game about an <em>incredibly near future</em> in which we’re all simultaneously under significant pressure to be on our phones all the time, but also to not be on our phones all the time. Our fingers want to touch the screen, our eyes want to watch the surface, our brains want to be occupied efficiently and always. But it’s also exhausting liking photos, swiping profiles, watching short-form video, and everything else we’re always doing. <em>It is as if you were on your phone</em> presents an alternative: <em>pretend</em> to be on your phone so that you pass as human, but actually do essentially nothing instead. Follow the prompts and be free.</p>

<p>The Donald Trump administration has cut off vital support for F-16 jamming capabilities.</p>

<p>The United States, having decided to end its support for Ukraine, cannot simply turn off the Ukrainian Air Force’s U.S.-designed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unian.net/world/f-16-dlya-ukrainy-aviaekspert-nazval-veroyatnuyu-prichinu-zaderzhki-postavki-belgiyskih-istrebiteley-12937956.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F-16</a>&nbsp;fighters . But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/03/07/france-to-the-rescue-french-made-mirage-2000-jets-could-become-ukraines-most-important-aerial-radar-jammers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">However, as Forbes</a>&nbsp;analyst David Ax writes&nbsp;, the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.</p>



<p>As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.</p>



<p>But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.</p>



<p>However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.</p>



<p>The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.</p>



<p>“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.</p>



<p>Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.</p>



<p>In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">
  <p>
    Published 08 Mar, 2025 by Louis Pilfold
  </p>
<p>Gleam is a type-safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v1.9.0">v1.9.0</a> has been published. Let’s
take a look!</p>

<h2 id="echo-debug-printing">Echo debug printing</h2>

<p>There are debuggers you can use with Gleam, however the most popular ways
to understand the runtime behaviour of a Gleam program is through writing tests
and through print debugging.</p>

<p>The standard library function <code>io.debug</code> is most commonly used for print
debugging. It takes a value of any type, uses target specific runtime
reflection to turn it into a string of Gleam syntax, and then prints it to
standard-error. This works well, but there are some ways in which this function
is not optimal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions don’t know anything about where they are called from, so it’s not
possible to print the location of the <code>io.debug</code> call along with the value
being printed.</li>
  <li>There’s no way for the compiler or build tool to know this is a special
function which is only for debugging, so they are unable to prevent you from
accidentally publishing packages that still have debug code in them.</li>
  <li>Runtime reflection is used to make a string representation of the value, so
any information that no longer exists after compile time cannot be used. This
results in <code>io.debug</code> relying on heuristics to decide how to show the value,
and this can be at-times incorrect.</li>
</ul>

<p>To improve on this the <code>echo</code> keyword has been introduced. Prefix an expression
with it and the value will be printed to standard-error, along with the path to
the file and line containing the echo expression, so you can click to jump to it
in your editor.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn main() {
  echo [1, 2, 3]
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can also be used in pipelines. Here the list returned by the first <code>list.map</code>
call will be printed.</p>

<pre><code>pub fn main() {
  [1, 2, 3]
  |&gt; list.map(fn(x) { x + 1 })
  |&gt; echo
  |&gt; list.map(fn(x) { x * 2 })
}
</code></pre>

<p>The build tool is aware this is for debugging, so it’ll let you know if you
forget to remove it before publishing a package for others to use.</p>

<p>Currently it uses the same runtime reflection and heuristics to format the
output, but in future it’ll be enhanced to make use of the compiler’s static
analysis.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>! We had all
manner of annoying CI-related problems when implementing the integration tests
for this feature, Jak’s a very patient and determined programmer indeed!</p>

<h2 id="git-dependencies">Git dependencies</h2>

<p>There are times when we wish to try out early prototype versions of libraries we
have made in our applications. It may be tempting to publish these unfinished
packages to the package manager, but this would be inappropriate! Only
production-ready packages should be published for other people to use, the Gleam
package ecosystem is to be high quality and easy to depend upon safely.</p>

<p>As a more suitable alternative the build tool now supports depending on packages
within git repositories. Add the git or HTTP URL of a repository along with a
tag, branch, or commit SHA, and the build tool will download it for you and then
treat it like a regular Gleam dependency package.</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
gleam_stdlib = { git = "https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib.git", ref = "957b83b" }
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/GearsDatapacks">Surya Rose</a> for this much
anticipated feature.</p>

<h2 id="more-powerful-bit-arrays-on-javascript">More powerful bit arrays on JavaScript</h2>

<p>Gleam’s bit array syntax allows you to construct and parse binary data in a way
that may be easier to understand than using binary operators. Historically bit
arrays had to be byte aligned, meaning they had to have a number of bits that
was divisible by 8. <a href="https://github.com/richard-viney">Richard Viney</a> has done
some incredible work and lifted this limitation. Thank you Richard!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GearsDatapacks">Surya Rose</a> has also been lifting
JavaScript bit array restrictions, enabling the usage of dynamically sized
segments in bit array patterns. Thank you Surya!</p>

<h2 id="faster-list-pattern-matching-on-javascript">Faster list pattern matching on JavaScript</h2>

<p>The list type is one of Gleam’s primary data structures, it is used very heavily
in Gleam programs. <a href="https://github.com/yoshi-monster">yoshi~</a> has been working
hard to identify potential performance optimisations for the virtual-DOM
implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre">Lustre</a> framework,
and in the process they identified a way to improve the JavaScript code we
generate when pattern matching on lists.</p>

<p>Programs that compile to JavaScript and make heavy use of list prefix patterns
may now be up to twice as fast!</p>

<h2 id="go-to-type-definition">Go-to type definition</h2>

<p>Gleam’s built-in language server brings IDE-like functionality to all editors
that support the language server protocol. It has had support for go-to
definition for some time, but with this release <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>
has added support for go-to type definition. Place your cursor on an expression
and trigger the feature and the language server will identify the types of all
the values used in the expression and present their definitions for you to view
and to jump to. Thank you Jak!</p>

<h2 id="hexdocs-search-integration">HexDocs search integration</h2>

<p>When a Gleam package is published HTML documentation is generated and published
to HexDocs for users to read. HexDocs have been improving their search
functionality to search for types and functions with in packages themselves, and 
<a href="https://github.com/diemogebhardt">Diemo Gebhardt</a> has updated Gleam’s
documentation generator to implement the search index interface so Gleam
packages are included in the search. Thank you Diemo!</p>

<p>Another option for searching within Gleam packages is <a href="https://gloogle.run/search?q=fn(Int,%20Int)%20-%3E%20Order">Gloogle</a>,
a Gleam community project, which can even search by function type signature.</p>

<h2 id="custom-ca-certificates-support">Custom CA certificates support</h2>

<p>Some enterprise networks may perform TLS interception for security reasons. In
these environments custom CA certificates must be used as otherwise requests
will get TLS errors due to the unknown authority of the injected certificates.</p>

<p>The new <code>GLEAM_CACERTS_PATH</code> environment variable can be used to specify a
path to CA certificates for Gleam to use when interacting with the Hex package
manager servers, making Gleam usable in these enterprise environments.
Thank you <a href="https://github.com/winstxnhdw">winstxnhdw</a>!</p>

<h2 id="convert-to-and-from-pipeline-code-actions">Convert to and from pipeline code actions</h2>

<p>Gleam’s much-loved pipe syntax gives programmers another way to write nested
function calls so that they read top-to-botton and left-to-right.</p>

<p>Two new language server code actions have been added to help you refactor
between the pipe syntax and regular function call syntax. Triggering them on
these two code examples will edit your code to match the other.</p>

<pre><code>import gleam/list

pub fn main() {
  list.map([1, 2, 3], double)
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>import gleam/list

pub fn main() {
  [1, 2, 3] |&gt; list.map(double)
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also choose to pipe arguments other than the first by selecting them in
your editor before triggering the code action. Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>!</p>

<h2 id="generate-json-encoder-code-action">Generate JSON encoder code action</h2>

<p>Many Gleam programs make use of JSON, a common text-based data exchange format.
With this release the Gleam language server now offers a code action to generate
a function to convert a type into JSON using the <code>gleam_json</code> library. Given
this type definition:</p>

<pre><code>pub type Person {
  Person(name: String, age: Int)
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the code action is triggered on the type definition this function will be
generated:</p>

<pre><code>import gleam/json

fn encode_person(person: Person) -&gt; json.Json {
  json.object([
    #("name", json.string(person.name)),
    #("age", json.int(person.age)),
  ])
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/GearsDatapacks">Surya Rose</a> for this code action!</p>

<h2 id="inline-variable-code-action">Inline variable code action</h2>

<p>The Gleam language server now offers a code action that will inline a variable
that is used only once.</p>

<pre><code>import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  let greeting = "Hello!"
  io.println(greeting)
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the code action is triggered on the <code>greeting</code> variable the code will be
edited like so:</p>

<pre><code>import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  io.println("Hello!")
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/GearsDatapacks">Surya Rose</a>!</p>

<h2 id="generate-multi-variant-decoder-code-action">Generate multi-variant decoder code action</h2>

<p>Gleam’s <code>Dynamic</code> type represents data of unknown shape that comes from outside
of the Gleam program, for example data sent to a HTTP server as JSON. To convert
data from dynamic into known Gleam types the decoder API is used.</p>

<p>A previous release added convenient a code action which would generate a dynamic
decoder for a given type definition. With this release this code action has been
extended to support multi-variant custom types. For example, given this type
definition:</p>

<pre><code>pub type Person {
  Adult(age: Int, job: String)
  Child(age: Int, height: Float)
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the code action is triggered on it then this function will be generated:</p>

<pre><code>import gleam/dynamic/decode

fn person_decoder() -&gt; decode.Decoder(Person) {
  use variant &lt;- decode.field("type", decode.string)
  case variant {
    "adult" -&gt; {
      use age &lt;- decode.field("age", decode.int)
      use job &lt;- decode.field("job", decode.string)
      decode.success(Adult(age:, job:))
    }
    "child" -&gt; {
      use age &lt;- decode.field("age", decode.int)
      use height &lt;- decode.field("height", decode.float)
      decode.success(Child(age:, height:))
    }
    _ -&gt; decode.failure(todo as "Zero value for Person", "Person")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/GearsDatapacks">Surya Rose</a>!</p>

<h2 id="string-interpolate-code-action">String interpolate code action</h2>

<p>The language server now offers a convenient code action to interpolate a value
into a string easily. If the cursor is inside a literal string the language
server will offer to split it:</p>

<pre><code>"wibble | wobble"
//      ^ Triggering the action with the cursor
//        here will produce this:
"wibble " &lt;&gt; todo &lt;&gt; " wobble"
</code></pre>

<p>And if the cursor is selecting a valid Gleam name, the language server will
offer to interpolate it as a variable:</p>

<pre><code>"wibble wobble woo"
//      ^^^^^^ Triggering the code action if you're
//             selecting an entire name, will produce this:
"wibble " &lt;&gt; wobble &lt;&gt; " woo"
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a> for this!</p>

<h2 id="module-qualifier-hovering">Module qualifier hovering</h2>

<p>The language server can now show documentation for a module when hovering the
module qualifier of an imported type or value. Thank you <a href="https://github.com/GearsDatapacks">Surya Rose</a>!</p>

<h2 id="redundant-function-capture-removal">Redundant function capture removal</h2>

<p>Gleam’s function capture syntax is a shorthand for creating an anonymous
function that takes one argument and calls another function with that argument
and some other values. These two expressions are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>let double = fn(number) { int.double(number, 2) }
let double = int.double(_, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>If the function capture syntax is used without any additional arguments, then it
is redundant and does nothing that referring the function directly wouldn’t do.</p>

<pre><code>let print = io.print(_)
</code></pre>

<p>The Gleam code formatter will now remove the redundant function capture syntax
for you, formatting it like so:</p>

<pre><code>let print = io.print
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/giacomocavalieri">Giacomo Cavalieri</a>!</p>

<!--more--><p>In 2001, after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center upended American travel, layoffs rippled through the airline industry.</p>
<p>By late September, ~81k jobs had been cut industry-wide. Nearly everyone made cuts, from bargain carriers like Frontier and Spirit to heavyweights like American, US Airways, and United, which each laid off between 15%-23% of their workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lone holdout was Southwest Airlines.</p>
<p>It delayed purchases of new planes and nixed a renovation of its corporate headquarters, but it didn’t enact layoffs. Co-founder and former CEO <strong>Herb Kelleher</strong> saw them as anathema for a successful company.</p>
<p>“Nothing kills your company’s culture like layoffs,” Kelleher <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/646570238/?match=1&amp;terms=%22southwest%22%20and%20%22no%20layoffs%22"><span>once said</span></a>.</p>
<p>If that’s true, then company culture has experienced an economy-wide massacre in recent years:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In 2023, more than 1k tech companies laid off <strong>264k</strong> employees, <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/"><span>according to layoffs.fyi</span></a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The federal government <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/28/hes-tracked-tech-firings-since-the-pandemic-now-hes-keeping-doges-body-count/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><span>has cut</span></a> <strong>~110k</strong> jobs this year through layoffs, firings, and deferred resignations, including <strong>30k+</strong> jobs as part of Elon Musk’s Department of Governmental Efficiency.</li>
<li aria-level="1">BP, BlackRock, IBM, Meta, Starbucks, Workday, and many other big firms <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/recent-company-layoffs-laying-off-workers-2025#southwest-airlines-16"><span>have announced</span></a> layoffs so far in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even Southwest joined the club, announcing mass layoffs for the first time in over 50 years in February. Kelleher wasn’t around to see them. He died in 2019.</p>

<p><em>Herb Kelleher addresses stockholders. (David Woo/Corbis via Getty Images)</em></p>
<p>Research has consistently shown he was right about layoffs: They’re damaging to companies — especially when done for cost-cutting purposes; they’re damaging to laid off employees, who’ve <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3423193/"><span>seen</span></a> higher rates of suicide in the aftermath of layoffs; and they’re damaging to the employees who keep their jobs.</p>
<p>So why do companies keep doing them?</p>
<h4>Neutron Jack and Chainsaw Al</h4>
<p>Once upon a time, US businesses had far more people who thought like Herb Kelleher.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 20th century, as America entered an era of unprecedented prosperity, influential companies <a href="https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/51/democratic-capitalisms-future/"><span>practiced a form of capitalism</span></a> that balanced profits with employee welfare and the public good. Seasonal employees got axed at times, but mass layoffs were relatively rare, as workers routinely stayed at a single company for much of their career.</p>
<p>Things <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580324?origin=crossref#metadata_info_tab_contents"><span>changed</span></a> starting around the 1980s. As companies sought to rebound from a nationwide economic funk, they began practicing a more rough-and-tumble capitalism that prized shareholder value and ushered in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mo-harsh-work-history-20130405-story.html"><span>a “free agent” model of employment</span></a>. Celebrity CEOs like <strong>“Neutron” Jack Welch</strong> and<strong> “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap</strong> popularized a style of management predicated on reducing costs to produce short-term profits.</p>

<p>One of their favorite tools was mass layoffs.</p>
<p>Welch, who ran General Electric, laid off more than <strong>100k</strong> employees during his 20-year tenure. Every fiscal year, he’d rank workers and slash <strong>the bottom 10%</strong>. Dunlap’s strategy was to cut quickly and deeply — and ask questions later.</p>
<p>“My philosophy is to err on the side of too much,” Dunlap wrote in his memoir, <em>Mean Business</em>. “Too many asset sales. Too many layoffs.”</p>
<p>Plenty of corporations followed their example:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In 1979, roughly <strong>5%</strong> of Fortune 100 companies <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/layoffs-that-dont-break-your-company"><span>had layoffs</span></a>, according to McMaster University professor Art Budros.</li>
<li aria-level="1">By 1994, that number had increased to <strong>45%</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Olivia Heller/The Hustle</em></p>
<p>“All of a sudden,”<strong> David Gelles</strong>, author of the Welch biography <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Broke-Capitalism-America-ebook/dp/B09JPKVQV2"><em><span>The Man Who Broke Capitalism</span></em></a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/01/1101505691/short-term-profits-and-long-term-consequences-did-jack-welch-break-capitalism"><span>told NPR</span></a>, “other CEOs saw that…if we rapidly wind down the cost of our labor, we could potentially see a meaningful increase in earnings per share for the next quarter and Wall Street sure liked that.”</p>
<p>That ethos remains today. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that <strong>1.5m-2m </strong>Americans are typically laid off or discharged every month, a number that increases during recessions.</p>
<p>But the belief that company earnings and stock prices increase through layoffs typically doesn’t match reality.</p>
<h4>Layoffs equal dwindling stock prices and bankruptcy risks</h4>
<p>At best, research indicates that companies that lay off employees, on average, don’t see a better financial payoff in the long term compared to companies with a stable employment base.</p>
<p>And they often fare worse. There are findings that <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/layoffs-that-dont-break-your-company"><span>suggest</span></a> layoffs lead to both short-term <em>and</em> long term issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Neutral or negative immediate returns in stock prices.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Declines in profitability that last for up to three years.</li>
<li aria-level="1">A 2x as likely chance of bankruptcy compared to companies that haven’t done layoffs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even during bad economies, when layoffs are rampant and often more justified, the results are similar — and that’s according to Bain &amp; Company, which, ironically, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-hired-bain-before-mark-zuckerberg-year-of-efficiency-layoffs-2023-8"><span>consults</span></a> for firms that make cuts. After the early-2000s dotcom bust, Bain researchers <a href="https://hbr.org/2002/04/look-before-you-lay-off"><span>found</span></a> that stock prices for S&amp;P 500 companies that had no layoffs or laid off less than 3% of their workforce increased an average of <strong>9%</strong> in the next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stock prices were flat in companies that laid off between 3%-10% of their workers, and prices plummeted <strong>38%</strong> for companies that laid off more than 10%.</p>

<p><em>Laid off tech workers network at a “Pink Slip Party” in San Francisco after the dotcom bust in 2001. (David McNew/Newsmakers via Getty Images)</em></p>
<p>Some of these issues stem from the fact that a company that does layoffs is typically in distressed shape already. But experts have found several other reasons for why layoffs lead to negative results:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Mass layoffs are often symptoms of unsound business strategies and don’t do anything to cure the larger problem.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Absent significant strategy changes, productivity declines with fewer employees.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Companies routinely replace laid off employees (who often receive severance) with expensive consultants or hire contractors for similar wages, reducing the cost savings.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Companies must invest to train current workers to pick up new tasks — and invest to recruit replacement employees after the economy improves or the company’s financial troubles clear up.</li>
</ul>
<p>As they recruit, these companies often find their reputation has been damaged among potential applicants, says <strong>Wayne Cascio</strong>, a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado Denver who’s researched layoffs for decades. “If they have two offers and one is with a company that just had layoffs last year and another one is with a company that hasn’t had layoffs, which one are you going to pick?”</p>
<p>Plus, the employees who survive layoffs grow discontent with the company and burn out faster as they handle more tasks, Cascio adds, leading to expensive voluntary worker exits.</p>
<p>Layoffs don’t <em>always</em> portend future problems: Companies who enact them as part of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277473996_Financial_consequences_of_employment-change_decisions_in_major_US_corporations"><span>a broader change in strategy</span></a>, Cascio says, fare better than those who enact them simply to cut costs.</p>
<p>It’s also true that recent layoffs among some tech brands <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-layoffs-stock-market-reaction-meta-spotify-wall-street-investors-2024-2"><span>have been accompanied</span></a> by positive reactions from investors:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Spotify’s stock went up by <strong>7.5%</strong> immediately after layoffs in 2023.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Meta’s stock <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-02/mark-zuckerberg-gains-record-12-5-billion-wealth-in-a-day-as-meta-rebounds?sref=3Ac2yX40"><span>increased</span></a> <strong>23%</strong> when Mark Zuckerberg announced his “year of efficiency” in early 2023, and its stock has soared by ~4x since then (although layoff news in 2024 and earlier this year led to brief drops.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tech layoffs fit into a category that Cascio describes as <strong>proactive downsizing</strong>. The companies were relatively healthy but realized they’d hired too much during the pandemic or saw signs of struggles down the road that they believed they could avoid with restructuring.</p>

<p><em>Olivia Heller/The Hustle</em></p>
<p>Still, says <strong>Jeffrey Pfeffer,</strong> a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor and expert on organizational behavior, “the tech layoffs make no sense to me.” He attributes some of them to a contagion effect that led to companies enacting layoffs simply because everyone else did it.</p>
<p>And if overhiring or underperformance was the true problem, Pfeffer says the companies should question their leaders, who green-lit the overhiring and may have failed to develop productive roles for their employees.</p>
<p>“You could blame the workforce,” he says, “or the managers and leaders who are leading that workforce.”</p>
<p>Some companies clearly trust management over the workforce. After a layoffs announcement last month, Meta <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/meta-approves-plan-for-bigger-executives-bonuses-following-5percent-layoffs.html"><span>doubled</span></a> the potential amount of bonuses its executives can receive this year.</p>
<h4>Cutting hours instead of workers</h4>
<p>So, what are the best alternatives to layoffs?</p>
<p>As Southwest Airlines showed in 2001, companies can reduce expenses by delaying purchases and investments, cutting in places that don’t lead to job losses.</p>
<p>If that’s not enough, Wayne Cascio says companies should attempt to reduce hours or initiate furloughs (a temporary unpaid leave of absence) rather than layoffs. His research <a href="https://business-news.ucdenver.edu/2020/07/06/professors-research-on-layoffs-featured-in-the-new-york-times/"><span>has shown</span></a> that, even if layoffs occur, companies that try these alternatives perform better than those who instantly lay off employees when faced with financial problems.</p>
<p>At least during the pandemic, many companies showed a willingness to delay or resist layoffs. Cascio says that a survey from the Society for Human Resources Management found that a majority of firms enacted furloughs or cut travel and employee perks before laying off workers.</p>

<p><em>Olivia Heller/The Hustle</em></p>
<p>Still, as the last few years have shown, layoffs are happening — and often without any signs that they’re indicative of larger strategic moves. The problem, Cascio says, is that there are only two ways to make money in business: growing revenues or cutting costs.</p>
<p>Slashing costs is a far more predictable way to ensure future growth than finding new ways to generate revenue. And, too often, companies do the predictable thing.</p>
<p>Pfeffer was reminded of this impulse on a recent flight when he got upgraded to first class and ended up next to an airline executive. The industry had used buyouts and layoffs to shrink staff sizes during the pandemic and faced difficulties in refilling positions when demand picked up.</p>
<p>Pfeffer told the executive the layoffs had been a terrible idea. Then he asked him if his airline had gotten rid of any airplanes when business was down. The executive said it had not.</p>
<p>“So why,” Pfeffer says, “get rid of employees?”</p></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eye injuries that damage the cornea are usually irreversible and cause blindness. But a new clinical trial has repaired this damage in patients thanks to a transplant of stem cells from their healthy eyes.</p><p>The cornea is the outer layer of the eye, which focuses light towards the retina. Since it’s on the frontline of potential hazards from the outside world, the cornea features a population of limbal epithelial stem cells, which repair minor damage to keep the surface smooth and functional.</p><p>Unfortunately, injuries like thermal or chemical burns can damage the cornea beyond the capability of these resident stem cells. There’s not much else that can be done – even a <a href="https://newatlas.com/human-corneas-3d-printed/54837/" data-cms-ai="0">cornea transplant</a> won’t take hold if the damage is too severe.</p><p>The new study, conducted by scientists at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, investigated a new treatment called cultivated autologous limbal epithelial cells (CALEC). This involves removing stem cells from a patient’s uninjured eye, growing their population in the lab for a few weeks, then surgically transplanting them into the injured eye.</p><p>The phase 1/2 trial recruited 14 patients to undergo the procedure, and followed them for 18 months afterwards. Success was primarily judged by how effectively the treatment repaired the cornea’s surface, while a secondary test analyzed improvements to visual acuity.</p><p>By the first checkup at three months, the corneas of seven (50%) of the participants had been completely restored. By the 12-month mark, that number had increased to 11 (79%) patients. Two other participants met the definition for partial success, so the team claims an overall success rate of 92% for CALEC.</p><p>It’s worth noting that three participants did require a second transplant of stem cells, with one of them going on to reach the mark of complete success by the end of the study. In tests of visual acuity in the damaged eye, the majority of patients regained some sight, with some advancing from legally blind to low vision.</p><p>No serious adverse effects that were attributed to the procedure were seen in the patients, in either the donor or recipient eyes. The researchers say that this success paves the way for further trials with larger cohorts and longer follow-ups, before CALEC is submitted for FDA approval.</p><p>The research was published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56461-1" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"><i>Nature Communications</i></a>.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/calec-stem-cell-therapy-clinical-trial-repairs-corneal-damage" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Massachusetts General Brigham</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

          <h2><a href="#l-threonate" title="Link to section: § 'L-threonate'">L-Threonate</a></h2>
          <p>There are a variety of substances to get magnesium from. Considerable enthusiasm for the new compound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_L-threonate" id="RQF-ur58" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_L-threonate#bodyContent" title="Magnesium L-threonate">magnesium l-threonate</a> was stirred by 2 small animal rat studies finding that magnesium l-threonate was able to increase magnesium levels in the brain and improve learning/memory tasks. (There are no published human trials as of October 2015, and <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/old.reddit.com/a84bd51511044c7e47574518a24b2eaec58fc989.html" id="KV1_93EH" data-link-icon="reddit" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#ff4500" data-url-archive="/doc/www/old.reddit.com/a84bd51511044c7e47574518a24b2eaec58fc989.html" data-url-original="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3pk4yv/magnesium_lthreonatemagtein_publication_bias_in/">evidence of publication bias</a>, which I take as evidence against there being large effects in humans.) Animal studies mean very little, of course (see <a href="https://gwern.net/replication" id="gwern-replication" title="'The Replication Crisis: Flaws in Mainstream Science', Gwern 2010">the appendix</a>), but I thought it’d be interesting to try using l-threonate, so I bought the <span data-year-original="2013" data-amount-original="30" data-year-current="2025" data-amount-current="44.87" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $30 in 2013 → real $44.87 in 2025">$44.87<span><sup>$30</sup><sub>2013</sub></span></span> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P57AFM/" id="s6ZQg3EK" data-link-icon="amazon" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#ffce53">“Life Extension Neuro-Mag Magnesium L-Threonate with Calcium and Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (205g)”</a>, which according to the <a href="https://www.lef.org/Vitamins-Supplements/Item01602/Neuro-Mag-Magnesium-L-Threonate-with-Calcium-and-Vitamin-D3.html" id="4RlyZhca">LEF product page</a> works out to ~60g of “Magtein™ magnesium L-threonate” <span>and ~4.31g elemental magnesium inasmuch as LEF claims <span>2000<sub><span title="2000 was 25 years ago.">25ya</span></sub></span>mg of threonate powder provides 144mg elemental magnesium or a 14:1 ratio. (I don’t need the calcium or vitamin D</span><sub>3</sub>, but this was the only magnesium l-threonate on Amazon.) Experiment-wise, I’ll probably look at sleep metrics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne_%28software%29" id="jWUB0YIc" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne_%28software%29#bodyContent" title="Mnemosyne (software)">Mnemosyne</a> performance; I put off designing a blind self-experiment until after trying some.</p>
          <p>The powder itself is quite bulky; the recommended dose to hit 200mg of absorbed magnesium leads to ~7g of powder (so capping will be difficult) and the container provides only 30 doses’ worth (or each dose costs <span data-year-original="2013" data-amount-original="1" data-year-current="2025" data-amount-current="1.5" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $1 in 2013 → real $1.5 in 2025">$1.5<span><sup>$1</sup><sub>2013</sub></span></span>!). It’s described as lemon-flavored, and it is, but it’s sickly-sweet unpleasant and since it’s so much powder, takes half a glass of water to dissolve it entirely and wash it down. Subjectively, I notice nothing after taking it for a week. I may try a simple A-B-A analysis of sleep or Mnemosyne, but I’m not optimistic. And given the large expense of LEF’s “Magtein”, it’s probably a non-starter even if there seems to be an effect. For sleep effects, I will have to look at more reasonably priced magnesium sources.</p>
          <p>One thing I did do was piggyback on my <a href="https://gwern.net/nootropic/nootropics#noopept" id="gwern-nootropic-nootropics--noopept">Noopept self-experiment</a>: I blinded &amp; randomized the Noopept for a real experiment, but simply made sure to vary the Magtein without worrying about blinding or randomizing it. (The powder is quite bulky.) The correlation the experiment turned in was an odds-ratio of 1.9; interesting and in the right direction (higher is better), but since the magnesium part wasn’t random or blind, not a causal result.</p>

                <p>Encouraged by TruBrain’s magnesium &amp; my magnesium l-threonate use, I design and run a blind random self-experiment to see whether magnesium citrate supplementation would improve my mood or productivity. I collected ~200 days of data at two dose levels. The analysis finds that the net effect was negative, but a more detailed look shows time-varying effects with a large initial benefit negated by an increasingly-negative effect. Combined with my expectations, the long half-life, and the higher-than-intended dosage, I infer that I overdosed on the magnesium. To verify this, I will be running a followup experiment with a much smaller dose.</p>
              </blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>The original magnesium l-threonate caused me no apparent problems by the time I finished off the powder and usage correlated with better days, further supporting the hypothesis that magnesium helps it. But l-threonate would be difficult to cap (and hence blind self-experiment) and is ruinously expensive on a per-dose basis. So I looked around for alternatives for the followup; one of the most common compounds suggested was the citrate form because it is reasonably well-absorbed and causes fewer digestive problems, so I could just take that. Magnesium oxide is widely available it looks cheap, but the absorption/bioavailability problem makes it unattractive: at a 3:5 ratio, an estimate of <em>4%</em> absorption, a ZMA formulation of an impressive-sounding 500mg would be 500 × <span>3⁄5</span> × 0.04 = 12mg or a small fraction of RDAs for male adults like 400mg elemental. (Calcium shouldn’t be a problem since I get 220mg of calcium from my multivitamin and I enjoy dairy products daily.)</p>
            <p>Finding an usable product on Amazon caused me some difficulties. I wanted a 500mg magnesium-citrate-only product at &lt;<span data-year-original="2014" data-amount-original="20" data-year-current="2025" data-amount-current="29.47" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $20 in 2014 → real $29.47 in 2025">$29.47<span><sup>$20</sup><sub>2014</sub></span></span> for 120 doses, but I discovered most of the selection for “magnesium citrate” had sub-500mg doses, involved <em>calcium</em> citrate or other substances like zinc (not necessarily a bad thing, but would confound an experiment), were mostly magnesium <em>oxide</em> rather than citrate, or some still other problem. Ultimately I settled on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solgar-Magnesium-Citrate-120-tablets/dp/B00013Z0ZG/" id="l330TaFq" data-link-icon="amazon" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#ffce53">Solgar’s 120x400mg magnesium citrate</a> (<span data-year-original="2014" data-amount-original="13" data-year-current="2025" data-amount-current="19.16" title="CPI inflation-adjusted US dollar: from nominal $13 in 2014 → real $19.16 in 2025">$19.16<span><sup>$13</sup><sub>2014</sub></span></span>) as acceptable. (To compare with the bulkiness of the LEF vitamin D+l-threonate powder, <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" id="g2-1e6nf" title="Magnesium—Health Professional Fact Sheet">the Office of Dietary Supplements</a> says magnesium citrate is 16% magnesium, so to get 400mg of magnesium as claimed, would take 2.5g of material, rather than 7g for 200mg; even if l-threonate is absorbed 100% and citrate 50%, the citrate is ahead. The pills turn out to be wider and longer than my 00 pills; if I want to get them into my gel capsules, I have to crush them into fine powder. The powder from one pill turns out to take up 2 00 pills.)</p>
            <p>My impression after the first two days (2 doses of 400mg each, one with breakfast &amp; then lunch) was positive. I did not have the rumored digestion problems, and the first day went excellently: I was up until 1:30AM working and even then didn’t feel like going to bed—and I probably should have since I then slept abominably, which made the second day merely a good day. The third day I took none and it was an ordinary day. This is consistent with what I expected from the LEF l-threonate &amp; TruBrain glycinate/lycinate, and so it is worth investigating with a self-experiment.</p>

              <p>The basic idea is to remedy a deficiency (not look for acute stimulant effects) and magnesium has a slow excretion rate<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, so week-long blocks seem appropriate. I can reuse the same methodology as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium" id="KzM5_jn-" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium#bodyContent" title="Lithium">lithium</a> self-experiment. The response variables will be the usual mood/productivity self-rating and, since I was originally interested in magnesium for possible sleep quality improvements, a standardized score of sleep latency + # of awakenings + time spent awake (the same variable as my <a href="#gwern-zeo-potassium">potassium sleep experiment</a>).</p>
              <p>Since each 400mg pill takes up 2 00 pills, that’s 4 gel caps a day to reach 800mg magnesium citrate (ie. 136mg elemental magnesium), or 224 gel caps (2x120) for the first batch of Solgar magnesium pills. Turning the Solgar tablets into gel capsules was difficult enough that I switched to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Foods-Magnesium-Citrate-Powder-Ounces/dp/B004189JCW/" id="a1RjThck" data-link-icon="amazon" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#ffce53">NOW Food’s 227g magnesium citrate powder</a> for the second batch.</p>

                <p>50 pairs of active/placebos or 100 days. With 120 tablets and 4 tablets used up, that leaves me 58 doses. That might seem adequate except the paired <em>t</em>-test approximation is overly-optimistic, and I also expect the non-randomized non-blinded correlation is too high which means that is overly-optimistic as well. The power would be lower than I’d prefer. I decided to simply order another bottle of Solgar’s &amp; double the sample size to be safe.</p>

                <p>The initial results are a shock: the mean effect of the magnesium citrate comes in at almost the exact same magnitude (-0.25) as had been estimated for the Magtein back in the original Noopept analysis (0.26), except the estimated average effect is <em>negative</em>, as in, the magnesium citrate was harmful, and statistically-significantly so. Huh?</p>
                <p>This was so unexpected that I wondered if I had somehow accidentally put the magnesium pills into the placebo pill baggie or had swapped values while typing up the data into a spreadsheet, and checked into that. The spreadsheet accorded with the log above, which rules out data entry mistakes; and looking over the log, I discovered that some earlier slip-ups were able to rule out the pill-swap: I had carelessly put in some placebo pills made using rice, in order to get rid of them, and that led to me being unblinded twice before I became irritated enough to pick them all out of the bag of placebos—but how could that happen if I had swapped the groups of pills?</p>
                <p>So I began looking further into the data to see just what had happened (perhaps bad luck on a few days?), and turned to a plot:</p>

                <p>One thing I notice looking at the data is that the red magnesium-free days seem to dominate the upper ranks towards the end, and blues appear mostly at the bottom, although this is a little hard to see because good days in general start to become sparse towards the end. Now, why would days start to be worse towards the end, and magnesium-dose days in particular?</p>
                <p>The grim surmise is: an accumulating overdose—no immediate acute effect, but the magnesium builds up, dragging down all days, but especially magnesium-dose days. The generally recognized symptoms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermagnesemia" id="qyacYFTu" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermagnesemia#bodyContent" title="Hypermagnesemia">hypermagnesemia</a> don’t include effect on mood or cognition, aside from <a href="https://chemocare.com/sideeffect/hypermagnesemia" id="KRCBFBvv" title="Hypermagnesemia">“muscle weakness, confusion, and decreased reflexes…poor appetite that does not improve”</a>, but it seems plausible that below medically-recognizable levels of distress like hypermagnesemia might still cause mental changes, and I wouldn’t expect any psychological research to have been done on this topic.</p>
                <p>A picture is worth a thousand words, particularly in this case where there seems to be temporal effects, different trends for the conditions, and general confusion. So, I drag up 2.5 years of MP data (for context), plot all the data, color by magnesium/non-magnesium, and fit different LOESS lines to each as a sort of smoothed average (since categorical data is hard to interpret as a bunch of dots), which yields:</p>

                <p>That really says it all: there’s an initial spike in MP, which reads like the promised stimulative effects possibly due to fixing a deficiency (a spike which doesn’t seem to have any counterparts in the previous history of MP), followed by a drastic plunge in the magnesium days but not so much the control days (indicating an acute effect when overloaded with magnesium), a partial recovery during the non-experimental Christmas break, another plunge, and finally recovery after the experiment has ended.</p>
                <p>We can verify the negative correlation with the date &amp; an interaction between magnesium and the date; I don’t know whether to treat the magnesium dose as a linear, categorical, or logical, so I’ll try all of them:</p>

                <p>As feared and consistent with the accumulating overdose hypothesis, scores decrease over time and they decrease if magnesium is used that day. (The interaction isn’t statistically-significant, but I am not surprised: I powered this self-experiment to detect one main effect, not two main effects and an interaction.)</p>
                <p>But at least initially, the magnesium seemed to be remarkably useful. The crossover point, using this linear model, would have been somewhere around 20 days of the early small magnesium doses:</p>

                <p>The final question is: since I was taking an overdose, how did I mess up? I thought I was making sure I got at least the right RDA of elemental magnesium by aiming for 800mg of elemental magnesium and carefully converting from raw powder weight. So I went back to the original references, and scrutinizing them closely, they really were talking about elemental magnesium and indicating I should be getting 400mg elemental a day, but I did notice something: I got the dose wrong for the Solgar pills, it wasn’t 800mg elemental, it was 800mg of <em>citrate</em>—I misread the label. So I went from taking ~130mg of elemental magnesium in the first period to ~800mg in the second; I don’t think it is an accident that the second period seems to have been much worse (between the plot and the time trend).</p>
                <p>I find this very troubling. The magnesium supplementation was harmful enough to do a lot of cumulative damage over the months involved (I could have done a <em>lot</em> of writing September 2013–June <span>2014<sub><span title="2014 was 11 years ago.">11ya</span></sub></span>), but not so blatantly harmful enough as to be noticeable without a randomized blind self-experiment or at least systematic data collection—neither of which are common among people who would be supplementing magnesium I would much prefer it if my magnesium overdose had come with visible harm (such as waking up in the middle of the night after a nightmare soaked in sweat), since then I’d know quickly and surely, as would anyone else taking magnesium. But the harm I observed in my data? For all I know, that could be affecting every user of magnesium supplements! How would we know otherwise?</p>

The result were ambiguous: only a few effects survive multiple correction, which were a mix of good and bad ones, and I would guess that some of the bad effects are due to too much magnesium (although there is no time trend as blatant).</p>

                <p>The interpretation which seems to best resolve everything I know about magnesium with the data from my experiment is that magnesium supplementation does indeed help me a large amount, but I was taking way too much.</p>

            <p>This is not 100% clear from the data and just blindly using a plausible amount carries the risk of the negative effects, so I intend to run another large experiment. I will reuse the “NOW Foods Magnesium Citrate Powder”, but this time, I will use longer blocks (to make cumulative overdosing more evident) and try to avoid any doses &gt;150mg of elemental magnesium.</p>
            <p>I spent 2.5 hours making gel capsules:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>10x24 Bisquick placebo</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>10x24 magnesium citrate</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>480 total</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The powder totals 227g of magnesium citrate, hence there is ~0.945g per magnesium citrate pill. The nutritional information states that it contains 119 servings of 0.315g magnesium elemental = 37.485g elemental, as expected, and so likewise there is 0.156g elemental magnesium per pill. This is the same dosage as the second half of the first magnesium citrate experiment (249 gel capsules there, 240 here), where the overdose effect seemed to also happen; so to avoid the overdosage, I will take one pill every other day to halve the dose to an average of ~0.078g/78mg elemental per day (piggybacking on the morning-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" id="6wFba-pt" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#bodyContent" title="Caffeine">caffeine</a> experiment to make compliance easier).</p>
            <p>At 1 pill every other day, 14 doses, so pairs of 28-day blocks. The total time to use up all pills will then be ~960 days; this is a long time and excessively-powered, so I may stop early or possibly do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_analysis" id="vi03hU5c" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_analysis#bodyContent" title="Sequential analysis">sequential analysis</a>.</p>
            <p>The benefit of sequential analysis here is being able to stop early, conserving pills, and letting me test another dosage: if I see another pattern of initial benefits followed by decline, I can then try cutting the dose by taking one pill every <em>3</em> days; or, if there is a benefit and no decline, then I can try tweaking the dose up a bit (maybe 3 days out of 5?). Since I don’t have a good idea what dose I want and the optimal dose seems like it could be valuable (and the wrong dose harmful!), I can’t afford to spend a lot of time on a single definitive experiment.</p>

              <p>Since I didn’t take any 78mg elemental doses and the effects were time-varying, it’s more difficult to estimate the expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size" id="7H3QCJ9x" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#bodyContent" title="Effect size">effect-size</a> and hence power.</p>
              <p><em>If</em> I assume that the coefficient of +1.22 for <code>as.logical(Magnesium.citrate)TRUE</code>’s effect on <code>MP</code> in the previous analysis represents the true causal effect of 0.156g elemental magnesium without any overdose involved <em>and</em> that magnesium would have a linear increase (up until overdose), then one might argue that optimistically 0.078 would cause an increase of ~0.61. Or one could eyeball the graph and note that the LOESS lines look like at the magnesium peak improved by &lt;+0.5 over the long-run baseline of ~3 Then one could do a power estimate with those 2 estimates.</p>

              <p>The standard binary test with a linear date trend indicates high probability of harm as before, and the estimated per-mg effect size of the halved (78mg) dose is similar to the original magnesium citrate per-mg effect size: the original estimate was -0.0005/mg; and the new is -0.0009/mg; so, similar, and actually higher (but well within the two estimates’ combined sampling error).</p>
              <p>Unsurprisingly, combining the two experiments into a single analysis yields an intermediate effect size of -0.0006/mg (95% credible interval, -0.0008 to -0.0003) with <em>P</em> = 1 that it’s negative:</p>

              <p>So the original result is not anomalous and is confirmed by the followup.</p>
              <p>This is a disappointing finding on several levels: from a biological perspective, magnesium is a vital micronutrient and deficiency expected and getting a result of harm makes me question my methods &amp; results; from a practical perspective, it means that in addition to the considerable work required to set up &amp; run the self-experiments, I inflicted a nontrivial level of harm on myself (-0.06 on &gt;1 year’s worth of days); and from a decision perspective, this result is, <em>ex post</em>, worthless, as my default decision is to not supplement magnesium and the additional information doesn’t change my decision and so has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information" id="EVtG3prV" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information#bodyContent" title="Value of information">VoI</a> of zero (only somewhat ameliorated by the possibility that the results will be of interest or use to readers).</p>
              <p>What might explain this harm? After thinking about the results some more, I have two suggestions:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Electrolyte Imbalance</strong>: I recall that there is another related supplement where my randomized blinded self-experiment found harm despite general reports of benefits and deficiencies: <a href="#gwern-zeo-potassium">potassium</a>.</p>
                  <p>Potassium is much like magnesium/sodium/calcium in being a metal and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte" id="vMQA2uFv" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte#bodyContent" title="Electrolyte">electrolyte</a> heavily used by the nervous system and often supplemented for activities like sports. Could supplementing potassium and then magnesium, separately, have been causing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte_imbalance" id="pRuJjAUO" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte_imbalance#bodyContent" title="Electrolyte imbalance">electrolyte imbalance</a>? This would elegantly resolve both findings of harm and explain why others find benefits (perhaps they had higher baseline levels of the necessary co-electrolytes, or were supplementing them simultaneously). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine" id="dLCS3kXR" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine#bodyContent" title="Thiamine">Thiamine</a> has also been suggested as a possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)" id="bTCutKqj" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cofactor_(biochemistry)#bodyContent" title="Cofactor (biochemistry)">cofactor</a> used up by magnesium supplementation.</p>
                  <p>In that case, the solution is simple: do some reading to find out if any optimal ratios have been measured yet, or simply take a common-sized dose of both potassium &amp; magnesium (and perhaps sodium too—I am pretty sure I get more than enough calcium because I consume so much dairy, but I am not sure about sodium since I cook almost all my food &amp; use little salt by default as I grew up in a low-sodium home &amp; find even a little salt to be more than enough flavoring). There might be something useful in blood test panels too. Figuring out the right dose might be tricky, as overdoses can produce issues like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk-alkali_syndrome" id="DZifpJRU" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk-alkali_syndrome#bodyContent" title="Milk-alkali syndrome">milk-alkali syndrome</a>.</p>
                  <p>Given the established harm, I would have to run yet a third self-experiment, one long enough to be able to rule out even a small harm and certify long-term use (which has potentially high regret).</p>

                  <p><strong>Overdose</strong>: as mentioned in the first experiment, the fact that the harm seems like it increases over time is suspicious. This shows up less in the second one, but that uses a smaller dose and has longer &amp; more breaks, so that might be why.</p>
                  <p>If it’s a cumulative overdose, since magnesium has a long half-life, modeling the hypothetical cumulative doses each day should offer some insight. If there turns out to be</p>
                  <p>No additional experimentation is needed, since the doses &amp; dose schedule is known and there ought to be enough variation in sums to analyse. So I can do some exploratory analyses of this possibility.</p>

                <p>To model the possibility of overdose, I can take the existing data’s schedule of doses and use a magnesium half-life formula to calculate the increase in magnesium load each day over an assumed baseline of 0mg. Then regress as before, but on the total magnesium load, both linear and quadratic (for the dose-response curve).</p>
                <p>So what’s the actual half-life of a magnesium supplement, besides “long”?</p>
                <p>“Magnesium Basics” cites on the topic just the paper <span><span>1966</span></span>, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/nootropic/magnesium/1966-avioli.pdf" id="avioli-berman-1966" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" title="'Mg<sup>28</sup> Kinetics In Man', Avioli &amp; Berman 1966">“Mg<sup>28</sup>^ kinetics in man”</a>. They trace magnesium in humans and fit to the data a rather complex multi-compartment model with several small (15% of total magnesium) fast-exchanging reservoirs of magnesium and a few large slow-exchanging reservoirs (the other 85%), all of which turnover and connect with each other at different rates. This would be unmanageable but they do suggest a simplified two-compartment model:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Most often the data have been treated with the assumption that each exponential function represented a discrete magnesium compartment with independent rates of turnover. On the basis of such analyses applied to urinary Mg<sup>28</sup>^ specific activity curves, Silver et al (21) defined three exchanging magnesium compartments in man with half-times of 35 hr, 3 hr, and 1 hr, respectively…Zumoff (23) analyzing curves in normal subjects again described three components with half-lives of 15, 40, and 340 min.</p>
                  <p>In the present model over 85% of the exchangeable magnesium pool was accounted for by compartment 3. Of total body magnesium of man, 60% can be accounted for by bone and 20 % by muscle (1). The magnesium content of soft tissues in man approximate 400-420 mEq or 20% of total body magnesium (1). The rapid exchangeability of this soft tissue magnesium with injected Mg<sup>28</sup>^ as compared to the much slower skeletal muscle and bone magnesium exchangeability has been documented repeatedly in animals and man by many investigators (4, 10, 11, 15, 17). One could argue, therefore, that the calculated whole-body exchangeable magnesium content in the present study representing 15% of the whole-body magnesium primarily reflects intra-cellular magnesium.</p>
                  <p>…The present study indicates that in man there are at least three exchangeable magnesium pools with varied rates of turnover reflected in a 6-day study. Compartments I and 2, exemplifying pools with a relatively fast turnover, together approximate extracellular fluid in distribution; compartment 3, an intracellular pool containing over 80% of the exchanging magnesium, with a turnover one-half that of the most rapid pool; and compartment 5, which probably accounts for most of whole-body magnesium. Since only 15% of whole-body magnesium is accounted for by relatively rapid exchange processes, approximately 25.5 mEq/kg of body magnesium (0.85 X 30 mEq/kg) is either nonexchangeable or exchanges very slowly.</p>
                  <p>Assuming 1. a steady state wherein Rho<sub>35</sub> = Rho<sub>53</sub> (Rho<sub>35</sub> = 0.0156 mEq/kg hr, Table I) and 2. that the slowly exchanging body magnesium could be accounted for by a single compartment (compartment 5, Fig. 3), then (Equation 9):</p>
                  
                  <p>This represents a biological half-life of about 1,000 hr and would require an isotopic kinetic study of about 50 days for experimental verification. The short physical half-life of Mg<sup>28</sup>^ and radiation hazards imposed by millicurie doses of Mg<sup>28</sup>^ presently prohibit in vivo experiments of this nature in man…The subjects may not have been in a magnesium steady state during the Mg<sup>28</sup>^ study since compartment 5 is so large (85%; whole-body magnesium) and its estimated turnover of 0.0006/hr so small that it had not yet adjusted to the constant dietary intake selected arbitrarily for each patient.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>If I’m understanding it right, the suggested simple model is a two-compartment one, with a ‘fast’ and a ‘slow’ compartment. The fast one holds 15% of the magnesium and decays at a fraction of 0.0156 per hour, giving a half-life of ~44 hours ((1 − 0.0156)<sup>44</sup> = 0.50) or ~1.8 days, while the slow one holds 85% and has a half life of &gt;1000 hours ((1 − 0.00062)<sup>1000</sup> = 0.54) or ~42 days (!). So to approximate the net disturbance each day and any accumulation, we can add the daily dose, and decay the previous daily total by the weighted decay rates. (Averaging like this, assuming that of each day’s dose, 15% goes into the fast compartment &amp; 85% into the slow compartment, may not be right. The slow compartment is slow, after all. Should the slow compartment be modeled as instead sucking in a small percentage each day from the fast compartment?)</p>

                <p>The slow totals turns out to reach far larger levels than the fast totals, and the cumulative is dominated by the slow total, so it makes more sense to avoid lumping them together: they are different biologically in size and half-life, are different parts of the body (the fast seems to be circulating magnesium while the slow corresponds to muscle &amp; skeleton, I think <span><span>Avioli &amp; Berman</span><span>1966</span></span> suggests), and if they act differently, using the total would hide that, and if they don’t, they’ll add up to the same thing anyway.</p>

                  <p>In desperation, I will proceed to torture the data with various ways to try to winkle out a temporal/accumulating effect.</p>
                  <p>One idea I had was to try different decay rates (of a single compartment, which would be perhaps the fast one), ranging from 1 day to 64 days, and use the horseshoe prior for variable selection to pick out the decay rate giving the most predictive moving-average. None of them popped out:</p>
