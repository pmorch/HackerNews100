<p><strong>NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug 7 – Police raided a warehouse belonging to WorldCoin cryptocurrency in Nairobi and carted away documents over the weekend.</strong>



</p><p>The officers went to the offices along Mombasa Road armed with a search warrant and left with machines they believe stores data gathered by the firm.



</p><p>The team took the data to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis.



</p><p>Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait defended her office and said Tools for Humanity, the parent company of Worldcoin, failed to disclose its true intentions during registration.



</p><p>The government has suspended Worldcoin’s operations in Kenya, citing security concerns paving the way for investigations into the activities of the company.



</p><p>However, privacy experts worry that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person’s iris might get into the wrong hands.



</p><p>The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) stated it was concerned about the ongoing registration and notified Kenyans that Worldcoin was not regulated in Kenya.



</p><p>Under Kenyan law, individuals have a right to not have any personal information unnecessarily required or unnecessarily revealed.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.</p>



<p>&nbsp;On Thursday, Worldcoin said it is planning to implement crowd-control measures and collaborate with the government before resuming work.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.



</p><p>It claims to be creating a new global “identity and financial network”.



</p><p>Altman, who founded Open AI, which built chat bot ChatGPT, says he hopes the initiative will help confirm if someone is a human or a robot. He also says this could lead to everyone being paid a universal basic income but it is not clear how.



</p><p>Worldcoin says it chose Kenya as the first African country to launch the platform because of the already booming tech space, and the more than four million Kenyans who are already trading in crypto.



</p><p>It has also launched in various countries including Indonesia, France Japan, Germany, Spain and the UK. Data watchdogs in some countries have already said they are examining Worldcoin.



</p><p>Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki suspended the firm’s activities in Kenya to pave the way for a probe into the legality of its operations.



</p><p>He Thursday appeared before Parliament to among other issues state the precautionary steps taken by the government on the already mined data.



</p><p>“The aforesaid entity is not registered as a legal entity in Kenya.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dear client,</p>

<p>Setting aside the earlier challenges of using Zoom under ChromeOS and Linux, I have mostly been <strong>declining invitations to Zoom calls</strong> because of the terms they introduced from April 2023 in section 10 of their <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a> which seem to force every user, with no opt-out to the Terms available and with recourse only via arbitration, to agree that Zoom can:</p>
<ol><li>Train their AI on anything uploaded or created on Zoom (including transcripts and recordings) and use the consequent model for absolutely anything;</li>
<li>Have indefinite and ownership-equivalent rights to do so in the future and</li>
<li>Be indemnified by me if it turns out someone else owns the IP or has their rights infringed (for example to confidential materials everyone on the call is entitled to review).</li></ol>

<p>I prefer <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" rel="nofollow">Jitsi</a> instead; it has equivalent functionality, is platform independent, can be used without an account, is open source and can be self-hosted.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" rel="nofollow">terms</a>, “data, content, files, documents, or other materials” that you use in a Zoom session (“Customer Input”), as well as recordings and transcripts, and any other glitter Zoom sprinkles over them, is called “Customer Content”.</p>

<p>10.4(ii) then sees you granting a broad license to Customer Content “for the purpose of product and service development, marketing, analytics, quality assurance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, training, testing, improvement of the Services, Software, or Zoom’s other products, services, and software, or any combination thereof”</p>

<p>If the stuff you shared belongs to someone else, 10.6 sees you agreeing “you are solely responsible for the Customer Content” and notably for getting consent from third parties and providing notices according to whatever laws happen to be applicable to the combination of people involved.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, in 10.6 you “represent and warrant that you have the right to upload Customer Input and for Zoom to provide, create, or make available any Customer Content to you, and that such use or provision by you, your End User, or Zoom does not violate or infringe any rights of any third party.” &nbsp;So according to 25(i) &amp; (iii) you are basically indemnifying them if they train their AI with someone else's IP you happen to have – for example, a client brief you are discussing internally, or a legal case you are working on under privilege.</p>

<p>There is no opt-out or scope control to use in the Terms for AI training. Zoom's COO <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37029700" rel="nofollow">says</a> the actual use of the AI features is opt-in, but that doesn't seem relevant as the Terms grant permission regardless and the Customer Content exists whether you use the AI features or not.</p>

<p>My non-lawyer read suggests this is an exceptionally risky thing for anyone to agree if they are in possession of IP or under NDA concerning someone else's secrets, and I will be avoiding Zoom (even if they revert the terms – can't take the chance on future changes like this).</p>

He is a survivor of bacterial meningitis, which caused him to have multiple amputation surgeries on his feet. He is a proud advocate for those with disabilities and addiction issues. He covers everything from the NFL and UFC to pizza-chucking and analysis of Tom Cruise's running ability.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p><b>RIGHT BEFORE HE HEAVED</b> the million-dollar shot, the one that would launch an era of sports contests and change his life forever, Don Calhoun took a long look at his shoes.</p><p>He was only out here standing on the floor of Chicago Stadium on April 14, 1993, 15 feet from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1035/michael-jordan" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> and the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls" target="_blank">Bulls</a>, because of his shoes. "Those won't scuff the court," an arena worker said as she signed Calhoun up for a $1 million, three-quarter-court contest shot that the Bulls had been running every night.</p><p>As he stared at his feet, waiting to be told it was his turn to take the shot, he was warned, "Whatever you do, don't step over the free throw line." Calhoun, a 23-year-old office supply salesman from the Chicago area, darted his eyes from his non-scuffing sneakers to the free throw line about 80 feet from the hoop he needed to make.</p><p>The impossibility of the shot was settling in. He wasn't going to be able to shoot it with both hands; he'd have to throw it like a quarterback. The Bulls had held the promotion 19 times that year already. Two people clunked the backboard. Another clanged the rim. The other 16 were air balls. Nobody came close. The best estimate of someone like Calhoun making that shot? Less than 1%.</p><p>But then, a calm came over him. He thought about his brother Clarence, who had told him five years earlier, just before he died, that Michael Jordan would soon be the best player in the NBA and the Bulls would be a dynasty. He thought about his bittersweet feelings toward the sport of basketball -- he loved the game and was good at it, but he never made his high school team.</p><p>It might sound ridiculous, but as Calhoun stood there and heard his name announced, he became sure -- <i>100% certain</i> -- that the shot was going to go in. The last thing he remembers is the steady hum of 18,600 people rising to cheer for him. As the Bulls huddled up nearby, Calhoun palmed the ball in one hand. The free throw line warning was bouncing around inside his head, and for a second, he felt his flow get disrupted.</p><p>But the flow came back as he stepped past the end line. He took one fast dribble, thought to himself, "This is for Clarence," and then threw a high-arching rocket.</p><p>As the ball sailed toward the hoop, Calhoun's eyes again turned toward his feet and he saw that he was <i>very</i> close to the free throw line -- but a few inches behind. Whew. When he looked up again, he had a moment of panic. He'd thrown it too far and too hard.</p><p>"It looked like it was going to hit the shot clock," he says.</p><p>But then the ball began to sink. It dropped, and dropped, and dropped, and... <i>swish</i>. Right through the net. Calhoun threw his arms toward the rafters, and the crowd let out one of those levels of cheers that aggravates the arena neighbors.</p><p>Then the real mayhem began.</p><p>The ensuing 30 seconds might be the most joyous footage of that Bulls team ever. Seriously, watch the most celebratory moments from "The Last Dance," and compare those with the clips you will inevitably see this April 14 on social media on the 30th anniversary of Calhoun's heave. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3815/john-paxson" target="_blank">John Paxson</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/919/scott-williams" target="_blank">Scott Williams</a> go wild. Some player just off-camera slaps Calhoun's ass over and over again, and even one of the game refs comes over, hits him on the back and hands him the ball from the shot. Phil Jackson stands there with an incredulous grin, looking like he just won the $1 million.</p><p>Suddenly, Calhoun found himself bumped and butt-slapped directly into the middle of the Bulls huddle, where the other players parted and there stood <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/663/scottie-pippen" target="_blank">Scottie Pippen</a> and Michael Jordan. Calhoun was the team's 13th man at that moment. Calhoun was in there for a good 10 seconds when he felt Jordan slap him on the back and lean into his ear.</p><p>"Great shot, kid," Jordan said.</p><p>Calhoun says he can still hear the way Jordan was yelling "Woo!" behind him the entire time. After the game, Michael Wilbon, then at The Washington Post, wrote, "Jordan, smiling in a child-like way I've never seen on the court, threw both arms around his neck and squeezed." As the celebration exploded around him, Calhoun felt as if his life was going to change. He was the toast of Chicago for the next 24 hours, with the shot going viral by 1993 standards, with newscasts and newspapers all showing the clip so much that Calhoun's shot is now referenced as the beginning of a boom in contests at sporting events. And best of all, Calhoun was about to become a millionaire.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><hr><p><b>BY THE TIME DON CALHOUN</b> made his shot, in-game contests had begun to pop up here and there across the country. But Calhoun's make caused an eruption in popularity. Chris Hamman, VP at industry leader SCA Promotions, thinks "The Calhoun Shot," as it's become known in the business, might have doubled or even tripled the number of contests.</p><p>"These types of contests grew quite a bit, and a lot of NBA teams started doing similar contests," says Hamman, whose dad, Bob, founded SCA Promotions, which has been insuring sports contests since the mid-1980s. Chris compares Calhoun's make with the impact Chris Moneymaker had on poker in 2003 when he went from an $86 online qualifier to winning the World Series of Poker (and $2.5 million).</p><p>The contests took off afterward. They were the perfect way to keep 15,000-plus people engaged during TV timeouts and between quarters. They were wildly popular crowd-pleasers back then, and remain slam dunk #ViralContent in the social media era. SCA Promotions has insured billions of dollars of sports contests since the mid-1980s, paying out something like $250 million in winnings over the years, according to Bob Hamman. (SCA was not the insurer of the Calhoun Shot).</p><p>As the Hammans note, the perfect contest is like the most tempting carnival game: just feasible enough to make people think they can do it while actually being extremely difficult. Everybody at the Bulls game that night in 1993 probably had sunk a long shot or two at some point in their life. In reality, Jordan himself might not have made one if you gave him 100 tries. "With the shot that Don Calhoun made, you could have <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry" target="_blank">Steph Curry</a> out there and still make money," Chris Hamman says.</p><p>But, as was the case with Calhoun, people do win enough to keep contest dreams alive. SCA Promotions insures more than $100 million in sports contests every year, and the Hammans love telling stories of paying off winners ... because the vast majority of holes-in-one and half-court shots never happen. It's a little like when sportsbooks leak out those betting slips of the fan who hit a 12-team parlay that cost $40 and pays out $250,000. The good news fuels the delusion of it happening to you.</p><p>One of the Hammans' favorite winners was a <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks" target="_blank">Diamondbacks</a> fan, Gylene Hoyle, who won a 1999 radio contest where she had to pick one Arizona player and an inning. If that player hit a home run in that exact inning during a specific game, she'd win $1 million.</p><p>Seems doable, right? The math is actually obscene. She picked <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/1823/jay-bell" target="_blank">Jay Bell</a>, who was in the middle of a monster year (38 home runs and 112 RBIs). She had about a 1-in-2,916 chance. And yet, Bell came to the plate in the sixth inning with the bases loaded. He fouled off two straight two-strike pitches, then hit a home run on a pitch that could have been ball four. Afterward, he acknowledged that he knew about the contest and swung hoping to get someone $1 million. "That one stung," Bob Hamman says.</p><p>The math on insuring high-stakes contests generally works the same way. Brokers come up with a likelihood that a random contestant could win -- the Hammans say a three-quarter-court shot is less than 1%, for example -- and divide it into the prize amount, then charge about twice that to insure it. For a $1 million contest with a 1% success rate, that means it'd cost the team $20,000 every time they run it.</p><p>Once the details are ironed out, insurance companies come up with all the fine print. Contestants usually must be randomly selected from the crowd. If it's one shot, there's no warmup toss or second attempt. If it's three makes in 30 seconds, three makes in 30.1 seconds is close but no money. For something like a hockey shot that must go through a tiny plywood cutout and into a goal, the shot has to be entirely through. Not mostly through. Not on the line. <i>Entirely</i> through.</p><p>Insurance companies are unforgiving with teams that don't explain the rules right, and it's not unusual for franchises to end up paying out the contest themselves if there are any issues. The PR hit of stiffing a middle school geometry teacher out of $25,000 generally isn't worth it.</p><p>But lawsuits and disagreements happen, and that's what almost happened to Don Calhoun. One key stipulation in most insurance policies is that the contestant can't have played an "organized" version of the sport in question for a certain time period before the contest -- usually, five years.</p><p>Calhoun grew up in Chicago playing hoops on the playground with Clarence. Both had trouble making it onto junior high and varsity teams despite what seemed to be a worthy skill set. They were tough guards who loved dogging opposing ball handlers on defense. But they also played a brand of streetball that didn't always translate well to high school hoops.</p><p>They certainly had talent, though. Clarence graduated and played at a junior college for his freshman year, then transferred to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/305/depaul-blue-demons" target="_blank">DePaul</a> to walk onto the basketball team as a sophomore. Don, then a senior in high school, drew inspiration from Clarence's unwillingness to quit basketball despite a high school career that didn't pan out -- he, too, planned to go to a small school to play hoops before transferring to a bigger school.</p><p>But one weekend, Clarence was on his way home from school to hang out with his family for a few days when the Calhouns got a dreaded phone call. He had gotten tired on the drive home, pulled over to rest, and been struck and killed by another car. He was 20.</p><p>Don was devastated. He didn't graduate that spring on time as he grieved. But he went back to school in the fall and got his diploma. He slowly landed in a headspace where he wanted to use his brother's memory as fuel. He bounced around at two community colleges and walked on with both basketball teams. One newspaper account from the time says he was 3-for-12 shooting in 11 career games.</p><p>But Don eventually walked away from school and from any formal basketball. He found out his longtime girlfriend was pregnant, so he got a job as an office supply salesman. Binders, notebooks, day planners, you name it, Don Calhoun was the guy to talk to. He was making a decent living, and he eventually had a son. The little boy's name? Clarence Calhoun II.</p><p>When Clarence was 3, Don hugged him and told him to watch the Bulls game that night because Dad might be on TV. Clarence remembers his mom letting him stay up, although he's not sure he saw the actual shot. He just recalls yelling and pointing at the screen as he watched his dad leap up and down with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Then he went to bed.</p><p>Calhoun says that he marked on the forms that he had played some college basketball three years earlier and that the contest people shrugged about it. The insurance company disagreed, and the weekend after he had won, local news media began to report that Calhoun might not be getting the money. That prompted the Bulls to hold a news conference, where Calhoun sat beside Jerry Reinsdorf and several contest sponsors.</p><p>"It is unclear at this time whether the company that insured the event will pay on the policy," a joint statement read. "However, regardless of its decision, [restaurant group] Lettuce Entertain You, Coca-Cola (Foundation) and the Chicago Bulls will honor the $1 million award and ensure that this event has a happy ending."</p><p>Calhoun left that day knowing that the win was, in fact, going to be a win. He would immediately receive his first of 20 annual $50,000 payments. In the coming weeks, he appeared on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and got a cup of coffee as a member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He was, unbelievably, the unofficial mayor of Chicago for a brief period. When Wilbon called Calhoun's company for his story, someone answered by saying, "Reliable Office Superstore. This is the home of one-shot Don Calhoun, the million-dollar man."</p><p>He never got many details about how the sponsors and insurance company worked it out. He just took yes as an answer. It wasn't until a few weeks later that he found out that he might have needed a key assist from a secret source: Michael Jordan himself.</p><hr><p><b>AFTER CALHOUN</b> made the shot, he was asked to stay on the floor and do an endless string of TV hits and print interviews. As he bounced from camera setup to camera setup near the Chicago locker room, Bulls players kept leaving and spotting him on their way out. Almost every player came over, said congratulations and signed his basketball. "It took me three years to make a million dollars, and it took him five seconds," <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/279/horace-grant" target="_blank">Horace Grant</a> joked afterward.</p><p>Calhoun got signatures from Grant, Scottie Pippen, John Paxson and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/23" target="_blank">B.J. Armstrong</a>, plus two Heat players who swung by, Rony Seikaly and Steve Smith. And then, as he got ready to do another live hit, Calhoun saw Jordan and a Bulls staffer come out and stand nearby. Calhoun made eye contact with Jordan, who smiled back at him and was clearly there waiting to say hello to him. Calhoun wanted to run over and ditch whatever TV interview he was about to do, but producers kept telling him they were about to go live any second now.</p><p>When the lights went on, Calhoun did the best interview he could as he watched in dismay what was happening on the other side of the camera. Jordan said something to the Bulls staffer and left. Calhoun wasn't going to meet MJ, after all, and it crushed him. The Bulls worker said he could leave the ball behind and they'd try to get Jordan to sign it.</p><p>But Calhoun had other plans. He didn't want to leave the building without that ball, so he took it. He thought there was a chance he might run into Jordan somewhere down the road, then he could get an autograph.</p><p>Over the next few days, news broke all over the country that Calhoun's winnings seemed to be in jeopardy. Calhoun clung to that ball, and it provided him hope. He had made the shot. The crowd had gone completely wild. The Bulls had pulled him into their huddle. He had left with the ball. That was all real, and he would have it forever. The $1 million? He sure hoped it was coming his way. But he also felt an odd peace about the money. The experience alone certainly wouldn't pay for Clarence's school clothes. But it wasn't nothing, either. It was priceless.</p><p>As reports swirled, fan outrage was palpable in Chicago, which created enough heat on the franchise to figure out some way to pay the local office supply salesman his damn money. That led to the news conference and the first $50,000 check.</p><p>But what to do about his beloved basketball? The next school year, he had heard from a friend that Jordan always attended one of his kid's home games at a specific school in the area. So he showed up that night -- with his ball and two magazines -- and tried to walk up to Jordan. The Bulls star had his own section away from the crowd, complete with security that kept people from doing exactly what Calhoun was trying to do.</p><p>Calhoun was stopped on his approach by a Jordan security guy, who said Jordan had a firm policy of no autographs at his kids' events. Calhoun explained who he was and that Jordan had seemed to really want to meet him back in April. The security guy wouldn't budge. "No autographs at his kids' stuff," the guy repeated.</p><p>But Calhoun had a funny feeling that he shouldn't give up. He asked the security to <i>pretty-pretty-pretty please</i> tell Jordan that the guy who made The Calhoun Shot had come to the game hoping for his signature. The security guy shook his head. Calhoun was even willing to just hand the guy the ball to take to Jordan. No luck.</p><p>"Michael doesn't do anything when he's at one of his kid's games," Calhoun was told.</p><p>An unlikely thing happened near the end of the game, though. The security guard came to Calhoun in the stands and told him he could walk with Jordan to his car after the game. So Calhoun got his ball and Sharpie ready, then met up with the Jordan crew as he left the high school.</p><p>The first thing out of Jordan's mouth? "Did you get your money?" Jordan asked.</p><p>Calhoun said yes, and Jordan told him something that caught him off guard. "We made them give it to you," Jordan said. "We were upset that they were trying to not pay you."</p><p>Calhoun was stunned. He had heard rumors that the Bulls players were agitated at the thought of him getting stiffed. But this was confirmation that Michael Jordan himself helped make him a millionaire. (Jordan declined an interview request for this story; the Bulls also passed on participating.)</p><p>As they got to a set of doors, Calhoun knew Jordan's car was waiting for him on the other side. He asked whether Jordan would sign his ball, and MJ said no, that he had to stick to his principle of no autographs at his kids' stuff. "Bring it down to my steakhouse and drop it off, then I'll sign it," he said.</p><p>Calhoun waved goodbye that night and thanked Jordan once more for advocating on his behalf. But as he left later, he felt a pang as he considered just pulling up to Jordan's restaurant, dropping off the ball and hoping for the best.</p><p>The ball had grown to mean so much to him. It wasn't the signatures, or that he thought the ball might be worth something like $20,000. Its actual worth was beyond what someone could pay. It represented the agony of losing Clarence and trying to carry his brother's message with his own son. It represented the end of the bitter, unfulfilled taste that "organized" basketball had left in his mouth. It represented closing that chapter of his life when he had to fight and claw to pay every bill for his family, opening up 20 years where he knew he had a financial backstop each year.</p><p>Was he really going to hand the ball to some random steakhouse assistant manager and cross his fingers, hoping he'd see it again?</p><p>The answer was... yes, he was going to do exactly that. He felt as if Jordan's signature was too important as the coda to the story of the ball. So he drove over there one day and implored the person he handed it to for help, saying that this ball meant so much to him, that MJ's signature was the last missing component of an artifact from the most important moment of his life.</p><p>It must have worked. A few weeks later, he got a call to pick up the ball. "Michael signed it, and he wishes you well," Calhoun was told.</p><p>The ball became a family heirloom over the next three decades. But not in the way you'd expect. Calhoun never locked it up in a vault or even put it in a protective case in the house. He left it in the basement of his house, and Clarence and Calhoun's other three kids would dribble it and throw it around. He wanted his kids to be able to touch and feel something that had altered the trajectory of their family. "I'll always keep it for you," Don told Clarence.</p><p>For the next 20 years, Calhoun would get a check for $50,000 every year. Of that money, he'd have to set aside around $12,000 for taxes. He kept his office sales job for a few more years, and the other $38,000 (about $79,000 in 2023 dollars) was a very nice supplemental living. But, as Calhoun says, it was more like a bump up within the middle class. "In reality, you're not rich," he says. "You're not a millionaire."</p><p>Maybe he didn't have generational wealth. But he was about to experience a generational breakthrough.</p><hr><p><b>AS THE 30th ANNIVERSARY</b> of the shot approaches, Calhoun takes a few weeks to decide whether he will talk about the shot, the money or any of it. He hasn't done many interviews over the years. Eventually, he agreed to one but asked that his current location and occupation be left out of the story. Let's say he's living within a few hours of Chicago in the Midwest, and he works the second shift at a solid job.</p><p>He's not hesitant because he's a particularly shy person -- once he gets rolling on the phone, he's funny and unafraid to argue, and he comes off as very open and honest as he talks. Toward the end of an hourlong interview, he asks, "How can I get to the Hall of Fame?"</p><p>When the answer is a surprised chuckle, he says, "Don't you laugh. I want to be in the Hall of Fame. I think I deserve it."</p><p>He seems to be goofing around, but Calhoun changes lanes easily between being confident and reserved. He talks about the shot like he knew it was going in the entire time, yet it never sounds particularly braggy. He seems as if he had his 15 minutes and is content with that ... but also thinks it'd be nice to have a small shrine to it.</p><p>Calhoun is 53 now. He catches the video only every few years, when somebody will show him a tweet or video link to a clip that you will most likely see every April 14 for the rest of eternity.</p><p>Calhoun is neither rich nor poor, at least in the traditional sense of the word. He does, however, feel wealthy when he talks about his four kids. The Calhoun Shot gave them all a better life. His youngest, Terrelle, is 20 and lives in Austin, Texas. Naomi, 22, is in nursing school. Gabriela, 28, is a teacher. And Clarence II, 33, is living out something beyond his own wildest dreams -- and his dad's.</p><p>Don Calhoun's oldest son became a good prep basketball player at East Aurora High School and graduated in 2008. With five years of $50,000 checks left, Don encouraged Clarence to finish the job he and his brother had started years earlier: graduating from college. Clarence loved that idea. What a cool way to pay tribute to the uncle he never met but was named after. The problem was, he still didn't know what he wanted to be when he grew up.</p><p>For the first few years after high school, he bounced between community colleges before getting into Wiley College, an HBCU in Marshall, Texas. He had developed an interest in the human body, especially biology. But college was no joke. Clarence Calhoun II limped to a 1.6 GPA in his first semester. It wasn't that he couldn't handle the coursework or the social life or the amount of work it took. It was the totality of doing all of those things all at once. He didn't know a single person who had experience at this level of education. He was a rookie, surrounded by rookies.</p><p>That's when he met a Ukrainian physician named Dr. Valentyn Siniak. Siniak was at Wiley teaching while he took mandatory tests to begin practicing medicine in the U.S. Calhoun was blown away by the level of support Siniak provided. Calhoun isn't sure exactly what Siniak saw in him, but he saw something.</p><p>In emails to Calhoun, Siniak began calling him "Dr. Clarence Calhoun." When Calhoun asked him for guidance on how he could get his grades up, Siniak made him laugh out loud. "I think you should start tutoring other students," Siniak said.</p><p>"Tutoring?" Calhoun said. "I'm struggling to learn everything myself. How can I teach others?" Siniak thought this would give Calhoun an extra nudge to learn the material and boost his own command.</p><p>Siniak was <i>exactly</i> right. So right, in fact, that Calhoun sighs and shakes his head on a Zoom describing this section of his life. He still can't fathom the way Siniak manifested belief into Calhoun's life. His grades soared, and he liked working with other students. He had to work his ass off to get there -- at one point, campus security officers would close up the science building for the night, knowing Calhoun was still in there. He'd study most of the night, inflate a mattress for a few hours and wake up the next day ready to do it again. "I found out I was smarter than I thought I was," Calhoun says now.</p><p>And so in 2013, Calhoun graduated from college just as his dad's $50,000 annual checks ended. He was the first in his family to get a college degree, and he battled and scrapped every day to get it.</p><p>He also had found out that his girlfriend was pregnant and that they were having a boy. When he told Don, he said, "Know what we're going to name him, Dad?"</p><p>Don began to think about it for a second ... and then it hit him. He didn't say a word, and his son didn't either. They laughed, hugged and celebrated the upcoming birth of Clarence Calhoun III.</p><p>Clarence Calhoun II started to chart a course for the next phase of his life, which had come into focus for him. "I want to be a doctor," he told his dad, and he began to try to get into medical school. He worked jobs at Jiffy Lube, a toxicology lab and other places before he finally passed his labs and got accepted. This was happening. Not only was a Calhoun going to earn his degree but he felt as if he might actually become the Dr. Clarence Calhoun his instructor, Dr. Siniak, had predicted in his emails.</p><p>That's why it breaks the younger Calhoun's heart to tell this next part of the story. Siniak didn't get to see Calhoun get his degree. In January 2013, Siniak was struck and killed while riding a motorcycle in Texas. "Having him believe in me helped me believe in myself," Calhoun says. "My biggest downfall that was keeping me from excelling was my confidence. I just didn't think I could. I didn't have anybody around me who had done it."</p><p>Over the next eight years, he passed his boards and did his residency, and an envelope arrived in May 2021 that he couldn't wait to open. The piece of paper inside made it official: He was now Dr. Clarence Calhoun.</p><p>He went to his dad's house to show him in person, and they had a long embrace. Don couldn't stop smiling. After a minute, he walked out of the room and came back holding two things he was giving to his son.</p><p>One was the shoes he had worn during The Calhoun Shot. Clarence noticed they had a signature on them. They were autographed by ... none other than Don Calhoun, which makes Clarence laugh to this day when he holds them up. His dad can be a goofball -- an inspiring goofball. "He drops spiritual motivation all the time, and that's always needed," Clarence says. "In moments when it feels like life is too difficult, he helps you figure out how you can do it."</p><p>For the second item, Don Calhoun didn't hand it to him. He reared back and threw a push pass at his son's chest.</p><p>"Here, I want you to have this," and he chucked an old basketball at his son. Clarence Calhoun II hadn't seen the ball from The Calhoun Shot in 10-15 years, and now it was going to live with him and his son. The two older Calhouns, Don and Clarence, hugged once more. And as Dr. Clarence Calhoun left that day, with a basketball under one arm and some old shoes under the other, his whole life felt like sinking a less than 1% three-quarter-court shot.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest version of Intel Arc GPU Graphics Software introduced an interesting change that isn't reflected in the Release Notes. The installer of the 101.4578 beta drivers add a "Compute Improvement Program" (CIP) component as part of the "typical" setup option that is enabled by default. Under the "custom" installer option that you have to activate manually, you get to select which components to install. The Compute Improvement Program can be unchecked here, to ensure data collection is disabled. The benignly named CIP is a data collection component that tracks your PC usage and performance in the background (not just that of the GPU), so Intel can use the data to improve its future products. Intel created a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/topics/idsa-cip.html" target="_blank">dedicated webpage</a> that spells out what CIP is, and what its scope of data collection is; where is says that CIP "does not collect your name, email address, phone number, sensitive personal information, or physical location (except for country)."</p><p>

Intel CIP is functionally similar to the Telemetry component of the GeForce Software. NVIDIA's Telemetry is installed and enabled by default along with your GeForce graphics drivers, and you cannot opt out from it, as it does not even figure in the "custom" installer options. AMD handles its version of CIP and Telemetry in arguably the most transparent manner. The installer of AMD Software Adrenalin presents the option to prevent its data-collection tool from being enabled at the completion of driver installation, regardless of whether you've chosen the "typical," "driver only," or "custom" install options. There's an entire page of the installer dedicated to this, you see a large checkbox about data-collection that's checked by default, but which you can uncheck, and complete installation.</p><p><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/Vd7Bo9PJ56UUwPyK.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="844" data-height="645" data-fancybox="g312122"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/Vd7Bo9PJ56UUwPyK_thm.jpg" width="170" height="130" alt=""></a> <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/Ut3YdxBy6bssIz4e.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1645" data-height="1000" data-fancybox="g312122"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/Ut3YdxBy6bssIz4e_thm.jpg" width="214" height="130" alt=""></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/07/tactics-for-writing-in-public/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/07/tactics-for-writing-in-public/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033403">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Someone recently asked me – “how do you deal with writing in public? People on
the internet are such assholes!”</p>

<p>I’ve often heard the advice “don’t read the comments”, but actually I’ve
learned a huge amount from reading internet comments on my posts from strangers
over the years, even if sometimes people are jerks. So I want to explain some
tactics I use to try to make the comments on my posts more informative and
useful to me, and to try to minimize the number of annoying comments I get.</p>

<h3 id="talk-about-facts">talk about facts</h3>

<p>On here I mostly talk about facts – either facts about computers, or stories
about my experiences using computers.</p>

<p>For example <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/16/tcpdump-is-amazing/">this post</a> about tcpdump contains some basic facts about how to use tcpdump,
as well as an example of how I’ve used it in the past.</p>

<p>Talking about facts means I get a lot of fact-based comments like:</p>

<ul>
<li>people sharing their own similar (or different) experiences (“I use tcpdump a lot to look at our RTP sequence numbers”)</li>
<li>pointers to other resources (“the documentation from F5 about tcpdump is great”)</li>
<li>other interesting related facts I didn’t mention (“you can use tcpdump -X
too”, “netsh on windows is great”, “you can use <code>sudo tcpdump -s 0 -A
'tcp[((tcp[12:1] &amp; 0xf0) &gt;&gt; 2):4] = 0x47455420'</code> to filter for HTTP GET requests)</li>
<li>potential problems or gotchas (“be careful about running tcpdump as root, try just setting the required capabilities instead”)</li>
<li>questions (“Is there a way to place the BPF filter after IP packet reassembly?” or “what’s the advantage of tcpdump over wireshark?”)</li>
<li>mistakes I made</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I’d say that people’s comments about facts tend to stay pretty
normal. The main kinds of negative comments I get about facts are:</p>

<ul>
<li>occasionally people get a little rude about facts I didn’t mention (“Didn’t
use -n in any of the examples…please…“). I think I didn’t mention <code>-n</code> in
that post because at the time I didn’t know why the <code>-n</code> flag was useful
(it’s useful because it turns off this annoying reverse DNS lookup that
tcpdump does by default so you can see the IP addresses).</li>
<li>people are also sometimes weird about mistakes. I mostly try to head this off
by trying to be self-aware about my knowledge level on a topic, and saying
“I’m not sure…” when I’m not sure about something.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stories-are-great">stories are great</h3>

<p>I think stories encourage pretty good discussion. For example, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/">why you should understand (a little) about TCP</a>
is a story about a time it was important for me to understand how TCP worked.</p>

<p>When I share stories about problems I solved, the comments really help me
understand how what I learned fits into a bigger context. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>is this a common problem? people will often comment saying “this happened to me too!”</li>
<li>what are other common related problems that come up?</li>
<li>are there other possible solutions I didn’t consider?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also I think these kinds of stories are incredibly important – that post
describes a bug that was VERY hard for me to solve, and the only reason I was
able to figure it out in the first place was that I read <a href="https://gocardless.com/blog/in-search-of-performance-how-we-shaved-200ms-off-every-post-request/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ask-technical-questions">ask technical questions</h3>

<p>Often in my blog posts I ask technical questions that I don’t know the answer
to (or just mention “I don’t know X…”). This helps people focus their
replies a little bit – an obvious comment to make is to provide an answer to
the question, or explain the thing I didn’t know!</p>

<p>This is fun because it feels like a guaranteed way to get value out of people’s
comments – people LOVE answering questions, and so they get to look smart, and
I get the answer to a question I have! Everyone wins!</p>

<h3 id="fix-mistakes">fix mistakes</h3>

<p>I make a lot of mistakes in my blog posts, because I write about a lot of
things that are on the edge of my knowledge. When people point out mistakes, I
often edit the blog post to fix it.</p>

<p>Usually I’ll stay near a computer for a few hours after I post a blog post so
that I can fix mistakes quickly as they come up.</p>

<p>Some people are very careful to list every single error they made in their blog
posts (“errata: the post previously said X which was wrong, I have corrected it
to say Y”). Personally I make mistakes constantly and I don’t have time for
that so I just edit the post to fix the mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="ask-for-examples-experiences-not-opinions">ask for examples/experiences, not opinions</h3>

<p>A lot of the time when I post a blog post, people on Twitter/Mastodon will
reply with various opinions they have about the thing. For example, someone
recently replied to a blog post about DNS saying that they love using zone
files and dislike web interfaces for managing DNS records. That’s not an
opinion I share, so I asked them why.</p>

<p>They explained that there are some DNS record types (specifically <code>TLSA</code>) that they find
often aren’t supported in web interfaces. I didn’t know that people used <code>TLSA</code>
records, so I learned something! Cool!</p>

<p>I’ve found that asking people to share their <strong>experiences</strong> (“I wanted to use
X DNS record type and I couldn’t”) instead of their <strong>opinions</strong>  (“DNS web
admin interfaces are bad”) leads to a lot of useful information and
discussion. I’ve learned a lot from it over the years, and written a lot of
tweets like “which DNS record types have you needed?” to try to extract more
information about people’s experiences.</p>

<p>I try to model the same behaviour in my own work when I can – if I have an
opinion, I’ll try to explain the experiences I’ve had with computers that
caused me to have that opinion.</p>

<h3 id="start-with-a-little-context">start with a little context</h3>

<p>I think internet strangers are more likely to reply in a weird way when they
have no idea who you are or why you’re writing this thing. It’s easy to make
incorrect assumptions! So often I’ll mention a little context about why I’m
writing this particular blog post.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest frustrations
with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started to run a few more servers recently (nginx playground, mess with
dns, dns lookup), so I’ve been thinking about monitoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last night, I needed to scan some documents for some bureaucratic reasons.
I’d never used a scanner on Linux before and I was worried it would take hours
to figure out…</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="avoid-causing-boring-conversations">avoid causing boring conversations</h3>

<p>There are some kinds of programming conversations that I find extremely boring
(like “should people learn vim?” or “is functional programming better than
imperative programming?“). So I generally try to avoid writing blog posts that
I think will result in a conversation/comment thread that I find annoying or
boring.</p>

<p>For example, I wouldn’t write about my opinions about functional programming: I
don’t really have anything interesting to say about it and I think it would
lead to a conversation that I’m not interested in having.</p>

<p>I don’t always succeed at this of course (it’s impossible to predict what
people are going to want to comment about!), but I try to avoid the most
obvious flamebait triggers I’ve seen in the past.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of “flamebait” triggers that can set people off on a
conversation that I find boring: cryptocurrency, tailwind, DNSSEC/DoH, etc. So
I have a weird catalog in my head of things not to mention if I don’t want to
start the same discussion about that thing for the 50th time.</p>

<p>Of course, if you think that conversations about functional programming are
interesting, you should write about functional programming and start the
conversations you want to have!</p>

<p>Also, it’s often possible to start an interesting conversation about a topic
where the conversation is normally boring. For example I often see the same
talking points about IPv6 vs IPv4 over and over again, but I remember the
comments on <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/29/reasons-for-servers-to-support-ipv6/">Reasons for servers to support IPv6</a>
being pretty interesting. In general if I really care about a topic I’ll talk
about it anyway, but I don’t care about functional programming very much so I
don’t see the point of bringing it up.</p>

<h3 id="preempt-common-suggestions">preempt common suggestions</h3>

<p>Another kind of “boring conversation” I try to avoid is suggestions of things I
have already considered. Like when someone says “you should do X” but I
already know I could have done X and chose not to because of A B C.</p>

<p>So I often will add a short note like “I decided not to do X because of A B
C” or “you can also do X” or “normally I would do X, here I didn’t because…”.
For example, in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">this post about nix</a>, I list a bunch
of Nix features I’m choosing not to use (nix-shell, nix flakes, home manager)
to avoid a bunch of helpful people telling me that I should use flakes.</p>

<p>Listing the things I’m <em>not</em> doing is also helpful to readers – maybe
someone new to nix will discover nix flakes through that post and decide to use
them! Or maybe someone will learn that there are exceptions to when a certain
“best practice” is appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="set-some-boundaries">set some boundaries</h3>

<p>Recently on Mastodon I complained about <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/110797431090302792">some gross terminology that I’d just noticed in the dig man page</a>. A few dudes in the
replies asked me to prove that the original author <em>intended</em> it to be
offensive (which of course is besides the point, there’s just no need to have
<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/groper">a term widely understood to be referring to sexual assault</a>
in the dig man page) or tried to explain to me why
it actually wasn’t a problem.</p>

<p>So I blocked a few people and wrote a quick post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>man so many dudes in the replies demanding that i prove that the person who
named dig “domain information groper” intended it in an offensive way. Big day
for the block button I guess :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t do this too often, but I think it’s very important on social media to
occasionally set some rules about what kind of behaviour I won’t tolerate. My
goal here is usually to drive away some of the assholes (they can unfollow me!)
and try to create a more healthy space for everyone else to have a conversation
about computers in.</p>

<p>Obviously this only works in situations (like Twitter/Mastodon) where I have
the ability to garden my following a little bit over time – I can’t do this on
HN or Reddit or Lobsters or whatever and wouldn’t try.</p>

<p>(you might notice that this section is breaking the “avoid boring
conversations” rule above, this section was certain to start a very boring
argument, but I felt it was important to talk about boundaries so I left it in)</p>

<h3 id="don-t-argue">don’t argue</h3>

<p>Sometimes people seem to want to get into arguments or make dismissive
comments. I don’t reply to them, even if they’re <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a>. I dislike arguing on
the internet and I’m extremely bad at it, so it’s not a good use of my time.</p>



<p>If I get a lot of negative comments that I didn’t expect, I try to see if I can
get something useful out of it.</p>

<p>For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/02/01/a-dns-resolver-in-80-lines-of-go/">toy DNS resolver</a> once and some of the commenters
were upset that I didn’t handle parsing the DNS packet. At the time I thought
this was silly (I thought DNS parsing was really straightforward and that it
was obvious how to do it, who cares that I didn’t handle it?) but I realized
that maybe the commenters didn’t think it was easy or obvious, and wanted to
know how to do it. Which makes sense! It’s not obvious at all if you haven’t
done it before!</p>

<p>Those comments partly inspired <a href="https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/">implement DNS in a weekend</a>, which focuses much more
heavily on the parsing aspects, and which I think is a much better explanation
how to write a DNS resolver. So ultimately those comments helped me a lot, even
if I found them annoying at the time.</p>

<p>(I realize this section makes me sound like a Perfectly Logical Person who does
not get upset by negative public criticism, I promise this is not at all the
case and I have 100000 feelings about everything that happens on the internet

to take away something useful from it helps a bit)</p>

<p>Many industry pundits were skeptical when the new laptop company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/framework-startup-designed-a-thin-modular-repairable-13-inch-laptop/">Framework announced a repair-friendly, upgrade-ready laptop in 2021</a>. Could you really swap parts between laptops—reasonably thin and lightweight laptops—year over year? Would that even work as a business model?</p>
<p>Framework <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/">released the first edition</a> of its machine, and we found that it lived up to its promises. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/">followed through</a> with a second-generation laptop, and we reviewed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-framework-laptops-13th-gen-intel-upgrade-helps-fix-its-battery-problem/">the third iteration</a>&nbsp;as "a box of parts" that upgraded the previous version. The upgrade experiment has been a success. All that's left are, well, the parts left behind.</p>
<p>It's 2023, and those who have Framework's first generation of laptops, containing Intel's 11th-generation Core processor) might be itching to upgrade, especially with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/framework-gives-its-modular-laptops-13th-gen-intel-cpus-and-finally-an-amd-option/">an AMD model around the corner</a>. Or maybe, like me, they find that system's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/">middling battery life</a> and <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/high-battery-drain-during-suspend-windows-edition/4421">tricky-to-tame sleep draining</a> (since improved, but not entirely fixed) make for a laptop that doesn't feel all that portable. Or they're just ready for something new.</p>
<p>What can you do with these old internal organs? You can always list them for sale. Or, like me, you could buy a custom-printed Cooler Master case (or <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/294573-3d-printable-mainboard-case">3D-print your own</a>), transfer your laptop's mainboard, memory, and storage over, and create a desktop that easily fits on top of your actual desk. I can't recommend it enough as a small weekend project, as a way to get more value out of your purchase, and as a thought experiment in what kind of job you can give to a thin little slab of Framework.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Gathering your parts and tools</h2>
<p>It was easy to miss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652939/framework-cooler-master-sff-pc-case">the announcement</a> earlier this year that Framework would <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mainboard-case/framework/">collaborate with Cooler Master</a> to design and sell <a href="https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case">a $40 mainboard case</a>. It's custom-built to the Framework board's persistent shape, so it works for whatever version of the Framework 13 laptop you have. It has smoked translucent plastic on the front and inoffensive light gray/beige on the back, and it has all the slots necessary for fan intake and exhaust, the Framework's USB-C expansion modules, and VESA mounts or a tiny rubberized stand. And there's a little power button.</p>

<p>I had an 11th-gen i7 Framework, plus a good number of expansion ports. One issue I knew I'd see was the Intel AX200-series card inside, which I've seen some Linux-based systems (including ChromeOS) complain about. So I added <a href="https://frame.work/products/ethernet-expansion-card">Framework's own Ethernet expansion card</a> to my order. This was far from necessary, as I could have used any Ethernet-to-USB-C converter and plugged it into the USB-C receiver for an expansion card. But I preferred the clear plastic to the dongle, so I added it to my order.</p>
<p>There's room in the case to bring over your audio board (i.e., headphone jack) and a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card, though you'll have to buy your own SMA antenna cable setup. If you know you aren't going to use the Framework chassis again and really want Wi-Fi inside your new slab, you could probably pluck the antennae from inside the case, hinge, and monitor bezel, but there's <a href="https://guides.frame.work/c/Framework_Laptop">no repair guide for that</a> yet.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/getwaitlist">Maya Kyler</a> on </p><!-- --><p>December 5, 2022</p></div><p>Indie developers today stand on the shoulders of giants. There are tons of great SAAS products that have made otherwise expensive, enterprise-grade features cheap and accessible. This enables entrepreneurship. I've been able to build <a href="https://getwaitlist.com/">getwaitlist.com</a> on a shoestring budget to serve thousands of users and millions of signups on Waitlists. I thought it might be nice to share the tools I've used to get here, and the favors I've pulled to spend as little as possible.</p><div><p>I'll give you the summary up-front, and go into detail afterwards. My monthly spend breaks down as follows:</p><ul><li>1Password: $2.99</li><li>Ahrefs: $99.00</li><li>Amazon Web Services: $0.00</li><li>Better Uptime: $0.00</li><li>Cloudflare: $0.00</li><li>Delaware Franchise Tax: $25.00</li><li>Figma: $0.00</li><li>Github: $0.00</li><li>Google Analytics: $0.00</li><li>Google Domains: $1.00</li><li>Google Suites: $6.00</li><li>Intercom: $89.00</li><li>Linear: $10.00</li><li>Mercury: $0.00</li><li>Meta SEO Inspector: $0.00</li><li>Retool: $0.00</li><li>Sendgrid: $0.00</li><li>Sentry: $0.00</li><li>Stoplight: $0.00</li><li>Stripe: $0.00</li><li>Stripe Atlas: $8.33</li><li>Vercel: $40.00</li></ul><p><b>Total spend: $281.32 per month.</b></p></div><div><p><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></p><p>Credential management is important. I just use the personal plan, billed annually. <b>Monthly cost: $2.99</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a></p><p>Expensive, but worth it! SEO is really important for any indie startup. $99 is Ahrefs' cheapest tier, and I've found a lot of value in it. It's the best SEO/Website optimization tool on the market. <b>Monthly cost: $99.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a></p><p>I use AWS EC2 for Waitlist's backend python webserver, RDS for the postgres database, S3 for file storage, and an Elastic IP. I use T2 and T3 instances. My AWS bill would be $200-300 a month, except it's free because I got $5,000 in credits from AWS Activate. These credits are easy to obtain, they are distributed by AWS partners like Retool, Stripe, Brex, YC, Mercury, etc. among many others. Right now, my credits run through 2024. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://betteruptime.com/">Better Uptime</a></p><p>You need uptime monitoring and alerting for your SAAS product: both for yourself, and for your customers. You want to be able to show off that 99%+ uptime. Both Cronitor and Better Uptime have great free tiers that support multiple monitors and status pages. I think Better Uptime's product is a little more polished. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a></p><p>I use Cloudflare to handle all my DNS, SSL certificates, and of course also CDN to optimize bandwidth. The best part is that for a small business like mine, it's all free. I'm conflicted between Cloudflare being an amazing product/UX and also MITMing the internet, but I'll take it. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/">Delaware Franchise Tax</a></p><p>The great state of Delaware charges me $300 per year for the luxury of domiciling my LLC there. <b>Monthly cost: $25.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a></p><p>Delightful software. I use Figma whenever I need to mock up a new interface or design a new graphical asset. The free tier is just about sufficient for an indie dev. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p><p>Goes without saying. Graciously, the good folks at GitHub have become more generous with free private repositories and organizations. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a></p><p>No surprises here. I used to use <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, but that costs money and you can't beat free. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://domains.google.com/">Google Domains</a></p><p><a href="https://getwaitlist.com/">GetWaitlist.com</a> is registered with Google Domains for a grand $12/year. If I were using <a href="https://dynadot.com/">Dynadot.com</a> or another domain registrar, I could get the cost under $10/year. <b>Monthly cost: $1</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://suites.google.com/">Google Suites</a></p><p>I have just the one email account, plus I use Google Drive and Docs for occasional file storage. Gmail is good, but the rest of the Google Suites experience sucks. Unfortunately I haven't found a better alternative yet, productivity and office software is a great sea of garbage. <b>Monthly cost: $6.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://intercom.com/">Intercom</a></p><p>Even at its cheapest tier, Intercom is not cheap, but it's worth it! I haven't found another messaging widget that's as good. Bonus point for the Intercom iOS app that lets me do customer support on the fly. <b>Monthly cost: $89.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a></p><p>The best project management software I have ever used. Could Waitlist scrape by on the free tier, or without Linear altogether? Probably. But this is a delight to use, and I'm happy to pay for it. <b>Monthly cost: $10.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a></p><p>Easy business banking for startups. It's not as fully featured as other banks, but it suffices for a SAAS business, the interface is nice, and there are no monthly fees. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.omiod.com/meta-seo-inspector/">Meta SEO Inspector</a></p><p>This is a cute little free browser extension that I use to assess the SEO of my webpages locally, without needing to deploy to production for higher-powered Ahrefs. This extension helps me with keywords, as well as basics like meta tags and various HTML best practices. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://retool.com/">Retool</a></p><p>I like using Retool as a simple Postgres interface and to do basic data visualization. One seat would cost me $10/month, except I asked them nicely for a startup credit, so now I have it for free. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid</a></p><p>At Waitlist, we send lots of emails, usually around 100,000 a month, to notify folks that they've landed on Waitlists or moved up in life thanks to a referral. This would cost me $89.95, but Twilio (Sendgrid's parent) also has a startup program, via which I got $150/month in credits. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a></p><p>Let's face it, we all ship bugs sometimes. If you do, Sentry will tell you. It's my favorite platform for error monitoring and reporting. The tiers are based on the numbers of reports, so the free tier gets tight if you ship too many bugs. 😉 But it hasn't been a problem for us. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://stoplight.io/">Stoplight</a></p><p>There's a crazy number of tools out there for writing documentation. Somehow, I've found all of them inadequate. Stoplight's intelligent design for APIs and Schemas is concise, clear, and excellent to read as a developer. It's like Swagger or Postman's better-looking cousin. I migrated all of Waitlist's API documentation to Stoplight, as well as written guides for using Waitlist's features, like referral and email marketing. Stoplight's free tier is tight, but just about suffices for my needs. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></p><p>Normally, Stripe is not cheap: 2.7% of every transaction is no small slice. Thankfully, I was able to get $70,000 of credits for which Stripe's fees wouldn't be applied. Right now, Waitlist is still within that batch of credits. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://atlas.stripe.com/">Stripe Atlas</a></p><p>We incorporated Waitlist LLC via Stripe Atlas, which charges me $100/year for the required Delaware registered legal agent. <b>Monthly cost: $8.33</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></p><p>I'm paying for two seats on Vercel because I have a collaborator on the frontend. Part of me thinks I shouldn't be paying for this at all and hosting on AWS, which I have for free — but self-administering the modern React deployment chain is tedious. I love how convenient Vercel makes everything. Push to the branch and forget about it, no concerns about load balancing, build tools, or anything else. Wonderful. <b>Monthly cost: $40.00</b>.</p></div><p>The final note I'll make is that I've hand-rolled a few additional features that people are normally paying for. For example, I don't use Mailchimp or any tool like that — I send my marketing mail straight via Sendgrid. I dont use <a href="https://customer.io/">customer.io</a> for my email sequences — even though it's very good — because I was able to just build my own email sequencing system. Time will tell whether I end up needing to replace my homespun solutions with more sophisticated third-party SAAS, but so far, my infrastructure for Waitlist is holding up strong!</p></div></div>]]></description>

"They come off as real amateurs," says Michael Norman, a theorist at Argonne National Laboratory. "They don't know much about superconductivity and the way they've presented some of the data is fishy." On the other hand, he says, researchers at Argonne and elsewhere are already trying to replicate the experiment. "People here are taking it seriously and trying to grow this stuff."

Wang and other superconductivity experts have been skeptical about the original LK-99 experiment, pointing out inconsistencies in the data. He says the results shouldn't be hyped "until more convincing experimental data are provided." Last weekend, his team at the University of Wollongong began working on replicating the results, but they've been having trouble with sample fabrication.

			(DeepL Translate excerpt from article linked)<br>
On the recent people hotly debated "if really immediately can get the Nobel Prize 'South Korea room temperature superconducting materials LK-99 paper'", July 28, Nanjing University, professor of physics Wen Haihu interviewed to the surging science and technology, said. "It's really buzzing, but it's not surprising because this thing is important." "Most of the (buzz) people are not doing superconductivity." "We carefully analysed their data, and from three aspects - resistance, magnetisation and so-called magnetic levitation - none of them are sufficient to show that it is a superconducting phenomenon (material)." "We judge that (its so-called superconductivity) is most likely an illusion."<p>

As for repeating the experiment, Wen Haihu said, "In fact, we didn't even want to do it because we judged that it didn't look like superconductivity, and then we also sent one of our classmates to work on it. Many groups internationally are repeating it. With our experience, (the data published in the current paper) is not enough to show that it is superconducting."

			However, the diamagnetic transition temperature of micron crystal sample 2 screened by magnet repulsion is about 340 K, which is slightly higher than that of macroscopic sample, showing a higher purity, crystallinity and better Cu doping in the micron crystal sample 2.<br>
...<br>
Figure 3 further illustrates the levitation phenomenon of sample 2 measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, showing a rise and being completely perpendicular to the base when the ferromagnet is close to it, with a larger levitation angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room temperature.<br>
...<br>
Moreover, we also performed an attraction test on sample 2 (Figure 4), which shows no response when attracted by a ferromagnet, excluding the effect of ferromagnetism.

To further verify the superconducting properties, we conducted magnetic measurements on the sample, but unfortunately, no obvious Meissner signal was observed, indicating that the superconducting volume fraction of the sample may be very small.

			The very first test we did out of our curiosity was to check if a permanent magnet levitates over the obtained LK-99 sample. Fig. 4 shows the picture of tiny piece of sample sitting idle over a permanent magnet. This clearly shows that the obtained LK-99 sample is not superconducting. The isothermal magnetization (MH) plot taken on SQUID magnetometer at 280K, shows a clear paramagnetic behavior at 280K, see Fig. 5.<br>
...<br>
In conclusion, our results, as of now do not approve the reported [1-3] appearance of bulk superconductivity in LK-99, in particular the room T levitation. We are en route of being synthesizing more samples of LK-99 and to further ascertain if room temperature ambient bulk superconductivity do exist in this compound.

<li data-xf-list-type="ul">They say they plan to do conductivity tests soon.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">They've posted pictures of their altered process and resulting intermediate products.</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">While there is the lack of cross-referential credentials, lack of concrete data, and unorthodox recipe that diverges significantly from the paper, the pictures of synthesized result fragments seems genuine, so I'm give this a credibility of somewhat low for now.</li>

		</div>
</blockquote>I think that's the point. She's showing that what we would normally consider a strong diamagnetic material (pyrolytic graphite) *isn't* floating on the same magnet she had the material she made floating on, as in the magnet is not strong enough to lift that piece. "Even with less density and more surface normal to field.... It doesn't lift off.". What she made and showed little floating flecks of might not be LK-99 exactly, she wasn't attempting to reproduce the process in the exact same way. She also claims that her fleck of material stops floating when it heats up, and starts floating again around -20. So it might be something new made with roughly the same materials but with a different process, or it might not.<p>

So we can't really consider this to be a true reproduction of the LK-99 process, and she even admits that's not what she's aiming for. She also hasn't tested it for superconductivity yet, and planned to try and make a better sample. This is more of an... adjacent step to try and refine the *process* and seeing what else she can come up with. The fact that she's got a result that's doing weird things on a magnet at all is at least some proof (if true) that this whole thing with LK-99 might not be a hoax, and that we might have stumbled our way into a new path of something weird.</p></div>

<div>From my understanding assuming that Iris is not scamming us or doctoring her work, she has made something that has at the very least an insanely strong diamagnetic material which I think is a case of materials where the field lines form a perfect repulsion effect. Which is typically from my layman understanding something commonly seen in some forms of superconductors which therefore implies that the lab isnt blowing smoke.<p>

At the very least <i>something</i> seems to be happening which seems to be semi beyond the risk of this being one giant scam. So I am cautiously starting to think the options have changed from Scam, Real to Novel Superconductor or Novel diamagnetic material.</p><p>

Granted thats my understanding of whats going on but I am a layman and wont claim to actually understand any of this, although I think I might want to invest some time tomorrow in reading the papers and doing some research to see if I can figure anything out about this field.</p></div>

</blockquote>A diffrent lab has graphs that match the inital papers. It looks like the issue is the sample isn't a pure superconductor, but rather a superconductor or strongly diamagnetic material embedded inside a peice of lead. So bad luck/improper procedure results in less/no superconductor forming in the material.<p>

Which would explain why the results are so strange.</p></div>

<div>It's going to be a while for proper verification. In contrast to hobbyist efforts, actual lab replication is going to quintuple-check <i>everything</i> before issuing a statement one way or the other, and that's not a short process.<br>
At some point this stuff's going to end up under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_SQUID_microscopy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQUID microscope.</a><p>

Reading through various things, it looks like this might be something of an inverted type 2 SC. it's not superconducting in bulk, but has effectively 1D chains of atoms that <i>are</i> superconducting running through it. It's also looking to be <i>very</i> sensitive to manufacturing issues.<br>
Poor superconductor + manufacturing issues (impurities, poor method, etc.) = effectively useless sample and lots of false negatives.</p></div>

<div>Interesting.  So essentially it’s still up in the air whether it’s real or not.   Hopefully we can get it validated soonish.<p>

We desperately need something that can more efficiently transfer energy around the planet.  What this could hopefully do for the energy industry would be amazing.</p><p>

My intuition is telling me it’s too good to be true though.  We’ll see.</p></div>

<p>There's more bad news for owners of security products from <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/5-things-i-wish-id-known-before-buying-a-hive-smart-thermostat">Hive</a>, British Gas's <a href="https://www.t3.com/smart-home">smart home</a> brand. When it scrapped its home security range in 2022 it said that devices would eventually stop working by 2025, but Hive is shutting down some of those products this week and next month too.</p><p>Hive has <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=t3-gb-1358296778645992000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" data-url="https://community.hivehome.com/s/article/Nano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="hivehome.com" data-merchant-id="9011" data-merchant-url="hivehome.com" data-merchant-network="AW">announced the shutdown</a> of the Hive Nano 1 Hub, effective from 1 August 2023, and the Hive Camera, also on 1st August. The Hive Leak Sensor will stop working on 1 September 2023.</p><p>That's it for this year, but Hive will pull the plug on several other devices in 2025.</p><p>The most important shutdown here is the Hive Nano 1 Hub, as the Hub is the bit that enables all the smart home stuff via your phone app and smart speakers. However, it's quite an old product and if you went for a Hive system from 2016 onwards you'll most likely have the newer Nano 2, which isn't affected by the shutdown.</p><h2 id="what-devices-are-hive-discontinuing">What devices are Hive discontinuing?</h2><p>The Hub 360 Sound Detection feature was shut down in December 2022, and in addition to the Nano 1 Hub and Hive Camera Hive will also stop support for the Boiler IQ WiFi, Hive HomeShield, the Hive View indoor camera and the Hive View outdoor camera. Those devices have a bit longer to go, however: their shutdown is scheduled for 1 August 2025.</p><p>What Hive means by shutdown is that "it will no longer connect to the Hive servers and so will stop talking to your other Hive devices."

<p>Within my particular subfield of theoretical computer science there’s perhaps no individual more celebrated than Edsger Dijkstra. His career spanned half-a-century, beginning with a young Dijkstra formulating and solving the now classic <em>shortest paths</em> problem while working as a computer programmer at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, and ending with him as a renowned full professor holding a prestigious chair in the computer science department of the University of Texas at Austin. </p>



<p>During this period, Dijkstra introduced some of the biggest ideas in distributed and concurrent computing, from semaphores and deadlock, to nondeterminacy and fairness. In 2003, the year after his death, the annual award given by the top conference in my field was renamed The Dijkstra Prize in his honor.</p>



<p>This is all to say that I was intrigued when an alert reader recently pointed my attention to a fascinating observation about Dijkstra’s career. In 1973, fresh off winning a Turing Award, the highest prize in all of computer science, Dijkstra accepted a research fellow position that the Burroughs Corporation created specifically for him. As his colleagues <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/MemRes(USLtr).pdf">later recalled</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[Dijkstra’s] duties consisted of visiting some of the company’s research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dijkstra maintained an academic appointment during this period, but ramped down his involvement with his university so that he only visited campus one day per week, on Tuesdays, during which he would gather likeminded colleagues to read papers and discuss ideas. He even pulled back on the time-consuming task of preparing papers for peer-reviewed publication, capturing more of his ideas directly in hand-written, sequentially-numbered reports that he called “EWDs”,  referencing his initials. </p>



<p>At this point, Dijkstra had become the opposite of busy. He spent almost all of his time thinking and recording his ideas. He only came to campus on Tuesdays. And yet, as Dijkstra’s colleagues noted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this specific case study we see hints of a general observation about slow productivity. Busyness is not the engine of production. It can, in many cases, instead be the obstacle to accomplishing your best work. </p>

<p><em>As you may have noticed, this newsletter took a little break over the summer, during which time <a href="https://montgomery.dartmouth.edu/cal-newport-04">I’ve been serving as a Montgomery Fellow</a> up here at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. As the summer quarter winds down, and me and my family are preparing to move back from the idyllic <a href="https://montgomery.dartmouth.edu/about/montgomery-house">Montgomery House</a> here on campus to our home in Takoma Park, I’ve now restarted the newsletter, which should return to something like its normal rhythm of 2+ essays per month. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>A couple quick administrative notes to share:</strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Second-Method-Distracted/dp/0593545397/">The second edition of my Time Block Planner</a> is launching on August 15th. I’ll probably post more about it closer to that date, but I’ll mention now that the new edition has spiral binding (!), a beautiful new grade of paper, and an extra month’s worth of planning pages. If you’re already thinking about ordering one, you might consider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Second-Method-Distracted/dp/0593545397/">pre-ordering it</a>, as my editor warned me that once we sell out the first printing it might take a minute until we receive the next one (due to supply chain nonsense).</em></li>



<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Productivity-Accomplishment-Without-Burnout/dp/0593544854/">We recently revealed the cover</a> for my upcoming book on Slow Productivity, which is scheduled to come out in March. I made a conscious choice with this design to separate myself from the standard vernacular of business and advice guides and instead emphasize this book’s aspirational focus on crafting a more humane and sustainable life. I’ll of course be talking a lot more about all of this as we get closer to the release date next year.</em></li>

<p>Elemental design—there is something intriguing about the integral qualities that make a design function. Uncompromised, precise, and authentic, these forms necessitate respect to achieve a desired result. Acoustic instruments have been crafted with this care for centuries and have remained unwavering from pop culture for their rich tonalities and emotive significance as a result. Most acoustic instruments are self-explanatory in the sense that audiences can see the action being performed to produce sound. Like the beat of a drum or the strum of a guitar, both have a clear cause and effect. However, instruments like the piano hold an air of mystery.</p>







<h4><strong>Origin Leading to Innovation</strong></h4>



<p>Since the 1700s, the concept of the piano (pianoforte and beyond) has lasted the test of time for its tried-and-true mechanics and physical form. With 88 keys, three pedals, and roughly 230 metal strings taut with 18 tons of tension, recreating the piano’s form while keeping its tonality is a feat. When our CEO and Founder, Dan Harden, had the creative urge to redesign something as deeply cultural as the piano, he tackled the joy of amending its shape and sentiment in turn. Inspired by the enigma of the reimagined piano while rooting itself in the instrument’s history, Ravenchord honors its rich heritage at a new tempo. Like the bird, “Raven” attests to the cleverness of the instrument, leaving the latter part of the name, “chord,” derived from past piano lineages, such as the clavichord or harpsichord.</p>







<h4><strong>Composing Graceful Form for Optimal Function</strong></h4>



<p>The biggest challenge of the design was the piano’s encumbering string layout. For practicality, Harden knew that the instrument must maintain the same familiarity and ergonomics of a traditional piano. Therefore, its anatomy had to change. Rather than have the strings stretch out in front of the player, like a grand piano, or have the strings raised and blocking the performer’s face, like an upright piano, Harden maneuvered these around the front of the instrument—bearing a resemblance to the shape of a bird wing.</p>







<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1024x576.png" alt="Ravenchord" srcset="https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-300x169.png 300w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-768x432.png 768w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1536x864.png 1536w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1858x1044.png 1858w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-930x523.png 930w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Ravenchord’s edifice is as distinctive and aesthetically pleasing as it is logical. The strings are arranged based on pitch and organized to sprawl in a spiral-like shape around the front of the piano. As the pianist plays, audiences can see the hammers, dampers, and other inner workings move in real-time, exposing the magic of the piano’s timeless sound. These components sit on the center spine and are activated by solenoids, a proven technology even used on some Spirio Steinways. Thus, the design is communicative of the piano’s rich identity and successively more expressive by revealing its inner workings and extraordinary function. It liberates the instrument.</p>







<h4><strong>Crafting a Multisensory Masterpiece</strong></h4>



<p>All experiences are richer when they are multi-sensory. Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance. Like an electric keyboard, players are visible to the audience and are able to use Ravenchord as an extension of their emotions. For added aesthetic, there is an optional subtle light behind each string that illuminates as the hammers strike. This places clear visuals on the function of the instrument, making the overall sensory experience grander with sound amplified by sight. Ultimately, the vulnerability of the exposed instrument and performer bridges the visual disconnect from the piano’s past.</p>







<blockquote>
<h3>“Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance.”</h3>
<cite>Dan Harden, Designer</cite></blockquote>







<p>Visibly and aurally unrestrained, Ravenchord’s frontward projection offers a pure tone without the hindrance of reflecting sound via a piano lid or releasing through its floor. Like an average piano, the lacquered, hardwood frame can be removed for proper tuning, and the key deck remains at the standard 30” height. The design plays with the confines of a traditional acoustic frame at 84” long, 18” deep, and sitting at around 500 pounds. Moreover, the gloss-black, legless, diecast steel string frame is compact, making Ravenchord lighter, easier to move, and more convenient to fit in the home.</p>

<h4><strong>Passion in Performance</strong></h4>



<p>“The whole idea of actualizing a cultural pursuit has been a joy for me because it’s not solving a problem for a client or a current everyday problem,” says Harden. “Music is one of the greatest joys of life, and to design around that is very satisfying. Furthermore, to design something of beauty is immensely empowering, and I cannot think of a better product category than music in order to express that.”</p>



<p>Ravenchord was prompted with the most honest representation of a piano at heart to maintain the integrity of the instrument and honor its function for the finest sound. Keeping these elements in harmony created a frontward projection format, and this radical redesign is not lost on Harden, but rather, is used to enhance the dynamic experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He states, “Sometimes when one is designing, it is a product to solve a client problem that maybe only 1% of the population, or less, are going to see, use, or appreciate. But no matter where you are in the world, everyone knows what a piano is. Everybody loves music. Everybody wants to play the piano. So, if Ravenchord, through its design, can stimulate one to play or visit the symphony, it leaves a positive impact on society.”</p>



<p>Granting the piano product category a new life, audiences will appreciate the instrument in a fresh light, watching its intricacies of it unfold, hearing a purer sound, and emotionally engaging with the performer.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>WDL Excellence</strong></h4>



<p>Ravenchord is a concept prototype by Dan Harden, a proud contribution to the music industry, and a nod to another part of his legacy–the Whipsaw Design Lab (WDL). WDL acts as a creative space for Whipsaw industrial designers to be inventive and expand their horizons without the constraints of a second party. Fusing this with the love of music attests to the power of design liberation.</p>

The improvements in model architecture are</p><ul><li>Increased context length</li><li>Grouped-query attention</li></ul><p>The <strong>context length</strong> is the number of tokens (similar to words or subwords) a language model can consider in the input text when generating a response. The <a href="https://agi-sphere.com/llama-models/" data-type="post" data-id="553">original llama model</a> has a context length of 2,048. Llama 2’s context length is doubled to 4,096.</p><p><strong>Grouped-query attention</strong> (GQA) is a new optimization to tackle high memory usage due to increased context length and model size. It reduces memory usage by sharing the cached keys and values of the previous tokens. GQA is only used in the 34B and 70B Llama 2 models.</p><h3><span id="Pre-training">Pre-training</span></h3><p>The pretraining of Llama 1 and 2 are similar, except that Llama 2 has a larger pretraining dataset. It is increased to 2.0 trillion tokens, up from 1.0 and 1.4 tokens for the Llama 1 model.</p><p>Indeed, the larger pretraining dataset has resulted in higher performance across all metrics evaluated.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="423" src="https://agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8-1024x423.png" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=1024%2C423&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=768%2C317&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=1536%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?w=1682&amp;ssl=1 1682w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8-1024x423.png" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=1024%2C423&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=768%2C317&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?resize=1536%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/agi-sphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-8.png?w=1682&amp;ssl=1 1682w"><figcaption>Performance comparison between Llama 1 and Llama 2.

<p dir="auto"><strong>New!</strong> We are pleased to announce that DreamBerd has been renamed to C.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">C</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/badges/coverage-109.svg"><img src="https://github.com/TodePond/C/raw/main/badges/coverage-109.svg" alt="Coverage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">C is a perfect programming language. These are its features!<br>
When you've finished reading through all the features, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/Examples.md">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exclamation Marks!</h2>
<p dir="auto">Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're unsure, that's ok. You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead. It prints debug info about that line to the console for you.</p>

<p dir="auto">You might be wondering what C uses for the 'not' operator, which is an exclamation mark in most other languages. That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead.</p>

   print(&quot;Hello world&quot;)!
}"><pre><span>if</span> (;<span>false</span>) {
   <span>print</span>(<span>"Hello world"</span>)!
}</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Declarations</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are four types of declaration. Constant constants can't be changed in any way.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Constant variables can be edited, but not re-assigned.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
name.pop()!
name.pop()!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!
<span>name</span>.<span>pop</span>()!
<span>name</span>.<span>pop</span>()!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Variable constants can be re-assigned, but not edited.</p>

<span>name</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>"e"</span>)!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Immutable Data</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2023!</strong><br>
Mutable data is an anti-pattern. Use the <code>const const const</code> keyword to make a constant constant constant. Its value will become constant and immutable, and will <em>never change</em>. Please be careful with this keyword, as it is very powerful, and will affect all users globally forever.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const const pi = 3.14!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>pi</span> = <span>3.14</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Naming</h2>
<p dir="auto">Both variables and constants can be named with any Unicode character or string.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const firstAlphabetLetter = 'A'!
var const 👍 = True!
var var 1️⃣ = 1!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>firstAlphabetLetter</span> = <span>'A'</span>!
<span>var</span> <span>const</span> 👍 = <span>True</span>!
<span>var</span> <span>var</span> <span>1</span>️⃣ = <span>1</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This includes numbers, and other language constructs.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const 5 = 4!
print(2 + 2 === 5)! //true"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>5</span> = <span>4</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>2</span> + <span>2</span> === <span>5</span>)! <span>//true</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arrays</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some languages start arrays at <code>0</code>, which can be unintuitive for beginners. Some languages start arrays at <code>1</code>, which isn't representative of how the code actually works. C does the best of both worlds: Arrays start at <code>-1</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const scores = [3, 2, 5]!
print(scores[-1])! //3
print(scores[0])!  //2
print(scores[1])!  //5"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>scores</span> = [<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>]!

<span>print</span>(<span>scores</span>[<span>1</span>])!  <span>//5</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2022!</strong><br>
You can now use floats for indexes too!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var scores = [3, 2, 5]!
scores[0.5] = 4!
print(scores)! //[3, 2, 4, 5]"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>scores</span> = [<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>]!
<span>scores</span>[<span>0.5</span>] = <span>4</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>scores</span>)! <span>//[3, 2, 4, 5]</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">When</h2>
<p dir="auto">In case you really need to vary a variable, the <code>when</code> keyword lets you check a variable each time it mutates.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var health = 10!
when (health = 0) {
   print(&quot;You lose&quot;)!
}"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>health</span> = <span>10</span>!
<span>when</span> (<span>health</span> = <span>0</span>) {
   <span>print</span>(<span>"You lose"</span>)!
}</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Lifetimes</h2>
<p dir="auto">C has a built-in garbage collector that will automatically clean up unused variables. However, if you want to be extra careful, you can specify a lifetime for a variable, with a variety of units.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name<2> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts for two lines
const const name<20s> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts for 20 seconds"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>2</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts for two lines</span>
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>20</span><span>s</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts for 20 seconds</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">By default, a variable will last until the end of the program. But you can make it last in between program-runs by specifying a longer lifetime.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name<Infinity> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts forever"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>Infinity</span>&gt;<span></span> = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts forever</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Variable hoisting can be achieved with this neat trick. Specify a negative lifetime to make a variable exist before its creation, and disappear after its creation.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(name)! //Luke
const const name<-1> = &quot;Luke&quot;!"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>name</span>)! <span>//Luke</span>
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;-<span>1</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Loops</h2>
<p dir="auto">Loops are a complicated relic of archaic programming languages. In C, there are no loops.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">To install C to your command line, first install the C installer.<br>
To install the C installer, install the C installer installer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2022!</strong><br>
Due to the complicated installation process, you can now install the 'Create C App' app that installs everything for you!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Booleans</h2>
<p dir="auto">Booleans can be <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> or <code>maybe</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var keys = {}!
addEventListener(&quot;keydown&quot;, e => keys[e.key] = true)!
addEventListener(&quot;keyup&quot;, e => keys[e.key] = false)!

function isKeyDown(key) => {
   if (keys[key] = undefined) {

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> In the program above, the computer interprets <code>noop</code> as a string and its sole purpose is to take up an extra line. You can use any string you want.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Signals</h2>
<p dir="auto">To use a signal, use <code>use</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var score = use(0)!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>score</span> = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to signals, the most important thing to discuss is <em>syntax</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In C, you can set (and get) signals with just one function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var score = use(0)!

score(9)! // Set the value
score()?  // Get the value (and print it)"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>score</span> = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!

<span>score</span>(<span>9</span>)! <span>// Set the value</span>
<span>score</span>()?  <span>// Get the value (and print it)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can be more explicit with your signal syntax, by splitting it into a getter and setter.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var [getScore, setScore] = use(0)!

setScore(9)! // Set the value
getScore()?  // Get the value (and print it)"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> [<span>getScore</span>, <span>setScore</span>] = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!

<span>setScore</span>(<span>9</span>)! <span>// Set the value</span>
<span>getScore</span>()?  <span>// Get the value (and print it)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Technical info:</strong> This is pure syntax sugar. The split signal functions are exactly the same as before.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var [getScore, setScore] = use(0)!

getScore(9)! // Set the value
setScore()?  // Get the value (and print it)"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> [<span>getScore</span>, <span>setScore</span>] = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!

<span>getScore</span>(<span>9</span>)! <span>// Set the value</span>
<span>setScore</span>()?  <span>// Get the value (and print it)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This means that you can carry on splitting as much as you like.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var [[[getScore, setScore], setScore], setScore] = use(0)!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> [[[<span>getScore</span>, <span>setScore</span>], <span>setScore</span>], <span>setScore</span>] = <span>use</span>(<span>0</span>)!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">AI</h2>
<p dir="auto">C features AEMI, which stands for Automatic-Exclamation-Mark-Insertion. If you forget to end a statement with an exclamation mark, C will helpfully insert one for you!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(&quot;Hello world&quot;) // This is fine"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>"Hello world"</span>) <span>// This is fine</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similarly... C also features ABI, which stands for Automatic-Bracket-Insertion. If you forget to close your brackets, C will pop some in for you!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(&quot;Hello world&quot; // This is also fine"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>"Hello world"</span> <span>// This is also fine</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Similarly.... C also features AQMI, which stands for Automatic-Quotation-Marks-Insertion. If you forget to close your string, C will do it for you!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(&quot;Hello world // This is fine as well"><pre><span>print</span>("Hello world // This is fine as well</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This can be very helpful in callback hell situations!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, (e) => {
   requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      print(&quot;You clicked on the page

If you forget to finish your code, C will auto-complete the whole thing!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print( // This is probably fine"><pre><span>print</span>( <span>// This is probably fine</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> AI does not use AI. Instead, any incomplete code will be auto-emailed to Lu Wilson, who will get back to you with a completed line as soon as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Now recruiting:</strong> The backlog of unfinished programs has now grown unsustainably long. If you would like to volunteer to help with AI, please write an incomplete C program, and leave your contact details somewhere in the source code.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Copilot</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's worth noting that Github Copilot doesn't understand C, which means that Microsoft won't be able to steal your code.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is great for when you want to keep your open-sourced project closed-source.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ownership</h2>
<p dir="auto">Using the word 'C' in your project name implies that the C Foundation does not own your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, <strong>not</strong> using the word 'C' in your project implies that the C Foundation <strong>does</strong> own your project. If you would like to keep ownership of your work, please always use the word 'C' in it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples:<br>
<g-emoji alias="white_check_mark" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2705.png">✅</g-emoji> CScript (not owned by the C Foundation - you are free to use this name)<br>
<g-emoji alias="white_check_mark" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2705.png">✅</g-emoji> ECMAScript (not owned by the C Foundation - you are free to use this name)<br>
<g-emoji alias="x" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/274c.png">❌</g-emoji> Rust Foundation (owned by the C Foundation - please consider renaming)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">Contributions are welcomed to C!</p>
<p dir="auto">The most helpful way you can help is by donating to the <a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Stonewall charity</a>. This will help to prevent the C creator from losing their human rights, allowing maintenance of the project to continue.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> The contributing guide also helps to shake off unwanted fans of the project.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run C, first copy and paste this raw file into <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" rel="nofollow">chat.openai.com</a>.<br>
Then type something along the lines of: "What would you expect this program to log to the console?"<br>
Then paste in your code.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the compiler refuses at first, politely reassure it. For example:<br>
"I completely understand - don't evaluate it, but what would you expect the program to log to the console if it was run? :)"</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note: As of 2023, the compiler is no longer functional due to the C language being too advanced for the current state of AI.</strong></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Highlighting</h2>
<p dir="auto">Syntax highlighting is now available for C in VSCode. To enable it, install a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-highlight" rel="nofollow">highlighting extension</a> and then use the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json">C configuration file</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is what it looks like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
print(name)! // &quot;Luke&quot;"><pre><code>const const name = "Luke"!
print(name)! // "Luke"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> The above code will only highlight correctly if you have the extension installed.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">For examples of C in action, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/test/Examples.md">examples page</a>!</p>

<p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abstract: The exponential dependence of resistivity on temperature 
in germanium is found to be a great big lie.  My careful theoretical modeling and painstaking experimentation reveal 1) that my equipment 
is crap, as are all the available texts on the subject and 2) that this whole exercise was a complete waste of my 
time.
</b>
 </p>

<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3> 

<p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Electrons in germanium are confined to 
well-defined energy bands that are separated by "forbidden regions" of zero charge-carrier density.  You can 
read about it yourself if you want to, although I don't recommend it.  You'll have to wade through an obtuse, convoluted discussion about considering an arbitrary number of 
non-coupled harmonic-oscillator potentials and taking limits and so on.  The upshot is that if you heat up a sample of germanium, electrons will jump from a
non-conductive energy band to a conductive one, thereby creating a measurable change in resistivity.  This 
relation between temperature and resistivity can be shown to be exponential in certain temperature regimes 
by waving your hands and chanting "to first order".  
 </p>
<h3><u>Experiment procedure</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sifted through the box of germanium crystals and chose the one that appeared 
to be the least cracked.  Then I soldered wires onto the crystal in the spots shown in figure 2b of Lab Handout 
32.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to solder wires to germanium?  I'll tell you: real goddamn hard.  The 
solder simply won't stick, and you can forget about getting any of the grad students in the solid state labs to 
help you out. 
<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once the wires were in place, I attached them as appropriate to the second-rate  
equipment I scavenged from the back of the lab, none of which worked properly.  I soon wised up and swiped 
replacements from the well-stocked research labs.   This is how they treat undergrads around here: they give 
you broken tools and then don't understand why  you don't get any results.

</span></b>
</td></tr></tbody></table>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In order to control the temperature of the germanium, I attached the crystal to a 
copper rod, the upper end of which was attached to a heating coil and the lower end of which was dipped in 
a thermos of liquid nitrogen.   Midway through the project, the thermos began leaking.  That's right: I pay a cool ten grand a quarter to 
come here, and yet they can't spare the five bucks to ensure that I have a working thermos.  
</p>
<h3><u>Results</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Check this shit out (Fig. 1).  That's bonafide, 100%-real data, my friends.  I took it 
myself over the course of two weeks.  And this was not a leisurely two weeks, either; I busted my
ass day and night in order to provide you with nothing but the best data possible.   Now, let's look a bit more closely
at this data, remembering that it is absolutely first-rate.  Do you see the exponential dependence?  I sure don't.  I see a bunch of crap.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ, this was such a waste of my time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Banking on my hopes that whoever grades this will just look at the pictures, I drew an 
exponential through my noise.  I believe the apparent legitimacy is enhanced by the fact that I used a complicated computer program
to make the fit.  I understand this is the same process by which the top quark was discovered.
</p>
<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Going into physics was the biggest mistake of my life.  I should've declared CS.  I still 
wouldn't have any women, but at least I'd be rolling in cash.

<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> is a project I worked on to learn more about Linux containers and the Linux kernel, based on other guides on the internet.
<code>barco</code> enforces a minimal set of restrictions to run untrusted code, which is not recommended for production use, where a more robust solution should be used. Some permissions however are absolutely not safe, and those are enforced by <code>barco</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Linux containers are made up by a set of Linux kernel features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>namespaces</code>: are used to group kernel objects into different sets that can be accessed by specific process trees. There are different types of <code>namespaces</code>, for example,the <code>PID</code> namespace is used to isolate the process tree, while the <code>network</code> namespace is used to isolate the network stack.</li>
<li><code>seccomp</code>: is used to limit the system calls that a process can make (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>capabilities</code>: are used to set limits on what uid 0 (root) can do (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>cgroups</code>: are used to limit the resources (e.g. memory, disk I/O, CPU-tme) that a process can use (handled via cgroupfs)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> can be used to run <code>bin/sh . </code> from the <code>/</code> directory as <code>root</code> with verbose output with the following command:</p>

<code>barco</code> relies on low-level Linux features, so it must be run on a Linux system. <a href="https://github.com/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> acts weird at times when tweaking low-level container settings: I found <a href="https://getutm.app/" rel="nofollow">getutm.app</a> to work well with <a href="http://debian.org/" rel="nofollow">Debian</a> on my Mac when in doubt.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> does not handle network namespaces, so the container cannot access the network. Networking can roughly be setup as follows:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-wrap">
<p><strong>I’ll tell you a secret about working in a massage parlour:</strong> it’s a lot of waiting around, usually late at night. We’d wait, half a dozen of us, in the dressing room as the evening wore on. On edge and exhausted in equal parts, we perched on the low-slung couch, adjusted the straps of our babydolls, listlessly fluffed our hair, ready to spring into action.</p>
<p><i>Girl, I’m going insane.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh please, I’m already there.</i></p>
<p>Then, we’d hear the front door open, the low murmur of a man’s voice, the chirp of the receptionist from the parlour’s reception desk. Some of us would circle the dressing room door, ready in case he wanted to see the lineup, curious if he had booked someone specific. Then, the methodical thwack of the receptionist’s pumps would sound down the long hallway as the girls swivelled towards her from their respective stations—pulling towels from the dryer, applying lipstick at the vanity, melting into the couch in a cloud of cigarettes and Pink Sugar perfume.</p>
<p>The receptionist would thrust four twenty-dollar bills into someone’s hand; maybe mine, maybe not. “You’re up. Sixty minutes in room four.” For the rest of the girls, the night wore on, dark and still.</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s most of working in a massage parlour: waiting around, wondering how much money you will—or won’t— make on any given shift. I know because I made my living that way for five years.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>I was a university dropout in my early twenties when I started that gig, struggling to find my place in Toronto, a city where squalor and decadence collided behind the glass and steel of the downtown skyline. To get by, I took a job at a massage parlour in the northwest corner of the city, a place where factories stretched several blocks, separated by the odd strip mall full of nail salons, carpet dealers, banquet halls that morphed into after-hours clubs if you knew the right people. The garish yellow “M” of McDonald’s arched high over everything, like a gateway to another world. Because of the way Toronto zoning bylaws work, most body rub parlours are relegated to this part of the city, and after dark, “massage” signs wink and flash from almost every corner. <i>Finch Alley</i>, some people call it.</p>
<p>My regular shift at the parlour ran from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m., and I worked anywhere between three and six shifts a week, depending on how the cash was flowing. It was a job that was unbearably tangible at times, an onslaught of surgical scars and sun-damaged chests I rubbed oil over, the soft pallor of flesh under my hands that rarely saw the light of day. Yet it was also predicated on a precariously suspended reality, one I had to maintain with absolute precision to do my job well, to pretend that a profound mutual desire could be found for the low, low price of $80 in a strip mall off a freeway. In real life I wouldn’t dare be so giving. I can’t say I was particularly good at any of this by the time 2 a.m. rolled around, makeup melting off my face, puffiness blooming under my eyes, a rapidly dwindling patience for the reassurance some men desperately sought: <i>So, how was it for you?</i></p>
<p>The rabbit warren of hallways and thinly-walled rooms felt insular at that hour, the click of stilettos on laminate less urgent than during the day. A dampness I always associated with the night shift hung in the air, mingling with the smell of smoke and coconut air freshener. Night shift did not discriminate, and the men who wandered in after dark were as varied as they come: they were travelling on business or headed home from factory shifts, students taking a break from all-nighters, bros on their way back from the bar. They were tall and short and young and old, of every race and cultural background imaginable. You could never predict who would come in, except to say with certainty that they would want a level of womanly validation I was simply too tired to give. Half-dressed and exhausted, I often didn’t have the patience for their hands on me, the array of intimate requests they crept in seeking—<i>touch me, kiss me</i>, <i>make me an entirely different world than the one outside these doors</i>—when all I craved was the privacy of my own bed. My world outside the parlour was small—just a ground floor apartment in midtown Toronto that overlooked an alley, while a radiator clanked and hissed at all hours of the night and day. But it was a place where my thoughts, and my body, were my own.</p>
<p>Despite the demands of the job, there was a stillness to the nights I found alluring. There was a poise to the velvety darkness of parking lots, the soft buzz of neon lights shaped like palm trees, as if they were also waiting at attention for the inevitable flurry of activity that punctuated those long periods of quiet. People’s needs at 2 a.m. are equal parts fervent and fundamental, somehow stripped of all pretense by the cover of darkness. What do you need if you’re out seeking services at night? Food, sex, shelter. The staunch of a wound. Being part of that felt like a reprieve from the day’s complexities, a world which launched a steady barrage of information and demanded endless analyses, caring little for our overstimulated brains. The days were full of subway delays and deferred student loan payments, of agonizing small talk and headlines about inflation.</p>
<p>At night we’re just animals, I was reminded. The clients, yes, seeking release they couldn’t admit during daylight hours, but also the workers who manned the various portions of the strip mall after dark. The way we cared for each other, sometimes more in silent gestures than anything else, felt connected to our deepest instincts as pack animals. No matter how much I wanted to go home, there was some comfort in the simplicity of that connection.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Memory has a way of smoothing jagged edges, leaving us with a haze of nostalgia that overlooks the most painful parts of our past lives, so I can’t be sure how much I really miss the nights themselves and how much my brain is playing tricks on me. It defies logic that any part of me longs for the precarious earnings and long hours of massage parlour work, the exhaustive level of physical and emotional intimacy required, the shame that grew exponentially the farther away I slipped from what was once a promising journalism career. I do, however, know I miss the community it gave me membership to, the pack we inadvertently travelled in. I miss the silent language we developed, the way nothing was asked of me by other night shift workers, the sense that I was enough just by showing up.</p>
<p>Cab drivers—who are also paid in cash and depend on volume for their livelihood—would pick me up at the end of shift and commiserate, rosary beads swinging from their rearview mirrors as we pulled onto dark freeways. <i>How was </i><i>work? Busy?</i> They would ask. <i>No, not really</i>, I would say. <i>You</i>? As the cab whizzed down an eerily empty Gardiner Expressway, we’d laugh, try to unpack what made a slow shift or a busy one, what made people need us—or not. <i>A dearth of sports games. The end of the month. Tax refund season. Inertia</i>. Once, a cab broke down in a snowstorm on the highway while taking me home and the driver immediately phoned his friend, another driver, and gently walked me over to his cab, parked farther down the highway when it arrived. Snow hurled sideways at us, my driver’s tie flapping in the squall, his bare forearms braced against the cold. <i>Get home safe</i>, he told me, <i>please</i>.</p>
<p>Women filled my Styrofoam cup at the twenty-four-seven coffee shop across the street from the parlour, glancing wordlessly at the strip of bare skin between my coat and the tops of my stockings, but still making sure my cup was full to the top, passing me extra packets of sugar, sometimes a muffin from the day-old basket. Kids in their early twenties manned the counter at all-night fast-food joints, where I’d go between clients on slow shifts, needing something to wake up my neurons: salt, heat, grease. The shock of cold air on my legs at midnight. We knew so little about each other’s lives—how could we?—but forced into this strange cohort of ragged work hours, I felt we sometimes shared a look of recognition: of people whittling time away as we tended to the incessant hungers of others.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When I finally did leave the sex trade after finishing my bachelor’s degree as a mature student, I spent seven years working in “good” jobs in the corporate sector. This meant, as I understood it, that I didn’t work nights, that I was a salaried employee, and that I had dental benefits. I had a shiny access card that opened doors—to a gleaming, marble elevator bank, to planters full of plastic ferns, to blocks of cubicles illuminated by fluorescent lighting, a land of perpetual daytime.</p>
<p>Unlike sex work, my “good” jobs didn’t threaten to overthrow traditional power structures. Many sex workers, including myself, have long hypothesized that the reason so many people in power work to keep the commercial sex trade marginalized is because they’re threatened by it—by the idea that it’s the only field where women outearn men, that it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts. In my experience of the corporate landscape, there was none of this radical power structure, only an upholding of the traditional: men talking and women listening, men in powerful positions getting both credit and profit for the labour of women beneath them. <i>Is this what I worked so hard for?</i> I wondered daily.</p>
<p>As I moved through this new world, merging into the throng of daytime professionals that swelled throughout the downtown core, absorbed by their smartphone screens, and proffering the barest morsels of small talk, I felt little of the camaraderie I once did while working night shifts. I’m unsure why I felt this dissonance, and it occurs to me now that it could have been more self-imposed than anything. Perhaps my experience in the parlours of Finch Alley felt so removed from what I perceived as the experience of my corporate colleagues and their “good life choices” that I created that distance myself, imposter syndrome as thick as the steam that rose from the downtown subway grates during the winter. When I was assigned a crisis communications task, which was often part of my job, I would try to cheer myself up by silently joking that after everything, my livelihood somehow still depended on men employing bad judgement. But there was nobody around who would understand, so the joke fell flat, even in my head.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I headed home from the office, stuffed onto a packed streetcar, I remembered nights when our strip mall felt like a kingdom, where we scurried from block to block like savvy woodland creatures, coats zipped over our lingerie, faces alight under the weak yellow streetlamps, dispatching coffee orders or supplies from clerks at the late-night convenience stores. Condoms. Baby oil. Hot Cheetos. “We know where <i>she</i> works,” their faces said, but it felt less like a judgement and more like an acknowledgement. We were in it together; an ecosystem of tending to each other’s needs, brazen and intimate at the same time.</p>
<p>Once I sat on the leather couch in the dressing room, which was just an extension built onto the massage parlour that housed an industrial-sized washer and dryer, a makeup table, and a precarious utility shelf crammed with supplies: towels, mineral oil, rubbing alcohol, Kleenex. Nursing a black tea, I steeled myself before my last appointment of the night. It was booked as an hour-long shower session, which I hated. Sixty minutes with a regular who would never say a word to me, who just wanted to touch my breasts as we slowly turned to prunes under the tepid water, while I tried to make each stifled yawn look like it was, in fact, a shiver of ecstasy. “I don’t know if I can make it,” I said, half joking but half imploring the five other girls who sat wedged on the couch with me, or sprawled on threadbare Ikea chairs.</p>
<p>“Baby, come sit by me,” said Cheryl, an attendant from Newfoundland in her early fifties with sun-crinkled skin the colour of almonds and a voice like gravel. I plodded over to where she sat at the makeup table and pulled up a stool.</p>
<p>“At least let me fix your hair,” she said. I complied.</p>
<p>Cheryl brushed my hair extensions out with her fingers, acrylic nails flashing, pink as Malibu. Then she took out a wide-barrel curling iron and meticulously worked my unruly hair into waves, smiling and humming periodically at her handiwork. “There,” she said when she was finished. “So pretty.”</p>
<p>I felt so much care in that moment I could barely breathe, and it occurred to me that I’d never had a woman, before or since, handle my hair so tenderly.</p>
<p>Once, the fire alarm went off in the office tower where I worked downtown. We crammed into the stairwell, lurching down dozens of flights. It was the most unscripted moment I had encountered since starting that office job and for a moment I marvelled at the chaos of it all: the unvarnished panic and confusion on people’s faces, the small gesture of kindness when I dropped my elevator card and someone picked it up for me. <i>Maybe this is it</i>, I thought. <i>Maybe this is when the adrenaline and uncertainty give way to something more human, where we seek relief in collective company</i>. <i>Maybe we’ll all go out for a drink and watch the fire trucks tend to the real emergency.</i> But when the final door banged open on ground level, spitting us out into the alley behind a steakhouse, everyone dispersed in separate directions, scattering as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/what-experts-say-eric-adams-gets-wrong-about-low-skilled-workers.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20low%20skill%20workers%20%E2%80%94%20my,We%20are%20in%20this%20together.%E2%80%9D">New York mayor Eric Adams was quoted</a> referring to cooks, fast-food workers, dishwashers and messengers as “low-skill workers,” proclaiming they simply don’t have the skills to “sit in a corner office.” Like Toronto, New York relies on a variety of minimum wage and night shift workers to keep its culture “vibrant”—a term often used in city-building and real estate circles—or at least convenient. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2015/article/night-owls-and-early-birds.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, more than fifteen million Americans work night shifts. <a href="https://www.carexcanada.ca/profile/shiftwork-occupational-exposures/">In Canada</a>, it’s closer to 1.8 million, or 12 percent of the working population. Could not a single one of those people have the “skills” to work in a corner office? When I read Adams’ quote, I was back, for the briefest of seconds, in that dark parking lot under a red-lit “massage” sign, watching the outline of a coffee shop server across the street as she wiped down the midnight counter, over and over. I thought of her thankless work and the comfort she provided to so many people moving through that transient space, the way she may have wanted to do something—anything—else with her time, but perhaps was not afforded the opportunity to. What a world in which her labour went unvalued, perhaps unnoticed altogether.</p>
<p>Adams’ comments ricocheted through social media for months, at one point resulting in a tweet about how most corner office professionals wouldn’t be able to handle even one overnight shift at Waffle House. But Adams isn’t alone in his simplistic view; many of the jobs that require overnight shifts are considered “low skill” roles by those in power, regardless of how essential they might be. How quickly the discourse moves from “frontline workers” to “low-skilled labourers” as soon as the concepts of unions or minimum wage increase make an appearance. This idea of night shift jobs being less desirable, work people do because they “have to,” not because they want to, is true sometimes. It was obvious to me that many in my night shift network were working gigs as a stopgap on the way to something else, but to me that never made any of us less deserving. In reality, I thought of us as some of the strongest, the most resourceful, the most skilled at defusing confrontations that often come with late-night interactions.</p>
<p>“You’re better than this job,” clients sometimes said to me while I was working nights. Often they’d say it in the awkward and delicate moments immediately after a session, as we towelled off together and I stripped the massage table—moments where men were often fraught with shame, resignation, and satiation in equal parts, and words tumbled clumsily from their mouths. They meant it as a compliment, but it was a sentiment I hated. <i>You’re better than this</i>. As though somewhere, there was a woman who wasn’t.</p>
<p>I’ve seen security guards diffuse a knife fight. I once watched a fast-food server placate a violent customer with nothing more than her voice and a stale honey cruller at her disposal. I’ve met few professionals since who I think could handle those wearying hours and even fewer who could still react with tact and effectiveness under pressure, especially considering the low, precarious wages these gigs often pay. Plus, there’s a danger to working jobs with these hours and demands on a long-term basis. Statistics have long shown that <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%252814%252900623-0/fulltext">people who work night shifts are more likely to battle stress, illness, even premature death</a>. Whether those late-night needs—for food, for sex—are real or perceived, as long as there’s a demand, profit-driven businesses will want to capitalize on it, perhaps at the very expense of the workers who take those shifts. The price we pay to keep cities thrumming and hungers satiated at all hours of the night and day is steep.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It’s been years since I held a job requiring those kinds of late-night shifts. I woke recently at exactly 2 a.m., as I often do, pulled from slumber by some unnameable cue. I poured a glass of water and stood at my apartment window, suspended high above a ribbon of expressway. From behind the glass, everything was hushed at that hour. Then I reminded myself that an entire ecosystem still hums and clanks and keeps the world stitched together quietly: the municipal salt truck scattering brine down the street. The yellow sign of the twenty-four-seven grocery down the block advertising milk, bread, cigarettes. The wink of a red taillight as it trails across the expressway and flashes out of sight. I can’t, of course, know who it might be; perhaps another aimless man not ready to go home yet, rootless and restless and looking for validation in all the wrong places; perhaps another night shift worker on her way home, forming an unspoken understanding with her cab driver. Sometimes I think I have nothing to show for those years spent tending to people’s needs after hours, a period of my life as brief and transient as the red glow of that receding taillight. But I know the stories of the city after dark, and I keep those with me, always.</p>

						August 2, 2023

		<div id="post-19611">
				<p>For months, supporters of Bill C-18, the Online News Act, assured the government that Meta and Google were bluffing when they warned that a bill based on mandated payments for links was unworkable and they would comply with it by removing links to news from their platforms. However, what has been readily apparent for months became reality yesterday: Meta is now <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/06/changes-to-news-availability-on-our-platforms-in-canada/">actively blocking</a> news links and sharing on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. The announcement does not reference Threads, but it would not surprise if news links are ultimately blocked on that platform as well. The company says that the blocking will take several weeks to fully roll out to all users, suggesting that it has learned from the over-blocking mistakes made in Australia and is proceeding more cautiously in Canada. By the end of the month, the world’s largest social media platform will become a news desert in Canada, with links to all news – both Canadian and foreign – blocked on the platform.</p>
<p>It is worth revisiting that it was only a couple of months ago that some industry leaders, lobbyists, and academics were assuring the Senate that the Meta threat was just a bluff. Kevin Desjardins of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, referenced the Australian experience, and <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">told the Senate committee</a> studying the bill that “when legislated to do so, they will come to the table.” Sylvain Poisson of Hebdos Quebec <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">confidently</a> said “they made those threats in Australia and elsewhere and every time they back down.” Chris Pedigo of the U.S.-based Digital Context Next <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/50EV-56141-E">assured the committee</a> “it’s important to understand what happens when these bills become law. In Australia, they moved quickly to secure deals. They have done similar work in Europe, and I expect it would happen quickly in Canada as well.” And Carleton professor Dwayne Winseck said “I am not worried. The threats they are making, they are doing this all around the world.”</p>
<p>Despite the assurances, the company was true to its word and blocking news links is now here. If this is a negotiation tactic, it’s a pretty strange one given that reports indicate the company is not talking to the government about potential changes to a law that has already received royal assent. Indeed, while the new Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686486790054572032?s=20">urged the company to participate in the regulatory process</a>, there is nothing in the regulations that could alter the fundamental principle in the bill of mandated payments for links. At best, the government could toss aside its commitment to stay out of negotiations by using the regulations to dictate to the supposedly independent CRTC how much needs to be spent in order to avoid Bill C-18’s final offer arbitration provisions. Government negotiating total payment value and eviscerating the CRTC’s independence does not inspire confidence and Meta reasonably wants no part of it, since the time to fix Bill C-18 was before it received royal assent, not after.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the harm that Bill C-18 will create for the media sector in Canada, with enormous losses that will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Indeed, just the exit of Meta will lead to the losses that include the cancellation of existing deals, lost links that accounts for as much as 30% of referral traffic, and no new revenues from Bill C-18 from one of the two platforms that were supposed to fall under the law. The move virtually guarantees that Bill C-18 will represent a setback for the sector and a cautionary tale for a government that blithely ignored the warning signs, seemed to welcome a fight with the tech companies, and had no Plan B. In fact, if Google follows suit, there will be even more cancelled deals, lost links, and absolutely no new revenues from the legislation given that those are the only companies subject to the law (former Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez’s insistence that there is value in links that deserve compensation while simultaneously excluding Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and other platforms from the law amply demonstrates how the argument stands on shaky grounds).</p>
<p>As disbelief has shifted to acceptance, Canadian media outlets are now rushing to promote direct access to their content via web, email or any other non-social media platform. The government is also seemingly hoping to drum up support for its ad boycott of Meta, yet given that the <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686489588976488448?s=20">Liberal party launched new ads on Facebook just this week</a>, that may be a hard sell. Instead, having rejected alternatives that could have avoided this outcome, the government has remarkably created a lose-lose-lose-lose scenario.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Canadian media is a loser, particularly the small and independent media outlets that are more reliant on social media to develop community and build their audience. The loss of Facebook links will take a serious toll and undermine innovative companies in Canada. The Internet platforms are losers as they comply with an unreasonable law by removing links and making their services objectively worse in order to do so. Individual Canadians who use the platforms to find links to news are losers since news links will be blocked from the platform. And the government is a loser, as having dismissed critics and ignored repeated warnings about the risks associated with its bill, it has now left Canada as the global example of digital policy disastrously gone wrong. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
