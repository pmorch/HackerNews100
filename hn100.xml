            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/159-employees-are-leaving-automattic-as-ceos-fight-with-wp-engine-escalates/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/159-employees-are-leaving-automattic-as-ceos-fight-with-wp-engine-escalates/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41738914">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said on Thursday that 159 employees (roughly 8.4% of staff) <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/">accepted a severance package</a> that the company had offered to those who disagreed with his direction of WordPress and his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/">handling of the tussle with web hosting provider WP Engine</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, Mullenweg said the package offered $30,000 or six months of salary, whichever is higher, but the employees who took it would not be eligible to be re-hired by Automattic. </p>







<p>Nearly 80% of people who took the offer worked in the company’s Ecosystem / WordPress division, and the rest were in Automattic’s Cosmos businesses, consisting of apps like Pocket Casts, Day One, Tumblr and Cloudup.</p>

<p>Mullenweg, who co-created WordPress and is arguably the face of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wordpress.org/">open-source project</a>, tried to put a positive spin on the announcement, writing that the company “decided to design the most generous buy-out package possible, we called it an Alignment Offer.”</p>

<p>“HR added some extra details to sweeten the deal; we wanted to make it as enticing as possible,” he wrote, and later on added: “159 people took the offer, 8.4% of the company, the other 91.6% gave up $126M of potential severance to stay!” </p>

<p>“It was an emotional roller coaster of a week. The day you hire someone, you aren’t expecting them to resign or be fired; you’re hoping for a long and mutually beneficial relationship. Every resignation stings a bit,” Mullenweg wrote.</p>

<p>Mullenweg and Automattic have been in a skirmish with WP Engine for almost two weeks now, in which the CEO has called WP Engine a “cancer to WordPress,” accusing it of wrongfully using the WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/wordpress-org-bans-wp-engine-blocks-it-from-accessing-its-resources/">banning the company</a> from accessing the open-source WordPress.org resources.</p>


<p>Both WP Engine and Automattic have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/wp-engine-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-automattic-over-mullenwegs-comments/">sent</a> each other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/legal-ping-pong-in-the-wordpress-world-continues-automattic-now-sends-wp-engine-a-cease-and-desist-letter-alleging-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cease-and-desist letters</a>. And WP Engine earlier on Thursday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/wp-engine-sues-automattic-and-wordpress-co-founder-matt-mullenweg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg</a>, accusing the company and its CEO of “abuse of power,” extortion, and saying the WordPress co-creator has conflicts of interest in handling WordPress as an open-source project.</p>

<p>Automattic has so far called all of WP Engine’s claims meritless. “I stayed up last night reading WP Engine’s Complaint, trying to find any merit anywhere to it. The whole thing is meritless, and we look forward to the federal court’s consideration of their lawsuit,” the company’s legal representative, Neal Katyal, said in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://automattic.com/2024/10/03/meritless/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Over the last few days, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/jeffr0/status/1841585100665872569">several</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/BoweFrankema/status/1841836017810092059">people</a> on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/kellie/status/1841210258422972536">X</a> have hinted about a severance offer being circulated among Automattic employees. Mullenweg also <a rel="nofollow" href="https://medium.com/@kelliepeterson/nice-guy-matt-mullenweg-ceo-of-wordpress-com-cries-foul-and-threatens-me-with-legal-action-f116ac57d862">allegedly DM’d a former employee who posted about the offer</a> and accused her of attacking the company and him.</p>







<p>Today, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/p3ob7o/status/1842078298030956576">some Automattic employees</a> who opted to keep their jobs <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/richard_tabor/status/1842062384820633742">posted messages</a> in support of the company and Mullenweg.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/">https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41738502">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cartographist is an experimental web browser optimized for rabbit-holing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of opening new windows (with <code>cmd</code>-click), Cartographist spawns horizontally scrollable panes.</li>
<li>Instead of forcing you to find things in a linear history, Cartographist shows a tree-structured outline of your browsing:
<img src="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/history.jpg" loading="lazy" width="720" height="280"></li>
<li>Instead of always starting fresh, Cartographist can save, and load "trails" — the exact state of the session you've left — supporting researching topics over long periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more context about the project, you can check out the longer write-up below, which originally appeared as a part of <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/"><span>Q4 2021</span></a> newsletter.</p>

<h2>Transcluded from <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/#cartographist"><span>Cartographist</span></a></h2>
          
<p>During the summer of 2020 I played around with an idea for research-focused web browser, embodying some of the concepts from <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/notes/browsing-vs-searching/"><span>Browsing vs Searching</span></a> note — <em>browsing</em> being an open-ended divergent activity, and <em>searching</em> understood as information retrieval.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/szymon_k/status/1289942401318977537" target="_blank"><span>I shared a preview on Twitter</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a>, to a surprisingly overwhelming response, but I got distracted with other things and never got back to the project. I still occasionally get requests for sharing this, so here it is: <a href="https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist" target="_blank"><span>szymonkaliski/Cartographist</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>The main idea of browsing in panes was inspired by <a href="http://andymatuschak.org/" target="_blank"><span>Andy Matuschak's website layout</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> and some of <a href="http://nateparrott.com/" target="_blank"><span>Nate Parrot's</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> experiments around stacking mobile web browser views next to each other (which I can't seem to find anymore, sorry).
This sort of layout has a long history, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns" target="_blank"><span>Miller columns</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> and the original Smalltalk class browser, and is a great interface for detail-in-context browsing.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also use this technique for navigating code with Vim, where a single shortcut goes to a definition of a function in a new pane:</p>
<p><img src="https://szymonkaliski.com/newsletter/2022-01-03-q4-2021/vim-panes.jpg" loading="lazy" width="3536" height="1790"></p><p>(<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/" target="_blank"><span>Glamorous Toolkit</span><span>&nbsp;↗</span></a> is worth checking out, as it takes the idea of pane browsing to another level)</p>
<p>In theory, I also really like the idea of disk-persisted history which allows for going back to a browsing session after a while, and consciously deciding which "topic" I am in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in practice, I don't think having the full history is that useful.
Yes, it's sometimes good to know how you ended up somewhere, but I think what's most valuable about "research" is the synthesis part — grabbing parts of larger wholes, rearranging, recombining, thinking with the material.
A small step in this direction could be persisting scroll position or maybe selection, and making the history editable — allowing users to remove dead ends, add notes, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, it started to feel that I'm solving this problem on a wrong level.
For example, a good window manager could replace Cartographist almost completely —
I played around with columnar layout in <a href="https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/hhtwm/"><span>HHTWM</span></a> for a bit, but lack of horizontal scrolling makes it not that useful in the end.</p>
<p>Well, let me know if you have any ideas how to make Cartographist better! Is there anything interesting here that I'm not seeing? Could it be useful to you in any way?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>This is an easter egg in <code>man</code>. When you run <code>man</code> without specifying the page or with <code>-w</code>, it outputs "gimme gimme gimme" to stderr, but only at 00:30:</p>

<pre><code># date +%T -s "00:30:00"
00:30:00
# man -w
gimme gimme gimme
/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man
</code></pre>

<p>The exit code is always 0.</p>

<p>The correct output should always be:</p>

<pre><code># man -w
/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/man
# echo $?
0
# man
What manual page do you want?
# echo $?
1
</code></pre>

<p>The string "gimme gimme gimme" can be found in RHEL, OpenSUSE, Fedora, Debian and probably more, so it's not really distro specific. You can <code>grep</code> your <code>man</code> binary to verify.</p>

<p><a href="http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/tree/src/man.c#n4122" rel="noreferrer">This code is responsible for the output</a>, added by <a href="http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/src/man.c?id=002a6339b1fe8f83f4808022a17e1aa379756d99" rel="noreferrer">this commit</a>:</p>

<pre><code>src/man.c-1167- if (first_arg == argc) {

src/man.c:1173:     fprintf (stderr, "gimme gimme gimme\n");
</code></pre>

<p>I have contacted RHEL support about this issue.</p>

<p>The string comes from well known <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEjLoHdbVeE&amp;t=1m10s" rel="noreferrer">ABBA song Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The developer of the man-db, Colin Watson, decided that there was enough fun and the story won't get forgotten and <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/?id=b225d9e76fbb0a6a4539c0992fba88c83f0bd37e" rel="noreferrer">removed the easter egg completely</a>.</p>

          <p>Cox Communications is lowering Internet upload speeds in entire neighborhoods to stop what it considers "excessive usage," in a decision that punishes both heavy Internet users and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Cox, a cable company with about 5.2 million broadband customers in the United States, has been sending notices to some heavy Internet users warning them to use less data and notifying them of neighborhood-wide speed decreases. In the case we will describe in this article, a gigabit customer who was paying $50 extra per month for unlimited data was flagged by Cox because he was using 8TB to 12TB a month.</p>
<p>Cox responded by lowering the upload speeds on the gigabit-download plan from 35Mbps to 10Mbps for the customer's whole neighborhood. Cox confirmed to Ars that it has imposed neighborhood-wide slowdowns in multiple neighborhoods in cases like this one but didn't say how many excessive users are enough to trigger a speed decrease.</p>
<p>Mike, a Cox customer from Gainesville, Florida, pays $150 a month, including $100 for 1Gbps download speeds and 35Mbps upload speeds, and another $50 for "unlimited data" so that he can go over <a href="https://www.cox.com/residential/internet/learn/data-usage.html">Cox's 1TB data cap</a>. Mike told Ars via email that most of his 8TB+ monthly use consists of scheduled device backups and "data sharing via various (encrypted) information-sharing protocols," such as peer-to-peer networks, between 1am and 8am. (We agreed to publish Mike's first name only but reviewed his bills and confirmed the basic details of his account with Cox.)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, data usage for most households declines significantly during those 1am-8am overnight hours, so a robustly built broadband network should be able to handle the traffic. In any case, Mike couldn't use more than 35Mbps for uploads at any given time because that's the limit Cox always imposed on its gigabit-download cable plan. Mike said his household's daytime and evening use is more like a typical Internet user's, with work-from-home activities during the day and streaming video in high-definition during the evening.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Mike also said his level of Internet usage has been roughly the same for the past four years that he's been using Cox—but it was only in mid-May that the company flagged him for excessive use. This may suggest that Cox is struggling to handle pandemic-level broadband traffic, but Cox says that the vast majority of its network is "performing very well."</p>
<p>Cox provided a little more detail after this story published, saying that the neighborhood-wide slowdowns and disconnection threats sent to individual customers "are two separate initiatives that could cross over in some cases."</p>
<p>(<em>Clarification</em>: Mike's nightly uploads alone couldn't have accounted for more than half of his monthly 8TB+ usage if his upload speeds were capped at 35Mbps; seven hours of nightly uploads at that rate would amount to about 3.3TB per month. The nightly uploads may have accounted for most of his upload usage, however, as his monthly usage of 8TB to 12TB includes both downloads and uploads. Assuming Mike was also downloading heavily during those 1-8am hours, then the overnight usage including both downloads and uploads would account for most of his overall data usage.)</p>
<h2>“Scheduled for termination”</h2>
<p>First, Mike got three calls from Cox including one that left a voicemail saying, "we need to speak with you regarding your Internet usage. Your home is using an extraordinarily high amount of Internet data and adjustments need to be made immediately." The voicemail warned that your "Internet will be scheduled for termination" unless usage reductions are "made within five days," according to Mike.</p>
<p>Mike explained how he responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since I work from home, I naturally was very concerned they would pull the plug on me and I'd be unable to work. Immediately calling the number [provided in the voicemail], I was funneled directly to a department for "questions about your recent Internet speed changes," and spoke with a representative there. He went on to explain that their network is overburdened and since I was an above-average user, I was being targeted to lower my usage or else have my account terminated... I tried to explain that my usage is not out of the ordinary for me. My day-time bandwidth usage is paltry (most of my bandwidth consumption is scheduled from 1am-8am), and that Cox should have been upgrading their infrastructure instead of oversubscribing nodes and pocketing the record revenue. I was told if I did not make a substantial decrease in my upload data usage, my service would be terminated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comments in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/gkicjg/cox_internet_speeds_lately/fr670cx/">Reddit thread last month</a> confirm that Mike isn't the only Cox customer being warned to cut upload speeds in order to avoid being kicked off the network.&nbsp;Cox didn't tell Mike exactly how much data he'd have to shave off his monthly usage. There was "no magic number or threshold, just an arbitrary amount of decrease, a Cox-deemed 'good effort,'" or his service would be cut off, he said.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Shortly after that phone call, Mike received an email from Cox with the subject line, "Alert: Action required to continue your Internet service." Mike provided Ars with a copy of the email.</p>
<p>"We've recently tried getting in touch with you about your service—your account has been identified as using an extremely high level of bandwidth, which is causing a negative impact on our network and our other customers across your neighborhood," the email said. Mike's "extraordinarily high" upload usage "is negatively impacting Internet service of other customers, which is a violation of our <a href="https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/acceptable-use-policy.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>, the email said. The policy contains a broad prohibition on transmitting amounts of data large enough to disrupt the network, but it doesn't specify an amount.</p>
<p>The real kicker is that Cox's email to Mike said that everyone in his neighborhood will get lower upload speeds until July 15:</p>
<blockquote><p>During these unprecedented times, many people are working and schooling from home, and maintaining connectivity is important. We are working to provide a positive Internet experience for everyone, so we've adjusted our Gigablast upload speeds in your neighborhood from 35Mbps to 10Mbps, now through July 15, 2020. Your download speeds have not changed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cox's email doesn't specifically state that Mike's usage spurred the decision to impose a neighborhood-wide slowdown, but this is apparently only happening in a small percentage of neighborhoods where Cox has seen heavier use than elsewhere in its network.</p>
<h2>Questions for Cox</h2>
<p>This raises several questions that we asked Cox. We asked the cable company why its network is "unable to handle Mike's uploads in the middle of the night" and whether it has "considered adding capacity to its network instead of forcing unlimited-data customers to use less data." We asked Cox how much data, specifically, customers who pay for unlimited data are actually allowed to use, and "Why isn't Mike allowed to use unlimited data when he is paying for the highest speeds and paying extra for unlimited data?"</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We also asked why Cox is imposing slowdowns throughout entire neighborhoods instead of only on the people allegedly violating the Acceptable Use Policy and whether the slowdowns are imposed even when only a single customer in a neighborhood is flagged for excessive usage. We also asked how many people in Mike's neighborhood are affected by the upload-speed decrease and whether they will get discounts to reflect their reduced service.</p>
<p>Cox didn't provide as much detail as we were looking for, but it confirmed the neighborhood-wide speed decreases, saying it has "identified a small number of neighborhoods where performance can be improved for all customers in the neighborhood by temporarily increasing or maintaining download speeds and changing upload speeds for some of our service tiers."</p>
<p>Cox defended the temporary 10Mbps upload speed for its gigabit-download plan, saying that "10Mbps is plenty of speed for the vast majority of customers to continue their regular activity and have a positive experience." Of course, customers paying extra for Cox's fastest plan and unlimited data are more likely to be outliers who do need high upstream bandwidth. Unlike fiber-to-the-home service, in which ISPs offer symmetrical upstream and downstream speeds, cable service generally has much lower uploads than downloads. Cox offers symmetrical gigabit speeds in some areas where it has deployed fiber directly to homes but provides slower upload speeds on its cable network. Cable users may eventually get symmetrical upload and download speeds from an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/envious-of-5g-hype-cable-cos-unveil-potentially-confusing-10g-trademark/">upgrade to DOCSIS</a>, the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/speeds-and-data-plans.html">Cox webpage</a> that was updated on April 30 says that the gigabit plan's upload speeds are now "10Mbps in limited areas to support consistent service across customers during periods of sustained increased Internet usage."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The now-repealed net neutrality rules likely wouldn't have prevented this kind of data slowdown, as the slowdown would presumably fall under an exception for "reasonable network management." But the Obama-era system in which ISPs were regulated as common carriers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/how-title-ii-goes-beyond-net-neutrality-to-protect-internet-users-from-isps/">gave more rights to consumers</a> to complain about unreasonable rates and practices, perhaps giving extra impetus to ISPs to upgrade their networks instead of limiting their users. Cox is a private company and thus doesn't report network-upgrade spending publicly, but major ISPs such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/ajit-pai-promised-faster-broadband-expansion-comcast-cut-spending-instead/">Comcast</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/att-slashed-billions-from-network-spending-cut-tens-of-thousands-of-jobs/">AT&amp;T</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/charter-will-spend-less-on-cable-network-in-2019-but-charge-customers-more/">Charter</a> have reduced network spending since the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/">repealed</a> its net neutrality rules and common-carrier regulation. (<strong>Update</strong>: Harold Feld, senior VP of consumer-advocacy group Public Knowledge, <a href="https://twitter.com/haroldfeld/status/1270371055262203906">says</a> that "Cox's&nbsp;going after unspecified 'excess uploaders' would probably have violated the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/how-the-net-neutrality-repeal-helps-isps-keep-their-hidden-fees-hidden/">enhanced disclosure rules</a> under the 2015 net neutrality order.")</p>
<p>Cox told Ars that it "will continue to work with anyone who is violating our Acceptable Use Policy with excessive use to help ensure everyone can have a positive Internet experience."</p>
<h2>Cox says network “performing very well”</h2>
<p>Cox told Ars its "network is performing very well overall" during the pandemic, and that out of 28,000 neighborhood nodes across the US, 98 to 99 percent "are performing with adequate capacity even with the tremendous level of increased peak usage." If Cox's 5.2 million paying broadband customers are spread equally across nodes, each node would serve about 185 households.</p>
<p>Cox said that it always "keep[s] a close eye at the individual node level to make sure we don't approach any congestion thresholds and need to make any adjustments. Similar to our normal process, if we see the network reach or exceed utilization thresholds we will accelerate network upgrade plans in the impacted areas. This could include splitting nodes, pulling additional fiber, equipment swaps and/or core network changes, all of which add capacity to the area."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But those measures apparently aren't enough to handle users like Mike, Cox said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In some instances a number of excessive users, like the customer you referenced, are causing congestion problems in a small number of neighborhoods by utilizing over 100-200 times more upstream bandwidth than the average household. This type of excessive usage is negatively impacting the service of other customers, which is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy. It is not our desire to terminate anyone's service, but we may need to address excessive usage out of fairness to the rest of our customers, especially during this time when households are even more dependent on a good Internet experience...</p>
<p>In the case of the customer you mentioned, we have communicated with him about our concerns and it appears he has made adjustments to his usage to operate within our Acceptable Use Policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike confirmed to Ars that he has lowered his use by limiting overnight upload speeds to 400kbps, "so that it is always throttled." His usage in the 2.5 weeks since May 22 is 2.1TB, putting him well below his usual monthly pace.</p>
<h2>Pandemic spurs extra broadband use</h2>
<p>Broadband networks have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/pandemic-hasnt-crushed-broadband-networks-even-rural-areas-are-doing-ok/">mostly held up well</a> during the pandemic. Cable-lobby group NCTA, which represents Cox and other cable companies, <a href="https://www.ncta.com/COVIDdashboard">says</a> that "networks are engineered to provide superior performance throughout the day" and that "provider-backbone networks have significant capacity and show no signs of congestion." Since March 1, NCTA says that peak upstream traffic has risen 26.2 percent and peak download traffic has risen 9.1 percent.</p>
<p>Cox told us that "a small percentage of nodes... were approaching congestion levels prior to" the pandemic, and that "the dramatically increased use in those neighborhoods has pushed [them] beyond the threshold where performance will be impacted. These speed adjustments are temporary while we try to keep as many people as possible connected during the crisis."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
        
        
        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Mike said he suspects Cox is limiting upload speeds "because their network can't handle the increase of residential live video conference streaming" that has happened during the pandemic. Recently, Mike said he has been seeing upload speeds of only 4Mbps to 5Mbps.</p>
<h2>Coming soon: A price increase</h2>
<p>Mike's bill is currently lower than usual because Cox, like other ISPs, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/comcast-waives-data-cap-until-at-least-june-30-in-response-to-pandemic/">providing unlimited data</a> to all customers during the pandemic. The waiver of the $50 monthly unlimited-data charge temporarily knocked his bill down to $100, and Cox provided a further $20 discount on his latest bill. Mike's bill doesn't explain the reason for the $20 credit, but it could be because of the new upload data limit.</p>
<p>But Cox is already signaling that Mike is in for a price increase in the near future. Today, Mike told Ars that "I just got an alert after logging in that my one-year introduction rate is now over, so I'll be paying $175 a month for 'unlimited' data once the current data-overage exceptions expire. Yay."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Robert Dennard, DRAM Pioneer, Dies at 91"><p><strong>Robert Dennard </strong></p><p>Inventor of Dynamic RAM </p><p>Fellow, 91; died 23 April</p><p>In 1967 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/thanks-for-the-memories" target="_self">Dennard</a> invented what is known as DRAM—a type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell consisting of a tiny capacitor and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a>. </p><p>Before his invention, RAM required bulky, power-hungry components that were expensive to produce. His breakthrough paved the way for inexpensive, high-density, and commercially available memory.</p><p>The computing pioneer received the 2009 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-medal-of-honor/" target="_blank">IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for his innovation.</p><p>Dennard began his career as a staff engineer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM</a>’s New York City research lab. He worked on new devices and circuits for logic and memory applications and developed advanced data communication techniques. </p><p>He was transferred in 1961 to IBM’s newly opened <a href="https://research.ibm.com/labs/watson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Watson Research Center</a>, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., where he worked on field-effect transistors and integrated circuits, using a six-transistor memory cell for each bit of data, the standard at the time. In 1968 Dennard successfully reduced a RAM cell to a small capacitor and a single field-effect transistor—the device that became known as DRAM. He was granted a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3387286A/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. patent</a> for his invention in 1968. </p><p>By the early 1970s, DRAM was standard in virtually all computers. A decade later, the device powered the first PCs—including the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ibm">IBM</a> 5150—allowing them to perform more complex operations.</p><p>After DRAM’s success, Dennard turned his attention to transistors. In 1972 he developed principles for scaling metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices, the main building block in low-power and high-performance very-large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. IEEE Fellow <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/50-years-of-moores-law/" target="_self">Gordon Moore</a> had predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, but Dennard proposed that as transistors got smaller, their power consumption would remain nearly constant. He published his theory, now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dennard scaling</a>, with a set of supporting principles in the 1974 paper “<a href="http://stanford.edu/class/cs114/readings/dennard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Design of Ion-Implanted MOSFETs With Very Small Physical Dimensions</a>.”</p><p>Dennard was named an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/ibm_fellows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IBM Fellow</a> in 1979. For the next several decades at the company, he worked on metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, refining RAM and developing low-voltage, high-performance circuits. </p><p>During his career, he was honored with dozens of awards including the 2019 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-robert-n-noyce-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Robert N. Noyce Medal</a> and the 2001 <a href="https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE Edison Medal</a>.

<p><span>Oct. 3 (UPI) --</span> The U.S. Department of Energy Thursday announced a $1.5 billion transmission investment to improve electric grid reliability.</p>
<p>The Energy Department<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-invests-15-billion-bolster-nations-electricity-grid-and-0" target="_blank"> said the $1.5 billion</a> will fund four transmission projects "that will improve grid reliability and resilience, relieve costly transmission congestion, and open access to affordable energy to millions of Americans across the country."
</p>
<p>"The U.S. transmission network is the backbone of our nation's electricity system. Though our grid has served U.S. energy needs for more than a century, our country's needs are changing," said U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk in a statement.</p>
<p>The projects will increase grid capacity and are funded by the Biden-Harris administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

<p>The projects will enable nearly 1,000 miles of new electric transmission development and 7,100 megawatts of new capacity in Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.</p>
<p>The department said the the projects will also create 9,000 good-paying jobs.</p>
<p>They include the Aroostook Renewable Project in Maine, the Cimarron Link in Oklahoma, Southern Spirit connecting the Texas grid for the first time to southeastern U.S. power markets and Southline in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The Energy Department's National Transmission Planning study released Thursday was meant to be a long-term planning tool.
</p>
<p>It found that a substantial expansion of the transmission system throughout the entire contiguous United States would deliver the biggest grid benefits. That could also save the national electric system between $270 billion to $490 billion through 2050.</p>
<p>"The NTP Study is designed to enhance and encourage interregional planning efforts," the DOE said in a statement. "It does not replace industry planning or identify a specific set of transmission lines that should be built. Rather, the NTP Study identifies potential opportunities for industry planners to consider projects that would benefit customers under a wide range of future scenarios."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite all of its warts, I like working in Linux. I've used it for 15
years and I've never been as productive in another environment. Most
people claim that it's the configurability of Linux that keep the users
coming. That may have attracted me at first, but <strong>what attracts me now
is its programmability.</strong></p>
<p>Let me be very clear. I'm not saying that Linux is great because I can
patch the source code to grep and recompile it. In all my years of Unix,
I've never done anything like that. And I'm not saying that Linux is a
great workstation for programmers because it helps you program better.
Those are topics for another essay.</p>
<h3>Unix is a programmable environment</h3>
<p>I <em>am</em> saying that Unix is a programmable environment. When you interact
with the shell, <strong>you are writing programs to be interpreted</strong>. You can
easily extend the Unix system by writing a shell script, copying it to a
directory in your <code>PATH</code>, and making it executable. Boom. You've got a
new program.</p>
<p>What's more, that program, if it follows certain simple conventions, is
now able to work with other programs. Those conventions are simple, and
they are summed up well by Doug McIlroy, the inventor of Unix pipes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do
it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle
text streams, because that is a universal interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your program <em>reads text lines from standard in and writes text lines
on standard out</em>, it is likely to do well on Unix.</p>
<h3>Programs on your path are like pure functions in the higher-level language called the shell</h3>
<p>Not all programs are so pure. But the vast majority of the programs that
are so typically Unixy are. <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>wc</code>, <code>pr</code>, etc.</p>
<h3>Unix is a multi-lingual environment</h3>
<p>I must have compilers or interpreters for 30 languages on my machine.
Maybe more. All of these languages are invited to the party. They can
all call each other (through the shell). And of course their
<code>stdin</code>/<code>stdouts</code> can be piped together.</p>
<p>You really can use the best tool for the job. I've got Bash scripts, awk
scripts, Python scripts, some Perl scripts. What I program in at the
moment depends on my mood and practical considerations. It is a little
crazy that <strong>I don't have to think about what language something is
written in when I'm at the terminal</strong>.</p>
<h3>Unix provides a universal interface with a universal data structure</h3>
<p>It needs to be stated that there is a reason all of these languages can
work together. There is a standard data structure that programs are
invited to use: text streams. That means sequences of characters. Text
streams are cool because they're simple and flexible. <strong>You can impose a
structure on top of the flat sequence.</strong> For instance, you can break it
into a sequence of sequences of characters by splitting it on a certain
character (like new-line). Then you can split those sequences into
columns. In short, text is flexible.</p>
<h3>Unix is homoiconic</h3>
<p>There's another property that I think is rarely talked about in the
context of Unix. In Lisp, we often are proud that code is data. You can
manipulate code with the same functions that you manipulate other data
structures. This meta-circularity gives you a lot of power.</p>
<p>But this is the same in Unix. <strong>Your programs are text files</strong> and so
can be <code>grep</code>'d and <code>wc</code>'d and anything else if you want to. You can
open up a pipe to Perl and feed it commands, if you like. And this feeds
right back into Unix being programmable.</p>
<h3>Functional + universal data structure + homoiconic = power</h3>
<p>All of this adds up to synergy. When you write a program that follows
the Unix conventions of <code>stdin</code>/<code>stdout</code> with text streams, <strong>it can
work with thousands of programs that are already on your computer</strong>.
What's more, your program has to do less work itself, because so much of
the hard work can be done better by other programs.</p>
<h3>On the file system, hierarchical names point to data objects</h3>
<p>And this synergy extends well beyond just using text streams. I have
this tendency to look to databases as storage solutions for my personal
projects. They have some nice properties, like ACID and SQL.But by using
a database, I'm missing out on joining the Unix ecosystem. <strong>If I use
the file system to store my data---meaning text files in directories---I
can use all of Unix to help me out.</strong> I can use <code>find</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>head</code>,
<code>tail</code>, etc., just because I chose to use the measly file system instead
of some fancy database.</p>
<h3>Blog example</h3>
<p>A good example of the synergy I'm talking about is the blog you are
reading now. Here's how my blog works:</p>
<p>I store everything on the file system. I have an <code>src/</code> directory with
<code>drafts/</code> <code>posts/</code> <code>pages/</code> and <code>links/</code>. I wrote a Python script
(currently at 183 well-commented lines) that reads <code>src/</code> and spits out
the final product to <code>build/</code>. The Python uses a few libraries, but the
meat of it is done by calling other programs. The rendering of Markdown
to HTML is done by <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/"><code>pandoc</code></a>, which
happens to be written in Haskell. I also do a call out to the shell to
copy a directory (<code>cp -rp</code>) because I was too lazy to figure out how to
do it in pure Python.</p>
<p>I sync <code>build/</code> to Amazon S3 with a Ruby program called <code>s3sync</code>. I edit
my entries in Emacs. If I need to delete a post, I run <code>rm</code>. If I need
to list my posts, I run <code>ls</code>. If I'd like to change the name of a post,
I use <code>mv</code>.</p>
<p>It may not be the best interface for writing a blog. But notice all of
the stuff I didn't have to write to get started. I'm already writing
posts and publishing them. <strong>Compare that to the reams of PHP and
Javascript it takes to get the same functionality in Wordpress.</strong> That's
the power of small tools working together.</p>
<h3>Unix is old</h3>
<p>Now that I've expressed how great Unix is, allow me to speak about its
numerous shortcomings. I can't say for sure, but I would guess that most
of the shortcomings are due to the long history of <strong>Unix starting on
underpowered machines</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, the fact that your programs have to be manually stored to
disk using file system operations so that your dynamic shell language
can have access to them seems awfully quaint. But when Unix was
developed, disk space, RAM, and computation were expensive. Everything
was expensive. So the strategy was to <strong>cache your compiler output to
disk</strong> so you wouldn't have to do a costly compile step each time you
ran a program.</p>
<p>If I want to write a new program, even a short one, I have to open up a
text file in Emacs (make sure it's in the path!), write the program,
save it, switch to the terminal, and <code>chmod +x</code> it. Compare that to
Clojure, where you constantly define and redefine functions at the REPL.
Or, if you like, a Smalltalk system where you can open up the editing
menu of <em>anything you can see</em> and change the code which will then be
paged out to disk at a convenient time. Unix clearly has room to grow in
that respect.</p>
<h3>The file system</h3>
<p>The file system is archaic, too. It's reliable, but a little
feature-poor. It's one of the reasons I think first about a database
before remembering the synergy available with the file system. It
doesn't provide any kind of ACID properties. The metadata available is
laughable (permissions, owner/group, date, and filesize?). <strong>A more
modern file system would give a little more oomph</strong> to compete with
other forms of storage.</p>
<h3>The terminal</h3>
<p><strong>The terminal is just old.</strong> It's all text. The editing is
sub-primitive. The help it gives you is the bare minimum. One of its
biggest shortcomings is how opaque it is. It doesn't do much to help you
learn commands. It's not very good with huge dumps on <code>stdout</code>.
Multiline commands? Supported with <code>\</code>. I think we can do better.</p>
<h3>Text streams</h3>
<p>The world of computers has grown up a lot since the early days of Unix.
There has been a Cambrian explosion in the number of file formats. Lots
of them are binary formats. Lots are structured text, like XML or JSON.
Unix can handle those kinds of files, but <strong>it has failed to find a
lever to help the Unix user master them with the same synergy you see
with flat text files</strong>.</p>
<h3>Wrong turns</h3>
<p>Uni
x has a long history. Some of that history was kind, some was unkind.
Most of the development of Unix was just practical people doing their
best with the tools they had.</p>
<p>What's unfortunate is that we now have better tools and we see what
could be done, but to do it would break backwards compatibility. And so
we continue with sub-optimal tools.</p>
<h3>Layering instead of evolving</h3>
<p>One thing I think is unfortunate in the world of Unix today is layering.
<strong>Modern Linux distributions are midden piles of configuration daemons
to manage permissions daemons to give your configuration GUI access to
the configuration daemons.</strong> Or we find ourselves installing a database
to manage a few kilobytes of metadata.</p>
<p>The problem is Unix has not evolved in those areas. The permission
system has changed very little. Modern distributions want to provide a
modern and unintrusive interface to protected resources, so they add a
layer of indirection onto the primitive permissions model instead of
evolving the permission system itself. The Unix permissions system is
solid and has worked for years. Maybe it should stay. But instead of
giving us small programs that do one thing well to let us become masters
of the permissions system, <strong>we get obtuse, opaque daemons</strong> that also
need to be learned.</p>
<p>The file system, though much improved in terms of capacity, stability,
and reliability, still has the same basic features: hierarchical
directories containing files, accessed by name. If you want something
more, you have to add a layer like BerkeleyDB or SQLite. These tools are
great, but I'd like to see a more Unixy solution that allows for the
synergy you get from existing programs made to run with files on the
disk.</p>
<h3>Megacommands</h3>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/1091803">Command bloat</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/665971">is
terrible</a>. Rob Pike and Brian Kernighan
have <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/cat-v/">written about this</a>. I'll merely
refer you to their <a href="https://ericnormand.me/files/papers/unix_prog_design.pdf">excellent
paper</a>. The gist is that having n
commands gives yo
u O(n^2^) ways of combining them. <strong>Having fewer,
bigger, "more powerful" programs does not give you this exponential and
synergistic advantage.</strong></p>
<p>If you look at it the right way, all of these little programs that do
one thing are like functions in the higher-level language that is Unix.
We see that languages like Perl and Python have huge numbers of
libraries for doing all sorts of tasks. Those libraries are only
accessible through the programming language they were developed for.
This is a missed opportunity for the languages to interoperate
synergistically with the rest of the Unix ecosystem.</p>
<h3>The road ahead</h3>
<p>I've given a bit of a taste of some of the non-Unixy directions we're
going in. Now I'd like to end with some right directions.</p>
<p>I mentioned before that saving a compiled binary to disk is done to
cache what used to be an expensive operation. With modern hardware, a
short utility C program could be read in, parsed, compiled, and run very
quickly. Probably with no noticeable delay. It's something to consider
when thinking about the division between static programs and dynamic
scripting languages and the role of the compiler.</p>
<h3>Talking to Unix</h3>
<p>Foreign Function Interfaces between programming languages are considered
very difficult to work with because of the semantics mismatch between
any two languages. But Unix provides a universal interface for programs
to <strong>interoperate without the need for FFI</strong>. I hope to see more "sugar"
in languages to take advantage of calling out to other programs for
help. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/799968/whats-the-difference-between-perls-backticks-system-and-exec">Perl's
backticks</a>
comes to mind.</p>
<p>You might say that this is expensive. Well, yes and no. Yes, there is
much more overhead in reading in who-knows-how-many files to execute
some script on disk than in just calling some library function. I argue,
though, that <strong>the time difference is becoming small enough not to
matter</strong>; and the operating system should evolve to make it more
practical.</p>
<h3>Evolving</h3>
<p><code>stdin</code>/<code>stdout</code></p>
<p>Stdin/stdout with text streams is the closest thing we have to a
universal, language-agnostic interface. It defines a minimal
"constitution" with which programs can interact. <strong>Can this interface be
improved on without destroying it?</strong> I wouldn't doubt it. There are lots
of "data flow" patterns besides input and output. Pub/sub, broadcast,
dispatch, etc., should be explored.</p>
<h3>Text streams, evolved</h3>
<p>Unix was designed for flat text and the existing Unix tools operate on
text. We need new tools to <strong>bring structured text and binary into the
Unix world</strong> to join the party. I don't think this would be hard. I've
written programs that read in JSON and write it out with one JSON object
per line. That lets you grep it to find the one you want, or <code>wc -l</code> it
to count the objects.</p>
<p>Another thing I've been working on is defining a dispatch mechanism for
common operations on files of different types. Take, for instance,
metadata that is stored in a file. An HTML file has a title, sometimes
it has an author (in a meta tag), etc. A JPEG file has metadata in the
EXIF data. <strong>Is there some way we can unify the access of that
metadata?</strong> I think there is and I'm working on it. The same command
would dispatch differently based on mime-type.</p>
<h3>21st Century Terminal</h3>
<p>How can we improve the terminal? I think it's a hard problem but not
impossible. Part of the issue with the terminal is that as X Windows
developed, people started using menus to run monolithic programs instead
of piping things with the shell. So the usefulness of the terminal will
be improved, without changing the terminal itself, by <strong>breaking those
monolithic programs up into composable programs</strong>. For instance, a
program which displays all of the thumbnails of the files listed on
<code>stdin</code> would be much more useful to me than a mouse-oriented file
browser.</p>
<p>The terminal is about text. I don't think that could or should change.
But does it have to be only about text?
<a href="http://acko.net/blog/on-termkit">Explorations</a> are underway.</p>
<h3>The Shell</h3>
<p>The last improvement I want to touch on is the shell language itself.
Bash is ugly. There. I said it. A lot of good work has been done in
programming language design and I'd like to see some of it make its way
to the shell. <strong>What if we take the idea of Unix programs as pure
functions over streams of data a little further?</strong> What about
higher-order functions? Or function transformations? Combinators? <strong>What
if we borrow from object-oriented languages?</strong> Can we have message
passing? What about type-based dispatching?</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Unix has always been practical and it has proven itself over the years.
It's 40 years old and it's still being used. Furthermore, Unix is the
closest thing to a personal computing experience^1 that is practical
today.</p>
<p>People tend to <a href="https://ericnormand.me/files/papers/LispGoodNewsBadNews.pdf">contrast Unix</a>
with systems like the Lisp Machine and Smalltalk. But I see <strong>more
similarities than differences</strong>: <em>Code as data.</em> <em>Everything is
programmable.</em> <em>Dynamic language prompt.</em> <em>Universal data structure.</em> <em>A
propensity for "dialects" or "distributions".</em> <em>Garbage collection.</em>^2
Unix just made a lot of compromises to make it practical on the limited
hardware that was available.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those compromises have stuck. A lot of work went into
workarounds and a lot of software has been built on top of those design
decisions. The question is: <strong>where to go from here?</strong></p>
<p>My own personal choice is to go <strong>back to the roots</strong>. Often, when we
want to make a change, we must look to what has worked in the past. What
has brought us this far? What were the things that made Unix special?
Unix was built by individuals all adding their own practical knowledge
and hard work into one cohesive system. Their individual work was
multiplied by the synergy of a common interface. If we want to evolve
Unix (and I do), that common interface---the heart of Unix---is the
place to start.</p>

<p>When I say "personal computer", I'm referring to <a href="http://www.mprove.de/diplom/gui/kay72.html">Alan Kay's
vision</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What then is a personal computer? One would hope that it would be
both a medium for containing and expressing arbitrary symbolic
notions, and also a collection of useful tools for manipulating
these structures, with ways to add new tools to the repertoire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unix has a limited form of garbage collection. Short-running
programs (like those executed at the terminal) need not concern
themselves with freeing allocated memory since the OS will free
everything when they exit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

  
  
    <address>Sahil Lavingia</address>
    <p><time>September 30, 2024</time></p><p>At Gumroad, we recently embarked on a new project called <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://helper.ai/">Helper</a>. As the CEO, I was initially quite
optimistic about using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> for this project, even though some team members were less enthusiastic.</p>
<p>My optimism stemmed from previous experiences with React, which often felt like overkill for our needs. I thought htmx
could be a good solution to keep our front-end super light.</p>
<figure>

<img alt="Gumroad Red" src="https://htmx.org/img/gumroad-red.jpeg">
</a>

</figure>
<p>In fact, I shared this sentiment with our team in Slack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“https://htmx.org/ may be a way of adding simple interactions to start”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And initially, it seemed promising! As one of our engineers at Gumroad eloquently put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“HTMX is (officially) a meme to make fun of how overly complicated the JS landscape has gotten - much like tailwind is
just a different syntax for inline CSS, HTMX is a different syntax for inline JS.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, unlike Tailwind, which has found its place in our toolkit, htmx didn’t scale for our purposes and didn’t lead
to the best user experience for our customers–at least for our use case.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Intuition and Developer Experience</strong>: While it would have been possible to do the right thing in htmx, we found it
much more intuitive and fun to get everything working with Next.js. The development process felt natural with
Next.js, whereas with htmx, it often felt unnatural and forced. For example, when building complex forms with dynamic
validation and conditional fields, we found ourselves writing convoluted server-side logic to handle what would be
straightforward client-side operations in React.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UX Limitations</strong>: htmx ended up pushing our app towards a Rails/CRUD approach, which led to a really poor (or at
least, boring and generic) user experience by default. We found ourselves constantly fighting against this tendency,
which was counterproductive. For instance, implementing a drag-and-drop interface for our workflow builder proved to
be a significant challenge with htmx, requiring workarounds that felt clunky compared to the smooth experience we
could achieve with React libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI and Tooling Support</strong>: It’s worth noting that AI tools are intimately familiar with Next.js and not so much with
htmx, due to the lack of open-source training data. This is similar to the issue Rails faces. While not a
dealbreaker, it did impact our development speed and the ease of finding solutions to problems. When we encountered
issues, the wealth of resources available for React/Next.js made troubleshooting much faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability Concerns</strong>: As our project grew in complexity, we found htmx struggling to keep up with our needs. The
simplicity that initially attracted us began to feel limiting as we tried to implement more sophisticated
interactions and state management. For example, as we added features like real-time collaboration and complex data
visualization, managing state across multiple components became increasingly difficult with htmx’s server-centric
approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community and Ecosystem</strong>: The React/Next.js ecosystem is vast and mature, offering solutions to almost any problem
we encountered. With htmx, we often found ourselves reinventing the wheel or compromising on functionality. This
became particularly evident when we needed to integrate third-party services and libraries, which often had React
bindings but no htmx equivalents.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<figure>

<img alt="Gumroad Green" src="https://htmx.org/img/gumroad-green.jpeg">
</a> 
<figcaption>Source with NextJS - Click Image To View</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ultimately, we ended up moving to React/Next.js, which has been a really great fit for building the complex UX we’ve
been looking for. We’re happy with this decision–for now. It’s allowed us to move faster, create more engaging user
experiences, and leverage a wealth of existing tools and libraries.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This experience has reinforced a valuable lesson: while it’s important to consider lightweight alternatives, it’s
equally crucial to choose technologies that can grow with your project and support your long-term vision. For Helper,
React and Next.js have proven to be that choice.</p>
<p>Since we’ve moved there, we’ve been able to seriously upgrade our app’s user experience for our core customers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Drag-and-Drop Functionality</strong>: One of the key features of our workflow builder is the ability to reorder steps
through drag-and-drop. While it’s possible to implement drag-and-drop with htmx, we found that the available
solutions felt clunky and required significant custom JavaScript. In contrast, React ecosystem offers libraries like
react-beautiful-dnd that provide smooth, accessible drag-and-drop with minimal setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complex State Management</strong>: Each workflow step has its own set of configurations and conditional logic. As users
edit these, we need to update the UI in real-time to reflect changes and their implications on other steps. With
htmx, this would require numerous server roundtrips or complex client-side state management that goes against htmx’s
server-centric philosophy. React’s state management solutions (like useState or more advanced options like Redux)
made this much more straightforward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Form Generation</strong>: The configuration for each step type is different and can change based on user input.
Generating these dynamic forms and handling their state was more intuitive with React’s component model. With htmx,
we found ourselves writing more complex server-side logic to generate and validate these forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-time Collaboration</strong>: While not visible in this screenshot, we implemented features allowing multiple users to
edit a workflow simultaneously. Implementing this with WebSockets and React was relatively straightforward, whereas
with htmx, it would have required more complex server-side logic and custom JavaScript to handle real-time updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: As workflows grew larger and more complex, we needed fine-grained control over
rendering optimizations. React’s virtual DOM and hooks like useMemo and useCallback allowed us to optimize
performance in ways that weren’t as readily available or intuitive with htmx.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to note that while these challenges aren’t insurmountable with htmx, we found that addressing them often
led us away from htmx’s strengths and towards solutions that felt more natural in a JavaScript-heavy environment. This
realization was a key factor in our decision to switch to React and Next.js.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that htmx may be a great fit for many projects, especially those with simpler interaction models or those
built on top of existing server-rendered applications. Our experience doesn’t invalidate the benefits others have found
in htmx. The key is understanding your project’s specific needs and choosing the tool that best aligns with those
requirements.</p>
<p>In our case, the complex, stateful nature of Helper’s interface made React and Next.js a better fit. However, we
continue to appreciate htmx’s approach and may consider it for future projects where its strengths align better with our
needs.</p>
<p>That said, we’re always open to reevaluating our tech stack as our needs evolve and new technologies emerge. Who knows
what the future might bring?</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.

<p><a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MIDiA's latest gaming report</a> looks at the growing viability of(re)allocating resources towards single-player games. </p>
<p>We zoom in on gameplay preferences by platform and age, motivators for trying new games, preferred game themes for puzzle, action-adventure, sports, shooter, and RPG fans, and offer data-backed strategic recommendations. </p>
<p>This article shines the spotlight on some high-level takeaways from the first section of the report. If you’re ready to dive deeper, <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let us know</a>.</p>
<p><b>Several single-player studios were pushed into making live-service games – the trend chasing did NOT pay off</b></p>
<p>Many AAA game makers have been chasing the live-service trend, looking to replicate the success of <i>Fortnite</i>, <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>Roblox</i>, and other success stories. </p>
<p>Even developers that rose to prominence thanks to single-player – with games that helped put their publishers on the map – were pushed to chase the live-service trend.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For many, it was a wild goose chase, and the list of failures is growing. SEGA cancelled Creative Assembly’s <i>Hyenas</i> and PlayStation did the same thing for Naughty Dog’s <i>The Last of Us Online</i> after years of development. </p>
<p>Other revered single-player names in the industry have tried their hand at live services – with dire results: Crystal Dynamics (<i>Marvel’s Avengers</i>), EA’s BioWare (<i>Anthem</i>), Platinum Games (<i>Babylon’s Fall</i>), and Microsoft’s Arkane (<i>Redfall</i>) – the list goes on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This underlines an undeniable opportunity cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>These studios’ single-player offerings have respectively generated hundreds of millions in revenue</li>
<li>How much revenue and positive consumer sentiment was left on the table because these companies were pushed to make live-service games?</li>
<li>Aggravating things, the market is too delicate for most publishers to take huge risks in an oversaturated space</li>
</ul>
<p>Hitting a few singles and doubles beats trying to hit a home run and striking out.</p>
<p>The timing of live service’s oversaturation is not ideal. Publishers now need to cut costs to adapt to a challenging macroeconomic climate (and to course correct from overextending during the pandemic). </p>
<p><b>There's a way forward for these studios: returning to what has always worked, single-player games </b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/concord-postmortem-what-went-wrong-and-whats-next-for-playstations-live-service-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">While new live-service games have floundered</a>, new single-player games have continued to smash records and generate hundreds of millions – or more.&nbsp; And it is not just juggernaut IP like <i>Zelda</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i> proving successful but also new franchises like&nbsp;<i>Elden Ring </i>(25 million copies sold) and <i>Black Myth Wukong&nbsp;</i>(20 million).</p>
<p>While live-service games and in-game purchases dominate spending and attention in the games market, over half of gamers prefer solo play:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.midiaresearch.com/storage/uploads/paragraphs/dbdbaba91de72cd615d8be1a0119cfca" alt="dbdbaba91de72cd615d8be1a0119cfca"></p>
<p>There are some caveats to this opportunity and how best to seize it. Data from the above image, which you can dive deeper into via the <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/single-player-is-safer-and-has-more-opportunities-amid-live-service-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full single-player opportunity report</a>, underlines a positive correlation between age and preferring single-player: </p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond younger generations’ higher emphasis on social play, life starts getting busier in the mid-20s</li>
<li>Life commitments make it trickier to play live-service games regularly, and co-ordinating sessions with friends becomes more challenging</li>
<li>To that end, the 25+ gamers are the lowest-hanging fruit to target with single-player games</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The one-and-done nature of single-player gels better with the saturated attention economy</b></p>
<p>Younger players prefer PVP, which captures a large swathe of consumer attention and engagement and is enjoyed by all generations. Convincing players – and their friends – to leave for new titles is a huge barrier. </p>
<p>Live-service games are the <i>homes</i> of many highly engaged players. Getting them (and their friends) to relocate permanently to another live-service game is a big ask.</p>
<p>Yet, going 'on holiday’ to a single-player game is more viable. Releasing in quieter periods for the big live-service games, like towards the latter part of the live-service seasons, could be beneficial here. </p>
<p>It is also easier for busier 25+ gamers to dip into a single-player game – perhaps even on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/steam-is-the-unlikely-winner-of-the-modern-console-wars-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supporting device like the Steam Deck</a>&nbsp;or PlayStation Portal. </p>
<p><b>Single-player games are a safer bet for new games</b></p>
<p>Make no mistake: the costs to make AAA single-player, non-live service games have inflated to astronomic levels. Leaks from Insomniac showed that PlayStation’s AAA flagship games, like <i>Spider-Man 2, </i>have budgets in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But there is a growing <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/gamers-arent-finishing-games-and-thats-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opportunity for AAA studios to make leaner single-player games</a>. </p>
<p>Despite the extra risk, live-service games can be even more expensive. After launch, they also need significant additional costs to run over time (and keep their players coming back to spend). <i>Genshin Impact</i>’s budget was $100 million, with another $200 million <i>per year</i> needed for live-ops costs. </p>
<p>For many AAA publishers making new games, it might be time to course-correct from the red live-service ocean to the bluer single-player one – or at least shift some more resources to solo experiences. </p>

Every morning, when I sit in front of the computer, a new world opens up for me to explore, and I try to share this passion with my clients. Sometimes, I succeed.</p><p>I’ve been a Linux user since 1996, before I turned 17. Back then, I used Fidonet and would read about alternative operating systems. Curiosity got the best of me, and I bought a set of CDs with various Linux distributions at the first opportunity. I tried it, I liked it, but at the time, I didn’t find it advantageous, so I continued using it for secondary tasks while Windows remained my daily driver.</p><p>Things changed in late 1997. I decided to go deeper into Linux and, with the purchase of a new, more powerful computer, I realized that aside from gaming, Linux could be my everyday system. This came in handy when I started university in 1998, where the computer science department was very oriented towards Open Source solutions. I was one of the few students who already understood the concepts of Open Source and knew how to use Linux. I was also one of the few who wasn’t baffled when we found Solaris machines in the lab. After all, there were similarities.</p><p>Over the years, I became one of the administrators of that lab, which was almost entirely Linux-based.</p><p>In 2000, I was fortunate to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96zalp_Babao%C4%9Flu" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Professor Özalp Babaoğlu</a> as my lecturer, which pushed me to explore other operating systems like the BSDs. However, all I had at the time was an old Compaq laptop (486/25 MHz and 4 MB RAM) and no fast internet connection. So, apart from some theoretical studies, I postponed hands-on experiments until I had better resources. By 2002, thanks to a broadband connection and a new computer, I began exploring BSD systems. I started with FreeBSD, largely thanks to its fantastic handbook. I asked my parents to buy a laser printer so I could “print academic material” — but really, I wanted to print all the documentation I could find, including the BSD handbook. And it was incredibly helpful.</p><p>Before long, FreeBSD became my daily driver — entire nights spent compiling KDE while I slept a meter away from my laptop’s wildly spinning fans—but FreeBSD ran much, much better on that machine than Linux did. Unfortunately, OpenBSD was too slow to be usable with any graphical interface.</p><p>In 2003, my final thesis focused on virtualization on Open Source systems, NetBSD/Xen was one of the best and most efficient solutions I tested.</p><p>Shortly after, I found a job at a company that was just beginning to offer Linux-based solutions, mainly for web and mail servers, but I was criticized because I completed tasks that didn’t require constant interventions — this hurt the company’s billing. That’s when I set my future guidelines:</p><ul><li>I would work for myself, following my own philosophy.</li><li>I would not be tied to any particular vendor. I love exploring and learning, so I would always study solutions in depth and recommend the one I thought best suited for the client.</li><li>I solve problems — I don’t sell boxes.</li><li>I would use and promote Open Source solutions whenever possible.</li><li>I would use a BSD whenever feasible and Linux where a BSD was not suitable.</li></ul><p>In every technological decision, my priority is solving my clients’ specific problems, not selling a predefined solution. <strong>I solve problems.</strong></p><p>I was often told that Open Source systems were “toys for universities” and that the real world ran on something else (mostly meaning Windows). I pressed on. In some cases, I offered to be paid only if the results were achieved, showing how much they’d save compared to traditional licensing costs. It worked, but…</p><ul><li>They accepted Linux, albeit reluctantly, but rejected BSDs because they didn’t know them. In some cases, I managed to convince them. In others, sadly, I didn’t.</li></ul><p>Result: I decided to use the BSDs where clients didn’t have direct access — like email servers or web hosting — while using Linux where they specifically requested it.</p><ul><li>NetBSD/Xen as the virtualization base, <a href="https://it-notes.dragas.net/2023/08/27/that-old-netbsd-server-running-since-2010/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">with excellent longevity and reliability</a>.</li><li>OpenBSD as network/firewall entry points.</li><li>FreeBSD (especially with the introduction of ZFS) for various services, including backup servers.</li></ul><p>It worked. What surprised clients most was the stability and the reduced need for maintenance. They saw more uptime and were happy.</p><p>Problem: <strong>“If nothing is working, what am I paying you for? If everything’s working, what am I paying you for?”</strong> So, I selected clients and situations that understood that if everything works, it’s because of the work behind the scenes. It’s better to pay for everything to work than to pay to fix problems. The problem to solve, in this case, is not stopping the client’s work. <strong>And I solve problems.</strong></p><p>I managed about 65% *BSD machines and 35% Linux. But as Linux’s popularity grew, so did client demand. It became necessary on multiple occasions to replace or implement Linux instead of a BSD, for specific requests.</p><p>At a certain point, Linux virtualization solutions matured, and many of my hosts transitioned from NetBSD/Xen to OpenNebula (often with MooseFS) and then to Proxmox (often with Ceph). This happened because my clients needed to manage their VM lifecycles autonomously, change configurations, migrate hosts, etc.</p><p>Proxmox showed excellent reliability and stability. The VMs were often Linux-based (especially if the client needed direct management) or FreeBSD, but in smaller quantities. My own infrastructure, however, remained primarily BSD-based.</p><p><em>Over time, I gradually started to reflect and ’take stock’.</em></p><p>No *BSD has ever caused me to lose data to the point of having to restore from backup. On Linux, I’ve lost data with ext4, XFS, and btrfs. The most catastrophic case was with XFS — just a few files, backed up and restored, but the client was highly demanding and didn’t take it well. The largest failure was with btrfs — after a reboot, a 50 TB filesystem (in mirror, for backups) simply stopped working. No more mounting possible. Data was lost, but I had further backups. The client was informed and understood the situation. Within a few days, the server was rebuilt from scratch on FreeBSD with ZFS — since then, I haven’t lost a single bit.</p><p>In 2018, I started introducing Docker and Podman to the developers with specific needs, especially to help them with their development. Many developers began incessantly asking for Docker, unfortunately some of them only wanted to bypass many limitations that traditional setups imposed. Unfortunately, in many cases, those “limitations” were just bad practices — running outdated versions of software and libraries, or not wanting to bother with keeping the stack updated. There are similar problems with other solutions, but at least I can block them. They’re great for quick deployment and increased security, but they aren’t always the best choice. Plus, they’re not the only option, despite what many people think these days.</p><p>Linux has had major development over the past years, but this has shifted towards specific players’ interests (mainly cloud providers) rather than technical reasons. Maybe not in the kernel, but many Linux distributions and communities now seem focused on the constant push to replace “the old with the new” with solid theoretical reasons but sometimes seemingly without practical benefit.</p><p>For me, computing should solve problems and provide opportunities to those who use it. <strong>I solve problems.</strong> Every change or variation will solve one problem but create new ones. It’s crucial to be mindful not to create worse problems than the ones you’re solving, and today’s enterprise world often seems to overlook that.</p><p>It’s common to see software distributed solely via Docker Compose files. Sometimes I use it as an installation tutorial, but I realize they’re just specific pieces precariously glued together (patched files, specific dependency versions, or nothing works).</p><p>The trend is to rush, to simplify deployments as much as possible, sweeping structural problems under the rug. The goal is to “innovate”, not necessarily improve — just as long as it’s “new” or “how everyone does it, nowadays.”</p><p>A massive business has grown around Linux: certifications, training, pentesting, certified platforms — the community is losing decision-making power. This is a far cry from the early days.</p><p><strong>I solve problems.</strong> And these fast-changing technologies risk creating more problems than they solve, at least in certain situations. The workloads I manage often stay up for years, requiring a more stable, upgradable, and consistent approach.</p><p>If a client’s problem is to have an e-commerce site, they don’t really care if it runs on Docker, Podman, a FreeBSD jail, or a Raspberry Pi cluster — as long as their problem is solved. In fact, clients are happy when their solution is stable, upgradable, and secure.</p><p><strong>There isn’t a single solution to all problems, but many solutions for each problem.</strong> My job is to give clients the best solution to solve their specific problem, not the most fashionable one.</p><p>That’s why I decided, several years ago, <em>to reverse the proportion and implement and the BSDs for all possible workloads.</em></p><p>Each *BSD has its characteristics and target audience. Sometimes these targets overlap, but it’s generally not difficult to choose the most appropriate solution.</p><p>The goal of the migration was to create stable, coherent, upgradable, and secure systems.</p><p>By implementing an OpenBSD system, I often don’t need to install any additional packages. When it’s time to upgrade, it’s simple and secure. When a vulnerability emerges, I’m often fortunate to read “OpenBSD is excluded from this issue because it eliminated this risk X years ago…”</p><p>By implementing a NetBSD system, I know I’m installing a system that isn’t in a rush to release new versions and will likely run for years with only a few package updates and security patches, when necessary. And it’s quite rare for a patch to be required.</p><p>By implementing a FreeBSD system, I know I’ll have ZFS at my disposal, a fast and efficient hypervisor like bhyve, and a native, mature jail system that will ensure service and setup separation coherently and precisely. Not as “add-ons” but built into the system itself.</p><p>Moving to the BSDs means, in my experience, reaching systems that are more stable, more easily upgradable, and more consistent in their parts. They don’t chase the hype of the moment, much like the early days of Linux. In the case of FreeBSD, this also means moving to native ZFS and boot environments, giving me greater peace of mind when it comes to upgrades.</p><p>The initial strategy was to migrate what would soon need updates anyway, what would be moved (thus requiring a new setup), and what was causing problems and deserved a deeper dive.</p><p>First, I decided to migrate to FreeBSD the hypervisors not directly accessed by clients, especially on leased servers. The approach was to create a twin machine (to have an objective performance and stability comparison — it wouldn’t make sense to compare it to a different machine), install FreeBSD, bridge it with the production server, install vm-bhyve, and start copying VMs from Proxmox, reconfiguring the main parameters in the configuration file. In some cases, I already used ZFS on Proxmox, so the first part of the migration was a simple zfs-send/receive. In other cases (e.g., when using Ceph), I made an intermediate move by live-migrating the storage to ZFS and then proceeding as in the first case. The first noticeable effect was a reduction in resources used by the host to handle VM traffic — as expected, only FreeBSD’s basic processes and bhyve were running — but at the same time, there was a significant increase in I/O performance, further enhanced by switching the virtual disk driver from virtio to NVMe. This allowed for in-depth testing and revealed that FreeBSD suffers less under heavy I/O (the VMs on Linux tended to block their I/O, an effect I didn’t notice on FreeBSD) and showed significantly lower loads. In short, it handled the load better.</p><p>As an experiment, I decided to migrate two hosts (each with about 10 VMs) of a client — where I had full control—without telling them, over a weekend. By Tuesday, they called me, concerned: they had noticed a massive performance boost and were worried I had upgraded their hardware without approval, thinking that, “given the performance boost,” it would cost them a lot. After explaining what I had done, they asked me to run further tests and progressively continue migrating everything. 20 hosts, all based on (sometimes slightly older) versions of Proxmox. And so I did, but taking advantage of their open-mindedness, I went a step further.</p><p>Many of their VMs handled simple workloads — PHP websites, or Java-based management systems (running on Tomcat), device monitoring software for industrial machinery, etc. The decision to use VMs had been made by their highly competent internal IT staff to separate environments and dependencies. It was a perfect use case for jails. I decided to try, VM by VM, to replicate the setups inside FreeBSD jails. In some cases, for convenience, I managed to run everything directly in Linux jails (with <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/Linuxulator" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Linuxulator</a>); in others, it was impossible, so I recreated the setups in individual jails. They immediately noticed an effect: faster operations. It didn’t surprise me. We avoided double buffering (VM and OS), so all the saved RAM could be used by ZFS for its cache and by the host to run other services. Some VMs remained as VMs (e.g., Zimbra). By the end of the operation, I had drastically reduced the number of VMs, replaced by jails, and consequently, the number of hosts. From 20 down to 11 — with a significant monthly cost saving.</p><p>The road was now clear, and I progressively continued down this path. One of the most interesting anecdotes: a client told me that they used to start an operation before taking a coffee break, around 15 minutes, to find the task almost done by the time they returned. After the migration, they shared that they launched the process, grabbed their things, and the task was already complete. An estimated reduction from about 18 minutes to 6 minutes on average. I didn’t investigate too much, but I suspect a combination of factors, with the predominant one <a href="https://it-notes.dragas.net/2024/06/10/proxmox-vs-freebsd-which-virtualization-host-performs-better/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">being bhyve’s NVMe driver</a>.</p><p>The main challenge I often face is ideological. Some people are used to thinking that the ideal solution is <strong>X</strong> — and believe that <strong>X</strong> is the only solution for their problems. Often, <strong>X</strong> is the hype of the moment (a few years ago, I fought to convince people that VMware wasn’t necessary and that Proxmox would be a great solution; today, Proxmox is on everyone’s lips — but it’s not the only solution). Often, <strong>X</strong> is a “cloud” cluster with Kubernetes - running WordPress on it. Even for hosting a law firm’s website, which will be updated every five years.</p><p>When I ask, “Okay, but why? Who will manage it? Where will your data really be, and who will safeguard it?”, I get blank faces. They hadn’t considered these questions. No one had even mentioned them. “But everyone I spoke to proposed this type of solution… It’s like at the beginning with Windows, when I proposed *BSD or Linux. Or later with VMware, when I proposed Proxmox. Or now with Kubernetes, when I propose the BSDs.</p><p>But the simplest solutions are the easiest to maintain and manage over time. My experience has taught me that setting something up is often the easiest part. The hardest part is returning to it after 1, 5, 10 years. Keeping it running, updating it, stabilizing it. For many, IT isn’t their business, but a tool to achieve their goals. A Kubernetes cluster is fantastic, but it requires maintenance. Or it’s external — so it’s no longer ours. We’ve lost control of the data. For many, it’s unnecessary to complicate things. And with every additional layer, we’re creating more problems.</p><p>No *BSD system has ever surprised me during an update or a simple reboot. I’ve never encountered, for example, a network interface renaming from <em>enx3e3300c9e14e</em> to <em>enp10s0f0np0</em> on Linux, effectively locking me out of a server. ix0 will remain ix0.</p><p>I’ve never had to recompile ZFS on FreeBSD, only to find that the module wouldn’t load, blocking the filesystem from mounting after reboot.</p><p>Many of the developers I work with have embraced the challenge. Most of them are passionate about technology, and learning a new operating method has been very interesting. Almost all of them, after experiments, were positive and, in fact, began explicitly requesting “jails” instead of Docker hosts. They started using <a href="https://bastillebsd.org/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">BastilleBSD</a> to clone “template” jails and deploy them. They learned to access ZFS automatic snapshots and recover lost files. They learned to manage the resources at their disposal without repeating the usual mantra of “we need mooooar powaaaar!” every time there’s a problem, a slowdown, or a storage overload. They’ve returned to trying to understand what’s happening, rather than just assembling pieces, libraries, and containers without considering the effects.</p><p>Others, however, struggled, but remained positive nonetheless. And that’s okay. <strong>I solve problems</strong> and can’t force my solutions on everyone.</p><p>In other cases, the challenge wasn’t technical but “commercial.” Often, decision-makers have little to no technical knowledge. Linux sells well. “Cloud” sells even better. A “NetBSD-based solution,” unfortunately, has less commercial appeal today. So, they want what they can sell, without focusing too much on the advantages of alternative solutions.</p><p>Linux today is subject to many compliance requirements — I’m often asked which version of OpenSSH I’m running — and they complain when the version (the latest from OpenBSD) isn’t considered “secure” because it doesn’t match their procedures (e.g., OpenSSH_9.2p1 Debian-2+deb12u3). They don’t understand when I explain that the “Debian” part refers to the Linux distribution, not a release. Those who prepare these documents are often, sadly, unaware of what they’re asking for. They just have a checklist.</p><p>The transition is ongoing, and as I see opportunities, I’m migrating from Linux to the BSDs whenever possible. Today, I can say that <strong>78% of the hypervisors I manage run on FreeBSD, and 66% of the workloads (VPS, jails, hosts, etc.) are running on one of the BSDs</strong> — including solutions like OPNsense. None of the clients have experienced major issues. No one has complained about performance or reliability. All feedback has been positive. Many appreciate moving away from IT monocultures, especially when problems arise — following the recent severe SSH vulnerability, many clients contacted me, worried. It was nice to tell some of them that the exposed SSH service was running OpenBSD’s version, and that OpenBSD wasn’t affected as they had developed a secure mechanism back in 2001. They appreciated it. They want more setups based on OpenBSD.</p><p><strong>I’m Stefano Marinelli, I solve problems. And I love solving problems using BSD systems.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large model inference is shifting from cloud to edge due to concerns about the privacy of user interaction data. However, edge devices often struggle with limited computing power, memory, and bandwidth, requiring collaboration across multiple devices to run and speed up LLM inference. Pipeline parallelism, the mainstream solution, is inefficient for single-user scenarios, while tensor parallelism struggles with frequent communications. In this paper, we argue that tensor parallelism can be more effective than pipeline on low-resource devices, and present a compute- and memory-efficient tensor parallel inference system, named TPI-LLM, to serve 70B-scale models. TPI-LLM keeps sensitive raw data local in the users' devices and introduces a sliding window memory scheduler to dynamically manage layer weights during inference, with disk I/O latency overlapped with the computation and communication. This allows larger models to run smoothly on memory-limited devices. We analyze the communication bottleneck and find that link latency, not bandwidth, emerges as the main issue, so a star-based allreduce algorithm is implemented. Through extensive experiments on both emulated and real testbeds, TPI-LLM demonstrated over 80% less time-to-first-token and token latency compared to Accelerate, and over 90% compared to Transformers and Galaxy, while cutting the peak memory footprint of Llama 2-70B by 90%, requiring only 3.1 GB of memory for 70B-scale models.

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org"><h2>Abstract</h2><div><p>Animal research indicates that a combination of physical activity and sensory enrichment has the largest and the only sustaining effect on adult neuroplasticity. Dancing has been suggested as a human homologue to this combined intervention as it poses demands on both physical and cognitive functions. For the present exploratory study, we designed an especially challenging dance program in which our elderly participants constantly had to learn novel and increasingly difficult choreographies. This six-month-long program was compared to conventional fitness training matched for intensity. An extensive pre/post-assessment was performed on the 38 participants (63–80 y), covering general cognition, attention, memory, postural and cardio-respiratory performance, neurotrophic factors and–most crucially–structural MRI using an exploratory analysis. For analysis of MRI data, a new method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) designed specifically for pairwise longitudinal group comparisons was employed. Both interventions increased physical fitness to the same extent. Pronounced differences were seen in the effects on brain volumes: Dancing compared to conventional fitness activity led to larger volume increases in more brain areas, including the cingulate cortex, insula, corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex. Only dancing was associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels. Regarding cognition, both groups improved in attention and spatial memory, but no significant group differences emerged. The latter finding may indicate that cognitive benefits may develop later and after structural brain changes have taken place. The present results recommend our challenging dance program as an effective measure to counteract detrimental effects of aging on the brain.</p>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section1"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Aging is associated with a reduction in brain volumes, mainly in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Regions such as the occipital cortex, on the other hand, show relatively few alterations throughout the lifespan [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref001">1</a>,<a href="#pone.0196636.ref002">2</a>]. The changes affect both gray [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0196636.ref003">3</a>] and white matter [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref004">4</a>]. The cortical volume decrease (i.e., atrophy) is not primarily caused by a loss of neurons but is due to an age-related shrinking of cells and reduced synaptic density [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref002">2</a>,<a href="#pone.0196636.ref005">5</a>]. In white matter, aging generates axonal deflections, resulting in defective neuronal transmission. Again, the most deflections are observed in the prefrontal cortex [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref006">6</a>] and are associated with working memory and executive dysfunction [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref007">7</a>].</p>
<p>These age-related changes, however, are not inevitable. It has become clear over the past several years that the aging brain is capable of neuroplasticity. This raises the possibility of counteracting the detrimental effects of aging on the brain. Most studies in this regard have investigated the effects of physical fitness on the aging brain. For example, Colcombe et al. (2006) reported that six months of aerobic training, in comparison to an anaerobic stretching program, led to a significant volume increase at multiple sites of the elderly subjects’ brains [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref008">8</a>]. Others found volume and perfusion of the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory consolidation, to be related to the physical fitness levels of seniors [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref009">9</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref010">10</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref011">11</a>]. It has been suggested that this adult neuroplasticity is mediated by BDNF, a neurotrophic factor that is also found in human blood [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref012">12</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref013">13</a>]. BDNF is an important growth factor supporting multiple functions in the CNS, including synaptic plasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref015">15</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref016">16</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref017">17</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref018">18</a>]. It has been suggested that release of BDNF from the brain is the source for circulating BDNF after physical exercise [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref019">19</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref020">20</a>]. An increase in circulating BDNF levels due to physical exercise has already been investigated by different groups [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref021">21</a>] and seems to depend on exercise intensity and the type of training [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref022">22</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref023">23</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref024">24</a>]. Erickson et al. (2011), for instance, demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with a greater volume of serum BDNF in seniors engaged in one year of aerobic training. From animal research, it is known that a combination of physical exercise and sensory enrichment has the strongest impact on neuroplasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref025">25</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref026">26</a>]. Moreover, only this combination guarantees that newborn neurons survive in the long run [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref026">26</a>]. For humans, dancing has been suggested as a homologue of this combined training, as it involves sensory, motor and cognitive challenges [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref027">27</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref028">28</a>]. To the best of our knowledge, only three published studies have assessed the possible impact of dancing on the brain so far [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref029">29</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref030">30</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref031">31</a>]. However, these studies were cross-sectional observational studies that compared the brains of professional dancers to those of non-professionals. With such studies, there is an inevitable possibility that life-style factors other than those of interest contributed to the observed differences. Moreover, professional dancing is hardly comparable to what can be achieved in untrained healthy seniors. Therefore, in the current study, we designed a novel dance program that, on the one hand, was tailored to the needs of healthy seniors (e.g., safety) but, on the other hand, was designed to continuously challenge them by introducing new and increasingly difficult choreographies throughout the intervention. The effects of this dancing program were compared with an active, not passive, well-established sport fitness program, as we wanted to test whether our new intervention is truly superior to conventional ones. Hence, the control group engaged in sportive exercises that involved mainly repetitive exercises such as cycling. These activities were comparable regarding their cardiovascular demands but not their cognitive and coordinative demands. With this approach, we should be able to distinguish the specific effects of the dance training program from other factors, especially physical fitness. Consistent with this approach, on the brain level, we made use of a new symmetric VBM analysis method especially designed to compare longitudinal group differences.</p>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section2"><h2>Materials and methods</h2>
<div id="section1"><h3>Subjects</h3>
<p>Approval for the study was obtained from the ethics committee of the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg. All subjects signed a written informed consent and received payment for their participation. This study has been registered subsequently at DRKS (DRKS00012605), a WHO-accepted platform, in terms of omission (<a href="#pone.0196636.s008">S1</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.s009">S2</a> and <a href="#pone.0196636.s010">S3</a> Files). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. Sixty-two normal volunteers, who responded to a local advertisement, were screened. Subjects with any neurological condition, metallic implants, claustrophobia, tinnitus, BMI ≤30, high blood pressure (systolic≤140 mmHg), diabetes mellitus, intensive physical engagement (more than 1 hour/week) and abnormal performance in a cognitive screening test (MMSE &lt; 27)[<a href="#pone.0196636.ref032">32</a>] and a test devoted to depressive symptoms (BDI-II &gt; 13) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref033">33</a>] were excluded. Fifty-two seniors (25 males; 27 females) aged 63–80 years were then randomly assigned to the experimental dance group (DG) and the control sport group (SG) controlling for age, MMSE status and physical fitness. We had some drop-outs during the training period (<a href="#pone-0196636-g001">Fig 1</a>), including subjects who did not reach the adherence rate of 70% (6 subjects) or got seriously sick (6 subjects) or who were unsatisfied with the group assignment (2 subjects). This left us with 38 complete data sets (<a href="#pone.0196636.s001">S1 Table</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>Interventions</h3>
<p>The training conditions in both groups were almost identical regarding intensity, frequency and duration. We also controlled for psychosocial effects by providing a group-based program in both study arms. Furthermore, the SG also enjoyed musical accompaniment. Both interventions occurred twice a week, lasted 90 minutes per session and were provided for six months. To control for the conditional load in both groups, we measured the heart frequency in every single training session after warm-up twice: during the main part and after cool down.</p>

<div id="section1"><h4>Dance intervention.</h4><p>A qualified dance instructor supervised every training session. The focus of this program was on continuous learning of new movement patterns and choreographies, thereby including coordination training and learning of specific dancing skills. Subjects were trained to accurately memorize and access different rhythms and step sequences in space, all under accuracy and time pressure. In brief, the dance intervention was divided into two blocks, each lasting three months. Each block comprised the teaching of choreographies of five different genres: line dance, jazz dance, rock ‘n’ roll, Latin-American dance and square dance. Coordinative demands and time pressure were increased in the second block by demanding more complex dance moves and introducing more beats per minute in the music.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h4>Sport intervention.</h4><p>The SG trained according to scientific guidelines and recommendations of health sports [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref034">34</a>] and was also supervised by a qualified trainer. Unlike the dancers, SG participants performed the same exercises repeatedly. Each session included three different units: endurance training, strength-endurance training and flexibility training. Each unit lasted 20 minutes. The endurance training was performed on bicycle ergometers with the intensity adjusted to the individual training heart frequency. The strength-endurance unit implied training with equipment such as barbells, rubber bands, Redondo balls, gymnastic sticks and fitness balls. We avoided combined arm and leg movements in order to keep coordinative demands low.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Structural MRI scanning protocol</h3>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Verio scanner (Syngo MR B17). A 3-D structural MRI was acquired of each subject using a T-1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (224 sagittal slices, voxel size: 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm<sup>3</sup>, TR: 2500 ms, TE: 3,47 ms, TI: 1000 ms, flip angle: 7°).</p>

<div id="section1"><h4>Voxel-based morphometry for pairwise longitudinal group comparison.</h4><p>Since systematic bias in longitudinal image registration has recently become an issue, we used a relatively new VBM method implemented in SPM 12. This method has been developed especially for the analysis within longitudinal studies [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref035">35</a>]. It counteracts biases from asymmetric processing, where within-subject image processing often treats one time-point differently from the others. With this new approach, it is possible to directly compare the effects of one intervention vs the other (dance vs sport) on gray and white matter structures [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref036">36</a>].</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Analysis of BDNF</h3>
<p>The BDNF serum and plasma levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA system (BDNF DuoSets; R&amp;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) as described previously [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref040">40</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref041">41</a>]. Blood samples were taken in the morning under fasting conditions.</p>

<div id="section5"><h3>Cognitive assessments</h3>
<p>We applied an extensive battery of cognitive tests that probed attention (alertness, Go/Nogo, divided attention, flexibility) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref042">42</a>], processing speed (trail making test) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref043">43</a>], verbal word fluency [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref044">44</a>], short-term and working memory (digit span forward and backward of the Wechsler-Memory Scale) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref045">45</a>], verbal episodic memory (verbal learning and memory task) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref046">46</a>] and visuospatial memory (Rey-Osterrieth-Complex-Figure Test) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref047">47</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Physical fitness assessment</h3>
<p>We employed the Physical Working Capacity 130 Test (PWC130) on a bicycle ergometer to assess endurance-related fitness. The test reflects the linear relationship between the heart rate during submaximal exercise and exercise load and highly correlates to VO<sub>2</sub>max [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref048">48</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="section7"><h3>Statistical analysis</h3>

<div id="section1"><h4>MRI data processing and analysis.</h4><p>Before preprocessing, all structural images were checked for artifacts, and the center point was placed on the anterior commissure. T1-weighted images of baseline and post measures of each subject were taken to run a pairwise longitudinal registration. The second step included the segmentation of gray and white matter as well of CSF for all average images. To measure volumetric changes in gray and white matter, every average image of each subject was disguised with the 3-D segmented maps of gray and white matter. Subsequently, spatial normalization using DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra) [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref036">36</a>] was applied in the standardized MNI space. The normalized, segmented images were smoothed using an 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. For each subject, normalized and smoothed images displaying volume changes in gray and white matter were created. Since we were especially interested in group differences, we investigated only average images for each individual, as in previous studies [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref037">37</a>]. Group analyses using t-tests for independent samples compared volume changes in both gray and white matter between the two intervention groups. Co-variables such as age, sex and intracranial volume were entered in the analysis. For both groups, aligned t-contrasts (dance&gt;sport; sport&gt;dance) were calculated. As in previous longitudinal studies [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref038">38</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref039">39</a>], we applied a threshold of p&lt; 0.001 (uncorrected) across the whole brain with a minimal cluster size of 50 voxel for gray and white matter.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="section8"><h3>Cognitive and physical data</h3>
<p>Explorative analysis for cognitive and physical data was performed using SPSS (SPSS 22 Inc./IBM). Intervention effects were tested using repeated-measurement ANOVAS with group (dance, sport) as the between-subject factor and time (pre, post) as the within-subject factor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section3"><h2>Results</h2><p>To assess baseline differences between the dance and sport groups we analyzed gray and whiter matter volume using voxel-based morphometry. Two-sample t-tests revealed no significant group differences. Baseline values of gray (p = .340) and white matter volume (p = .497) were similar for both groups and did not differ.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Gray matter changes</h3>
<p>After the intervention, compared to the SG, DG participants showed significantly larger volumes in multiple frontal and temporal cortical areas, including the anterior und medial cingulate cortex, the left supplementary motor area, the left precentral gyrus, the left medial frontal gyrus, the left insula, the left superior temporal gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus. The red-colored regions in <a href="#pone-0196636-g002">Fig 2</a> give an overview of these brain areas. The participants from the SG showed greater volume increases compared to the dancers in occipital and cerebellar regions. These included the primary visual cortex, the left lingual gyrus, the right fusiform gyrus, the right temporal pole and the right lobe of the cerebellum. The blue-colored regions in <a href="#pone-0196636-g002">Fig 2</a> give an overview of these brain regions. The corresponding MNI-coordinates and specific values for the contrast dance &gt; sport and sport &gt; dance are presented in <a href="#pone.0196636.s002">S2 Table</a>.</p>

<div id="section2"><h3>White matter changes</h3>
<p>Participants from the DG demonstrated larger volume increases in the truncus and splenium of the corpus callosum. An increased volume was also observed in the right and left frontal and right parietal white matter. These regions are presented in <a href="#pone-0196636-g003">Fig 3</a>.

<div id="section3"><h3>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)</h3>
<p>Whereas no intervention effects were observed in BDNF serum values, the plasma values showed an increase after dance training. This is confirmed by a time x group interaction with F(1,35) = 4,3; p = 0.046; η<sup>2</sup> = ,115. Although the dance group started with a lower plasma BDNF level, a t-test did not reveal a significant between-group difference at baseline (<a href="#pone.0196636.s004">S4 Table</a>). To exclude interindividual variations, we calculated intraindividual changes in BDNF levels after intervention. Again, DG participants showed significantly larger increases in plasma BDNF level than SG participants (<a href="#pone-0196636-g004">Fig 4</a>).</p>
<p>As it is evident from the figure, the increase in BDNF level was significantly increased in the DG compared with the SG (Mann-Whitney’s U-test, p &lt; 0.018).</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Cognitive results</h3>
<p>We found a main effect of time for alertness with acoustic cues (F (1,37) = 9,48; p = .004; η<sup>2</sup> = ,218) but no time x group interaction. Visuospatial memory improved after both trainings, demonstrated by a main effect of time for immediate (F(1,37) = 38,04; p &lt; .001; η<sup>2</sup> = ,54) as well as for delayed recall (F(1,37) = 28,37; p &lt; .001; η<sup>2</sup> = ,455). There was, however, no significant group x time interaction (all p-values &gt; 0.6). Other cognitive functions did not change in either group (all p-values &gt; 0.28). For detailed information see <a href="#pone.0196636.s005">S5</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.s006">S6</a> and <a href="#pone.0196636.s007">S7</a> Tables.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Physical fitness results</h3>
<p>After six months of training, both groups enhanced their aerobic fitness, indicated by a significant main effect of time for the PWC 130 test (F(1,32) = 11,4; p = 0.002; η<sup>2</sup> = ,275). No group differences emerged.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div xmlns:plos="http://plos.org" id="section4"><h2>Discussion</h2><p>This study examined the effects of a specially designed dance training program requiring constant learning of new choreographies compared to a conventional sportive fitness training with mainly repetitive exercises on brain structure and function in healthy seniors. We used a new voxel-based morphometry approach specifically designed for a pairwise longitudinal group comparison. Both groups improved their fitness levels. However, as there was no group difference, the observed differences in brain plasticity cannot simply be attributed to physical fitness but must reflect the specific components of the intervention programs.</p>

<div id="section1"><h3>Gray matter changes in dancers</h3>
<p>In general, dancing induced more wide-spread gray matter increases than the sportive control program. The dancers showed gray matter volume increases after training in the anterior and medial cingulate cortex, in the left supplementary motor area, in the left sided precentral gyrus, in the left medial frontal gyrus, in the left superior temporal gyrus, in the left insula and in the left post-central gyrus.</p>
<p>The anterior cingulate cortex and the medial frontal gyri are mainly associated with working memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref049">49</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref050">50</a>]. These areas also form the basis of executive functions, cognitive control and attention regulation. In addition, the cingulate gyrus is also a part of the limbic system and is engaged in the storage of new information in long-term-memory, as well as in the retrieval of stored information [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref050">50</a>]. In the insula, the networks of working memory and attention overlap and potentially interact [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref051">51</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref052">52</a>]. Dancing poses demands on both attention and memory. Our dancing program was intended to keep the dancers in a constant learning process by confronting them continuously with novel motion sequences. They had to attentively follow the movements of the instructor to retain, retrieve and perform the choreographies under several conditions of pressure. Since the genre or the dancing style was changed every second week, no monotony could evolve. Rather this approach placed high demands on attentional and memory processes, especially working memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref053">53</a>]. These cognitive functions usually underlie an age-related degradation making the results especially promising with respect to a preventive potential.</p>
<p>Enhanced volumes after dance training were also seen in motor and somatosensory areas. Among these were the precentral gyri and the supplementary motor area. These areas have a preprocessing and executive function within the motor system [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref054">54</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref055">55</a>]. Again, the increased volumes of these regions can be attributed to the complexity of the dance movement patterns. The simultaneous use of different body parts for different rhythms promotes the coordination of the whole body. In addition, the changing tempi of the music induce a dynamic and temporal variability in the execution of partial (segmented) and whole-body movements. Dancing also increased the volume of the postcentral gyrus. In this area, somatosensory fibers end, which convey information from proprioceptive organs such as neuromuscular spindles, joint and sinew receptors. Other than the fitness program, our dancing program involved manifold steps and constant shifts of balance and regular turns. Hence, it can be assumed that body movement perception was trained as well as the perception of the location and position of the body and body segments to each other in space. This kind of feedback (reafference) to the cortex is needed to align and refine movement processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the superior temporal gyrus displayed an increased gray matter volume after six months of dance training. This part of the temporal lobe is associated with episodic memory and deteriorates early in Alzheimer’s disease [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref008">8</a>]. Furthermore, it is closely linked to the adjacent superior temporal sulcus, which is crucial for auditory short-term memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref056">56</a>] and audio-visual integration [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref057">57</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref058">58</a>]. While learning to dance, participants needed to keep the verbal instructions of the teacher in mind. Another important aspect constitutes the audio-visual integration of stimuli because dancing involves multisensory stimulation with visual, sensory and auditory input. For example, dancers have to visually observe and sense their movements while they listen to music and have to set these pieces of information in accordance with each other.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2"><h3>White matter changes in dancers</h3>
<p>White matter volume increases associated with dancing were seen in close spatial proximity to the cortical changes in frontal and parietal parts of the brains. Most outstanding was the enlargement of the corpus callosum, which carries the largest part of the commissure fibers and connects nearly all parts of the hemispheres. Hence, the corpus callosum ensures the communication between both cerebral hemispheres. Aging leads to degradation of this region, a process that has been associated with age-related loss in cognitive performance [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref059">59</a>]. The present findings indicate that dancing can intensify the connectivity and interaction between both cerebral hemispheres. This appears plausible given that different motor, somatosensory and cognitive areas have to communicate in order to accomplish the complex task of dancing.</p>
</div>

<div id="section3"><h3>Brain changes after sport training</h3>
<p>Compared to dancing, the completion of the sport program led to fewer and smaller brain volume increases. For both white and gray matter, they were seen mainly in the cerebellum and higher visual and adjacent areas. The increased volume in the cerebellum seems plausible. Compared to dancing, the movements of the sport group had a cyclic and repetitive character. After the initial phase of training, these routines hardly required any conscious control; instead, they were performed automatically [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref028">28</a>]. The cerebellum is crucial for unconscious planning and execution of movements [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref060">60</a>]. Furthermore, together with the basal ganglia, it constitutes the basis of procedural memory [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref061">61</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref062">62</a>]. In procedural memory, the retrieval of movement programs does not underlie conscious cognitive control and does not require focused attention. In sum, in contrast to dancing, the fitness training required less cognitive resources.</p>
<p>The volume change in visual areas including the right fusiform gyrus came rather unexpectedly. Initially, it is unclear why fitness training should boost areas related to visual perception, especially that of faces, more than dancing [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref063">63</a>]. However, as outlined above, dancing stresses audio-visual integration rather than visual perception per se. The fitness training, on the other hand, with its low cognitive demands, may have seduced participants to focus their attention on visual input–especially the faces of the other participants.</p>
</div>

<div id="section4"><h3>Possible neurophysiological basis of the observed volume changes</h3>
<p>Animal models have suggested that age limits the capacity for adaptive changes related to dynamic neural network modulations induced by environmental and intrinsic changes [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref064">64</a>]. On the other hand, it is known that new neurons are generated in the vertebrate brain throughout the life span [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref065">65</a>]. This neurogenesis increases with physical exercise and occurs in the hippocampus as well as in the subventricular zone around the lateral ventricles [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref066">66</a>]. However, a large fraction of the new neurons does not survive [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref026">26</a>]. It was stated that while exercise increases the rate of neurogenesis, environmental enrichment increases the ratio of new neurons that survive and get incorporated into the lattice of the existing neural network [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref067">67</a>]. In this respect, dancing, which can be considered a combination of exercise and sensory enrichment, may have a similar potential for inducing long-lasting survival of newly created neurons. BDNF may be a possible mediating factor of adult neuroplasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref013">13</a>]. In the present study, BDNF plasma levels increased during the dance training. BDNF is known to be important for synaptogenesis, dendritogenesis as well as neurogenesis [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref014">14</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref015">15</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref016">16</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref017">17</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref018">18</a>]. Activity-dependent release of BDNF during dancing, a training program that involves attention and memory process could underlie the observed volume increases of gray matter. In Alzheimer’s disease, known for its neurodegenerative process and cognitive decline, BDNF levels in the brain and also in the blood were found to be significantly reduced [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref068">68</a>]. Therefore, the observed increase in gray matter volume associated with the increase in circulating BDNF support the idea of BDNF-induced structural changes in the brain.</p>
</div>

<div id="section5"><h3>Cognitive effects</h3>
<p>Compared with the effects on the brain, the effects of the trainings on cognitive functions were rather low and showed no significant differences between the groups. Improvements of some attentional processes and of visual spatial memory were observed in both groups. This raises the general question of why the effects on cognition were so small compared to those induced in the brain. Two explanations will be discussed: First, the tests were not sensitive for revealing changes in cognitive processes. Second, the brain changes may precede the changes in measurable behavior, so that the latter would have required a longer intervention program. This assumption is currently under investigation in our laboratory.</p>
</div>

<div id="section6"><h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Like other studies on training induced neuroplasticity [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref038">38</a>, <a href="#pone.0196636.ref039">39</a>], our MRI results are based on uncorrected data because with the small sample size, the results would not have survived traditional corrections such as FDR. Next, we tested highly selected, healthy and motivated samples of elder adults; hence, whether the results generalize to the elderly population as a whole needs to be investigated in future studies. Lastly, the assessment of subcortical structures with VBM has been criticized as being less reliable [<a href="#pone.0196636.ref069">69</a>]. Future studies should make use of DTI white matter tractography to assess white matter changes.</p>
</div>

<div id="section7"><h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>We were able to demonstrate in a randomized intervention trial that dancing has a strong potential to induce more positive effects on brain volumes in elderly people. Previous research has mainly focused on other, more monotonic aerobic exercises such as running, walking, cycling (endurance training) or on anaerobic strength and stretching exercises. Compared to these standard fitness programs, our specially designed six-month dancing program increased volumes in regions which relate to higher cognitive processes such as working memory and attention and which are especially affected by age-related decline. In our view, the more pronounced effects of dancing on the human brain can be explained by the fact that dancing promotes a large number of processes at the same time: spatial orientation, movement coordination, balance, endurance, interaction and communication. Furthermore, by presenting our participants with ever new choreographies, our program induced a constant learning processes. This dance training program does not need special requirements, has a low risk of accidents and can be implemented at low costs. Therefore, it endorses itself as an appropriate measure to counteract age-related declines in brain structure.</p>

Drawing on their experience of measuring emissions directly on board LNG-powered ships and at export terminals, they pointed to a number of potential sources, ranging from engine slip (unburned methane in exhaust fumes) from the vessel’s auxiliary engine to direct leaks from the terminal’s LNG loading arms. They also cautioned that wind conditions can make it hard to attribute plumes directly to sources on the ground —&nbsp;an important consideration, as according to </span><a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/la/cameron/KLCH/date/2021-4-28" rel="">historical data</a><span> 28 April 2021 was a relatively windy day in Louisiana.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png" width="1440" height="704" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:366805,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79292e00-0702-4829-922e-1120ad70a3bd_1440x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>A diagram from the </span><a href="https://theicct.org/publication/fumes-characterizing-methane-emissions-from-lng-fueled-ships-using-drones-helicopters-and-on-board-measurements-jan24/" rel="">FUMES</a><span> study, showing how researchers used drones to measure methane emissions from ships.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>According to Carbon Mapper’s estimates, the plume we’re looking at here was emitting methane at a rate of around 3.4 tonnes per hour. This is as much as some of the largest plumes observed from static oil and gas infrastructure in countries notorious for their methane-intensive upstream oil and gas production —&nbsp;for example, </span><a href="https://data.carbonmapper.org/?details=CH4_1B2_250m_5.99642_31.77781%3Fstatus%3Dnot_deleted#12.96/31.78964/6.00802" rel="">Algeria</a><span> and </span><a href="https://data.carbonmapper.org/?details=CH4_1B2_250m_54.20285_38.55782%3Fstatus%3Dnot_deleted#12.91/38.55775/54.21379" rel="">Turkmenistan</a><span>.</span></p><p>But ships are different from oil wells. Rather than emitting methane constantly, the largest emissions from LNG tankers appear to happen at specific times, during cargo loading and unloading or during bunkering (refuelling). Unlike oil wells, ships move around, and current satellites have a hard time detecting methane plumes over water, meaning that researchers without direct access to the ships are left poring over chance images like the one we’ve found. All this makes it especially challenging to come up with reliable estimates for the LNG shipping industry’s emissions as a whole.</p><p><span>There is hope, however. As more and more satellite-based methane emissions data comes online, repeating this analysis will likely yield more and more observations linked to LNG terminals around the world —&nbsp;and, in some cases, plumes emerging directly from LNG tankers. This data will feed into projects like GEM’s </span><a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-methane-emitters-tracker/" rel="">Global Methane Emitters Tracker</a><span> and eventually into the methodologies behind major initiatives like </span><a href="https://climatetrace.org/" rel="">ClimateTRACE</a><span>, where efforts are currently focussed on estimating emissions from the global shipping industry.</span></p><p><span>Speaking on a </span><a href="https://www.cleaningup.live/this-is-a-narrative-war-how-to-win-the-climate-argument-ep172-john-marshall/" rel="">recent episode</a><span> of the </span><em>Cleaning Up</em><span> podcast, Bryony Worthington described an advertising campaign around pollution that she’d been involved with in the 2000s: “We had a reasonable budget, and we took some stock footage, and we coloured in the gases so you could see a luminescent colour that we added to all the exhaust of the cars and the chimneys, and it all built up in the atmosphere. And the tagline was, ‘if you could see the blanket of gases, you’d do something about it.’” With methane emissions becoming more visible by the day, we hope this maxim holds true.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

This was the culmination of nearly three years of litigation against Sable, but it wasn’t the end of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Today we’re pleased to announce that the litigation against Sable has finally concluded on terms that we believe send a strong message to patent trolls everywhere — if you bring meritless patent claims against Cloudflare, we will fight back and we will win.</p><p>We’re also pleased to announce additional prizes in <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-prior-art-search/"><u>Project Jengo</u></a>, and to make a final call for submissions before we determine the winners of the Final Awards. As a reminder, Project Jengo is Cloudflare’s effort to fight back against patent trolls by flipping the incentive structure that has encouraged the growth of patent trolls who extract settlements out of companies using frivolous lawsuits. We do this by asking the public to help identify prior art that can invalidate any of the patents that a troll holds, not just the ones that are asserted against Cloudflare. We’ve already given out over $125,000 to individuals since the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo/"><u>launch of Project Jengo in 2017</u></a>, and we’re looking forward to celebrating the successful end of the Sable iteration of Project Jengo with our Final Awards!</p><p>To learn more about how things concluded with Sable and next steps in Project Jengo, read on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Background</h3><p>For anyone just joining us on this odyssey, here is a little background on how we got here:</p><p>Sable sued Cloudflare back in March 2021. Sable is a patent troll. It doesn’t make, develop, innovate, or sell anything. Sable IP is merely a shell entity formed to monetize (make money from) an ancient patent portfolio acquired by Sable Networks from Caspian Networks in 2006. <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-technology/caspian-closes-its-doors"><u>Caspian Networks was a router company that went out of business nearly 20 years ago</u></a>. Using Caspian’s old patents, Sable sued Cloudflare and many other companies, including Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, and Juniper Networks, alleging patent infringement. While these other companies resolved their disputes with Sable out of court, Cloudflare fought back.&nbsp;</p><p>Sable initially asserted around 100 claims from four different patents against Cloudflare, accusing multiple Cloudflare products and features of infringement. Sable’s patents — the old Caspian Networks patents — related to hardware-based router technologies common over 20 years ago. Sable’s infringement arguments stretched these patent claims to their limits (and beyond) as Sable tried to apply Caspian’s hardware-based technologies to Cloudflare’s modern software-defined services delivered on the cloud.</p><p>Cloudflare fought back against Sable by launching a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-prior-art-search/"><u>new round of Project Jengo</u></a>, Cloudflare’s prior art contest, seeking prior art to invalidate all of Sable’s patents.</p><p>After years of Cloudflare aggressively litigating against Sable’s patents before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the district court, Sable was left with only one claim from one patent to assert against Cloudflare at trial. If you’d like to know more, we described those battles, in which Cloudflare successfully eliminated around 99% of Sable’s claims, in more detail in a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-defeats-patent-troll-sable-at-trial/"><u>prior blog post</u></a>.</p><p>Sable and Cloudflare came together in a five-day jury trial in Waco, Texas in February 2024. At trial, Sable did its best to try to map its decades-old router technology onto Cloudflare’s modern software-based architecture. But Sable’s case was riddled with technical issues and its efforts backed only by the desire for a payout.</p><h3>The jury agrees: Cloudflare <u>does not infringe</u></h3><p>To defeat Sable’s claim of infringement we needed to explain to the jury — in clear and understandable terms — why what Cloudflare does is different from what was covered by claim 25 of Sable’s remaining patent, U.S. Patent No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7012919B1/en?oq=7012919"><u>7,012,919</u></a> (the ’919 patent). To do this, we enlisted the help of one of our talented Cloudflare engineers, Eric Reeves, as well as <a href="https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Paul-Min.html"><u>Dr. Paul Min, Senior Professor of Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering at Washington University</u></a>, an expert in the field of computer networking. Eric and Dr. Min helped us explain to the jury the multiple reasons we didn’t infringe.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial</i></sup></p><p>First, we explained that the accused Cloudflare products (<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/"><u>Magic Transit</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-smart-routing/argo-for-packets/"><u>Argo for Packets</u></a>) do not route “flows” or “micro-flows” as required by claim 25. Instead, they handle packets individually, on a packet-by-packet basis. Indeed, processing each packet individually is important to the functioning of these products and Cloudflare’s DDoS and security services as a whole.</p><p>Eric also helped to tell our invention story to the jury. He explained how the Cloudflare team saw problems that needed to be solved, and built unique and innovative new products to solve them. He described the work that went into developing Magic Transit and Argo for Packets, and how these products are part of Cloudflare’s modern software-based approach, which is fundamentally different from the hardware-based technology of the ’919 patent. Together, Eric and Dr. Min explained how the benefits of Magic Transit and Argo for Packets enjoyed by Cloudflare’s customers are not attributable to any technology claimed by the ’919 patent.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial</i></sup></p><p>Second, we explained that Cloudflare doesn’t infringe because claim 25 of the ’919 patent requires certain processes to occur “at” ingress and egress line cards, and Cloudflare’s accused servers do not include line cards.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial</i></sup></p><p>As Dr. Min explained, “line cards” are a specific type of hardware — a physical hardware “card” — that are commonly used in routers. Sable’s witnesses could not deny that the technology of the ’919 patent was tied to old router technology. After all, Caspian Networks Inc. (where the ’919 patent inventors worked) was a router company. Caspian’s core products were routers, and we showed the jury documents describing Caspian’s routers, which used “flow-based” technology on physical hardware line cards.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Trial exhibit, image of sample line card</i></sup></p><p>While Sable’s technical expert tried his hardest to convince the jury that various software and hardware components of Cloudflare’s servers constitute “line cards,” his explanations defied credibility. The simple fact is that Cloudflare’s servers do not have line cards.</p><p>Ultimately, the jury understood, returning a verdict that Cloudflare does not infringe claim 25 of the ‘919 patent.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from Verdict Form completed by the jury</i></sup></p><h3>The jury agrees: Sable’s patent claim is <u>invalid</u></h3><p>In addition to proving that we do not infringe, we also took on the challenge of proving to the jury that claim 25 of the ’919 patent is invalid and never should have been issued.</p><p>Proving invalidity to a jury is hard. The burden on the defendant is high: Cloudflare needed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that claim 25 is invalid.&nbsp; And, proving it by describing how the claim is obvious in light of the prior art is complicated.</p><p>To do this, we again relied on our technical expert, Dr. Min, to explain how two prior art references, U.S. Patent No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6584071B1/en?oq=6584071"><u>6,584,071</u></a> (Kodialam) and U.S. Patent No. <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6680933B1/en?oq=6680933"><u>6,680,933</u></a> (Cheeseman) together render claim 25 of the ’919 patent obvious. Kodialam and Cheeseman are patents from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel"><u>Nortel Networks</u></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent_Technologies"><u>Lucent</u></a> relating to router technology developed in the late 1990s. Both are prior art to the ’919 patent (i.e., they pre-date the priority date of the ’919 patent), and when considered together by a person skilled in the area of computer engineering and computer networking technology, they rendered obvious the so-called invention of claim 25.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from Verdict Form completed by the jury</i></sup><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p><h3>Sable does not get its payday …</h3><p>Sable’s real motivation for suing Cloudflare — its desire for a payout — was made clear by Sable’s trial witnesses, who were unified only by their desire to present a wildly inflated view of the alleged “value” of the Sable patent and the damages allegedly owed by Cloudflare.&nbsp;</p><p>Sable’s attorneys tried their best to present their clients as reasonable businessmen, just trying to get what they’re owed for Cloudflare’s purported use of Sable’s patent. But Sable couldn’t hide its true colors from the jury. When Sable presented testimony from Brooks Borchers, the founder of Sable IP, Mr. Borchers was forced to admit that Sable IP is in the “business” of filing lawsuits.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from Borchers trial testimony</i></sup></p><p>&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Borchers was forced to admit that Sable’s approach is to sue first and ask questions later. Even among patent trolls, this is hardly a noble business practice.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4Dr73QwC1urT9QNZYTzYK7/3882fcdbdeae32f583be2fdea8641729/BLOG-2579_9.png" alt="BLOG-2579 9" width="638" height="796" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpts from Borchers trial testimony</i></sup></p><p>What's more, Mr. Borchers and his lawyers have teamed up on cases like this before, following the same sue-first-and-ask-questions-later playbook in hopes of a payout. Sable’s true motivations for suing Cloudflare were on full display after this testimony, making Sable’s damages demand all the more galling.</p><p>Sable’s damages expert, Stephen Dell, told the jury that Sable was owed somewhere between <span>$</span>25 million and $94.2 million in damages. But, Mr. Dell was forced to admit to multiple flaws in his damages calculation, and Cloudflare’s damages expert Chris Bakewell explained to the jury how bad inputs and faulty assumptions led Mr. Dell to a wildly inflated damages figure. Indeed, after hearing Sable’s expert’s testimony, Judge Albright said he was “very skeptical” of Mr. Dell’s opinions, explaining that he was “very concerned that there’s not support for his methodology.”</p><p>In the end, Mr. Dell’s outsized damages demand didn’t matter because the jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe and that the asserted patent claim is invalid. But, it was revealing of Sable’s motivation (greed) and the lengths that it would go to try to get a payout.</p><p>When all was said and done, after all the testimony and argument, we were thrilled when the jury returned its verdict — after less than two hours of deliberations — finding across the board for Cloudflare. The jury’s verdict is truly a validation of our strong belief in the importance of standing up to patent trolls like Sable, and we are grateful for the jury’s time, attention and consideration!</p><h3>Sable admits defeat, and agrees to pay Cloudflare!</h3><p>A jury verdict is not the end of the road in a patent case ... there are post-trial motions, appeals, and other procedural hurdles to jump through before a case is truly over. Tired from the fight, and smarting from its loss, Sable decided it wanted to throw in the towel and end the fight once and for all.</p><p>In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public, ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against another company.</p><p>Let’s repeat that first part, just to make sure everyone understands:&nbsp;</p><p>Sable, the patent troll that sued Cloudflare back in March 2021 asserting around 100 claims across four patents, in the end wound up paying Cloudflare. While this $225,000 can’t fully compensate us for the time, energy and frustration of having to deal with this litigation for nearly three years, it does help to even the score a bit. And we hope that it sends an important message to patent trolls everywhere to beware before taking on Cloudflare.</p>

          </figure><p><sup>&nbsp;</sup><sup><i>Excerpt from the Dedication to the Public and Royalty Free License Agreement between Sable and Cloudflare</i></sup></p><p>And, let’s talk a bit more about that final part:</p><p>Sable has agreed to dedicate its entire patent portfolio to the public. This means that Sable will tell the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that it gives up all of its legal rights to its patent portfolio. Sable can never again use these patents to sue for infringement; they can never again use these patents to try to make a quick buck.</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>Excerpt from the Dedication to the Public and Royalty Free License Agreement between Sable and Cloudflare</i></sup></p><h3>To sum it up …</h3><p>Cloudflare fought back against the patent troll and we won. We not only defeated Sable's claims in court, we forced Sable to pay Cloudflare for the trouble, and we got Sable's patents dedicated to the public, ensuring that it can never assert these patents against any other company ever again. It was admittedly a lot of work for Cloudflare, but totally worth it.</p><h3>Project Jengo for Sable: Conclusion of the Case</h3><p>A crucial part of our efforts to secure this across-the-board win are our Project Jengo participants.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-redux-cloudflares-prior-art-search-bounty-returns/"><u>launch of the Project Jengo for the Sable case</u></a>, we’ve received hundreds of prior art references from dedicated Project Jengo participants. So far we have awarded <span>$</span>70,000 in prizes to the winners of Chapters 1 through 8. And we still have $30,000 in prizes to award in the Final Awards.</p><p>This blog post marks the official “Conclusion of the Case” under the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-rules/"><u>Project Jengo Sable Rules</u></a>. We will continue to accept submissions during the 30-day Grace Period, which lasts until November 2, 2024, and then will move on to selecting winners of the Final Awards.</p><h3>We are thrilled to announce the winners of Chapters 7 and 8</h3><p>We publicly celebrated the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-2-first-three-winners/"><u>Chapter 1</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/former-rd-engineer-wins-round-2-of-project-jengo-and-cloudflare-wins-at-the-patent-office/"><u>Chapter 2</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/arkansas-engineer-wins-round-3-of-project-jengo-and-cloudflare-continues-to-win-at-the-patent-office/"><u>Chapter 3</u></a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/three-new-winners-of-project-jengo-and-more-defeats-for-the-patent-troll/"><u>Chapters 4-6</u></a> winners in previous blog posts. However, as the trial approached in the Sable case, we chose not to make public announcements for the Chapter 7 and 8 winners out of respect for the judicial process. Now that the case is over, we are delighted to give a big public shout out to the winners of Project Jengo Chapters 7 and 8!</p><p>We selected four total winners in Chapters 7 and 8, each receiving prizes of <span>$</span>5,000, for a grand total of $20,000. Our Chapter 7 winners, George W. and Madhu, each provided helpful and detailed charts containing element-by-element comparisons of the prior art to the relevant Sable patents. George W. is an electrical engineer and lawyer, who is active in the intellectual property community. He learned about Project Jengo in an article posted online, and thought it was a clever idea. The Chapter 8 winners, Jatin and Ketan, also provided thoughtful and detailed submissions. Jatin submitted two pieces of prior art that were particularly good references for Sable’s U.S. Patent No. 7,012,919, which contains the one claim that remained asserted against Cloudflare at trial.</p><p>We also want to again thank our prior chapter winners and everyone who participated in Project Jengo! We look forward to selecting the Final Awards winners — it will be fun to take a walk down memory lane re-reviewing the fantastic prior art submitted by our prior winners, and we can’t wait to check out the new submissions, too! Please use the “Submit Prior Art” link on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-prior-art-search/"><u>this page</u></a> for your final entries. Once we’ve announced our Final Awards, we will also update the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/priorart/"><u>Sable patents prior art listing</u></a> on our website, to share all the prior art submitted by our Project Jengo participants.</p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.
