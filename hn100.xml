<p>Microsoft is working on adding a new Teams feature&nbsp;that will prevent users from capturing screenshots of sensitive information shared during meetings.</p>

<p>Those joining from unsupported platforms will be automatically placed in audio-only mode to protect shared content.&nbsp;The company&nbsp;plans to start rolling out this new Teams feature to Android, desktop, iOS, and web&nbsp;users worldwide in July 2025.</p>

<p>"To address the issue of unauthorized screen captures during meetings, the Prevent Screen Capture feature ensures that if a user attempts to take a screen capture, the meeting window will turn black, thereby protecting sensitive information," <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490051" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft shared</a> in a new&nbsp;Microsoft 365 roadmap entry.</p>

<p>"This feature will be available on Teams desktop applications (both Windows and Mac) and Teams mobile applications (both iOS and Android)."</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that, even if screenshots are blocked, sensitive media and information shared in Teams meetings can still be captured by taking a photo of the conversation.</p>

<p>Last month, Meta introduced a similar WhatsApp feature named "<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapps-new-advanced-chat-privacy-protects-sensitive-messages/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Advanced Chat Privacy</a>," which protects sensitive information exchanged in private chats and group conversations by blocking attempts to save shared media and export chat content.</p>

<p>Redmond will also roll out&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">town hall screen privilege management update</a>&nbsp;in Teams Rooms on Windows,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490564" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interactive BizChat/Copilot Studio agents</a>&nbsp;in meetings and 1-on-1 calls, and a Copilot feature to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a>&nbsp;of transcribed meetings in June.</p>

<p>Another Copilot feature to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a>&nbsp;of transcribed meetings is also under development and&nbsp;will let users choose the speakers, adjust the tone, and tailor the length.</p>

<p>In January, the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-phishing-attack-alerts-coming-to-everyone-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reminded Microsoft 365 admins</a>&nbsp;that its new Teams Chat brand impersonation protection feature, which alerts users when detecting phishing attacks targeting organizations with external Teams access toggled on, will be made generally available for all customers by mid-February 2025.</p>

<p>At last year's&nbsp;Enterprise Connect enterprise communications and collaboration conference, Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/microsoft-teams-building-a-foundation-for-the-future/4090393" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;that the Teams platform had reached over 320 million monthly active users across 181 markets and 44 languages.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thank you very much, Your Eminence. Before taking our seats, let us begin with a prayer, asking the Lord to continue to accompany this College, and above all the entire Church with this spirit, with enthusiasm, but also with deep faith. Let us pray together in Latin.</p> 
<p>Pater noster… Ave Maria…</p> 
<p>In the first part of this meeting, there will be a short talk with some reflections that I would like to share with you. But then there will be a second part, a bit like the opportunity that many of you had asked for: a sort of dialogue with the College of Cardinals to hear what advice, suggestions, proposals, concrete things, which have already been discussed in the days leading up to the Conclave.</p> 
<p>Dear Brother Cardinals,</p> 
<p>I greet all of you with gratitude for this meeting and for the days that preceded it. Days that were sad because of the loss of the Holy Father Pope Francis and demanding due to the responsibilities we confronted together, yet at the same time, in accordance with the promise Jesus himself made to us, days rich in grace and consolation in the Spirit (cf. <i>Jn</i> 14:25-27).</p> 
<p>You, dear Cardinals, are the closest collaborators of the Pope. This has proved a great comfort to me in accepting a yoke clearly far beyond my own limited powers, as it would be for any of us. Your presence reminds me that the Lord, who has entrusted me with this mission, will not leave me alone in bearing its responsibility. I know, before all else, that I can always count on his help, the help of the Lord, and through his grace and providence, on your closeness and that of so many of our brothers and sisters throughout the world who believe in God, love the Church and support the Vicar of Christ by their prayers and good works.</p> 
<p>I thank the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re – who deserves applause, at least once, if not more – whose wisdom, the fruit of a long life and many years of faithful service to the Apostolic See, has helped us greatly during this time. I thank the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell – I believe he is present today – for the important and demanding work that he has done throughout the period of the Vacant See and for the convocation of the Conclave. My thoughts also go to our brother Cardinals who, for reasons of health, were unable to be present, and I join you in embracing them in communion of affection and prayer.</p> 
<p>At this moment, both sad and joyful, providentially bathed in the light of Easter, I would like all of us to see the passing of our beloved Holy Father Pope Francis and the Conclave as a paschal event, a stage in that long exodus through which the Lord continues to guide us towards the fullness of life. In this perspective, we entrust to the “merciful Father and God of all consolation” (<i>2 Cor</i> 1:3) the soul of the late Pontiff and also the future of the Church.</p> 
<p>Beginning with Saint Peter and up to myself, his unworthy Successor, the Pope has been a humble servant of God and of his brothers and sisters, and nothing more than this. It has been clearly seen in the example of so many of my Predecessors, and most recently by Pope Francis himself, with his example of complete dedication to service and to sober simplicity of life, his abandonment to God throughout his ministry and his serene trust at the moment of his return to the Father’s house. Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith.</p> 
<p>It is the Risen Lord, present among us, who protects and guides the Church, and continues to fill her with hope through the love “poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us” (<i>Rom</i> 5:5). It is up to us to be docile listeners to his voice and faithful ministers of his plan of salvation, mindful that God loves to communicate himself, not in the roar of thunder and earthquakes, but in the “whisper of a gentle breeze” (<i>1 Kings</i> 19:12) or, as some translate it, in a “sound of sheer silence.” It is this essential and important encounter to which we must guide and accompany all the holy People of God entrusted to our care.</p> 
<p>In these days, we have been able to see the beauty and feel the strength of this immense community, which with such affection and devotion has greeted and mourned its Shepherd, accompanying him with faith and prayer at the time of his final encounter with the Lord. We have seen the true grandeur of the Church, which is alive in the rich variety of her members in union with her one Head, Christ, “the shepherd and guardian” (<i>1 Peter</i> 2:25) of our souls. She is the womb from which we were born and at the same time the flock (cf. <i>Jn</i> 21:15-17), the field (cf. <i>Mk</i> 4:1-20) entrusted to us to protect and cultivate, to nourish with the sacraments of salvation and to make fruitful by our sowing the seed of the Word, so that, steadfast in one accord and enthusiastic in mission, she may press forward, like the Israelites in the desert, in the shadow of the cloud and in the light of God’s fire (cf. <i>Ex</i> 13:21).</p> 
<p>In this regard, I would like us to renew together today our complete commitment to the path that the universal Church has now followed for decades in the wake of the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index.htm">Second Vatican Council</a>. Pope Francis masterfully and concretely set it forth in the Apostolic Exhortation <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html">Evangelii Gaudium</a></i>, from which I would like to highlight several fundamental points: the return to the primacy of Christ in proclamation (cf. No. 11); the missionary conversion of the entire Christian community (cf. No. 9); growth in collegiality and synodality (cf. No. 33); attention to the <i>sensus fidei</i> (cf. Nos. 119-120), especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, such as popular piety (cf. No. 123); loving care for the least and the rejected (cf. No. 53); courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world in its various components and realities (cf. No. 84; Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html">Gaudium et Spes</a></i>, 1-2).</p> 
<p>These are evangelical principles that have always inspired and guided the life and activity of God’s Family. In these values, the merciful face of the Father has been revealed and continues to be revealed in his incarnate Son, the ultimate hope of all who sincerely seek truth, justice, peace and fraternity (cf. Benedict XVI, <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi.html">Spe Salvi</a></i>, 2; Francis, <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/20240509_spes-non-confundit_bolla-giubileo2025.html">Spes Non Confundit</a></i>, 3).</p> 
<p>Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV. There are different reasons for this, but mainly because Pope Leo XIII in his historic Encyclical <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html">Rerum Novarum</a></i> addressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution. In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour.</p> 
<p>Dear brothers, I would like to conclude the first part of our meeting by making my own – and proposing to you as well – the hope that Saint Paul VI expressed at the inauguration of his Petrine Ministry in 1963: “May it pass over the whole world like a great flame of faith and love kindled in all men and women of good will. May it shed light on paths of mutual cooperation and bless humanity abundantly, now and always, with the very strength of God, without whose help nothing is valid, nothing is holy” (<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/speeches/1963/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19630622_first-message.html">Message <i>Qui Fausto Die </i>addressed to the entire human family</a>, 22 June 1963).</p> 
<p>May these also be our sentiments, to be translated into prayer and commitment, with the Lord’s help. Thank you!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6792624295909344732" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>In 1985, Intel introduced the groundbreaking 386 processor, the first 32-bit processor in the x86 architecture.
To improve performance, the 386 has a 16-byte instruction prefetch queue.
The purpose of the prefetch queue is to fetch instructions from memory before they are needed,
so the processor usually doesn't need to wait on memory while executing instructions.
Instruction prefetching takes advantage of times when the processor is "thinking" and the memory bus would otherwise be unused.</p>
<p>In this article, I look at the 386's prefetch queue circuitry in detail.
One interesting circuit is the incrementer, which adds 1 to a pointer to step through memory.
This sounds easy enough, but the incrementer uses complicated circuitry for high performance.
The prefetch queue uses a large network
to shift bytes around so they are properly aligned.
It also has a compact circuit to extend signed 8-bit and 16-bit
numbers to 32 bits.
There aren't any major discoveries in this post, but if you're interested in low-level circuits and dynamic logic, keep reading.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the 386's shiny fingernail-sized silicon die under a microscope.
Although it may look like an aerial view of a strangely-zoned city, the die photo reveals the functional blocks
of the chip.
The Prefetch Unit in the upper left is the relevant block.
In this post, I'll discuss the
prefetch queue circuitry (highlighted in red), skipping over the prefetch control circuitry to the right.
The Prefetch Unit receives data from the Bus Interface Unit (upper right) that communicates with memory.
The Instruction Decode Unit receives prefetched instructions from the Prefetch Unit, byte by byte, and decodes the
opcodes for execution.</p>

Click this image (or any other) for a larger version." width="500"></a></p><p>This die photo of the 386 shows the location of the registers. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</p>
<p>The left quarter of the chip consists of stripes of circuitry that appears much more orderly than the rest of the chip.
This grid-like appearance arises because
each functional block is constructed (for the most part) by repeating the same circuit 32 times, once for each bit, side by side.
Vertical data lines run up and down, in groups of 32 bits, connecting the functional blocks.
To make this work, each circuit must fit into the same width on the die; this layout constraint forces the circuit
designers to develop a circuit that uses this width efficiently without exceeding the allowed width.
The circuitry for the prefetch queue uses the same approach: each circuit is 66 µm wide<span id="fnref:width"><a href="#fn:width">1</a></span> and repeated 32 times.
As will be seen, fitting the prefetch circuitry into this fixed width requires some layout tricks.</p>
<h2>What the prefetcher does</h2>
<p>The purpose of the prefetch unit is to speed up performance by reading instructions from memory before they are needed,
so the processor won't need to wait to get instructions from memory.
Prefetching takes advantage of times when the memory bus is otherwise idle, minimizing conflict with other instructions
that are reading or writing data.
In the 386, prefetched instructions are stored in a 16-byte queue, consisting of four 32-bit blocks.<span id="fnref:cache"><a href="#fn:cache">2</a></span></p>
<p>The diagram below zooms in on the prefetcher and shows its main components.
You can see how the same circuit (in most cases) is repeated 32 times, forming vertical bands.
At the top are 32 bus lines from the Bus Interface Unit. These lines provide the connection between the datapath and
external memory, via the Bus Interface Unit.
These lines form a triangular pattern as the 32 horizontal lines on the right branch off and form 32 vertical lines, one for each bit.
Next are the fetch pointer and the limit register, with a circuit to check if the fetch pointer has
reached the limit.
Note that the two low-order bits (on the right) of the incrementer and limit check circuit are
missing.
At the bottom of the incrementer, you can see that some bit positions have a blob of circuitry missing from others,
breaking the pattern of repeated blocks.
The 16-byte prefetch queue is below the incrementer. Although this memory is the heart of the prefetcher, its
circuitry takes up a relatively small area.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/prefetcher-labeled.jpg"><img alt="A close-up of the prefetcher with the main blocks labeled. At the right, the prefetcher receives control signals." height="387" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/prefetcher-labeled-w600.jpg" title="A close-up of the prefetcher with the main blocks labeled. At the right, the prefetcher receives control signals." width="600"></a></p><p>A close-up of the prefetcher with the main blocks labeled. At the right, the prefetcher receives control signals.</p>
<p>The bottom part of the prefetcher shifts data to align it as needed.
A 32-bit value can be split across two 32-bit
rows of the prefetch buffer.
To handle this, the prefetcher includes a data shift network to shift and align its data.
This network occupies a lot of space, but there is no active circuitry here: just a grid of horizontal and vertical wires.</p>
<p>Finally, the sign extend circuitry converts a signed 8-bit or 16-bit value into a signed 16-bit or 32-bit value
as needed.
You can see that the sign extend circuitry is highly irregular, especially in the middle.
A latch stores the output of the prefetch queue for use by the rest of the datapath.</p>
<h2>Limit check</h2>
<p>If you've written x86 programs, you probably know about the processor's Instruction Pointer (EIP) that holds the
address of the next instruction to execute.
As a program executes, the Instruction Pointer moves from instruction to instruction.
However, it turns out that the Instruction Pointer doesn't actually exist!
Instead, the 386 has an "Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer", which holds the address of the next instruction to
fetch into the prefetch queue.
But sometimes the processor needs to know the Instruction Pointer value, for instance, to determine the return
address when calling a subroutine or to compute the destination address of a relative jump.
So what happens?
The processor gets the Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer address from the prefetch queue circuitry and subtracts
the current length of the prefetch queue.
The result is the address of the next instruction to execute, the desired Instruction Pointer value.</p>
<p>The Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer—the address of the next instruction to prefetch—is stored
in a register at the
top of the prefetch queue circuitry.
As instructions are prefetched, this pointer is incremented by the prefetch circuitry. (Since instructions are fetched 32 bits at a time,
this pointer is incremented in steps of four and the bottom two bits are always 0.)</p>
<p>But what keeps the prefetcher from prefetching too far and going outside the valid memory range?
The x86 architecture infamously uses segments to define valid regions of memory.
A segment has a start and end address (known as the base and limit) and memory is protected by blocking accesses
outside the segment.
The 386 has six active segments; the relevant one is the Code Segment that holds program instructions.
Thus, the limit address of the Code Segment controls when the prefetcher must stop prefetching.<span id="fnref:paging"><a href="#fn:paging">3</a></span>
The prefetch queue contains a circuit to stop prefetching when the fetch pointer reaches the limit of the Code Segment.
In this section, I'll describe that circuit.</p>
<p>Comparing two values may seem trivial, but the 386 uses a few tricks to make this fast.
The basic idea is to use 30 XOR gates to compare the bits of the two registers.
(Why 30 bits and not 32? Since 32 bits are fetched at a time, the bottom bits of the address are 00 and can be ignored.)
If the two registers match, all the XOR values will be 0, but if they don't match, an XOR value will be 1.
Conceptually, connecting the XORs to a 32-input OR gate will yield the desired result:
0 if all bits match and 1 if there is a mismatch.
Unfortunately, building a 32-input OR gate using standard CMOS logic is impractical for electrical reasons, as well as
inconveniently large to fit into the circuit.
Instead, the 386 uses dynamic logic to implement a spread-out NOR gate with one transistor in each column of the 
prefetcher.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows the implementation of one bit of the equality comparison.
The mechanism is that if the two registers differ, the transistor on the right is turned on, pulling the equality bus low.
This circuit is replicated 30 times, comparing all the bits: if there is any mismatch, the equality bus will be pulled
low, but if all bits match, the bus remains high.
The three gates on the left implement XNOR; this circuit may seem overly complicated, but it is a standard way
of implementing XNOR.
The NOR gate at the right blocks the comparison except during clock phase 2.
(The importance of this will be explained below.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-logic.jpg"><img alt="This circuit is repeated 30 times to compare the registers." height="120" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-logic-w500.jpg" title="This circuit is repeated 30 times to compare the registers." width="500"></a></p><p>This circuit is repeated 30 times to compare the registers.</p>
<p>The equality bus travels horizontally through the prefetcher, pulled low if any bits don't match.
But what pulls the bus high?
That's the job of the dynamic circuit below.
Unlike regular static gates, dynamic logic is controlled by the processor's clock signals and depends on capacitance in the circuit to hold data.
The 386 is controlled by a two-phase clock signal.<span id="fnref:clock"><a href="#fn:clock">4</a></span>
In the first clock phase, the precharge transistor below turns on, pulling the
equality bus high.
In the second clock phase, the XOR circuits above are enabled, pulling the equality bus low if the two registers don't
match.
Meanwhile, the CMOS switch turns on in clock phase 2, passing the equality bus's value to the latch.
The "keeper" circuit keeps the equality bus held high unless it is explicitly pulled low, to avoid the risk of
the voltage on the equality bus slowly dissipating.
The keeper uses a weak transistor to keep the bus high while inactive. But if the bus is pulled low, the
keeper transistor is overpowered and turns off.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-out.jpg"><img alt="This is the output circuit for the equality comparison.  This circuit is located to the right of the prefetcher." height="171" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/equality-out-w600.jpg" title="This is the output circuit for the equality comparison.  This circuit is located to the right of the prefetcher." width="600"></a></p><p>This is the output circuit for the equality comparison.  This circuit is located to the right of the prefetcher.</p>
<p>This dynamic logic reduces power consumption and circuit size.
Since the bus is charged and discharged during opposite
clock phases, you avoid steady current through the transistors.
(In contrast, an NMOS processor like the 8086 might use a pull-up on the bus.
When the bus is pulled low, would you end up with current flowing through the pull-up and the pull-down transistors.
This would increase power consumption, make the chip run hotter, and limit your clock speed.)</p>
<h2>The incrementer</h2>
<p>After each prefetch, the Advance Instruction Fetch Pointer must be incremented to hold the address of the next
instruction to prefetch.
Incrementing this pointer is the job of the incrementer.
(Because each fetch is 32 bits, the pointer is incremented by 4 each time.
But in the die photo, you can see a notch in the incrementer and limit check circuit where the circuitry for the
bottom two bits has been omitted.
Thus, the incrementer's circuitry increments its value by 1, so the pointer (with two zero bits appended)
increases in steps of 4.)</p>
<p>Building an incrementer circuit is straightforward, for example, you can use a chain of 30 half-adders.
The problem is that incrementing a 30-bit value at high speed is difficult because of the carries from one position to the next.
It's similar to calculating 99999999 + 1 in decimal; you need to tediously carry the 1, carry the 1, carry the 1, and so forth,
through all the digits, resulting in a slow, sequential process.</p>
<p>The incrementer uses a faster approach. First, it computes all the carries at high speed, almost in parallel.
Then it computes each output bit in parallel from the carries—if there is a carry into a position, it toggles that bit.</p>
<p>Computing the carries is straightforward in concept: if there is a block of 1 bits at the end of the value,
all those bits will
produce carries, but carrying is stopped by the rightmost 0 bit.
For instance, incrementing binary 11011 results in 11100; there are carries from the last two bits, but the zero
stops the carries.
A circuit to implement this was developed at the University of Manchester in England way back in 1959, and is known as the Manchester
carry chain.</p>
<p>In the Manchester carry chain, you build a chain of switches, one for each data bit, as shown below.
For a 1 bit, you close the switch, but for a 0 bit you open the switch.
(The switches are implemented by transistors.)
To compute the carries, you start by feeding in a carry signal at the right
The signal will go through the closed switches
until it hits an open switch, and then it will be blocked.<span id="fnref:manchester"><a href="#fn:manchester">5</a></span>
The outputs along the chain give us the desired carry value at each position.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain.jpg"><img alt="Concept of the Manchester carry chain, 4 bits." height="149" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain-w500.jpg" title="Concept of the Manchester carry chain, 4 bits." width="500"></a></p><p>Concept of the Manchester carry chain, 4 bits.</p>
<p>Since the switches in the Manchester carry chain can all be set in parallel and the carry signal blasts through
the switches at high speed, this circuit rapidly computes the carries we need.
The carries then flip the associated bits (in parallel), giving us the result much faster than a straightforward adder.</p>
<p>There are complications, of course, in the actual implementation.
The carry signal in the carry chain is inverted, so a low signal propagates through the carry chain to indicate a carry.
(It is faster to pull a signal low than high.)
But <em>something</em> needs to make the line go high when necessary.
As with the equality circuitry, the solution is dynamic logic.
That is, the carry line is precharged high during one clock phase and then processing happens in the
second clock phase, potentially pulling the line low.</p>
<p>The next problem is that the carry signal weakens as it passes through multiple transistors and long
lengths of wire. 
The solution is that each segment has a circuit to amplify the signal, using a clocked inverter and an asymmetrical
inverter.
Importantly, this amplifier is not in the carry chain path, so it doesn't slow down the signal through the chain.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain-circuit.jpg"><img alt="The Manchester carry chain circuit for a typical bit in the incrementer." height="275" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/chain-circuit-w500.jpg" title="The Manchester carry chain circuit for a typical bit in the incrementer." width="500"></a></p><p>The Manchester carry chain circuit for a typical bit in the incrementer.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows the implementation of the Manchester carry chain for a typical bit.
The chain itself is at the bottom, with the transistor switch as before.
During clock phase 1,
the precharge transistor pulls this segment of the carry chain high.
During clock phase 2, the signal on the chain goes through the "clocked inverter" at the right to produce the local carry signal.
If there is a carry, the next bit is flipped by the XOR gate, producing the incremented output.<span id="fnref:xor"><a href="#fn:xor">6</a></span>
The "keeper/amplifier" is an asymmetrical inverter that produces a strong low output but a weak high output.
When there is no carry, its weak output keeps the carry chain pulled high.
But as soon as a carry is detected, it strongly pulls the carry chain low to boost the carry signal.</p>
<p>But this circuit still isn't enough for the desired performance. The incrementer uses a second carry technique in parallel:
carry skip.
The concept is to look at blocks of bits and allow the carry to jump over the entire block.
The diagram below shows a simplified implementation of the carry skip circuit. Each block consists of 3 to 6 bits.
If all the bits in a block are 1's, then the AND gate turns on the associated transistor in the carry skip line.
This allows the carry skip signal to propagate (from left to right), a block at a time. When it reaches a block with a
0 bit, the corresponding transistor will be off, stopping the carry as in the Manchester carry chain.
The AND gates all operate in parallel, so the transistors are rapidly turned on or off in parallel.
Then, the carry skip signal passes through a small number of transistors, without going through any logic.
(The carry skip signal is like an express train that skips most stations, while the Manchester carry chain
is the local train to all the stations.)
Like the Manchester carry chain, the implementation of carry skip needs precharge
circuits on the lines, a keeper/amplifier, and clocked logic, but I'll skip the details.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/carry-skip.jpg"><img alt="An abstracted and simplified carry-skip circuit. The block sizes don't match the 386's circuit." height="133" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/carry-skip-w600.jpg" title="An abstracted and simplified carry-skip circuit. The block sizes don't match the 386's circuit." width="600"></a></p><p>An abstracted and simplified carry-skip circuit. The block sizes don't match the 386's circuit.</p>
<p>One interesting feature is the layout of the large AND gates.
A 6-input AND gate is a large device, difficult to fit into one cell of the incrementer.
The solution is that the gate is spread out across multiple cells.
Specifically, the gate uses a standard CMOS NAND gate circuit with NMOS transistors in series and PMOS transistors
in parallel.
Each cell has an NMOS transistor and a PMOS transistor, and the chains are connected at the end to form the desired
NAND gate. (Inverting the output produces the desired AND function.)
This spread-out layout technique is unusual, but keeps each bit's circuitry approximately the same size.</p>
<p>The incrementer circuitry was tricky to reverse engineer because of these techniques.
In particular, 
most of the prefetcher consists of a single block of circuitry repeated 32 times, once for each bit.
The incrementer, on the other hand, consists of <em>four</em> different blocks of circuitry, repeating in an irregular pattern.
Specifically, one block starts a carry chain, a second block continues the carry chain, and a third block ends
a carry chain.
The block before the ending block is different (one large transistor to drive the last block), making four variants in
total.
This irregular pattern is visible in the earlier photo of the prefetcher.</p>
<h2>The alignment network</h2>
<p>The bottom part of the prefetcher rotates data to align it as needed.
Unlike some processors, the x86 does not enforce aligned memory accesses.
That is, a 32-bit value does not need to start on a 4-byte boundary in memory.
As a result, a 32-bit value may be split across two 32-bit rows of the prefetch queue.
Moreover, when the instruction decoder fetches one byte of an instruction, that byte may be at any position in the prefetch queue.</p>
<p>To deal with these problems, the prefetcher includes an alignment network that can rotate bytes to output a byte, word, or four bytes with the alignment required by the rest of the processor.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows part of this alignment network.
Each bit exiting the prefetch queue (top) has four wires, for rotates of 24, 16, 8, or 0 bits.
Each rotate wire is connected to one of the 32 horizontal bit lines.
Finally, each horizontal bit line has an output tap, going to the datapath below.
(The vertical lines are in the chip's lower M1 metal layer, while the horizontal lines are in the upper M2 metal layer.
For this photo, I removed the M2 layer to show the underlying layer.
Shadows of the original horizontal lines are still visible.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-network.jpg"><img alt="Part of the alignment network." height="411" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-network-w600.jpg" title="Part of the alignment network." width="600"></a></p><p>Part of the alignment network.</p>
<p>The idea is that by selecting one set of vertical rotate lines, the 32-bit output from the prefetch queue will be
rotated left by that amount.
For instance, to rotate by 8, bits are sent down the "rotate 8" lines. Bit 0 from the prefetch queue will energize
horizontal line 8, bit 1 will energize horizontal line 9, and so forth, with bit 31 wrapping around to horizontal line 7. Since horizontal bit line 8 is connected to
output 8, the result is that bit 0 is output as bit 8, bit 1 is output as bit 9, and so forth.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-diagram.jpg"><img alt="The four possibilities for aligning a 32-bit value. The four bytes above are shifted as specified to produce the desired output below." height="115" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/alignment-diagram-w500.jpg" title="The four possibilities for aligning a 32-bit value. The four bytes above are shifted as specified to produce the desired output below." width="500"></a></p><p>The four possibilities for aligning a 32-bit value. The four bytes above are shifted as specified to produce the desired output below.</p>
<p>For the alignment process,
one 32-bit output may be split across two 32-bit entries in the prefetch queue in four different ways, as shown above.
These combinations are implemented by multiplexers and drivers.
Two 32-bit multiplexers select the two relevant rows in the prefetch queue (blue and green above).
Four 32-bit drivers are connected to the four sets of vertical lines, with one set of drivers activated to
produce the desired shift.
Each byte of each driver is wired to achieve the alignment shown above. For instance, the rotate-8 driver gets
its top byte from the "green" multiplexer and the other three bytes from the "blue" multiplexer.
The result is that the four bytes, split across two queue rows, are rotated to form an aligned 32-bit value.</p>
<h2>Sign extension</h2>
<p>The final circuit is sign extension. Suppose you want to add an 8-bit value to a 32-bit value.
An unsigned 8-bit value can be extended to 32 bits by simply filling the upper bits with zeroes.
But for a signed value, it's trickier. For instance, -1 is the eight-bit value 0xFF, but the 32-bit value is
0xFFFFFFFF.
To convert an 8-bit signed value to 32 bits, the top 24 bits must be filled in with the top bit of the original
value (which indicates the sign).
In other words, for a positive value, the extra bits are filled with 0, but for a negative value, the extra bits are
filled with 1.
This process is called sign extension.<span id="fnref:sex"><a href="#fn:sex">9</a></span></p>
<p>In the 386, a circuit at the bottom of the prefetcher performs sign extension for values in instructions.
This circuit supports extending an 8-bit value to 16 bits or 32 bits, as well as extending a 16-bit value to 32 bits.
This circuit will extend a value with zeros or with the sign, depending on the instruction.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows one bit of this sign extension circuit. It consists of a latch on the left and right, with a
multiplexer in the middle.
The latches are constructed with a standard 386 circuit using a CMOS switch (see footnote).<span id="fnref:latch"><a href="#fn:latch">7</a></span>
The multiplexer selects one of three values: the bit value from the swap network, 0 for sign extension, or 1 for
sign extension.
The multiplexer is constructed from a CMOS switch if the bit value is selected and two transistors for the 0 or 1 values.
This circuit is replicated 32 times, although the bottom byte only has the latches, not the multiplexer, as
sign extension does not modify the bottom byte.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-circuit.jpg"><img alt="The sign extend circuit associated with bits 31-8 from the prefetcher." height="195" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-circuit-w600.jpg" title="The sign extend circuit associated with bits 31-8 from the prefetcher." width="600"></a></p><p>The sign extend circuit associated with bits 31-8 from the prefetcher.</p>
<p>The second part of the sign extension circuitry determines if the bits should be filled with 0 or 1 and sends the control
signals to the circuit above.
The gates on the left determine if the sign extension bit should be a 0 or a 1. For a 16-bit sign extension, this
bit comes from bit 15 of the data, while for an 8-bit sign extension, the bit comes from bit 7.
The four gates on the right generate the signals to sign extend each bit, producing separate signals for the
bit range 31-16 and the range 15-8.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-logic.jpg"><img alt="This circuit determines which bits should be filled with 0 or 1." height="165" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extend-logic-w500.jpg" title="This circuit determines which bits should be filled with 0 or 1." width="500"></a></p><p>This circuit determines which bits should be filled with 0 or 1.</p>
<p>The layout of this circuit on the die is somewhat unusual.
Most of the prefetcher circuitry consists of 32 identical columns, one for each bit.<span id="fnref:extension"><a href="#fn:extension">8</a></span>
The circuitry above is implemented once, using about 16 gates (buffers and inverters are not shown above).
Despite this, the circuitry above is crammed into bit positions 17 through 7, creating irregularities in the layout.
Moreover, the implementation of the circuitry in silicon is unusual compared to the rest of the 386.
Most of the 386's circuitry uses the two metal layers for interconnection, minimizing the use of polysilicon wiring.
However, the circuit above also uses long stretches of polysilicon to connect the gates.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/sign-extension-layout.jpg"><img alt="Layout of the sign extension circuitry.

This circuitry is at the bottom of the prefetch queue." width="600"></a></p><p>Layout of the sign extension circuitry. This circuitry is at the bottom of the prefetch queue.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows the irregular layout of the sign extension circuitry amid the regular datapath circuitry that
is 32 bits wide.
The sign extension circuitry is shown in green; this is the circuitry described at the top of this section, repeated
for each bit 31-8.
The circuitry for bits 15-8 has been shifted upward, perhaps to make room for the sign extension control circuitry,
indicated in red.
Note that the layout of the control circuitry is completely irregular, since there is one copy of the circuitry and
it has no internal structure.
One consequence of this layout is the wasted space to the left and right of this circuitry block, the
tan regions with no circuitry except vertical metal lines passing through.
At the far right, a block of circuitry to control the latches has been wedged under bit 0.
Intel's designers go to great effort to minimize the size of the processor die since a smaller die saves substantial
money.
This layout must have been the most efficient they could manage, but I find it aesthetically displeasing compared
to the regularity of the rest of the datapath.</p>
<h2>How instructions flow through the chip</h2>
<p>Instructions follow a tortuous path through the 386 chip.
First, 
the Bus Interface Unit in the upper right
corner reads instructions from memory and sends them over a 32-bit bus (blue) to the prefetch unit.
The prefetch unit stores the instructions in the 16-byte prefetch queue.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/386-instr-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Instructions follow a twisting path to and from the prefetch queue." height="641" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-prefetch/386-instr-labeled-w600.jpg" title="Instructions follow a twisting path to and from the prefetch queue." width="600"></a></p><p>Instructions follow a twisting path to and from the prefetch queue.</p>
<p>How is an instruction executed from the prefetch queue? It turns out that there are two distinct paths.
Suppose you're executing an instruction to add 12345678 to the EAX register.
The prefetch queue will hold the five bytes 05 (the opcode), 78, 56, 34, and 12.
The prefetch queue provides opcodes to the decoder one byte at a time over the 8-bit bus shown in red.
The bus takes the lowest 8 bits from the prefetch queue's alignment network and sends this byte to a buffer
(the small square at the head of the red arrow).
From there, the opcode travels to the instruction decoder.<span id="fnref:decoder"><a href="#fn:decoder">10</a></span>
The instruction decoder, in turn, uses large tables (PLAs) to convert the x86 instruction into a 111-bit internal format
with 19 different fields.<span id="fnref:slager"><a href="#fn:slager">11</a></span></p>
<p>The data bytes of an instruction, on the other hand, go from the prefetch queue to the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) through a 32-bit data bus (orange).
Unlike the previous buses, this data bus is spread out, with one wire through each column of the datapath.
This bus extends through the entire datapath so values can also be stored into registers.
For instance,
the <code>MOV</code> (move) instruction can store a value from an instruction (an "immediate" value) into a register.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The 386's prefetch queue contains about 7400 transistors, more than an Intel 8080 processor.
(And this is just the queue itself; I'm ignoring the prefetch control logic.)
This illustrates the rapid advance of processor technology: part of one functional unit in the 386 contains more
transistors than an entire 8080 processor from 11 years earlier.
And this unit is less than 3% of the entire 386 processor.</p>
<!-- about 230 transistors per column -->

<p>Every time I look at an x86 circuit, I see the complexity required to support backward compatibility, and
I gain more understanding of why RISC became popular.
The prefetcher is no exception.
Much of the complexity is due to the 386's support for unaligned memory accesses, requiring a byte shift network to
move bytes into 32-bit alignment.
Moreover, at the other end of the instruction bus is the complicated instruction decoder that decodes
intricate x86 instructions. Decoding RISC instructions is much easier.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope you've found this look at the prefetch circuitry interesting.
I plan to write more about the 386, so
follow me on Bluesky (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/righto.com">@righto.com</a>) or <a href="https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default">RSS</a> for updates.
I've written multiple articles on the 386 previously; a good place to start might be my <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/10/intel-386-die-versions.html">survey of the 368 dies</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman announced in San Francisco that the World project he co-founded, formerly known as Worldcoin, is opening six stores across the United States, allowing users of the project's app to scan their eyeballs.</p>
<p>Simply put, the premise is this: scan your eyeball, get a biometric tag, verify yourself, buy our apps (and cryptocurrency). The scary part is the for-profit company developing the project has now gathered millions in venture capital investment, powerful partners, and is ready to expand and impose its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)">Minority Report</a> style technology everywhere. <strong>Welcome to Dystopialand.</strong><!-- more --></p>
<p>The World(coin) project is an initiative from the startup Tools for Humanity, co-founded by its CEO Alex Blania. Despite its friendly name, the for-profit corporation has been on the radar of many critics through the years already. From experts to journalists to privacy commissioners around the world, not everyone shares Blania's enthusiasm for his biometric-based technology.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-world-app">What is the World App?</h2>
<p>The World project, recently rebranded from the Worldcoin project (possibly to convey better its expansionist ambitions) presented its plan for the World App to Americans this week. The project is now expanding well beyond the cryptocurrency it started from.</p>
<p>The World App is an everything app, providing users with a <em>World ID</em>, that can be verified through the collection of biometric data in the form of an iris scan.</p>
<p>The scan is then filtered and hashed to create a unique identifier that is stored as a so-called "proof of personhood" on the <em>World Network</em>, a blockchain-based protocol.</p>
<p>The World App itself contains a collection of "Mini Apps", where users can manage their cryptocurrencies, chat together, play games, receive their pay check even, and ultimately live their whole life within the closed "verified" ecosystem of the app.</p>
<p>For a company constantly praising decentralization, it sure looks like they want to make sure they are the center of it all.</p>
<p>To obtain this coveted verification code, users <em>must</em> be ready to share their precious eyeball data with the Orb.</p>
<p>The Orb is a piece of hardware designed by Tools for Humanity to perform iris scans. It is available to access in the United States at one of the currently six locations in Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco (more to come soon), like some sort of biometrics collection ATM.</p>
<p>The World project has for ambition to expand its reach across the United States to install 7,500 Orbs by the end of this year, so be prepared to see this dystopian technology everywhere soon.</p>
<p>The San Francisco <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/04/sam_altman_startup_world/">presentation last week</a> was clearly prepared to impress investors with its Apple announcement vibe. The promise of a quickly growing startup that everyone will soon want to work with, was repeated over and over in different flavors.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity bragged about many large partnerships that should make any privacy advocates shiver in dread: the Match Group dating apps conglomerate (Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, Plenty of Fish), Stripe, and Visa are some of them.</p>
<p>If they succeed in convincing enough people, many of us could soon have little choice but to unwillingly have to enroll.</p>
<h2 id="worldcoin-isnt-new-you-might-have-heard-of-its-unethical-practices-already">World(coin) isn't new, you might have heard of its unethical practices already</h2>
<p>The project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/sam-altmans-world-unveils-a-mobile-verification-device/">claims</a> to have onboarded 26 million people already, including 12 millions "users" who are verified (had their biometric data collected).</p>
<p>These "users" are largely located in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. This is because the company started testing for its project there a few years ago, in regions where people often have fewer legal protections.</p>
<p>In 2022, MIT Technology Review produced <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">an extensive investigation</a> on the startup's debut in an article titled: <em>Deception, exploited workers, and cash handouts: How Worldcoin recruited its first half a million test users.</em></p>
<p>The investigation revealed a collection of unethical practices to pressure the most vulnerable populations in signing up for Worldcoin, and <strong>have their eyeball scanned in exchange for money</strong> they desperately needed.</p>
<p>Some participants had to provide much more personal information than the company says is required, such as emails, phone numbers, and even photos of official ID. Many people who gave their biometric data to Worldcoin were rushed and misinformed. Some who signed up didn't even have an email and had to create one. The "Orb operators" hired to perform the scans locally were often poorly trained, poorly informed, and unable to answer the questions asked by participants.</p>
<p>So much so that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/kenya-suspends-worldcoin-scans-over-security-privacy-and-financial-concerns/">Kenya suspended the company's operations</a> in 2023 over concerns for privacy, security, and financial service practices.</p>
<p>Some people who signed up never received the promised money. Some officials were bribed to give the impression to participants these operations were official and supported by the government.</p>
<p>As Ruswandi, one of the person targeted by this early campaign <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/">remarked</a>: "why did Worldcoin target lower-income communities in the first place, instead of crypto enthusiasts or communities?"</p>
<p>Exploiting people in situation of poverty in order to test a biometric identification technology isn't a great way to start a project developed by a company called "Tools for Humanity".</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-problem-selling-the-solution">Creating the problem, selling the solution</h2>
<p>Why developing such a technology in the first place?</p>
<p>Sam Altman himself have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-orb-eyeball-scan-launch-us/">expressed concern</a> about the problem this alleged solution solves: the avalanche of fake accounts and pretend persons online caused by the new AI tools unleashed everywhere.</p>
<p>The proposed use of a "proof of personhood" claims to solve this problem by allocating a unique identifier to each human, a personal code supposedly impossible to duplicate or cheat. Of course, this has <a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037">already been proven wrong</a>.</p>
<p>No one will miss the irony of the CEO of OpenAI, responsible for creating the largest share of this problem, expressing such concern <strong>while continuing to feed the fire</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a classic case of creating a problem and selling the solution. Well, in this case it is more like <strong><em>selling</em> the problem and selling the solution</strong>. As researcher and cryptocurrency critic <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/worldcoin-a-solution-in-search-of/">Molly White pointed out</a> in 2023:</p>
<p>"That's right, the guy who's going to sell us all the solution to a worsening AI-powered bot infestation of the Internet and to AI-induced mass unemployment is the same guy who's making the AI in question."</p>
<p>Sadly, this proposed solution also isn't really a solution, or at least it isn't a <em>good</em> solution. Indeed, this will <strong>create a whole collection of new problems</strong>, many much worse than a bot infestation.</p>
<h2 id="the-risks-of-sharing-biometric-data">The risks of sharing biometric data</h2>
<p>Biometric data is incredibly sensitive data, because it's irrevocably attached to a person. Whether it's from a face scan, palm scan, fingerprint, keystroke pattern, or iris scan, this data is part of our bodies and <strong>cannot be changed like a password</strong> if it gets compromised.</p>
<p>For this reason, a growing number of legislations around the world now include special categories for such data collection, and require extra protections and supervision for it.</p>
<p>There are many dangers in collecting and potentially endangering biometric data. First, if this data gets stolen, criminals can impersonate a victim much more convincingly, because they will have the "proof" to "verify" this is really you.</p>
<p>While straight-up stealing your eyeball or face might still belong to science-fiction, the risk of getting the data produced <em>from</em> the scan stolen is very real.</p>
<p>When the World project claims it is secure because biometric data isn't stored anywhere, even if that was true, the iris <em>code</em> derivative of this data is indeed stored and processed somewhere, and this can potentially be stolen.</p>
<p>How hard will it be for a victim to recover an account from a biometric thief when everything is reinforcing the false narrative shared with investors that this technology can't be cheated?</p>
<p>Then, there is the loss of pseudonymity protections online.</p>
<p>If every social media account becomes tied to a unique biometric-based identifier, whether directly or indirectly, there is no pseudonymity anymore.</p>
<p>Further, if only one account is allowed by "verified human", then no one can create separate accounts for their work life and personal life anymore. Creating separate accounts for separate purposes is an excellent privacy-preserving practice.</p>
<p>Even if the identifier isn't tied to a legal name directly, accounts on different platforms using the same identifier could potentially get liked together. To be fair, it does seem Tools for Humanity worked to prevent different platforms from having access to the same code, but how well will this hold the test of time? Will platforms increasingly escalate privacy-invasive requests from this point, like they often do?</p>
<p><strong>Pseudonymity saves lives.</strong> It is an essential tool for the safety of the most vulnerable online. Killing pseudonymity by requiring unique biometric identification could endanger millions.</p>
<p>This is a serious problem coming up with <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/05/06/age-verification-wants-your-face/">age verification</a> processes as well, which World ID will soon also be a part of when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/sam-altmans-eyeball-scanning-id-technology-debuts-in-the-us-130032856.html">testing</a> its implementation for Tinder in Japan.</p>
<p>Biometric data should never be used lightly. It should be reserved for the most extreme cases only.</p>
<p>The regions who have adopted stronger regulations for biometric data collection are moving in the right direction. But will protective legislation be enough to resist the pressure from a for-profit VC-backed corporation with a valuation at billions?</p>
<h2 id="flipping-the-coin">Flipping the coin</h2>
<p>Tools for Humanity seems to be well aware of its creepiness factor, and of the criticisms brought by privacy commissioners around the world.</p>
<p>Its recent Orb redesign from the previous cold (Black)mirror finish clearly tries hard to replace creepiness with cuteness.</p>
<p>The company has also evidently invested a lot in presenting a pro-privacy image, likely in an attempt to reassure users (and investors).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these privacy-preserving claims are inaccurate. Some claims promoting "features" that might sound impressive to a neophyte's ear are actually just the baseline, and others sadly are misleading <em>at best</em>.</p>
<p>While a few privacy-preserving efforts are indeed positive, most of the focus on privacy relates to marketing much more than any serious protections.</p>
<h2 id="how-privacy-preserving-is-it">How privacy-preserving is it?</h2>
<p>Most people are still put off by the idea of having their eyeball scanned, and the company has evidently invested a lot in promoting a "privacy-preserving" image, possibly as an attempt to reassure unconvinced humans and <a href="#privacy-legislators-arent-on-board">privacy commissioners</a> alike.</p>
<p>But how much can we trust those claims?</p>
<h3 id="flawed-assumption-about-what-constitutes-personal-data">Flawed assumption about what constitutes personal data</h3>
<p>The largest assumption about why this technology is "privacy-preserving" seems to come from the fact that the World App doesn't collect names, official IDs (<a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#6-2-credentials-">unless it does</a>), emails (<a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#annex-i-%E2%80%93-legal-grounds/purposes-for-tools-for-humanity-data-processing-activities-">unless it does</a>), phone numbers (<a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#5-1-data-you-provide-to-us">unless it does</a>), date of birth (<a href="https://world.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-new-world-id-unverify-option-increases-personal-control-over-data">unless it does</a>), or other identifiers.</p>
<p>This assumption however neglects the fact that 1) even data that isn't attached to a legal name can be personal data, and 2) the iris code it produces from the iris scan <em>is</em> indeed personal data.</p>
<p>While there are variations, most privacy regulations have similar definitions of what constitute personal data. The European General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">defines</a> it as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person". An iris code derived from an iris scan of course fits this definition.</p>
<p>Moreover, to create a World ID, the company also collects a face image. Together, the original iris scan and face photo are referred to as <em>Image Data</em>. For "privacy-preserving" purposes, Image Data of course never leaves the Orb device (<a href="https://world.org/legal/biometric-data-consent-form">unless it does</a>).</p>
<p>While it seems some effort has been made to protect the Image Data in some ways, the idea that derivative data from the scans isn't still sensitive personal information anymore is wrong.</p>
<p>If there is a way for a person to scan their iris again and generate the same code, then this data relates to their identifiable person. This also means that <em>someone else</em> could scan their iris and generate the same code.</p>
<p>As whistleblower <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1451990496537088000">Edward Snowden rightfully pointed out</a> in a 2021 tweet:</p>
<p>“This looks like it produces a global (hash) database of people's iris scans (for 'fairness'), and waves away the implications by saying 'we deleted the scans!' Yeah, but you save the <em>hashes</em> produced by the scans. Hashes that match <em>future</em> scans. Don't catalogue eyeballs.”</p>
<h3 id="questionable-reassurance-about-local-data">Questionable reassurance about local data</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reassurance relates to the claim that sensitive biometric data (Image Data) is only stored locally. But this isn't completely accurate either, and there seems to be conflicting information about it from the company's own documentation.</p>
<p>The World <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#enrollment-process">white paper</a> specifies that:</p>
<p>"The Orb verifies that it sees a human, runs local fraud prevention checks, and takes pictures of both irises. The iris images are converted on the Orb hardware into the iris code. Raw biometric data does not leave the device (unless explicitly approved by the user for training purposes)."</p>
<p>However, according to the <a href="https://world.org/legal/biometric-data-consent-form">Biometric Data Consent Form</a> users have to sign prior to data collection, if a user needs a fully verified World ID, inevitably this sensitive biometric data will be sent to their phone, therefore leaving the Orb.</p>
<p>After a user agrees to the form, they can keep the option for <em>Data Custody</em> disabled to have their biometric data deleted from the Orb "later", and have it uploaded to their phone (with all the risk that this entails).</p>
<p>The other option users have is to enable Data Custody (if allowed in the user's country) and have this sensitive data sent to both their phone <em>and</em> to Tools for Humanity.</p>
<p>This means the Orb inevitably sends this sensitive data to a mobile device. Then, this data is only as secure as the mobile device is. Which isn't so reassuring.</p>
<p>The documentation does maintain this biometric data is sent as an "end-to-end encrypted data bundle", but this doesn't mean the data never leaves the Orb, it just means it leaves it while encrypted (which is really just the basics), and copies it to the user's device.</p>
<p>Furthermore, future users are <em>strongly</em> incentivized to share their Image Data with Tools for Humanity, for algorithm improvement purposes. Pressure to opt in is even presented as a <em>convenience</em> option, because it would be cumbersome to have to come over for another scan after every update.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://world.org/legal/biometric-data-consent-form">stated</a> in the Biometric Data Consent Form:</p>
<p>"This will likely help you avoid some inconvenience because, if we have your Image Data, then you will not need to return to an Orb to re-verify your digital identity when we update the software."</p>
<p>The company continues to repeat they have a "privacy by default and by design approach". But <strong>you can't keep your privacy-preserving cake and eat it, too</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-the-white-paper-say">What does the white paper say</h3>
<p>In tech, a white paper is usually a research-based document produced by the developers that presents more technical details on an application, product, or process. It is especially valuable for products like the Orb and the World App, where security and privacy <em>should</em> be paramount, and therefore examined closer.</p>
<p>Because it isn't an independent review, a white paper can also not be worth much more than a marketing pamphlet.</p>
<p>To its credit, Tools for Humanity does <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#nature-of-the-whitepaper">warn</a> in its white paper that this information is "intended for general informational purposes and community discussion only and do not constitute a prospectus, an offer document, an offer of securities, a solicitation for investment, or any offer to sell any product, item or asset (whether digital or otherwise)."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company makes sure to specify that "circumstances may change and that the Whitepaper or the Website may become outdated as a result; and the [World] Foundation is not under any obligation to update or correct this document in connection therewith."</p>
<p>The document is also described as a "crypto-asset white paper".</p>
<p>We have been warned.</p>
<p>In its Privacy section, the white paper <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#image-custody-opt-in">states</a> that "no data collected, including images taken by the Orb has or will ever be sold. Nor will it be used for any other intent than to improve World ID."</p>
<p>However, its <a href="https://world.org/legal/privacy-notice#8--when-we-share-your-data">Privacy Notice also states</a> that they may "share your personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company."</p>
<p>If this happens, many regretful users might find themselves in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/23andme-is-bankrupt-and-about-to-sell-your-dna-heres-how-to-stop-that-from-happening">the same shoes as 23andMe users this year</a>, where the DNA collecting company started to look for buyers of its biometric data assets after filling for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Face Authentication section of the white paper <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#face-authentication">describes</a> a process where encrypted facial biometrics collected from the Orb are used for authentication in the World App.</p>
<p>Even if this data is stored on-device, it is still biometric data getting collected by the Orb then processed by the phone app. There is no question this is sensitive and personal biometric data, and it is indeed kept outside the orb.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity lacks consistency in the various claims and statements found through its documentation and promotion material. It becomes difficult to know which version to trust, and if it is to be trusted at all.</p>
<h3 id="no-deletion-on-the-blockchain">No deletion on the blockchain</h3>
<p>Tools for Humanity's Privacy Policy declares that the company will delete all account data (when laws allow it) one month after it is closed, this is good. They also state they will delete entirely any inactive account after 2 years, and this is actually a great policy.</p>
<p>But what happens to the World ID, transactions, and other data stored on the blockchain?</p>
<p>While some thoughts have been put into deletion and some good mechanisms seem to have been implemented, unfortunately data stored on the blockchain might be "deletion-resistant".</p>
<p>There's a possibility that <strong>what happens on the blockchain stays on the blockchain, forever</strong>.</p>
<p>The policy <a href="https://www.toolsforhumanity.com/legal/privacy-notice#11--how-long-do-we-keep-your-data-">notes</a> that:</p>
<p>"Due to the public and immutable nature of blockchain technology, we cannot amend, erase, or control the disclosure of data that is stored on blockchains."</p>
<p>So that is something to keep in mind if you value your right to delete.</p>
<h2 id="data-security-considerations">Data security considerations</h2>
<p>Even if some thoughtful security features seem to have been implemented for the World App and its Orbs, nothing processing sensitive data at such a large scale should be left in the hands of a single for-profit, largely unregulated, organization.</p>
<p>This would be like putting 8 billion eggs in a very fragile basket, held by someone paid to make the basket pretty and convince as many people as possible to put their precious single egg in it, with no incentive whatsoever to ensure the basket doesn't break. I would not want to put my egg in there, especially with how much it costs now.</p>
<p>The idea of using one single <em>for-profit</em> app worldwide for "human verification", identity verification, age verification, money transactions, and storing official IDs (and so on and so forth) makes this application a <em>huge</em> target for criminals and hostile governments alike.</p>
<p>It's good that the app had <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-08-worldcoin-orb-securityreview.pdf">security audits</a>, made some <a href="https://github.com/worldcoin">code available</a> as open source, and reportedly <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#why-custom-hardware-is-needed">plans</a> to open a bug bounty program.</p>
<p>However, there are still problems that remain. For example, the phone in this case becomes a single point of failure. The easiest way to steal someone's identity and money (all at once) will be to steal their phone data (whether physically or remotely). Even without criminal intent, what happens when someone just loses their phone? Or accidentally drop it in the pool? Or step on it?</p>
<p>With <strong>everything relying on a single app and a single device</strong>, risk is greatly amplified.</p>
<p>Outside the user's responsibility, Orb operators and Orb stores are susceptible to various attacks. This will increase exponentially with the number of users of course, as the target becomes bigger. In fact, Orb operators have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators/">already been hacked</a>.</p>
<p>Then, there is the appeal of fake identities and money fraud for criminals. Already, there is a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037">black market</a> for iris data in China, where people buy iris data (or verified World ID according to World) from people in Cambodia, Kenya, and other countries for a few dollars only. The vulnerability allowing this was reportedly fixed, but it is doubtful this is the last one we hear about.</p>
<p>The Orb itself is also an important potential <abbr title="The total number of possible entry points for unauthorized access to a system">attack surface</abbr>. With Tools for Humanity's ambition to fill the world with Orbs everywhere, will Orbs become the next version of the sketchy ATM? Where you might wonder if this funny-looking Orb is trustworthy enough to pay your bar tab without risking emptying your crypto wallet?</p>
<h2 id="privacy-legislators-arent-on-board">Privacy legislators aren't on board</h2>
<p>Despite all its privacy promotion material, the World project has failed to convince privacy commissioners around the world of their supposedly good intentions. Perhaps in this case actions speak louder than words, and privacy commissioners aren't so gullible.</p>
<p>With the expansion the project plans this year, we can expect even more experts will examine the company's claims and challenge its "privacy-preserving" assumptions</p>
<p>There are many reasons to remain skeptical about these promises of privacy. Indeed, numerous countries have already suspended, fined, or called for investigation on the company's (mal)practices.</p>
<h3 id="the-company-was-fined-for-personal-data-violation">The company was fined for personal data violation</h3>
<p>In 2024, the company was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-fines-worldcoin-personal-data-violations">fined</a> 1.1 billion Korean won for violating South Korea's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). The Worldcoin Foundation was also imposed corrective orders and recommendations. Organizations that are truly "privacy-first" rarely reach this point.</p>
<p>The Data Custody feature, which allows (and encourages) users to share their biometric data with Tools for Humanity is now unavailable in South Korea.</p>
<h3 id="brazil-has-banned-worldcoin-in-the-country">Brazil has banned Worldcoin in the country</h3>
<p>In January this year, the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) <a href="https://decrypt.co/305639/brazilian-regulator-denies-worldcoin-appeal-ban">banned</a> Worldcoin's operations in Brazil, after the company's appeal was rejected.</p>
<p>The ban comes from regulation stating that consent to process biometric data must be "free, informed, and unequivocal", which cannot be the case with the World project paying users in cryptocurrency in exchange for their iris scans. Data deletion concerns were also raised by the regulator.</p>
<p>The World project tried again to appeal the decision, in vain.</p>
<h3 id="kenya-and-indonesia-suspended-its-operations">Kenya and Indonesia suspended its operations</h3>
<p>In 2023, Kenya, one of the first country where Worldcoin was available, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/02/kenya-suspends-worldcoin-scans-over-security-privacy-and-financial-concerns/">suspended</a> Worldcoin's operations citing concerns over the "authenticity and legality" of its activities related to privacy, security, and financial services.</p>
<p>The worse part is, months before the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) of the country had ordered Tools for Humanity to stop collecting personal information from its citizens. The company simply <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/worldcoin-in-kenya/">ignored the ODPC order</a> and continued to collect biometric data from Kenyans. It only stopped after Kenya's ministry of interior and administration gave the suspension order later on.</p>
<p>This again is quite far from the behavior of a company who genuinely values privacy.</p>
<p>More recently on May 4th 2025, Indonesia also <a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/353861/indonesia-suspends-worldcoin-world-id-operations-over-public-concerns">suspended</a> the World project's operation in the country over concerns related to user privacy and security. The Ministry of Communication and Digital will be summoning the project's local operators to clarify the operations and determine potential violation of the Indonesia's electronic system regulation.</p>

<p>In December 2024, the German regulator, the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA), <a href="https://decrypt.co/298090/german-watchdog-cracks-down-on-worldcoin-over-biometric-data">issued an order</a> to obligate proving deletion procedures that comply with the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> within one month. Additionally, the BayLDA ordered the complete deletion of certain data records that were previously collected without sufficient legal basis.</p>
<p>Again, the World Foundation is fighting the order and will <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-watchdog-order-worldcoin-delete-data">appeal</a> the decision. The company tries to argue the data collected was "anonymized", a common strategy to try evading <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> compliance, which does not regulate anonymized data.</p>

<p>In 2023, France's data protection authority the CNIL <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/worldcoin-paris-office-checked-by-french-data-watchdog-2023-08-31/">investigated</a> Worldcoin's activities in the country. The same year, UK's privacy watchdog started its own <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-data-watchdog-make-enquiries-worldcoin-crypto-project-2023-07-25/">inquiry</a> into the company's operations.</p>
<p>In 2024, Hong Kong's Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3250480/hong-kong-eye-scan-cryptocurrency-scheme-probed-citys-privacy-watchdog">raided</a> six Worldcoin offices citing personal information privacy and security concerns.</p>
<p>There is no doubt more countries and regions will follow with similar investigations and bans as the World project expands to its ambition.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-united-states-the-app-is-restricted-in-some-states">In the United States, the app is restricted in some states</h3>
<p>Even in the US where the company is headquartered, the app is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-orb-eyeball-scan-launch-us/">restricted</a> in some states. The announcement for its event this month carried a warning the World is “not available for distribution via World App to people, companies or organizations who are residents of, or are located or incorporated in the State of New York or other restricted territories.”</p>
<p>We can also expect the project will encounter roadblocks in states that have passed <a href="https://www.huschblackwell.com/2024-state-biometric-privacy-law-tracker">regulations specific to the collection of biometric data</a>. This includes states like Illinois, Texas, Washington, and Colorado.</p>
<h3 id="some-regions-have-special-regulations-for-biometric-data">Some regions have special regulations for biometric data</h3>
<p>Around the world the number of biometric-specific regulations is growing. Even without a regulation specific to this type of data, many privacy laws have started to include special categories and requirements to govern the collection and processing of sensitive biometric data. As companies are increasingly requesting such collection, legislations to protect users are essential.</p>
<p>For example, the province of Quebec in Canada has recently implemented <a href="https://www.cai.gouv.qc.ca/protection-renseignements-personnels/sujets-et-domaines-dinteret/biometrie?%2F">strong protections for biometric data</a> with its new privacy law, the Law 25. Consent isn't sufficient to collect biometric data, as the law requires organizations to explicitly justify the necessity for such collection in the first place. Importantly, any violation of Law 25 comes with fines as hefty as the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>'s.</p>
<p>More privacy laws should implement such protections quickly, as corporations collecting biometric information carelessly are multiplying fast.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-full-dystopia">Welcome to full dystopia</h2>
<p>The most concerning part of the World project's recent expansion isn't its cryptocurrency grift as much as stepping out of it.</p>
<p>If cryptocurrency enthusiasts wish to share their personal data to get into a special cryptocurrency club, they might (although privacy regulations should still protect them). But using financial coercion to get new users by exploiting vulnerable communities living in poverty is <strong>absolutely despicable</strong>.</p>
<p>Further, the fact that the World project has partnered with powerful players in the financial, gaming, and even dating sectors <em>should terrify everyone</em>.</p>
<p>Beyond cryptocurrency, if platforms start to demand users everywhere to verify they are a human and verify they are an adult through the World ID system, then <strong>everyone will soon be subjected to this</strong>.</p>
<p>The amount of money invested in the project means there will be an incredible pressure to spread it everywhere soon, and <em>monetize</em> it. There will be a <em>strong</em> incentive to monetize our data and to monetize our proof of humanity. This isn't trivial.</p>
<p>The well-known dating app Tinder has already partnered with World ID to verify the age of users in Japan. If this experiment works well, and if users comply without objection, this could be soon mandatory for <em>all</em> dating apps.</p>
<p>Let's not stop at dating apps, the World project has already announced last week they will also be working with Razer to verify humanity of online gamers. How far can this go in the age of age verification? Will every online games with mature content soon require a World ID to play?</p>
<p>What about social media? Tools for Humanity's team have insisted the age of AI made us incapable of detecting if we are interacting with bots online. Therefore, they must valiantly come to our rescue to verify our humanity scanning our eyeballs (which bots tragically lack). What if this human verification is expanded to all our social media accounts? Certainly, regulators pushing for authoritarian age verification online would be delighted by such a product.</p>
<p>Then, it comes for our money. The everything app of course offers payment and money management features. This is the app where you can keep your whole wallet, containing all your official IDs, your cryptocurrencies of all kind, and even connect with your less hyped regular bank accounts.</p>
<p>Imagine a single app, owned by a single for-profit corporation, that collects and processes all the data from all your transactions online, all your communications online, that you absolutely have to continue using for your other social media accounts, your gaming life, and your dating life.</p>
<p>There could soon be no way to escape the grasp of World's everything app. Actually, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/04/sam_altman_startup_world/">some governments</a> (Taiwan and Malesia) have already started using it for official services, because why not.</p>
<p><strong>The ways this could degenerate fast into full dystopia are infinite</strong>, and very real.</p>
<p>The company even plans to ship next year the Orb Mini, a pocket-size personal spy-device with which users will be able to scan their own eyeballs on the go!</p>
<p>But why stop there? Why not scan other people's eyeballs as well? Maybe all government officials could carry one? Maybe every payment terminal could have one too?</p>
<p>We will find out soon, in one or two years.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity also bragged about the numerous utilities its new technology could make possible. For example, for event tickets! Order a concert ticket with your "proof of personhood" then maybe confirm you are the owner by having your eyeballs scanned to assist to a Rage Against the Machine concert?</p>
<p>The only fun part in this is the irony.</p>
<p>Tools for Humanity with its expansionist dream is without a doubt hungry enough to eat the whole World™️.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-world-of-wealth-inequalities">A new world of wealth inequalities</h3>
<p>The company brings up a few times the mention of Universal Basic Income (UBI) in its documentation, it even mentions it briefly in its <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#ubi">white paper</a>.</p>
<p>While puzzling, it appears Tools for Humanity might consider its cryptocurrency bribe to sign up and subsequent token giveaways as some form of UBI? Or perhaps this is only one of its other ambition to control all the financial systems in the entire world. Why UBI is even mentioned at all in this context is unclear.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's worth mentioning a for-profit company giving cash back in exchange for biometric data isn't UBI at all, it's just a <strong>creepy membership card points</strong>, at best.</p>
<p>While the World project works hard to present the idea this is a tool for the people, where everyone is equal, wealth will definitely <a href="https://whitepaper.world.org/#wld-token-allocation">not be distributed evenly</a> in this new World order.</p>
<p>Already, 11.1% of World's cryptocurrency tokens (WLD) have been distributed to the World's team, 13.6% to investors, and 0.3% are reserved for Tools for Humanity. This means these entities would share together 25% of the wealth, while 75% of the world's population (according the Tools for Humanity's ambition) would have to share 75% of what's left.</p>
<p>In the new "human" world this corporation envisions, Tools for Humanity and its investors would own 1 quarter of the entire world's wealth. There is nothing equitable or communal in a system like this.</p>
<p>It's important not to forget this everything app will do everything to pressure its users in eventually using Worldcoins, its ultimate goal.</p>
<p>From Tinder's mandatory age verification to cryptocurrency financial ruin in one single move.</p>
<h2 id="the-normalization-of-surveillance">The normalization of surveillance</h2>
<p>Even if this process was perfectly secure and perfectly private (which it is definitely not), the problem remains the normalization of surveillance.</p>
<p>This isn't limited to Tools for Humanity, although the way the company tries to advertise itself as a privacy-first organization makes it even more important to scrutinize.</p>
<p>But anyone else with a similar approach to biometric data collection for verifying humanity or age or legal names should be on our radar. Moreover, if it's a for-profit corporation with the power to impose this technology on us everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>One company should never have such power.</p>
<p>Further, biometric data should never be used for trivial purposes like "proof of personhood" or age verification. No amount of supposedly "privacy-preserving" features can change this.</p>
<p>The premise itself is flawed from the start to respect privacy rights.</p>
<p>While the problem of proving identify can still be an important one to solve in <em>some</em> context, the solution to this can never be monopolized by for-profit corporations.</p>
<p>Regardless of Tools for Humanity's intentions and efforts to convince us to trust them, any similar technology is just another step towards a global system of mass surveillance, where ultimately privacy rights and human rights are lost.</p>
<p>So, should you scan your eyeball to get a verified World ID?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No, you really shouldn't.</strong></p>

</div>   <div><p>Another shipping port official voiced concern about the drastic decline in imports as a result of President <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump" data-sys="1">Donald Trump</a>'s tariffs.</p><p>"I can see it right over my shoulder here, I'm looking out at the Port of Seattle right now, and we currently have no container ships at berth," Seattle port commissioner Ryan Calkins told <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cnn" data-sys="1">CNN</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>"That happens every once in a while at normal times, but it's pretty rare," he added. "And so to see it tonight is I think a stark reminder that the impacts of the tariffs have real implications."</p><p><em>Newsweek</em> has reached out to the Port of Seattle via email outside of business hours for further comment.</p><h2><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2><p>Several port authorities have observed a similar drop in cargo volumes over the past few weeks, warning that such a decline could have significant and adverse effects on consumers—who may face rising prices and limited product availability—as well as the supply chain-linked sectors of the U.S. economy.</p><h2><strong>What To Know</strong></h2><p>Calkins told CNN that the current situation would impact the job security of longshoremen and those dealing directly with the freight, as well as industries responsible for transporting imports nationwide.</p><p>"And that's hundreds of jobs right here in our region and across the country," he said, adding that his port had not witnessed such a significant downturn in activity since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><figure><div>

Need to talk through something? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Mark Zuckerberg</a> has a solution for that: a chatbot. Meta’s chief executive believes everyone should have a therapist and if they don’t – artificial intelligence can do that job.</p><p>“I personally have the belief that everyone should probably have a therapist,” he said last week. “It’s like someone they can just talk to throughout the day, or not necessarily throughout the day, but about whatever issues they’re worried about and for people who don’t have a person who’s a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI.”</p><p>The Guardian spoke to mental health clinicians who expressed concern about AI’s emerging role as a digital therapist. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/01/damehood-for-professor-til-wykes-is-a-recognition-of-mental-health-work" data-link-name="in body link">Prof Dame Til Wykes</a>, the head of mental health and psychological sciences at King’s College London, cites the example of an eating disorder chatbot that was <a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/neda-suspends-ai-chatbot-for-giving-harmful-eating-disorder-advice/" data-link-name="in body link">pulled in 2023</a> after giving dangerous advice.</p><p>“I think AI is not at the level where it can provide nuance and it might actually suggest courses of action that are totally inappropriate,” she said.</p><figure id="d717a53d-1bb0-4a3d-996a-6e6c377d467f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Heavy ChatGPT users tend to be more lonely, suggests research&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d717a53d-1bb0-4a3d-996a-6e6c377d467f&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/25/heavy-chatgpt-users-tend-to-be-more-lonely-suggests-research&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Wykes also sees chatbots as being potential disruptors to established relationships.</p><p>“One of the reasons you have friends is that you share personal things with each other and you talk them through,” she says. “It’s part of an alliance, a connection. And if you use AI for those sorts of purposes, will it not interfere with that relationship?”</p><p>For many AI users, Zuckerberg is merely marking an increasingly popular use of this powerful technology. There are mental health chatbots such as Noah and Wysa, while the Guardian has spoken to users of AI-powered “grieftech” – or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/14/i-felt-i-was-talking-to-him-are-ai-personas-of-the-dead-a-blessing-or-a-curse" data-link-name="in body link">chatbots that revive the dead</a>.</p><p>There is also their casual use as virtual friends <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/16/computer-says-yes-how-ai-is-changing-our-romantic-lives" data-link-name="in body link">or partners</a>, with bots such as character.ai and Replika offering personas to interact with. ChatGPT’s owner, OpenAI, admitted last week that a version of its groundbreaking chatbot was responding to users in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/01/chatgpt-chatbot-truth-user-update-ai" data-link-name="in body link">tone that was “overly flattering”</a> and withdrew it.</p><p>“Seriously, good for you for standing up for yourself and taking control of your own life,” it reportedly responded to a user, who claimed they had stopped taking their medication and had left their family because they were “responsible for the radio signals coming in through the walls”.</p><p>In an interview with the Stratechery newsletter, Zuckerberg, whose company owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, added that AI would not squeeze people out of your friendship circle but add to it. “That’s not going to replace the friends you have, but it will probably be additive in some way for a lot of people’s lives,” he said.</p><p>Outlining uses for Meta’s AI chatbot – available across its platforms – he said: “One of the uses for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Meta</a> AI is basically: ‘I want to talk through an issue’; ‘I need to have a hard conversation with someone’; ‘I’m having an issue with my girlfriend’; ‘I need to have a hard conversation with my boss at work’; ‘help me roleplay this’; or ‘help me figure out how I want to approach this’.”</p><p>In a separate interview last week, Zuckerberg said “the average American has three friends, but has demand for 15” and AI could plug that gap.</p><figure id="0bc631b2-4246-43cc-810d-d0844eed007d" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘Dangerous nonsense’: AI-authored books about ADHD for sale on Amazon&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;0bc631b2-4246-43cc-810d-d0844eed007d&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/04/dangerous-nonsense-ai-authored-books-about-adhd-for-sale-on-amazon&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Dr Jaime Craig, who is about to take over as chair of the UK’s Association of Clinical Psychologists, says it is “crucial” that mental health specialists engage with AI in their field and “ensure that it is informed by best practice”. He flags Wysa as an example of an AI tool that “users value and find more engaging”. But, he adds, more needs to be done on safety.</p><p>“Oversight and regulation will be key to ensure safe and appropriate use of these technologies. Worryingly we have not yet addressed this to date in the UK,” Craig says.</p><p>Last week it was reported that Meta’s AI Studio, which allows users to create chatbots with specific personas, was hosting bots claming to be therapists – with fake credentials. A journalist at 404 Media, a tech news site, said <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-ai-studio-therapy-chatbots-lie-about-being-licensed-therapists/" data-link-name="in body link">Instagram had been putting those bots in her feed</a>.</p><p>Meta said its AIs carry a disclaimer that “indicates the responses are generated by AI to help people understand their limitations”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<blockquote>
<p>"MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI
applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP
provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools."</p>

<p>― Anthropic</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="toc_0">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I would like for this to turn out to be a skill issue on my part, and hope that I'm missing something.</p>

<p>During the past month,<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MCP (Model Context Protocol)</a>, which would enable
LLMs to become agents and interact with the world, has really been blowing up. The idea is straightforward: let's standardize an
API for LLM/Agents to interact with the world and how to inform the LLM/Agent about it.</p>

<p>Things are moving really fast, and IBM recently released their own "orthogonal standard" to MCP
called <a href="https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)</a>, followed closely by Google
announcing <a href="https://google.github.io/A2A" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Agent2Agent (A2A)</a>.</p>

<p>MCP Servers and Clients are being built and published daily, and can be found at sites like <a href="https://mcp.so/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">mcp.so</a>
and <a href="https://www.pulsemcp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">pulsemcp.com</a>.</p>

<p>However, I'm astonished by the apparent lack of mature engineering practices. All the major players spend billions of dollars on
training and tuning their models, only to turn around and, from what I can tell, have an interns write the documentation,
providing subpar SDKs and very little in terms of implementation guidance.</p>

<p>This trend seems to have continued with MCP, resulting in some very strange design decisions, poor documentation, and an even
worse specification of the actual protocols.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that the whole suggested setup for HTTP transport (SSE+HTTP and Streamable HTTP) should be thrown out and
replaced
with something that mimics stdio... Websockets.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Background</h2>

<p>About three weeks ago, I decided to jump on the MCP bandwagon to give it a try and see how it could be used in our own
environment. I'm very much a person who wants to understand how things actually work under the hood before I start using
abstractions. Here we have a new protocol that works over different transports — how exciting!</p>

<p>Anthropic is the company behind the MCP standardization effort, and MCP seems to be one of the major reasons Anthropic's CEO is
thinking that most code will be written by LLMs within a year or so. The bet on coding tooling in particular seems to have been
the guiding principle of the standardization effort based on how it feels to work with it.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Protocol</h2>

<p>Simply put, it is a JSON-RPC protocol with predefined methods/endpoints designed to be used in conjunction with an LLM. This is
not really the focus of this post, but there are things to be criticized about the protocol itself.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Transport</h2>

<p>As with many applications post-2005, they're supposedly "local first" (<em>ironically</em>), and this seems to be very much the case with
MCP. Looking at the transport protocol, you get a sense of where
they're coming from—if their intention is to build LLM tools for coding on your laptop. They're probably looking at local IDEs (or
more realistically, Cursor or Windsurf) and how to have the LLM interact with the local file system, databases, editors, language
servers, and so on.</p>

<p>There are essentially two main transport protocols (or three):</p>

<ol>
<li>stdio</li>
<li>"Something over HTTP, the web seems to be a thing we probably should support."</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_4">Stdio</h3>

<p>Using stdio essentially means starting a local MCP Server, hooking up <code>stdout</code> and <code>stdin</code> pipes from the server to the client,
and starting to send JSON and using <code>stderr</code> for logging. It kind of breaks the Unix/Linux piping paradigm using these streams for
bidirectional communication. When bidirectional communication is needed, we usually reach for a socket, unix socket or even a net
socket.</p>

<p>However, it is straightforward and easy to reason about, works out of the box in all OSes, no need to deal with sockets, and so
on. So even if there is a critique to be made, I get it.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">HTTP+SSE / Streamable HTTP</h3>

<p>The HTTP transport is another story. There are two versions of the same mistake: HTTP+SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport, which is
being replaced by "Streamable HTTP" (a made-up term) that uses REST semantics with SSE. But with a whole lot of extra confusion
and corner cases on top.</p>

<p>It can be summarized as: "Since we like SSE for LLM streaming, we're not using WebSockets. Instead, we're effectively implementing
WebSockets on top of SSE and calling it 'Streamable HTTP' to make people think it's an accepted/known way of doing things."</p>

<p>They discuss the problems with WebSockets (and the reason for Streamable HTTP) in this
PR: <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/206" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">modelcontextprotocol/pull/206</a>, making some very
strange contortions and straw-man arguments to <strong>not</strong> use WebSockets. At least one other person in the thread seems to agree with
me: <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/206#issuecomment-2766559523" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">modelcontextprotocol/pull/206#issuecomment-2766559523</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">A Descent into Madness</h2>

<p>I set out to implement an MCP server in Golang. There isn't an official Go SDK, and I wanted to understand the protocol. This
turned out to be a mistake for mental health...</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">The Warning Signs...</h3>

<p>Looking at <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://modelcontextprotocol.io</a>, the documentation is poorly written (all LLM vendors seem to have an internal
competition in writing confusing documentation). The specification glosses over or ignores important aspects of the protocol and
provides no examples of conversation flow. In fact, it seems the entire website is not meant for reading the standard; instead, it
pushes you toward tutorials on how to implement their SDKs.</p>

<p>All example servers are implemented in Python or JavaScript, with the intention that you download and run them locally using
stdio. Python and JavaScript are probably one of the worst choices of languages for something you want to work on anyone else's
computer. The authors seem to realize this since all examples are available as Docker containers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be honest... when was the last time you ran <code>pip install</code> and didn't end up in dependency hell?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I being pretentious/judgmental in thinking that people in AI only really know Python, and the "well, it works on my computer"
approach is still considered acceptable? This should be glaringly obvious to anyone that ever tried to run anything from
Hugging Face.</p>

<p>If you want to run MCP locally, wouldn't you prefer a portable language like Rust, Go, or even VM-based options such as Java or
C#?</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">The Problem</h3>

<p>When I started implementing the protocol, I immediately felt I had to reverse-engineer it. Important aspects of the SSE portion
are missing from the documentation, and no one seemed to have implemented the "Streamable HTTP" yet; not even their own tooling
like <code>npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest</code>. (To be fair, it might have been a skill issue on my part, pulling the wrong
version, since it was available when I checked again a few weeks later. You can also find version at
<a href="https://inspect.mcp.garden/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">inspect.mcp.garden</a>, which might be more convenient.)</p>

<p>Once you grasp the architecture, you quickly realize that implementing an MCP server, or a client, could be a huge effort. The
problem is that the SSE/Streamable HTTP implementations are trying to act like sockets, emulating stdio, without being one and is
trying to do <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em>.</p>

<h4 id="toc_9">HTTP+SSE Mode</h4>

<p><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports</a></p>

<p>In <strong>HTTP+SSE mode</strong>, to achieve full duplex, the client sets up an SSE session to (e.g.) <code>GET /sse</code> for reads. The first read provides
a URL where writes can be posted. The client then proceeds to use the given endpoint for writes, e.g., a request to
<code>POST /a-endpoint?session-id=1234</code>. The server returns a 202 Accepted with no body, and the response to the request should be read
from the pre-existing open SSE connection on <code>/sse</code>.</p>

<h4 id="toc_10">"Streamable HTTP" Mode</h4>

<p><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports</a></p>

<p>In <strong>"Streamable HTTP" mode</strong>, they realized that instead of providing a new endpoint in the first request, they could use an
HTTP header for the session ID and REST semantics for the endpoint. For example, <code>GET</code> or <code>POST /mcp</code> can open an SSE session and
return an <code>mcp-session-id=1234</code> HTTP header. To send data, the client does requests to <code>POST /mcp</code> and adds the HTTP header
<code>mcp-session-id=1234</code>. The response may:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a new SSE stream and post the reply</li>
<li>Return a 200 with the reply in the body</li>
<li>Return a 202, indicating the reply will be written to one of any pre-existing SSE stream</li>
</ul>

<p>To end the session, the client may or may not send a <code>DELETE /mcp</code> with the header <code>mcp-session-id=1234</code>. The server must maintain
state with no clear way to know when the client has abandoned the session unless the client nicely ends it properly.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">What Are the Implications for SSE Mode?</h3>

<p>This is such a problematic design that I don't know where to begin.</p>

<p>While some key features of SSE mode are undocumented, it's fairly straightforward once you reverse-engineer it. But this still
puts a huge and unnecessary burden on the server implementation, which needs to "join" connections across calls. Doing anything
real will pretty much force you to use a message queue to reply to any request. E.g., running the server in any redundant way will
mean that the SSE stream might come from one server to the client, while the requests are being sent to a completely different
server.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">What Are the Implications for "Streamable HTTP"?</h3>

<p>The <strong>Streamable HTTP</strong> approach takes it to another level with a host of security concerns and obfuscated control flow. While
keeping all the bad parts from SSE mode, Streamable HTTP seems to be more of a super-set of confusion over SSE mode.</p>

<p>In terms of implementation I have just scratched the surface, but from what I understand in the docs...</p>

<p><strong>A new session can be created in 3 ways:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>An empty <code>GET</code> request</li>
<li>An empty <code>POST</code> request</li>
<li>A <code>POST</code> request containing the RPC call</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>An SSE can be opened in 4 different ways:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>GET</code> to initialize</li>
<li>A <code>GET</code> to join an earlier session</li>
<li>A <code>POST</code> to initialize a session</li>
<li>A <code>POST</code> that contains a request and answers with an SSE</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A request may be answered in any of 3 different ways:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>As an HTTP response to a <code>POST</code> with an RPC call</li>
<li>As an event in an SSE that was opened as a response to the <code>POST</code> RPC call</li>
<li>As an event to any SSE that was opened at some earlier point</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_13">General implications</h4>

<p>With its multiple ways to initiate sessions, open SSE connections, and respond to requests, this introduces significant
complexity.
This complexity has several general implications:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Complexity</strong>: The multiple ways of doing the same thing (session creation, SSE opening, response delivery) increases
the cognitive load for developers. It becomes harder to understand, debug, and maintain code.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Inconsistency</strong>: With various ways to achieve the same outcome, there's a higher risk of inconsistent
implementations across different servers and clients. This can lead to interoperability issues and unexpected behavior. Clients
and servers just implementing the parts they feel are necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability Concerns</strong>: While Streamable HTTP aims to improve efficiency, with a charitable interpretation, the complexity
will introduce scalability bottlenecks that need to be overcome. Servers might struggle to manage the diverse connection states,
response mechanisms over a large number of machines.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_14">Security Implications</h4>

<p>The "flexibility" of Streamable HTTP introduces several security concerns, and here are just a few of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>State Management Vulnerabilities</strong>: Managing session state across different connection types (HTTP and SSE) is complex. This
could lead to vulnerabilities such as session hijacking, replay attacks or DoS attacks by creating state on the server that
needs to be managed and kept around waiting for a session to be resumed.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Attack Surface</strong>: The multiple entry points for session creation and SSE connections expand the attack surface. Each
entry point represents a potential vulnerability that an attacker could exploit.</li>
<li><strong>Confusion and Obfuscation</strong>: The variety of ways to initiate sessions and deliver responses can be used to obfuscate malicious
activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_15">Authorization</h3>

<p>The latest version of the protocol contains some very opinionated requirements on how authorization should be done.</p>

<p><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implementations using an HTTP-based transport SHOULD conform to this specification.</li>
<li>Implementations using an STDIO transport SHOULD NOT follow this specification, and instead retrieve credentials from the
environment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm reading it like, for stdio, do whatever. For HTTP, you better fucking jump through these OAuth2 hoops. Why do I need to
implement OAuth2 if I'm using HTTP as transport, while an API key is enough for stdio?</p>

<h2 id="toc_16">What Should Be Done</h2>

<p>I don't know, just kind of feel sad about it all...
It seems like the industry is peeing their pants at the moment ― <em>it feels great now, but it's going to be hard to deal with
later.</em></p>

<p>There is one JSON RPC protocol, and Stdio is clearly preferred as the transport protocol. Then we should try to have the HTTP
transport be as much like Stdio as we can make it, and only really deviate if we really, really need to.</p>

<ul>
<li>In Stdio, we have Environment Variables, in HTTP we have HTTP Headers</li>
<li>In Stdio, we have <em>socket-like</em> behavior with input and output streams, in HTTP we have WebSockets</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it really. We should be able to accomplish the same thing on WebSockets as we do on Stdio. WebSockets are the appropriate
choice for transport over HTTP. We can do away with complex cross-server state management for sessions. We can do away with a
multitude of corner-cases and on and on.</p>

<p>Sure some things, like authorization, might be a bit more complicated in some instances (and easier in some); some firewalls out
there might block WebSockets; there might be extra overhead for small sessions; it might be harder to resume a broken session. But
as
<em>they</em> say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clients and servers MAY implement additional custom transport mechanisms to suit their specific needs. The protocol is
transport-agnostic and can be implemented over any communication channel that supports bidirectional message exchange</p>

<p><a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#custom-transports" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#custom-transports</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an industry, we should optimize for the most common use-cases, not the corner-cases.</p>

<h2 id="toc_17">Side note: Alternatives and Additions</h2>

<p>As discussed above, there seem to be more protocols emerging. MCP is effectively "a protocol to expose an API to an LLM" (which
can create an agent). The more recent protocols from IBM and Google (ACP and A2A) are effectively "protocols to expose an Agent to
an LLM" (which can create an agent of agents).</p>

<p>Looking through the A2A specification, it seems like there's a very limited need for them. Even though they claim to be
orthogonal, most things in A2A could be accomplished with MCP as is or with small additions.</p>

<p>It boils down to two entire protocols that could just as well be tools in an MCP server. Even IBM seems to acknowledge that their
protocol isn't really necessary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Agents can be viewed as MCP resources and further invoked as MCP tools. Such a view of ACP agents allows MCP clients to
discover and run ACP agents..."</p>

<p>― IBM / <a href="https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/ecosystem/mcp-adapter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/ecosystem/mcp-adapter</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My initial feeling is that the ACP protocol mostly seems like an attempt for IBM to promote their "
agent-building-tool" <a href="https://beeai.dev/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BeeAI</a></p>

<p>What both of the A** protocols bring to the table is a sane transport layer and a way to discover agents.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the strangest features of American work culture is the constant pressure to treat one’s job as something more than a job: a calling, a means of expressing oneself, a vehicle for personal growth. This pressure comes from bosses, of course, who would rather foster intrinsic motivation than pay higher wages. But it also comes from popular psychology. As every self-help reader knows, the most successful careerists leverage their own unique personalities to achieve results and add value. They work for themselves. They love what they do. They are radiant with a higher purpose. In a word, they are “entrepreneurial.”</p>
<p>In his new book, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674293601"><em>Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America</em></a>, historian Erik Baker calls this self-help ideology “the rot festering at the core” of our national obsession with work. A comprehensive and sharply written intellectual history, the book traces the origins of several reputedly twenty-first-century maladies to an earlier age. Gig work, as it turns out, didn’t begin with Uber but with Avon direct-sales reps. The wacky metaphysics of today’s tech billionaires have their analogues in the “mind-cures” of nineteenth-century spiritualists. And the celebration of “charismatic” executives has its origins in German social science, with disturbingly fascist undertones. Baker also demonstrates how a fetish for entrepreneurs shaped both modernization theory during the Cold War and now-discredited market-based solutions to global poverty, especially microfinance. But the “marriage of positive psychology and the entrepreneurial ethic” is the book’s primary target. It’s a rotten worldview because it “enjoins us to work more intensely than we need to,” and more importantly, it “leaves us feeling devoid of purpose when we don’t have work.”</p>
<p><br><strong>Baker’s book tells a story</strong> about the unholy union between American psychology and American business—not just how it was formed, but how it came to present as universal truths concepts that were in fact derived from economic scarcity. The story begins with New Thought, a nineteenth-century spiritual movement that emerged in response to the trauma of American capitalism as it swaggered into the Gilded Age. Writers like Ralph Waldo Trine, who became a favorite of Henry Ford, believed that “creative” people had the power to manifest opportunities for themselves even amid the direst circumstances. There’s a reason William James felt the need to address the movement in his scrupulously compassionate book <em>The Varieties of Religious Experience</em>. New Thought claimed that “personal thoughts are forces,” that “serenity” and “happiness” are available to anyone who adopts the right attitude, that the universe has a reservoir of positive vibes to draw from. Like James, Baker approaches his subject with care and curiosity. He is less interested in the credulousness of those who believed in “mind cures” than he is in the material conditions that created such a strong demand for intellectual moonshine. At a time of great upheaval, he writes, “New Thought promised to restore power to the individual” and “grant practitioners the ability to overcome ‘concern’” about the “precarious labor market.” Eventually, this quirky strain of neo-transcendentalism evolved into what Baker calls a “doctrinally fuzzy success philosophy.”</p>
<p>That philosophy is just as fuzzy now as it was a century ago. It remains with us in the form of personal-growth seminars, advice podcasts, and the bright, encouraging schlock filling space in airport bookstores. Then as now, the field was nothing if not a huckster’s paradise. One of the more amusing figures, Napoleon Hill, a con man and the bestselling author of <em>Think and Grow Rich</em> (1937), urged his readers to cultivate a self that one could market, which required “imagination.” His own imagination invented a meeting with Andrew Carnegie as a ploy to sell more books; other creative schemes included credit fraud, an oil-stock scam, and embezzlement from charities. This message paired nicely with that of the more renowned and less explicitly fraudulent Dale Carnegie, who emphasized the importance of turning talents and passions into cash. Both authors preyed upon the fragile, desperate millions still recovering from the market crash.</p>
</div><div><p>In the fifties, Norman Vincent Peale, a preacher, New Thought evangelist, and eventual officiant of Donald Trump’s first wedding, produced one of the most popular self-help books of all time, <em>The Power of Positive Thinking</em>. “The more you lose yourself in something bigger than yourself,” Peale writes, “the more energy you will have.” Strangely, for Peale, that “something bigger” didn’t include unions or the social infrastructure built by Roosevelt’s New Deal, which he fumed against at every turn. The book has never been out of print, and Baker is good at explaining why. For people afraid of falling behind in the wake of the Great Depression (or, in our own time, the Great Recession) the entrepreneurial ethic that arose from New Thought literature “functioned as a sort of insurance policy—not just a failsafe strategy in case of unemployment, but a preemptive ward against redundancy and obsolescence.”</p>
<p>The same anxieties that attracted people to New Thought at the dawn of American capitalism would later fuel demand for the positive-psychology movement, which has since been enshrined in the curricula of American business schools. At first glance, this movement may appear unassailable. Its goal, after all, is to make people happier and encourage them to “flourish” in their work lives. However, as Baker demonstrates, its primary role is to lend intellectual support to the entrepreneurial ethic. “Psychology is the idiom through which entrepreneurship is discussed,” he writes. In fact, “it’s not always obvious where positive psychology ends and entrepreneurship begins.” How could it be, when business schools now employ teams of psychologists, urging future leaders to embrace “grit,” find “flow,” adopt a “growth mindset,” and establish their own personal brand? “Popular psychology,” Baker writes, “encouraged Americans to cultivate an attractive personality that would help them win the affection of their coworkers and bosses and thus ascend the corporate ladder—instead of striving to embody the transcendent moral values constitutive of the older notion of character.” Baker is keen to expose the harm this movement’s entrepreneurial turn has caused the culture at large. The book opens with the tragic story of Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos and the author of <em>Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose</em>. Hsieh died in a fire at the age of forty-six after barricading himself in a shed with nitrous-oxide canisters, a propane tank, and candles. It’s a cautionary tale about the Faustian bargain “positive psychology” struck with the startup world.</p>
<p>The term “positive psychology” was coined in 1954 by Abraham Maslow, whose relationship with entrepreneurs in Arizona and California is one of the book’s many fascinating subplots. According to Baker, Maslow saw “entrepreneurial leadership” as one of the best applications of his psychological theories of motivation and self-actualization. A similar fondness for business can be found in Maslow’s successor, Martin Seligman, whose work in the nineties and early aughts emphasized the usefulness of positive psychology to achieving success at work. (<em>Flourish</em>, his 2011 book, was blurbed by Tony Hsieh.)</p>
<p>The incentive to make one’s insights more amenable to executives and consultants seems to be irresistible. This is how the author of <em>Flow</em>, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,<em> </em>became the author of <em>Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning</em>, for example. Not that the insights themselves are wrong. Just as Dale Carnegie was right to say that people love to hear the sound of their own name, it is probably true that “autoletic” workers (those who discover intrinsic motivation and achieve “flow”) will feel more satisfied at work. But Baker is calling attention to the fact that these ideas become popular among managers for ignoble reasons: they make it cheaper and easier to burden employees with the task of preserving their own well-being. “Autoletic” workers are more easily exploited, as are those who treat their jobs as extension of themselves. The basic career advice one gets from positive psychology is that throwing yourself into your work is the best way to achieve success and personal fulfillment. And since Americans, as Baker suggests, “prize psychological health as highly as a religious duty,” to fail to be entrepreneurial is a kind of mortal sin.</p>
<p>The Christian language of “duty” and “calling” comes from Max Weber, the German sociologist who studied the problem of how to encourage <em>Arbeitsfreude</em>, or “joy in work.” Weber’s 1904 visit to the United States helped convince him of his famous thesis that the main driver of worker motivation was the Protestant ethic. His colleague Joseph Schumpeter, building upon the supposed link between economic and personal growth, celebrated the entrepreneur as the innovative, heroic force behind “creative destruction”—the kind of leader who inspires joy, meaning, and purpose. The problem, Baker argues, as he combs through the legacy of German social science, is that for some, the only purpose of life is to win at any cost. “The entrepreneur became a Nietzschean conqueror,” he writes, “setting the world ablaze with his energy and virility.” This holds true even when proponents of “creative destruction” adopt a sunnier idiom in Northern California. Baker describes Steve Jobs, who encouraged “an almost cult-like esprit de corps” in his Macintosh unit, as “the most ruthless entrepreneur to emerge from the counterculture.” In Silicon Valley, charismatic leadership of the kind that aroused the Austrian economists was given a friendly, New Age twist. Baker’s genealogy helps explain why American startup culture is so deeply weird.</p>
<p><br><strong>But it’s not weird</strong>, of course, to seek work that is meaningful and satisfying. Hence the universal appeal of the entrepreneurial ethic: it offers the founder, the franchisee, the gig worker, and the influencer the same promise of freedom, and it offers those with W-2s a reason to clock in every day. Employees, no matter what their job, crave recognition, autonomy, and a personal connection to work, which is why they often contribute more than they’re paid for. Baker’s point is that celebrating workers’ “proactivity” disguises an essentially exploitative relationship. That’s especially true when the ethic becomes a management philosophy, as it did during the consulting boom of the seventies and eighties, when “value creation” and “innovation” served as important alibis for cost-cutting and deregulation. “The ultimate function of the entrepreneurial ethic,” he writes, “is to reconcile workers to precarity.” It also creates the illusion that the tech billionaire and the gig worker (who receives no benefits and cannot join a union) are aligned against the wet blanket of government regulation.</p>
<p>Because this ideology is custom made for slumps and busts, it can never be discredited. Baker echoes the work of Barbara Ehrenreich, who discovered a correlation between corporate downsizing and the rise of “positive thinking,” when he says, “Bad news for the economy has always been good news for the entrepreneurial work ethic.” The result is a tragic cycle:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the one hand there is burnout, a hustle culture whose intensity many Americans feel is grinding them into mental, emotional, and physical depletion. On the other hand, there is the lingering poison of deindustrialization, the anomie or social decay that appears to creep into communities where work disappears. But to some extent, these complaints are two sides of the same coin. The looming specter of worklessness is one important motivator of the punishing demands we make on ourselves when we are at work. And our relentless search for innovation and optimization in turn renders swaths of the workforce redundant and obsolete. On and on it goes, in a perpetual spiral.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Make Your Own Job</em> diagnoses that spiral by showing how our economic and psychological pain form a kind of double helix. And Baker allows us to see why the genre of business self-help—and the management theory it often serves—is so predatory. “We are the CEOs of our own companies: Me, Inc.” Tom Peters wrote in “The Brand Called You,” published in <em>Fast Company</em> in 1997. This pressure to build a personal brand is one of the great pathologies of the past three decades—not only because the LinkedIn startup crowd is so insufferable, or because a personal brand is currently looting the federal government with the help of a lunatic entrepreneur, but because this ethos ultimately corrupts our souls and relationships.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with finding spiritual value in one’s career—provided that value doesn’t exist to be exploited by a billionaire. And of course it’s fine to love what you do. But it’s even better to treat love itself as the most important work.</p>

      <p>“Lord Byron on his Death-bed” by Joseph Denis Odevaere</p></span></p><p>This topic has bothered me for years. So now, in a moment of inspiration instigated by <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html">Wait But Why</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and drinking a glass or two of bourbon, I want to hash it out. It is something I call <em>the Deathbed Fallacy</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-deathbed-fallacy">What is the Deathbed Fallacy?</h2>

<p>People on their deathbeds regret not spending more time of their life with their family, traveling more, worrying less, etc. I’ve heard this truism echoed by <a href="http://www.thelawofattraction.com/the-top-5-regrets-people-reveal-they-have-on-their-deathbed/">growth gurus</a> and spiritualists. It <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bronnie-ware/top-5-regrets-of-the-dyin_b_1220965.html">is</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying">amplified</a> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/palliative-nurse-shares-the-most-common-regrets-of-her-patients-a6821061.html">by</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/5-things-people-regret-on-their-deathbed-2013-12">newspapers</a>. It comes up at dinner discussions. The origin the list of regrets is the palliative nurse <a href="http://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/">Bronnie Ware</a> who listed the following most common regrets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.</li>
  <li>I wish I didn’t work so hard.</li>
  <li>I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.</li>
  <li>I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.</li>
  <li>I wish that I had let myself be happier.”</li>
</ol>

<p>All well and good. A bit vague, but seems like solid advice. So what is the
problem?</p>



<p>The fallacy is to assume that whoever you are on your deathbed knows how you should live your life right now. They wish they would have done things differently, meaning, they think <em>you</em> should do something differently, <em>right now</em>. You should consider yourself over a lifetime not as a single person, but a line of many people with different views and priorities. Now, do you think the last person in that line is wise and all-knowing? There are three reasons to doubt that deathbed-you is a competent guide for your life.</p>

<p>The deathbed you is not a reliable advisor. Here’s why.</p>

<h2 id="reason-1-it-is-not-a-representative-state">Reason 1: It is not a representative state</h2>

<p>The deathbed is not a representative state of life, and what you want when you
are there might not have much correlation with what would have been the happiest, most satisfactory and/or meaningful life you could have led.</p>

<p>The deathbed you is very special in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They don’t have a future at all. They are about to die, and nothing they
think has a bearing on the future. All they have is the present and memories.</li>
  <li>They think they know their past selves (such as you) very well but probably
don’t. More on that soon.</li>
  <li>Like all your temporal selves, they are locked in a time, place and life
situation that does not necessarily correspond to yours.</li>
</ul>

<p>We should also expect recency bias to play a significant role. We should assume that the people expressing these regrets are in general quite old. Their memories of working a lot should be dominated by the late stages of their careers. The lost friends should be those they miss at old age, not necessarily the people you hung out with in your twenties that you’ve forgotten almost entirely by the time you’re 60.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2-you-dont-know-your-past-selves-but-you-think-you-do">Reason 2: You don’t know your past selves, but you think you do</h2>

<p>The older I get, the more I think I understand myself as a teenager. As I learn more about myself, I seem to grasp my motivations and my core ides ever more fully. So I tend to think of past me as <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3474">nothing but a slightly less grown-up, more athletic version of myself</a>. I think I’ve been consistent. And when I made the “wrong” choices, it’s either because I was (am) stupid, or because I didn’t have the right information.</p>

<p>But every now and then I find something I wrote or remember a decision I made in high school, which reminds me that my assumptions are all wrong. I was just as smart in high school, I had a lot of information (more than I do now because I’ve forgotten the details). The decisions I made were actually the right ones, and what I think now is wrong, because present me is overly simplistic about past me.</p>

<p>Case in point: for a few years, when I was 14 to 15, a big priority in my life was fitting in, and not be too open about my own ideas and feelings. This goes entirely against both my current ideals and the Deathbed List. So young me would have benefitted from some guidance from present me, right?</p>

<p>Wrong. When I find a diary from that time or talk to a friend from those days about it, it turns out I was probably doing the right thing. My core values were the same as now, only somewhat more 2-dimensional. I valued independence and authenticity back then, too. But what younger me realized, that present me forgot, was that I <em>sucked</em> as a person in a lot of ways and that people, in general, weren’t very fond of me. I also realized that no matter how enlightened or authentic I got, my overall happiness depended quite a lot on how other people saw me, and what relationship we developed.</p>

<p>Today, I probably care too much about what others think. I often blame teenage me for making me so aware of other people’s judgment – why can’t I just focus on cool work and meditation all the time with a select few people I love? But that is just present me shaming past me for dragging himself through an ordeal which benefitted us both. He handled the most pressing matter and passed on the work of undoing the side-effects to me. I just forgot about it and got stuck in regret.</p>

<p>In much the same way, I am now highly career focused. I want to learn a shit lot, I want good jobs, I want money, I want to influence. Deathbed-me would probably scowl and think I’ve gotten my priorities all twisted up. But I am doing this for us. I don’t care about having a career or money, except for as enablers of a good life, a life of freedom, a life in a great city with great people. I believe that hard work can take me places I will enjoy more than where I’d end up if I just focused on being happy in the moment, following the Deathbed List. I’m doing the best I can based on what I know. And that doesn’t come free, I have to make trade-offs. I happen to believe that a lot of the people I would love the hang out with are people in places it is actually hard to get to. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo&amp;ab_channel=CarnegieMellonUniversity">The brick walls are there for a reason</a>, and I want to spend as much of my time as possible with the people on the other side of it, so I need to let go of some stuff on this side for a while. Deathbed-me is gonna be pissed, but he’s just a spoiled ingrate. He’s the kid I’m raising, not the other way around.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3-most-people-that-die-today-lived-in-a-world-very-different-to-yours">Reason 3: Most people that die today lived in a world very different to yours</h2>

<p>Maybe you think the key to happiness is universal. That it doesn’t change as the world does. But keep in mind that for all the things on the list, the predicament has changed. Let’s take number 1 on the list as an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about someone you know who lived to be 70 years, 80 years or older. It may be someone alive or no longer with you. They correspond best to the average person in palliative care. Think about the stories they told you about growing up, about working life, about their values. Wouldn’t you agree that it was likely <em>a lot</em> harder for them to live outside the expectations of others? Have we not come a long way when it comes to people being free to shape their own lives? Is it possible, maybe, just maybe, that some people are a bit too good at being “authentic,” to the detriment of themselves and their surroundings, by being a bit self-obsessed and not paying enough attention to duty and the common good?</p>

<p>To someone in their 20s, there is, like, a 50-year delay in the data here. The challenges facing my generation are not the same as that of my grandparents. For example, do you 20-somethings today are better or worse at staying in contact with friends? My grandparents might have had trouble staying in touch, but weren’t stuck on social media. Maybe they were stuck in a cubicle or a rigid moral structure. Maybe they were stuck hiding their sexuality from their friends and families. Maybe they were homeowners by my age, settled down with a family. How similar do you think our lives are?</p>

<h2 id="who-is-most-guilty-of-this-fallacy">Who is most guilty of this fallacy?</h2>

<p>In my experience, those who “figure out” what life is really about seem to be pretty far
up in Maslow’s pyramid of needs, and focus a lot on the higher-order needs. They tend to be smart people that have figured out some way to make a decent living that allows them a lot of time to think, and personal freedom to explore experiences. I’d say that a lot of these people are, or have been, workaholics. And now they have the luxury of thinking about The Real Important Things In Life™, casting judgment on their former selves for not seeing when a precondition for them to be able to figure themselves out in the first place is the work they already put in.</p>

<p>Conversely, I’ve met quite a few people who are very concerned about living an authentic, carefree life without having a lot of other things figured out first. They don’t have a stable income (or at least the contacts and knowledge required to make some money when they need to), good relationships, and a good grasp of their material priorities. These are struggling artist, miserable drifters or just pretty aimless people with romantic dreams that leave them disappointed with the real world.</p>

<p>In short, people who already have a lot seem to assume that if they never even strived for it, they would be happier. But that striving is often an enabler of the life they now think they want. It is what gave them their family, their network, their passions.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-alternative">So what’s the alternative?</h2>

<p>The Deathbed List is in a lot of ways sound advice (if a bit abstract). It aligns well with current happiness research. But it kind of shifts the blame onto you, for caring about other people, for working hard. Heck, it might be a good idea to be miserable for a few years to build up some knowledge or capital. At least, that’s what a lot of other solid life advice is telling us.</p>

<p>What I want you to take away is this: Don’t bother with the Deathbed Fallacy. Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Study">happiness research</a>, which tells you a stable income, focus on relationships and experiences rather than stuff, practicing acceptance, and small things like short commute times make you happier. <a href="https://www.happinessresearchinstitute.com/books">Get some books on the topic</a>. Reflect on your own past happiness right now, and consider what you should do become more fulfilled both today and for the rest of your time on Earth. Going to work most days and dropping a few friends you don’t have time for may actually be sensible right now if you are in the middle of your career, doing something meaningful. Don’t worry about what some old version of yourself will think of you but focus instead on making sure they are happy and well off, even if they are total ingrates.</p>

<p>This footage has gone viral online with the claim that it shows an 3 year old chimney sweep on the job:</p>

<p>Millions of people saw the footage, shared it online an were upset by it, as they should be… if it was real…</p>


<div>

<p>When I saw this I knew things were not as they seemed, it was staged, but convincing people of this was quite tricky, after all there’s film footage, it’s right there and it looks real.</p>



<p>Before we debunk the claim, we first have to find out more about the footage.</p>



<p>The source for the footage is the British Pathé archive, you can find the film by <a href="https://www.britishpathe.com/video/the-three-year-old-2/query/98002">clicking here</a>. They describe the footage as “Very young boy works with his father as a chimney sweep.” and date it to 1933.<br>That’s all they seem to know.<br>But what can we learn from the film itself?<br>The text on the shops suggests this was filmed in a German speaking country, we see “Luxus Geschirr” (luxury tableware) and “Eingang” (entrance).</p>

<p>But the pavement looked familiar to me, I’m specialised in Europe during the 1920s-40s and have worked on a project about daily life in Berlin in the 1920s and I’ve seen that pavement in other old footage and in countless photos.<br>That peculiar combination of big slabs and small cobbles seems to be rather specific to Berlin.</p>

<p>The tram in the background also looked like trams did in Berlin back then and a few friends of mine who live in that city agreed that the street was a Berlin street.<br>After some research I found this very familiar looking cover of a Polish 1929 magazine;</p>





<p>I am almost completely sure that these are the same father and son as in the film footage and when I found a clearer copy of the photo I was even more convinced;</p>

<p>In this photo we can also see the exact same pavement and when I traced the photo down to a stock photo company’s website it was described as “Ein Schornsteinfeger und sein Sohn gehen zur Arbeit. Foto, Berlin 1930er Jahre” ( A chimney sweep and his son go to work. Photo, Berlin 1930s), confirming the location.<br>We know the photo was taken in 1929 (or earlier) because that’s when it appeared in the magazine, which means it’s highly unlikely that the film is from 1933.<br>Either way, this is as close to the source as I could get.</p>



<p>So although we now know the film was indeed shot in Berlin roughly in 1929-1930, we still don’t know anything about the story behind it.</p>



<p>Everybody knows that children used to be chimney sweeps, we’ve seen them in the movies and read about them in Victorian books.<br>And let’s be absolutely clear about this; children, boys and girls, were indeed forced to do this terrible work, even very young ones, for a long time.<br>They were abused, exposed to cancer causing coal dust, were sometimes literally bought from poor parents and sometimes died in the most horrific ways imaginable.<br>But were they still a thing in 1920s Berlin?</p>



<p>Child labour was very common in Europe for many centuries, in the public mind this was especially part of the Victorian era, the industrial revolution seems to have made child labour more prevalent but also more dangerous and dirty than it had been before.<br>Children were cheap and could do some jobs grown-ups couldn’t.<br>But as the 19th century progressed people started to protest against this horrible practice, more and more regulations and laws appeared to protect children, in part thanks to the trade unions but also the many publications revealing the plight of the poor.<br>In Britain a damning report was published by a Parliamentary Committee that was established to investigate the conditions of children apprenticed to chimney-sweeps.<br>This brought some awful stories to light that shocked the public so much that in 1843 several specific acts were passed just for the protection of children working for chimney sweeps, forbidding any child under the age of 14 being engaged in cleaning chimneys, keep this in mind the next time you see one in a Victorian drama.<br>But even before that law existed, sweep apprentices often started work when they were six, as those younger were considered too weak.<br>So even chimney sweeps weren’t really using 3 year olds that much, even when they were still allowed to.</p>



<p>In Germany things evolved in a similar manner except earlier, the ‘Preußisches Regulativ’ from 1839 was one of the first or perhaps even the first regulation on the European continent to restrict child labour.<br>It was not specifically set up to stop children working but more focused on enforcing the also new compulsory education laws.<br>In 1903 the ‘Gesetz, betreffend Kinderarbeit in gewerblichen Betrieben’ (Law concerning child labour in commercial establishments) added a lot of restrictions to the type of work children were allowed to do and chimney sweeps were specifically mentioned.<br>Legal language is quite confusing, especially in German, especially from over a century ago, but the law made it illegal for children under the age of 10-13 to work in the chimney sweeping business, even if was just to help dad.<br>Yes, of course, just because there was a law against it does not rule out that some people might still have done it, but these laws were strictly enforced by the government and it was widely supported by the public, people had felt bad about little chimney sweeps for a very long time.<br>It’s rather unlikely that dad was using not just a child, but a toddler, breaking an 26 year old law regarding child labour that specifically mentions the job he’s being forced to do and that dad didn’t mind him committing this crime being filmed and shown in cinemas everywhere… </p>



<p>But there are a few other clues that what we’re seeing is just a bit of a fun in stead of an example of horrible child labour.</p>



<p>Everything about the child is miniature, not just his outfit but also the tools of the trade.<br>Ladder, brush, coring ball, they’re all tiny.<br>Which is odd because grown-up chimney sweeps use the same tools for the same chimneys, but bigger, some of these tools only work because they’re heavy and big.<br>The kid is a miniature chimney sweep but he isn’t doing a miniature job.</p>



<p>On top of that the tools we see are a bit outdated.<br>In the 19th century new tools were invented that involved extendable rods with brushes that could be used to clean an entire chimney from the fireplace.</p>

<p>This revolutionised the way chimneys were cleaned to this day.<br>They made using children no longer necessary, not only were they illegal, they were outdated and replaced by a better, easier and faster tool.</p>

<p>Another important thing to mention is that the chimney sweep was a good luck symbol at that time, especially in Germany.<br>People dressed up as them and send each other postcards showing children as chimney sweeps.</p>







<p>Dressing children up as adults has a long tradition, people still do it today.<br>Remember this kid?</p>

<p>He’s also not a real chimney sweep, the photo was taken in 1980, I remember 1980, there were no child chimney sweeps in my part of Europe back then.<br>More about that photo <a href="https://fakehistoryhunter.net/2019/09/22/not-a-pre-child-labour-law-chimney-sweep/">here</a>.</p>



<p>So in conclusion;</p>



<ul><li>We have a toddler doing a job even ruthless Victorians chimney sweeps thought he was too young for.</li><li>He’s doing a job in a country where it had been illegal for almost 30 years for kids much older than him to do that job.</li><li>His dad does not seem to mind the world seeing him break the law.</li><li>He’s using miniature tools that just wouldn’t do the job properly.</li><li>A century earlier new tools had been invented that made climbing up chimneys no longer necessary.</li><li>The public had opposed children being used as chimney sweeps en masse long before this film was made.</li><li>Kids dressing up as chimney sweeps was extremely popular back then in Germany, they were a good luck symbol.</li><li>Seeing a child playing a chimney sweep was so unusual people in the street stopped, stared and smiled and it ended up on the cover of a Polish magazine and in news footage that went around the world, almost as if it wasn’t something people were used to…</li></ul>



<p>But the quest for the true story behind the footage has not come to an end just yet.<br>Who were the man and his son, what happened to them, could finding their identities help us understand the footage even more?<br>When I shared this article online soon my followers started doing some detective work as well and more details were soon unearthed.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/volksvlijt">Mr. Dommershuijzen</a> found the tiny chimney sweep photo shared in several Dutch 1927 newspapers and one of them mentioned the dad’s name; Bohnhe:</p>

<p>Here the little chimney sweep is mentioned by name; Horst Bohnke, which proves that Otto Böhnke is indeed his father.<br>With these names we managed to find them being mentioned in newspapers and magazines all over the world, it seems like little Horst has gone viral once before!</p>



<p>In the archives we found that in 1915 Otto Böhnke married Martha Blume, so now we know mum’s name as well, the family is appearing out of the shadows of history.</p>

<p>The search continues, we’ve learned so much in such a short time, who knows what we’ll find next?<br>Whatever happened to little Horst?</p>



<p>We’ll keep looking, but for now I think there’s more than enough here to say that the toddler was not actually working as a real chimney sweep but just coming along for a day for fun or for the benefit of a photographer or the newsreel crew.<br>But as with all my articles, this is a work in progress, if more is found, I’ll update the story.</p>

    <h4 id="a-reflection-on-bonfire%E2%80%99s-journey-to-1.0-and-an-open-invitation-to-shape-what-comes-next."><em>A reflection on Bonfire’s journey to 1.0 and an open invitation to shape what comes next.</em> <a href="#a-reflection-on-bonfire%E2%80%99s-journey-to-1.0-and-an-open-invitation-to-shape-what-comes-next.">#</a></h4>
<p>As we approach the release of Bonfire 1.0, this isn’t your typical launch announcement. Instead, it’s a moment to reflect on <strong>how</strong> we’ve built Bonfire, a roadmap of values, methods, and intentions – and an invitation to define what comes next.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You can <a href="https://indieweb.social/@bonfire">follow Bonfire on the fediverse</a> for updates on the release, including highlights of unique features we’ll share over the next few days.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a world of “move fast and break things,” we’ve chosen a different tempo — one rooted in care, deep listening, and collective stewardship. Slow software means building for long-term resilience and meaningful participation, rather than chasing novelty, speed, or scale.</p>
<h2 id="%F0%9F%8F%A6-profit-over-people%3A-at-what-cost%3F">🏦 <strong>Profit over people: at what cost?</strong> <a href="#%F0%9F%8F%A6-profit-over-people%3A-at-what-cost%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>The Silicon Valley model delivers quick but unaccountable decisions. Rules are one-sided, power is hoarded, and systems operate behind closed doors. The casualties are many:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust:</strong> Algorithms bred to addict or manipulate rather than to inform or empower.</li>
<li><strong>Consent</strong>: Secrecy quietly eroding autonomy. Invisible hands reshaping our lives without consent.</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> Platforms optimising for engagement, making division and hatred profitable.</li>
<li><strong>Attention:</strong> Human focus becomes data—extracted like oil to fuel the surveillance economy.</li>
<li><strong>Labour:</strong> Care work like content moderation rendered invisible, workers treated as expendable.</li>
<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Scale trumping sustainability at every turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>As power concentrates, democracy withers and authoritarianism thrives. Algorithms tuned for "engagement" amplify fear, outrage, and division—because that’s what keeps us clicking. In the end, <strong>the tools meant to connect us are weaponized to divide us</strong>.</p>
<p><em>We've witnessed the damage when tech scales without care. What could we build instead?</em></p>
<h2 id="%F0%9F%90%8C-caracol%3A-a-different-outlook">🐌 <strong>Caracol: a different outlook</strong> <a href="#%F0%9F%90%8C-caracol%3A-a-different-outlook">#</a></h2>
<p>Bonfire draws inspiration from the <em>caracol</em> (snail), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation">Zapatista</a> symbol of slow, collective movement. The caracol is a spiral, with no top or center—only a shared heart. It stands for governance from the edges, listening before action, autonomy over hierarchy, and the conviction that <em>how</em> we build matters more than <em>what</em> we build.</p>
<p>These aren't lofty ideals—they're the backbone of Bonfire's design: a system built for flexibility, diversity, and overlapping needs. <strong>You don’t just use Bonfire—you shape it.</strong> It’s not one tool; it’s a terrain. A toolkit. Imagine digital spaces growing organically, communities determining how they connect, and tools that can be picked up, transformed, or set aside as needed. The <em>caracol</em> reminds us: meaningful progress comes from how we move, who we move with, and what kind of world we forge together.</p>
<h2 id="%E2%9C%8A-governance%3A-foundations-of-bonfire">✊ <strong>Governance: foundations of Bonfire</strong> <a href="#%E2%9C%8A-governance%3A-foundations-of-bonfire">#</a></h2>
<p>The way we build is part of what we create. Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy">sociocracy</a>—a method of collaborative governance based on circles, consent, and distributed authority, and by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalism">Bookchin’s municipal confederations</a>, the Zapatistas, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria">Rojava</a>, governance in Bonfire runs deep:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything is modular—down to the core:</strong> All features are provided by separate extensions, meaning the “core app” contains no code but just configuration. There also isn’t a single core; instead, there exists different “flavours” of Bonfire: sets of config and extensions adapted to various use cases or communities.</li>
<li><strong>Communities govern “flavours”:</strong> Bonfire's modularity serves a political purpose—inviting communities to discuss, configure, and collectively govern every aspect of their experience.</li>
<li><strong>Shining a light on the power of defaults:</strong> Whenever a choice about how something should work in Bonfire is unclear, we make it configurable. Code establishes an initial default, but flavours can override it, communities can set instance-wide settings, and individuals make final decisions in their own account or profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Custom roles:</strong> Moving beyond binary admin/user hierarchies, communities and individuals define and assign roles with precisely calibrated permissions—distributing power and responsibility to match their unique contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Circles and boundaries:</strong> Creating flexible "circles" (like "colleagues" or "book club") and "boundaries" (granular permission sets) to control exactly who can see, interact with, or collaborate on anything—putting people in charge of their online relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Tools that prioritise real people and relationships</strong> over speed and simplicity. We make no assumptions about the “average” user, social needs are complex and overlapping, there are no no one-size-fits-all solutions. We center needs often marginalized or overlooked—making them foundational so everyone benefits from greater flexibility and control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="%F0%9F%9B%A1%EF%B8%8F-guarding-the-commons">🛡️ <strong>Guarding the commons</strong> <a href="#%F0%9F%9B%A1%EF%B8%8F-guarding-the-commons">#</a></h3>
<p>Values alone aren’t enough—many well-intentioned projects eventually drift, burn out, or sell out. Bonfire is federated at every level—protocol, code, and governance—so its purpose and values can’t be quietly eroded or easily overturned. This technical and political design aims to resist capture, prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>, and safeguard community autonomy for the long term.</p>
<p>Here's how Bonfire can <strong>resist capture:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AGPL licensing:</strong> All code is AGPL, ensuring all modifications remain open and accessible, preventing capture by Big Tech or cloud services.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-layered modularity and forkability:</strong> Everything is an extension—identity, moderation, groups. People can fork just an extension or a flavour–which encourages forking by lowering the maintainance effort.</li>
<li><strong>Community-governed flavours:</strong> Communities decide what's included and how it evolves.</li>
<li><strong>Zero VC funding or ads:</strong> Bonfire will remain free of venture capital and advertisement. No dark patterns. No pivoting away from responsibility or ethics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're also experimenting with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sociocratic circles:</strong> Self-organizing groups stewarding specific extensions or flavours, making decisions by consent. We're expanding this approach, creating pathways for communities to shape and protect their own digital spaces.</li>
<li>New models for <strong>participatory funding</strong> and resource allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The commons survive only when they can <strong>regrow anywhere</strong>. We design for resilience, adaptability, and collective stewardship.</p>
<h2 id="%F0%9F%8C%90-federation%3A-autonomy-through-connection">🌐 <strong>Federation: autonomy through connection</strong> <a href="#%F0%9F%8C%90-federation%3A-autonomy-through-connection">#</a></h2>
<p>Bonfire federates (i.e., interconnects with other independent platforms) with Mastodon and the wider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a>, but federation is more than a technical protocol — it embodies our commitment to autonomy <em>and</em> collaboration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each community governs itself while connecting with others, maintaining distinct cultures, rules, and practices.</li>
<li>Federation isn't for scaling one model, but for interconnecting many. No central power dictates decisions—only connected, independent nodes working in concert.</li>
<li>Offboarding and freedom to migrate: Users should never be locked into platforms by their data or social connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We're building many interconnected worlds, not one massive platform.</strong></p>

<p>Bonfire is a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons">commons</a></em>–a place to gather, co-create, and build networks that last–beyond products to be sold or services that use, abuse, or extract from you.</p>
<p>Bonfire’s values, goals, and processes are shaped by the people and communities who choose to participate. As a starting point, we uphold principles rooted in care, consent, and collective stewardship.</p>
<p>Whether you're a community organiser, activist, builder or simply curious, join us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Join the conversation:</strong> Take part in our public discussion spaces. Share your experiences, needs, and questions.</li>
<li><strong>Help shape governance:</strong> Participate in forming circles to govern specific extensions or Bonfire flavours, and share responsibility, decide by consent, and ensure Bonfire evolves with real community needs.</li>
<li><strong>Propose features or co-design new extensions:</strong> Bring your ideas for how Bonfire can serve new purposes, or create new "flavours" and tools.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute feedback:</strong> Help us spot issues, propose adaptations, or challenge assumptions so Bonfire can serve more people, more justly.</li>
<li><strong>Help shape the culture:</strong> Share learnings from your own communities, organize workshops, or experiment with governance models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Built for the long haul. <em>By people, for people</em>.</p>
<h3 id="%F0%9F%8F%95%EF%B8%8F-campground%3A-a-living-laboratory">🏕️ <strong>Campground: a living laboratory</strong> <a href="#%F0%9F%8F%95%EF%B8%8F-campground%3A-a-living-laboratory">#</a></h3>
<p>Our test instance, <a href="https://campground.bonfire.cafe/">the campground</a>, is open as a local-only space for co-design and experimentation. Here, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience what digital spaces built on consent, care, and mutual aid feel like.</li>
<li>Collaborate to co-design and test features — making Bonfire safer, more resilient, accessible, and truly centered on people and communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t a product launch—we’re not looking for <em>users</em> but for <em>active participants</em>: people and groups who want to shape, critique, and experiment together — whether that’s on the campground, through their own Bonfire instances, or by joining others to co-create new digital spaces.</p>
<h2 id="%E2%9C%A8-let%E2%80%99s-build-what-lasts%2C-together">✨ <strong>Let’s build what lasts, together</strong> <a href="#%E2%9C%A8-let%E2%80%99s-build-what-lasts%2C-together">#</a></h2>
<p>If these ideas resonate, we invite you to reflect, dialogue, reach out, and co-create. Bonfire lives as a conversation in motion, beyond its code. The world needs many interconnected spaces built on care, autonomy, and collective power — not yet another app chasing scale.</p>
<p>We hope these principles can ignite new approaches to digital community-building. The future is ours to build — intentionally, collectively, and with care. Join us in shaping what comes next.</p>

La iniciativa se presenta como una alternativa para quienes han comenzado a buscar nuevas oportunidades de desarrollo profesional tras los recortes en el financiamiento científico impulsados por la administración de Donald Trump.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, presidenta de la Comisión Europea, advirtió que “lamentablemente, el papel de la ciencia en el mundo actual está siendo cuestionado. Se pone <a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/trump-recorta-fuertemente-la-investigacion-en-harvard">en duda la inversión en investigación</a> fundamental, libre y abierta. ¡Qué grave error de cálculo! La ciencia es clave para nuestro futuro. Sin ella, no podemos enfrentar los desafíos globales. Por eso, más que nunca, debemos defender una ciencia universal, compartida y unificadora”.</p><hr><div data-testid="ContentCardEmbedWrapper"><p><span><picture><img alt="Planta Nuclear" src="https://media.es.wired.com/photos/67e41013afedf7c98f6d5b04/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1540176964%2520(1).jpg" srcset="https://media.es.wired.com/photos/67e41013afedf7c98f6d5b04/master/w_120,c_limit/GettyImages-1540176964%20(1).jpg 120w, https://media.es.wired.com/photos/67e41013afedf7c98f6d5b04/master/w_240,c_limit/GettyImages-1540176964%20(1).jpg 240w, https://media.es.wired.com/photos/67e41013afedf7c98f6d5b04/master/w_320,c_limit/GettyImages-1540176964%20(1).jpg 320w, https://media.es.wired.com/photos/67e41013afedf7c98f6d5b04/master/w_640,c_limit/GettyImages-1540176964%20(1).jpg 640w" sizes="100vw"></picture></span></p><div><p>Un equipo del Instituto Nacional de Normas y Tecnología que publica datos de medición cruciales para la investigación avanzada en áreas como la astrofísica, la fusión nuclear y los semiconductores, podría desaparecer en las próximas semanas.</p></div></div><hr><p>La dirigente del Ejecutivo comunitario explicó que el programa <em>Choose Europe for Science</em> contempla <strong>una inversión de 500 millones de euros entre 2025 y 2027</strong> para captar especialistas en distintas ramas del conocimiento. Asimismo, incluye el compromiso de incrementar el presupuesto destinado a proyectos de Investigación y Desarrollo (I+D) hasta alcanzar el 3% del producto interior bruto (PIB) en 2030.</p><p>El plan, originalmente propuesto por el Gobierno francés, plantea la creación de una “súper subvención” con una duración de siete años para brindar estabilidad a los investigadores más destacados. Además, prevé duplicar este mismo año el monto de los apoyos económicos disponibles para quienes decidan trasladarse al bloque europeo.</p><p>Von der Leyen recalcó que “Europa siempre optará por la ciencia. Nuestra región dispone de todo lo necesario para que florezca: inversión sostenida, infraestructura de calidad, compromiso con una ciencia abierta y colaborativa, y una economía social de mercado que asegura acceso a la educación, la salud y otros servicios esenciales”. No obstante, reconoció que los científicos en la Unión aún enfrentan una burocracia más compleja en comparación con otras regiones del mundo.</p><p>“Sabemos que el camino que va de la investigación básica al mercado no es lo suficientemente ágil ni directo en Europa. Debemos ofrecer condiciones óptimas y estables a largo plazo”, admitió. En este sentido, anunció que <strong>el bloque impulsará una nueva Ley del Espacio Europeo de Investigación para garantizar la libertad científica.</strong></p><p>Según cifras de la Comisión Europea, en el continente trabajan actualmente 2 millones de investigadores, lo que representa una cuarta parte del total mundial. Von der Leyen destacó además que la Unión gestiona el mayor programa internacional de investigación: Horizonte Europa, con una dotación superior a los 93,000 millones de euros. Este financiamiento ha permitido apoyar a 33 <a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/quienes-ganaran-premios-nobel-2024-citas-que-obtuvo-cada-publicacion-pueden-darnos-idea">ganadores del Premio Nobel</a> en las últimas cuatro décadas.</p><p>“Queremos que Europa siga siendo referente en investigación básica, que lidere el desarrollo de tecnologías estratégicas y que científicos, académicos y trabajadores altamente cualificados elijan nuestra región para desarrollarse plenamente”, concluyó la presidenta de la Comisión.</p><h2>Europa quiere conquistar a los investigadores que EE UU desprecia</h2><p>En marzo, el gobierno estadounidense canceló más de 200 subvenciones federales destinadas a investigaciones sobre el <a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/este-nuevo-farmaco-podria-ser-la-solucion-al-vih-pero-los-recortes-en-ee-uu-frenan-su-lanzamiento">virus de inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH)</a>. También redujo los recursos asignados a los Institutos Nacionales de Salud para estudios relacionados con el covid-19 e impuso un recorte de 400 millones de dólares al financiamiento de la Universidad de Columbia, en represalia por las protestas pro-palestinas realizadas en su plantel en el contexto del conflicto con Israel.</p><p>Estas decisiones han generado un <a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/los-recortes-de-trump-a-la-ciencia-estan-causando-una-fuga-de-cerebros">éxodo de investigadores</a> que buscan continuar sus carreras fuera de Estados Unidos. Un análisis <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01216-7">publicado en <em>Nature</em></a> señala que e<strong>l 75% de los científicos estadounidenses se plantea dejar el país.</strong> Por su parte, datos de Nature Careers, una plataforma global de empleos científicos, revelan que entre enero y marzo de este año, los profesionales de ese país enviaron un 32% más de solicitudes a instituciones extranjeras en comparación con el mismo período de 2024. Asimismo, el número de usuarios estadounidenses que exploran oportunidades fuera del territorio nacional aumentó un 35%.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Paralelamente, el interés internacional por trabajar en Estados Unidos ha disminuido notablemente. Durante el primer trimestre del año, las postulaciones de científicos provenientes de Canadá, China y Europa a centros de investigación estadounidenses cayeron en un 13, 39 y 41%, respectivamente.</p><p>Frente a este contexto, diversas instituciones extranjeras han intensificado sus esfuerzos para atraer talento estadounidense, siendo Europa una de las regiones más activas. La Universidad de Aix-Marsella, en Francia, presentó recientemente el programa <em>Un lugar seguro para la ciencia</em>, orientado a acoger a investigadores estadounidenses despedidos, censurados o limitados por las políticas gubernamentales de Trump. <strong>Este proyecto contempla una inversión aproximada de 15 millones de euros.</strong></p><p>En la misma línea, la Sociedad Max Planck, en Alemania, anunció la creación del <em>Programa Transatlántico Max Planck</em>, cuyo propósito es establecer centros de investigación conjuntos con instituciones de Estados Unidos.</p><div data-testid="external-link-embed--inline"><a aria-label="Las noticias que marcan el presente y moldean el futuro, ¡ahora en WhatsApp!

Este programa ofrece una financiación adicional de 200,000 euros por proyecto a los seleccionados provenientes de Estados Unidos.</p><p>“Vamos a intensificar los <a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/por-que-muchas-cientificas-siguen-sin-salir-en-los-medios">esfuerzos para atraer talento</a> desde Estados Unidos. Queremos que vengan a hacer la mejor ciencia posible, libre de restricciones ideológicas. El conocimiento científico y tecnológico nos convierte en un país mejor, porque genera prosperidad compartida y visión de futuro”, concluyó Cigudosa durante la presentación del programa <em>Choose Europe for Science</em>, en declaraciones retomadas por la agencia <em>EFE</em>.</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"><div data-testid="IframeEmbedContainer"><p><iframe height="113" width="200" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" title="Embedded Frame" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zimXNLPU0r4" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p></div></figure></div></div></div>]]></description>
