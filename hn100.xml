<p><img height="100" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/2026.png" alt="Gentoo Fireworks">
Happy New Year 2026! Once again, a lot has happened in Gentoo over the past months. New developers, 
more binary packages, GnuPG alternatives support, Gentoo for WSL, improved Rust bootstrap, better NGINX packaging, …
As always <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html">here 
we’re going to revisit all the exciting news</a> from our favourite Linux distribution.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="gentoo-in-numbers">Gentoo in numbers</h2>

<p>Gentoo currently consists of <strong>31663 ebuilds</strong> for <strong>19174 different packages</strong>. For amd64 (x86-64), 
there are <strong>89 GBytes of binary packages</strong> available on the mirrors. Gentoo each week builds <strong>154
distinct <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/">installation stages</a></strong> for different processor architectures
and system configurations, with an overwhelming part of these fully up-to-date.</p>

<p><strong>The number of commits to the <a href="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/">main ::gentoo repository</a></strong>
has remained at an overall high level in 2025, with a slight decrease from <em>123942</em> to <em>112927</em>. 
The number of commits by external contributors was <em>9396</em>, now across <em>377</em> unique external authors.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU">GURU</a>, our user-curated repository with a trusted user model</strong>, 
as entry point for potential developers, has shown a decrease in activity.
We have had <em>5813</em> commits in 2025, compared to <em>7517</em> in 2024.
The number of contributors to GURU has increased, from <em>241</em> in 
2024 to <em>264</em> in 2025. Please join us there and help packaging the latest and 
greatest software. That’s the ideal preparation for becoming a Gentoo developer!</p>

<p>Activity has slowed down somewhat on the <strong>Gentoo bugtracker <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">bugs.gentoo.org</a></strong>, 
where we’ve had 20763 bug reports created in 2025, compared to 26123 in 2024. The number of resolved bugs 
shows the same trend, with 22395 in 2025 compared to 25946 in 2024. The current values are closer to those
of 2023 - but clearly this year we fixed more than we broke!</p>

<h2 id="new-developers">New developers</h2>

<p>In 2025 we have gained <strong>four new Gentoo developers</strong>. They are in chronological order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Jayofdoom">Jay Faulkner (jayf)</a></strong>:

Michael <a href="https://public-inbox.gentoo.org/gentoo-project/61af69b7-9bc8-44aa-8a13-359d15be1b9c@gentoo.org/T/#m67350f2a895898cef59e295ed28cbe8f2b0b43bc">joined 
us finally in June</a> from Austria, after already amassing over 9000 commits beforehand.
Michael works as Network Security Engineer for a big System House in Austria and likes
to go jogging regulary and hike the mountains on weekends. In Gentoo, he’s active in quality
control and cleanup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:APN-Pucky">Alexander Puck Neuwirth (apn-pucky)</a></strong>:

Alexander, a physics postdoc, <a href="https://public-inbox.gentoo.org/gentoo-project/87tt1jhst4.fsf@robot.e.airelinux.org/T/#m96e183e27e464fd7508eca5ae8721e03ec8c3e87">joined 
us in July</a> from Italy. At the intersection of Computer Science, Linux, and high-energy physics,
he already uses Gentoo to manage his code and sees it as a great development environment.
Beyond sci-physics, he’s also interested in continuous integration and RISC-V.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jaco Kroon (jkroon)</strong>:
<img height="45" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5144f854e6da57161798e7e931a1959d?s=45&amp;d=retro">

<h2 id="featured-changes-and-news">Featured changes and news</h2>

<p>Let’s now look at the major improvements and news of 2025 in Gentoo.</p>

<h3 id="distribution-wide-initiatives">Distribution-wide Initiatives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-codeberg.png">
<b>Goodbye Github, welcome Codeberg</b>: Mostly because of the continuous attempts to force Copilot usage
for our repositories, Gentoo currently considers and plans the migration of our repository mirrors and pull
request contributions to <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a>. Codeberg is a site based on 
<a href="https://forgejo.org/">Forgejo</a>, maintained by a non-profit organization, and located in Berlin, Germany. Gentoo
continues to host its own primary git, bugs, etc infrastructure and has no plans to change that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>EAPI 9</strong>: The wording for EAPI 9, a new version of the <a href="https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/latest/pms.pdf">specifications 
for our ebuilds</a>, has been finalized and approved, and support in Portage is complete.
<a href="https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/eapi/index.html#eapi-9">New features</a> in EAPI 9 include 
<em>pipestatus</em> for better error handling, an <em>edo</em> function for printing a command and executing it, a cleaner environment for the
build processes, and the possibility of declaring a default EAPI for the profile directory tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-fosdem-2025.png">
<b>Event presence</b>: At <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/">FOSDEM 2025</a> in Brussels, Gentoo has been present
once more with a stand, this year together with <a href="https://www.flatcar.org/">Flatcar Container Linux</a> (which 
is based on Gentoo). Naturally we had mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and of course the famous self-compiled buttons… 
Further, we have been present at 
<a href="https://www.froscon.org/">FrOSCon 2025</a> in Sankt Augustin with workshops
<a href="https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/3dd88e67-7e4e-42cc-8a51-85de837f1f45/"><i>Gentoo installation and 
configuration</i></a> and <a href="https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/cd1358e9-43c7-430f-982f-28f5b6dcc163/"><i>Writing 
your own ebuilds</i></a>. Last but not least, the toolchain team has represented Gentoo at the 
<a href="https://gnu-tools-cauldron.org/">GNU Tools Cauldron 2025</a> in Porto.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2024/logo-spi.png">
<b>SPI migration</b>: The migration of our financial structure to <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in 
the Public Interest (SPI)</a> is continuing slowly but steadily, with expense payments following the moving intake. 
If you are donating to Gentoo, and especially if you are a recurrent donor, please change your payments to be directed
to SPI; see also our <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/donate/">donation web page</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Online workshops</b>: Our German support, <a href="https://gentoo-ev.org/">Gentoo e.V.</a>, is grateful to the speakers
and participants of <a href="https://gentoo-ev.org/news/online-workshops-2025/">four online workshops</a> in 2025 
in German and English, on topics as varied as <i>EAPI 9</i> or <i>GnuPG and LibrePGP</i>. We are looking forward to more exciting 
events in 2026.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="architectures">Architectures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-riscv.png">
<b>RISC-V bootable QCOW2</b>:
Same as for amd64 and arm64, also for RISC-V we now have ready-made bootable disk images in QCOW2 format
<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/#riscv">available for download on our mirrors</a> in a console and
a cloud-init variant. The disk images use the rv64gc instruction set and the lp64d ABI, and can be booted via
the standard RISC-V UEFI support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-wsl.png">
<b>Gentoo for WSL</b>: We now publish weekly Gentoo images for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>, based on the amd64 stages, 
<a href="https://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-stage4-amd64-wsl-systemd/">see our mirrors</a>. 
While these images are not present in the Microsoft store yet, that’s something we intend to fix soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>hppa and sparc destabilized</b>: Since we do not have hardware readily available anymore and these architectures
mostly fill a retrocomputing niche, stable keywords have been dropped for both hppa (PA-RISC) and sparc.
The architectures will remain supported with testing keywords.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2022/logo-musl.png">
<b>musl with locales</b>: Localization support via the package 
<a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/musl-locales">sys-apps/musl-locales</a> has been added by default 
to the Gentoo stages based on the <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">lightweight musl C library</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="125" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/freepg-goose.png">
<b>GPG alternatives</b>: Given the unfortunate fracturing of the GnuPG / OpenPGP / LibrePGP ecosystem due to competing standards,
we now provide an alternatives mechanism to choose the system gpg provider and ease compatibility testing. At the moment, 
<a href="https://gnupg.org/">the original, unmodified GnuPG</a>, <a href="https://freepg.org/">the FreePG fork/patchset</a> 
as also used in many other Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian, Arch, …), and the re-implementation 
<a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/">Sequoia-PGP</a> with 
<a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-chameleon-gnupg#sequoias-reimplementation-of-the-gnupg-interface">Chameleon</a>
are available. In practice, implementation details vary between the providers, and while GnuPG and FreePG are fully supported,
you may still encounter difficulties when selecting Sequoia-PGP/Chameleon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>zlib-ng support:</strong> We have introduced initial support for using <a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng">zlib-ng</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/minizip-ng">minizip-ng</a> in compatibility mode in place of the reference zlib libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="85" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-steve.png">
<b>System-wide jobserver</b>: We have created <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Steve">steve</a>, an implementation of a
token-accounting system-wide jobserver, and introduced experimental global jobserver support in Portage. Thanks to that, it 
is now possible to globally control the concurrently running build job count, correctly accounting for parallel emerge jobs, 
make and ninja jobs, and other clients supporting the jobserver protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>NGINX rework</b>: The packaging of the <a href="https://nginx.org/">NGINX web server and reverse proxy</a> in Gentoo has 
undergone a major improvement, including also the splitting off of several third-party modules into separate packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-rust.png">
<b>C++ based Rust bootstrap</b>: We have added a bootstrap path for Rust from C++ using 
<a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc">Mutabah’s Rust compiler mrustc</a>, which alleviates the
need for pre-built binaries and makes it significantly easier to support more configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Ada and D bootstrap</b>: Similarly, Ada and D support in gcc now have clean bootstrap paths, which makes enabling these
in the compiler as easy as switching the useflags on gcc and running emerge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-flexiblas.png">
<b>FlexiBLAS</b>: Gentoo has adopted the new <a href="https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/flexiblas">FlexiBLAS wrapper
library</a> as the primary way of switching implementations of the BLAS numerical algorithm library at runtime.
This automatically also provides ABI stability for linking programs and bundles the specific treatment of different BLAS
variants in one place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Python</b>:
In the meantime the default Python version in Gentoo has reached Python 3.13. Additionally we have
also Python 3.14 available stable - fully up to date with upstream.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>KDE upgrades</b>: As of end of 2025, in Gentoo stable we have KDE Gear 25.08.3, KDE Frameworks 6.20.0, and 
KDE Plasma 6.5.4. As always, Gentoo testing follows the newest upstream releases (and using the KDE overlay you can even
install from git sources).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="physical-and-software-infrastructure">Physical and Software Infrastructure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Additional build server</b>: 
A second dedicated build server, hosted at Hetzner Germany, has been added to speed up the generation of installation
stages, iso and qcow2 images, and binary packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Documentation</b>: Documentation work has made constant progress on <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/">wiki.gentoo.org</a>. 
The Gentoo Handbook had some particularly useful updates, and the documentation received lots of improvements
and additions from the many active volunteers. There are currently 9,647 pages on the wiki, and there have been 766,731 
edits since the project started. Please <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Contributor%27s_guide">help 
Gentoo by contributing to documentation</a>!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finances-of-the-gentoo-foundation">Finances of the Gentoo Foundation</h3>

<ul>
  <li><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2023/dollar.jpg">
<b>Income</b>: The Gentoo Foundation took in $12,066 in fiscal year 2025 (ending 2025/06/30); the dominant part 
(over 80%) consists of individual cash donations from the community. On the SPI side, we received $8,471 
in the same period as fiscal year 2025; also here, this is all from small individual cash donations.</li>
  <li><strong>Expenses</strong>: Our expenses in 2025 were, program services (e.g. hosting costs) $8,332, management &amp; general (accounting)

	<p>I run Artix, by the way.  
</p>
<p>There. That's out of the way. I recently installed Linux on my main desktop computer and work laptop, overwriting the Windows partition completely. Essentially, I deleted the primary operating system from the two computers I use the most, day in and day out, instead trusting all of my personal and work computing needs to the Open Source community. This has been a <a href="https://betanews.com/2025/09/07/as-windows-10-reaches-end-of-life-windows-11-is-losing-market-share/" target="_blank">growing trend</a>, and I hopped on the bandwagon, but for good reasons. Some of those reasons might pertain to you and convince you to finally make the jump as well. Here's my experience.</p></div><div id="c15269001"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/copilot-spying-on-you.jpg" title="It feels like Copilot is always spying on you.

Anyone who has read one of those articles or watched one of those videos will know it boils down to two main issues: telemetry and poor software stability.  
</p>
<p>It's no secret that Windows 11 <a href="https://securelist.com/forensic-artifacts-in-windows-11/117680/" target="_blank">harvests data</a> like a pumpkin farmer in October, and there is no easy way (and sometimes no way at all) to stop it. The operating system itself acts exactly like what was called "spyware" a decade or so ago, pulling every piece of data it can about its current user. This data includes (but is far from limited to) hardware information, specific apps and software used, usage trends, and more. With the advent of AI, Microsoft made headlines with Copilot, an artificial assistant designed to help users by capturing their data with tools like Recall. It turns out that Copilot has largely been a flop and helps Microsoft (and data thieves) more than its users.</p></div></div><div id="c15247842"><div><p>The other main reason folks uninstall Windows is due to the overall poor software experience. Windows 11 has multiple settings modules to handle the same task (such as setting up networking or adding devices), and none of them seem to talk to each other. Additionally, each new update (which will eventually be forced upon you) seems to bring more bugs than fixes. Personally, I encountered 2-3 full system crashes a week when I ran Windows 11, and my hardware is fairly decent: AMD <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.589871.0.html" target="_self">Ryzen 7 6800H</a>, 32 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB PCIe NVMe drive. Still, a few times a week, my computer would freeze for a few seconds, the displays would go dark, and the PC would either restart or hang indefinitely.   
</p>
<p>After dealing with these issues and trying to solve them with workarounds, I dual-booted a Linux partition for a few weeks. After a Windows update (that I didn't choose to do) wiped that partition and, consequently, the Linux installation, I decided to go whole-hog: I deleted Windows 11 and used the entire drive for Linux.</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Linux-Windows-OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-logos.jpg" title="There are lots of Linux distros out there, but the overall experience is largely the same between them.

	<p>The first question often asked of Windows refugees migrating to Linux is, "Why Linux?" It's a good question, and one that needs to be asked before dumping Windows for anything else. Personally, I tried macOS first. The experience was smooth and easy but ultimately felt restrictive (installing from third-party developers, anyone?). Additionally, the only Apple computer I have is a 2014 MacBook Air. As such, the latest version of macOS I could actually run is 11 (Big Sur), which was released in 2020. Overall system operation was quite sluggish on the older hardware, and I knew that time would inevitably take its toll on the software experience — apps would soon be out of date and I wouldn't be able to update them. I also tried the OpenCore Legacy Patcher to push the laptop to macOS 13. While performance improved, key features like iMessage and Continuity Camera were either buggy or flat out refused to work. It felt like my laptop was running in mud with its hands tied behind its back. Plus, I needed something for my desktop. Not wanting to drop a mortgage payment or two on new hardware, I opted for Linux.  
</p>
<p>Linux promised me the potential of what I wanted - high hardware compatibility with full software freedom. The operating system can run on pretty much anything, and it grants users a huge amount of control over their system. I tried out a few ditributions, or distros, of Linux. A distro is like a "flavor" of Linux, and each one has unique factors (e.g., app/package management, bundled user interface). With most distros, these differences are largely irrelevant; most distros offer the same main packages as others.</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1" id="c15270364"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Linux-distro-journey83.png" title="Picking a Linux distro can be a long and winding journey.

I started this journey with some Linux experience under my belt; I have installed Linux on Chromebooks and old laptops (which I briefly referenced in <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Age-before-beauty-Why-a-decade-old-laptop-is-more-than-enough.858863.0.html" target="_self">this article</a>). Mint is considered a "just works" distro since it usually comes packaged with all the drivers and software most users would need. You can get to work within seconds of booting a fresh install without needing to fuss about in text files and the package manager. Mint was a nice experience, but it was a bit too bloated for my tastes (meaning it came with too much software preinstalled). I settled for Mint on my family's home theatre PC due to its stability and wide array of packages, and it hasn't failed us yet. For my own personal use, I wanted something a bit more "techy" and robust in terms of user features and system control.</p></div><div id="c15270363"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/artix-fastfetch-neofetch75.jpg" title="Artix gives users complete control over their system, for better or for worse.

(Image source: Fastfetch of own PC)</figcaption></figure></div><p>I tried out a few other distros, including Debian (which I ran on my work laptop and now use on the office PC at the coffee shop I own and manage), Bazzite, Fedora, and Void. These were all fine, save for Void — the XBPS repository of Void Linux was too sparse for what I needed, and driver compatibility was a big issue on my work laptop and home PC. I finally settled on Artix Linux, which is a derivative of Arch Linux. Artix has all the features and control of Arch, including the robust Arch User Repository for plenty of packages and applications. It is also a pretty lightweight distro in that it doesn't come with much out of the box. Artix differs from Arch in that it does not use SystemD as its init system. I won't go down the rabbit hole of init systems here, but suffice it to say that Artix boots lightning quick (less than 10 seconds from a cold power on) and is pretty light on system resources. However, it didn't come "fully assembled."</p></div><div id="c15274083"><div><p>My laptop is a 2014 MacBook Air, which is still a pretty solid machine. Unfortunately, Linux doesn't always play nice with Apple products. The biggest problem I ran into after installing Artix on the Air was the lack of wireless drivers, which meant that WiFi did not work out of the box. The resolution was simple: I needed to download the appropriate WiFi drivers (Broadcom drivers, to be exact) from Artix's main repository. This is a straightforward process handled by a single command in the Terminal, but it requires an internet connection... which my laptop did not have. Ultimately, I connected a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, plugged the laptop directly into my router, and installed the WiFi drivers that way. The whole process took about 10 minutes, but it was annoying nonetheless.  
</p>
<p>For the record, my desktop (an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H-based system) worked flawlessly out-of-the-box, even with my second monitor's uncommon resolution (1680x1050, vertical orientation). I did run into issues with installing some packages on both machines. Trying to install the KDE desktop environment (essentially a different GUI for the main OS) resulted in strange artifacts that put white text on white backgrounds in the menus, and every resolution I tried failed to correct this bug. After reverting to XFCE4 (the default desktop environment for my Artix install), the WiFi signal indicator in the taskbar disappeared. This led to me having to uninstall a network manager installed by KDE and re-linking the default network manager to the runit services startup folder. If that sentence sounds confusing, the process was much more so. It has been resolved, and I have a WiFi indicator that lets me select wireless networks again, but only after about 45 minutes of reading manuals and forum posts.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Artix-boxing-apple.png" title="Apple and Linux don't always play nicely together.

Not all games on Steam that are deemed Linux compatible actually are. <i>Civilization III Complete</i> is a good example: launching the game results in the map turning completely black. (Running the game through an application called Lutris resolved this issue.) Not all the software I used on Windows is available in Linux, such as Greenshot for screenshots or uMark for watermarking photos in bulk. There are alternatives to these, but they don't have the same features or require me to relearn workflows.</p></div><div id="c15282832"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/iPhone-loves-Linux93.png" title="Linux and iPhones can actually get along quite well, provided the right packages are used.

Android management is fairly straightforward due to how Android manages USB connections. An Android smartphone tends to be immediately recognized by Linux and act as a USB mass storage device. There's also ADB (Android Debugging Bridge) via the terminal for executing commands to an Android device. However, I use an iPhone. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Apple products and Linux don't always play together very well. This was certainly the case with my iPhone 13 Pro Max and Artix running the XFCE4 desktop environment. My phone would only charge when plugged in but wouldn't show up. I tried installing applications like KDE Connect, which promised to offer most of the same functions available between iPhones and Mac computers. Unfortunately, it was a no-go. But I found a solution in an unlikely place. 
</p>
<p>When I tried installing KDE (read above), it left the Dolphin file manager on my device. I started using Dolphin and preferred it to the default file manager for XFCE4 (Thunar). Dolphin held a pleasant surprise: it could detect my iPhone when it was plugged in. This made it a snap to transfer files to and from my phone as the file manager granted full file access to the iPhone. Due to how far Apple's file management has come on iOS, there were specific folders for each of my apps. The overall process is significantly easier than it was on Windows as iTunes is no longer needed.</p></div></div><div id="c15299297"><p>So why did I switch to Linux, and why am I writing this article about the experience? In a word: joy. I like using my computers again and find the experience fun. There's always something I can tweak or learn about how it operates. The fact that it runs faster than it did on Windows and is significantly more stable are huge bonuses.  
</p>
<p>There are lots of other points to discuss that would make this article more long-winded than it already is, so I will be brief on a few final specifics. Installing games via Steam is as simple as it is on any other OS, though compatibility will be a bit smaller than on Windows. Still, I've been able to play all of my Steam games (with the exception of <i>Civilization III</i> mentioned above) without any hiccups. In some cases, gameplay is a little bit smoother due to the lack of things like anticheat software running in the background.</p></div><div id="c15299300"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Conky48.jpg" title="Conky displays whatever system info you want and is highly customizable (if you have the technical know-how).

(Image source: Sam Medley - Notebookcheck)</figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Customization is a give and take and will vary based on your chosen desktop environment or window manager. I use XFCE4, which can be customized quite a bit but requires some technical knowledge to beautify. It supports a tool called Conky, which can display system information on your desktop. It is highly customizable but uses a typescript format in a config file to do so. 
</p>
<p>Power management is a bit wonky on Linux. My MacBook Air seems to last as long as it did with macOS (it's an old laptop, so the battery has worn down), but sometimes a rogue process will keep the machine from sleeping when the lid is closed. However, the lighter nature of Artix means the laptop's fan rarely ramps up. This is true of my desktop as well. 
</p>
<p>Transferring one's system configuration, including desktop and application settings, is as easy as transferring a single folder, so my MacBook can look exactly like my desktop (provided it has the same packages installed) with a simple drag-and-drop. The additional flexibility in choosing my computer's UI is unrivaled: if I don't like something in XFCE, I can either tweak the actual configuration file or just install a new environment (though this comes with risks, as mentioned above). 
</p>
<p>Overall system stability has been excellent. My computer hasn't crashed a single time, and I've never run into graphical issues rendering a black screen like I did with Windows 11.</p></div></div><div id="c15299301"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Tux.png" title="Tux, the mascot of Linux.

It is like any other operating system in that it will require users to learn its methods and quirks. Admittedly, it does require a little bit more technical knowledge to dive into the nitty-gritty of the OS and fully unlock its potential, but many distributions (such as Mint) are ready to go out of the box and may never require someone to open a command line. Our main media PC runs Mint and my younger children (aged 4 and 5 as of this writing) are able to navigate it without issue. My older kids are able to load games on it and play with Bluetooth controllers with no issue. 
</p>
<p>Personally, I like a bit of a challenge, and Linux balances usability with the carrot of a deeper computing experience. Depending on the distribution, I could have been up and running immediately after installation, but I wanted something more. The beauty of Linux is its flexibility; you can use a distribution that is as challenging or straightforward as you like.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Installing Linux not only saved three machines in my house (my laptop, desktop, and our media PC); it resurrected the joy of using a computer. It has been frustrating at times, but the rush of finally fixing a problem after a bit of work is unlike anything I felt on Windows. When I fix a problem on Windows, it's more of a shrug of the shoulder and relief that I'll no longer feel like I'm being stabbed in the eye. 
</p>
<p>I think that's because the issues I ran into on Linux were, for the most part, my fault. On Windows or macOS, most problems I run into are caused by a restriction or bug in the OS. Linux gives me the freedom to break my machine and fix it again, teaching me along the way. 
</p>
<p>With Microsoft's refusal (either from pride or ignorance) to improve (or at least not crapify) Windows 11 despite loud user outrage, switching to Linux is becoming a popular option. It's one you should consider doing, and if you've been thinking about it for any length of time, it's time to dive in.</p></div></div><div id="c15247735">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="158-" id="158-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 1 hour ago. 11169 views.  </span><pre>I love writing software, line by line. It could be said that my career was a continuous effort to create software well written, minimal, where the human touch was the fundamental feature. I also hope for a society where the last are not forgotten. Moreover, I don't want AI to economically succeed, I don't care if the current economic system is subverted (I could be very happy, honestly, if it goes in the direction of a massive redistribution of wealth). But, I would not respect myself and my intelligence if my idea of software and society would impair my vision: facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever.

In 2020 I left my job in order to write a novel about AI, universal basic income, a society that adapted to the automation of work facing many challenges. At the very end of 2024 I opened a YouTube channel focused on AI, its use in coding tasks, its potential social and economical effects. But while I recognized what was going to happen very early, I thought that we had more time before programming would be completely reshaped, at least a few years. I no longer believe this is the case. Recently, state of the art LLMs are able to complete large subtasks or medium size projects alone, almost unassisted, given a good set of hints about what the end result should be. The degree of success you'll get is related to the kind of programming you do (the more isolated, and the more textually representable, the better: system programming is particularly apt), and to your ability to create a mental representation of the problem to communicate to the LLM. But, in general, it is now clear that for most projects, writing the code yourself is no longer sensible, if not to have fun.

In the past week, just prompting, and inspecting the code to provide guidance from time to time, in a few hours I did the following four tasks, in hours instead of weeks:

1. I modified my linenoise library to support UTF-8, and created a framework for line editing testing that uses an emulated terminal that is able to report what is getting displayed in each character cell. Something that I always wanted to do, but it was hard to justify the work needed just to test a side project of mine. But if you can just describe your idea, and it materializes in the code, things are very different.

2. I fixed transient failures in the Redis test. This is very annoying work, timing related issues, TCP deadlock conditions, and so forth. Claude Code iterated for all the time needed to reproduce it, inspected the state of the processes to understand what was happening, and fixed the bugs.

3. Yesterday I wanted a pure C library that would be able to do the inference of BERT like embedding models. Claude Code created it in 5 minutes. Same output and same speed (15% slower) than PyTorch. 700 lines of code. A Python tool to convert the GTE-small model.

4. In the past weeks I operated changes to Redis Streams internals. I had a design document for the work I did. I tried to give it to Claude Code and it reproduced my work in, like, 20 minutes or less (mostly because I'm slow at checking and authorizing to run the commands needed).

It is simply impossible not to see the reality of what is happening. Writing code is no longer needed for the most part. It is now a lot more interesting to understand what to do, and how to do it (and, about this second part, LLMs are great partners, too). It does not matter if AI companies will not be able to get their money back and the stock market will crash. All that is irrelevant, in the long run. It does not matter if this or the other CEO of some unicorn is telling you something that is off putting, or absurd. Programming changed forever, anyway.

How do I feel, about all the code I wrote that was ingested by LLMs? I feel great to be part of that, because I see this as a continuation of what I tried to do all my life: democratizing code, systems, knowledge. LLMs are going to help us to write better software, faster, and will allow small teams to have a chance to compete with bigger companies. The same thing open source software did in the 90s.

However, this technology is far too important to be in the hands of a few companies. For now, you can do the pre-training better or not, you can do reinforcement learning in a much more effective way than others, but the open models, especially the ones produced in China, continue to compete (even if they are behind) with frontier models of closed labs. There is a sufficient democratization of AI, so far, even if imperfect. But: it is absolutely not obvious that it will be like that forever. I'm scared about the centralization. At the same time, I believe neural networks, at scale, are simply able to do incredible things, and that there is not enough "magic" inside current frontier AI for the other labs and teams not to catch up (otherwise it would be very hard to explain, for instance, why OpenAI, Anthropic and Google are so near in their results, for years now).

As a programmer, I want to write more open source than ever, now. I want to improve certain repositories of mine abandoned for time concerns. I want to apply AI to my Redis workflow. Improve the Vector Sets implementation and then other data structures, like I'm doing with Streams now.

But I'm worried for the folks that will get fired. It is not clear what the dynamic at play will be: will companies try to have more people, and to build more? Or will they try to cut salary costs, having fewer programmers that are better at prompting? And, there are other sectors where humans will become completely replaceable, I fear.

What is the social solution, then? Innovation can't be taken back after all. I believe we should vote for governments that recognize what is happening, and are willing to support those who will remain jobless. And, the more people get fired, the more political pressure there will be to vote for those who will guarantee a certain degree of protection. But I also look forward to the good AI could bring: new progress in science, that could help lower the suffering of the human condition, which is not always happy.

Anyway, back to programming. I have a single suggestion for you, my friend. Whatever you believe about what the Right Thing should be, you can't control it by refusing what is happening right now. Skipping AI is not going to help you or your career. Think about it. Test these new tools, with care, with weeks of work, not in a five minutes test where you can just reinforce your own beliefs. Find a way to multiply yourself, and if it does not work for you, try again every few months.

Yes, maybe you think that you worked so hard to learn coding, and now machines are doing it for you. But what was the fire inside you, when you coded till night to see your project working? It was building. And now you can build more and better, if you find your way to use AI effectively. The fun is still there, untouched.</pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It was originally designed by Anders Hejlsberg in 2012 and is currently developed and maintained by Microsoft as an open source project.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript compiles to JavaScript and can be executed in any JavaScript runtime (e.g., a browser or server Node.js).</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript supports multiple programming paradigms such as functional, generic, imperative, and object-oriented. TypeScript is neither an interpreted nor a compiled language.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why TypeScript?</h3><a id="user-content-why-typescript" aria-label="Permalink: Why TypeScript?" href="#why-typescript"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is a strongly typed language that helps prevent common programming mistakes and avoid certain kinds of run-time errors before the program is executed.</p>
<p dir="auto">A strongly typed language allows the developer to specify various program constraints and behaviors in the data type definitions, facilitating the ability to verify the correctness of the software and prevent defects. This is especially valuable in large-scale applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some of the benefits of TypeScript:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Static typing, optionally strongly typed</li>
<li>Type Inference</li>
<li>Access to ES6 and ES7 features</li>
<li>Cross-Platform and Cross-browser Compatibility</li>
<li>Tooling support with IntelliSense</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript and JavaScript</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-and-javascript" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript and JavaScript" href="#typescript-and-javascript"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is written in <code>.ts</code> or <code>.tsx</code> files, while JavaScript files are written in <code>.js</code> or <code>.jsx</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Files with the extension <code>.tsx</code> or <code>.jsx</code> can contain JavaScript Syntax Extension JSX, which is used in React for UI development.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015) in terms of syntax. All JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but the reverse is not always true.</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, consider a function in a JavaScript file with the <code>.js</code> extension, such as the following:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const sum = (a, b) => a + b;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The function can be converted and used in TypeScript by changing the file extension to <code>.ts</code>. However, if the same function is annotated with TypeScript types, it cannot be executed in any JavaScript runtime without compilation. The following TypeScript code will produce a syntax error if it is not compiled:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const sum = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span>: <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span>: <span>number</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript was designed to detect possible exceptions that can occur at runtime during compilation time by having the developer define the intent with type annotations. In addition, TypeScript can also catch issues if no type annotation is provided. For instance, the following code snippet does not specify any TypeScript types:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const items = [{ x: 1 }, { x: 2 }];
const result = items.filter(item => item.y);"><pre><span>const</span> <span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span> <span>x</span>: <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span>: <span>2</span> <span>}</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>item</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this case, TypeScript detects an error and reports:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Property 'y' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }'."><pre lang="text"><code>Property 'y' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }'.
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript's type system is largely influenced by the runtime behavior of JavaScript. For example, the addition operator (+), which in JavaScript can either perform string concatenation or numeric addition, is modeled in the same way in TypeScript:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const result = '1' + 1; // Result is of type string"><pre><span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>'1'</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Result is of type string</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The team behind TypeScript has made a deliberate decision to flag unusual usage of JavaScript as errors. For instance, consider the following valid JavaScript code:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const result = 1 + true; // In JavaScript, the result is equal 2"><pre><span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>// In JavaScript, the result is equal 2</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However, TypeScript throws an error:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Operator '+' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'boolean'."><pre lang="text"><code>Operator '+' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'boolean'.
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This error occurs because TypeScript strictly enforces type compatibility, and in this case, it identifies an invalid operation between a number and a boolean.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript Code Generation</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-code-generation" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript Code Generation" href="#typescript-code-generation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript compiler has two main responsibilities: checking for type errors and compiling to JavaScript. These two processes are independent of each other. Types do not affect the execution of the code in a JavaScript runtime, as they are completely erased during compilation. TypeScript can still output JavaScript even in the presence of type errors.
Here is an example of TypeScript code with a type error:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
const result = add('x', 'y'); // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'."><pre><span>const</span> <span>add</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span>: <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>)</span>: <span>number</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>,</span> <span>'y'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">However, it can still produce executable JavaScript output:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="'use strict';
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const result = add('x', 'y'); // xy"><pre><span>'use strict'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>add</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>,</span> <span>'y'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// xy</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is not possible to check TypeScript types at runtime. For example:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface Animal {
    name: string;
}
interface Dog extends Animal {
    bark: () => void;
}
interface Cat extends Animal {
    meow: () => void;
}
const makeNoise = (animal: Animal) => {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
        // 'Dog' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
        // ...
    }
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>Dog</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>bark</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>void</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>Cat</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>meow</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>void</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>makeNoise</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>animal</span>: <span>Animal</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>animal</span> <span>instanceof</span> <span>Dog</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// 'Dog' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As the types are erased after compilation, there is no way to run this code in JavaScript. To recognize types at runtime, we need to use another mechanism. TypeScript provides several options, with a common one being "tagged union". For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface Dog {
    kind: 'dog'; // Tagged union
    bark: () => void;
}
interface Cat {
    kind: 'cat'; // Tagged union
    meow: () => void;
}
type Animal = Dog | Cat;

const makeNoise = (animal: Animal) => {
    if (animal.kind === 'dog') {
        animal.bark();
    } else {
        animal.meow();
    }
};

const dog: Dog = {
    kind: 'dog',
    bark: () => console.log('bark'),
};
makeNoise(dog);"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>Dog</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>kind</span>: <span>'dog'</span><span>;</span> <span>// Tagged union</span>
    <span>bark</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>void</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>Cat</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>kind</span>: <span>'cat'</span><span>;</span> <span>// Tagged union</span>
    <span>meow</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>void</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dog</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cat</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>makeNoise</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>animal</span>: <span>Animal</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>animal</span><span>.</span><span>kind</span> <span>===</span> <span>'dog'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>animal</span><span>.</span><span>bark</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>animal</span><span>.</span><span>meow</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>const</span> <span>dog</span>: <span>Dog</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p dir="auto">The property "kind" is a value that can be used at runtime to distinguish between objects in JavaScript.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is also possible for a value at runtime to have a type different from the one declared in the type declaration. For instance, if the developer has misinterpreted an API type and annotated it incorrectly.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so the "class" keyword can be used as a type and value at runtime.</p>

<p dir="auto">In JavaScript, a "class" has a "prototype" property, and the "instanceof" operator can be used to test if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript has no effect on runtime performance, as all types will be erased. However, TypeScript does introduce some build time overhead.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Modern JavaScript Now (Downleveling)</h3><a id="user-content-modern-javascript-now-downleveling" aria-label="Permalink: Modern JavaScript Now (Downleveling)" href="#modern-javascript-now-downleveling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript can compile code to any released version of JavaScript since ECMAScript 3 (1999). This means that TypeScript can transpile code from the latest JavaScript features to older versions, a process known as Downleveling. This allows the usage of modern JavaScript while maintaining maximum compatibility with older runtime environments.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's important to note that during transpilation to an older version of JavaScript, TypeScript may generate code that could incur a performance overhead compared to native implementations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some of the modern JavaScript features that can be used in TypeScript:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>ECMAScript modules instead of AMD-style "define" callbacks or CommonJS "require" statements.</li>
<li>Classes instead of prototypes.</li>
<li>Variables declaration using "let" or "const" instead of "var".</li>
<li>"for-of" loop or ".forEach" instead of the traditional "for" loop.</li>
<li>Arrow functions instead of function expressions.</li>
<li>Destructuring assignment.</li>
<li>Shorthand property/method names and computed property names.</li>
<li>Default function parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">By leveraging these modern JavaScript features, developers can write more expressive and concise code in TypeScript.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Install-Package Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild"><pre>Install-Package Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">During the TypeScript installation, two executables are installed: "tsc" as the TypeScript compiler and "tsserver" as the TypeScript standalone server. The standalone server contains the compiler and language services that can be utilized by editors and IDEs to provide intelligent code completion.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, there are several TypeScript-compatible transpilers available, such as Babel (via a plugin) or swc. These transpilers can be used to convert TypeScript code into other target languages or versions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h3><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript can be configured using the tsc CLI options or by utilizing a dedicated configuration file called tsconfig.json placed in the root of the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">To generate a tsconfig.json file prepopulated with recommended settings, you can use the following command:</p>

<p dir="auto">When executing the <code>tsc</code> command locally, TypeScript will compile the code using the configuration specified in the nearest tsconfig.json file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples of CLI commands that run with the default settings:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="tsc main.ts // Compile a specific file (main.ts) to JavaScript
tsc src/*.ts // Compile any .ts files under the 'src' folder to JavaScript
tsc app.ts util.ts --outfile index.js // Compile two TypeScript files (app.ts and util.ts) into a single JavaScript file (index.js)"><pre>tsc main.ts // Compile a specific file (main.ts) to JavaScript
tsc src/<span>*</span>.ts // Compile any .ts files under the <span><span>'</span>src<span>'</span></span> folder to JavaScript
tsc app.ts util.ts --outfile index.js // Compile two TypeScript files (app.ts and util.ts) into a single JavaScript file (index.js)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript Configuration File</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-configuration-file" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript Configuration File" href="#typescript-configuration-file"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A tsconfig.json file is used to configure the TypeScript Compiler (tsc). Usually, it is added to the root of the project, together with the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>tsconfig.json accepts comments even if it is in json format.</li>
<li>It is advisable to use this configuration file instead of the command-line options.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">At the following link you can find the complete documentation and its schema:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig" rel="nofollow">https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/" rel="nofollow">https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following represents a list of the common and useful configurations:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">target</h4><a id="user-content-target" aria-label="Permalink: target" href="#target"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "target" property is used to specify which version of JavaScript ECMAScript version your TypeScript should emit/compile into. For modern browsers ES6 is a good option, for older browsers, ES5 is recommended.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">lib</h4><a id="user-content-lib" aria-label="Permalink: lib" href="#lib"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "lib" property is used to specify which library files to include at compilation time. TypeScript automatically includes APIs for features specified in the "target" property, but it is possible to omit or pick specific libraries for particular needs. For instance, if you are working on a server project, you could exclude the "DOM" library, which is useful only in a browser environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">strict</h4><a id="user-content-strict" aria-label="Permalink: strict" href="#strict"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "strict" property enables stronger guarantees and enhances type safety. It is advisable to always include this property in your project's tsconfig.json file. Enabling the "strict" property allows TypeScript to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Emit code using "use strict" for each source file.</li>
<li>Consider "null" and "undefined" in the type checking process.</li>
<li>Disable the usage of the "any" type when no type annotations are present.</li>
<li>Raise an error on the usage of the "this" expression, which would otherwise imply the "any" type.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">module</h4><a id="user-content-module" aria-label="Permalink: module" href="#module"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "module" property sets the module system supported for the compiled program. During runtime, a module loader is used to locate and execute dependencies based on the specified module system.</p>
<p dir="auto">The most common module loaders used in JavaScript are Node.js CommonJS for server-side applications and RequireJS for AMD modules in browser-based web applications. TypeScript can emit code for various module systems, including UMD, System, ESNext, ES2015/ES6, and ES2020.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: The module system should be chosen based on the target environment and the module loading mechanism available in that environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">moduleResolution</h4><a id="user-content-moduleresolution" aria-label="Permalink: moduleResolution" href="#moduleresolution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "moduleResolution" property specifies the module resolution strategy. Use "node" for modern TypeScript code, the "classic" strategy is used only for old versions of TypeScript (before 1.6).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">esModuleInterop</h4><a id="user-content-esmoduleinterop" aria-label="Permalink: esModuleInterop" href="#esmoduleinterop"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "esModuleInterop" property allows import default from CommonJS modules that did not export using the "default" property, this property provides a shim to ensure compatibility in the emitted JavaScript. After enabling this option we can use <code>import MyLibrary from "my-library"</code> instead of <code>import * as MyLibrary from "my-library"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">jsx</h4><a id="user-content-jsx" aria-label="Permalink: jsx" href="#jsx"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "jsx" property applies only to .tsx files used in ReactJS and controls how JSX constructs are compiled into JavaScript. A common option is "preserve" which will compile to a .jsx file keeping unchanged the JSX so it can be passed to different tools like Babel for further transformations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">skipLibCheck</h4><a id="user-content-skiplibcheck" aria-label="Permalink: skipLibCheck" href="#skiplibcheck"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "skipLibCheck'' property will prevent TypeScript from type-checking the entire imported third-party packages. This property will reduce the compile time of a project. TypeScript will still check your code against the type definitions provided by these packages.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">files</h4><a id="user-content-files" aria-label="Permalink: files" href="#files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "files" property indicates to the compiler a list of files that must always be included in the program.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">include</h4><a id="user-content-include" aria-label="Permalink: include" href="#include"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">The "include" property indicates to the compiler a list of files that we would like to include. This property allows glob-like patterns, such as "*<em>" for any subdirectory, "</em>" for any file name, and "?" for optional characters.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">exclude</h4><a id="user-content-exclude" aria-label="Permalink: exclude" href="#exclude"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The "exclude" property indicates to the compiler a list of files that should not be included in the compilation. This can include files such as "node_modules" or test files.
Note: tsconfig.json allows comments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">importHelpers</h3><a id="user-content-importhelpers" aria-label="Permalink: importHelpers" href="#importhelpers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript uses helper code when generating code for certain advanced or down-leveled JavaScript features. By default, these helpers are duplicated in files using them. The <code>importHelpers</code> option imports these helpers from the <code>tslib</code> module instead, making the JavaScript output more efficient.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Migration to TypeScript Advice</h3><a id="user-content-migration-to-typescript-advice" aria-label="Permalink: Migration to TypeScript Advice" href="#migration-to-typescript-advice"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For large projects, it is recommended to adopt a gradual transition where TypeScript and JavaScript code will initially coexist. Only small projects can be migrated to TypeScript in one go.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first step of this transition is to introduce TypeScript into the build chain process. This can be done by using the "allowJs" compiler option, which permits .ts and .tsx files to coexist with existing JavaScript files. As TypeScript will fall back to a type of "any" for a variable when it cannot infer the type from JavaScript files, it is recommended to disable "noImplicitAny" in your compiler options at the beginning of the migration.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second step is to ensure that your JavaScript tests work alongside TypeScript files so that you can run tests as you convert each module. If you are using Jest, consider using <code>ts-jest</code>, which allows you to test TypeScript projects with Jest.</p>
<p dir="auto">The third step is to include type declarations for third-party libraries in your project. These declarations can be found either bundled or on DefinitelyTyped. You can search for them using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/dt/search" rel="nofollow">https://www.typescriptlang.org/dt/search</a> and install them using:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install --save-dev @types/package-name"><pre>npm install --save-dev @types/package-name</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="yarn add --dev @types/package-name."><pre>yarn add --dev @types/package-name.</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The fourth step is to migrate module by module with a bottom-up approach, following your Dependency Graph starting with the leaves. The idea is to start converting Modules that do not depend on other Modules. To visualize the dependency graphs, you can use the "madge" tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">Good candidate modules for these initial conversions are utility functions and code related to external APIs or specifications. It is possible to automatically generate TypeScript type definitions from Swagger contracts, GraphQL or JSON schemas to be included in your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">When there are no specifications or official schemas available, you can generate types from raw data, such as JSON returned by a server. However, it is recommended to generate types from specifications instead of data to avoid missing edge cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">During the migration, refrain from code refactoring and focus only on adding types to your modules.</p>
<p dir="auto">The fifth step is to enable "noImplicitAny," which will enforce that all types are known and defined, providing a better TypeScript experience for your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">During the migration, you can use the <code>@ts-check</code> directive, which enables TypeScript type checking in a JavaScript file. This directive provides a loose version of type checking and can be initially used to identify issues in JavaScript files. When <code>@ts-check</code> is included in a file, TypeScript will try to deduce definitions using JSDoc-style comments. However, consider using JSDoc annotations only at a very early stage of the migration.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider keeping the default value of <code>noEmitOnError</code> in your tsconfig.json as false. This will allow you to output JavaScript source code even if errors are reported.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The TypeScript Language Service</h3><a id="user-content-the-typescript-language-service" aria-label="Permalink: The TypeScript Language Service" href="#the-typescript-language-service"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript Language Service, also known as tsserver, offers various features such as error reporting, diagnostics, compile-on-save, renaming, go to definition, completion lists, signature help, and more. It is primarily used by integrated development environments (IDEs) to provide IntelliSense support. It seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio Code and is utilized by tools like Conquer of Completion (Coc).</p>
<p dir="auto">Developers can leverage a dedicated API and create their own custom language service plugins to enhance the TypeScript editing experience. This can be particularly useful for implementing special linting features or enabling auto-completion for a custom templating language.</p>

<p dir="auto">An example of a real-world custom plugin is "typescript-styled-plugin", which provides syntax error reporting and IntelliSense support for CSS properties in styled components.</p>

<p dir="auto">For more information and quick start guides, you can refer to the official TypeScript Wiki on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/">https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Structural Typing</h3><a id="user-content-structural-typing" aria-label="Permalink: Structural Typing" href="#structural-typing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript is based on a structural type system. This means that the compatibility and equivalence of types are determined by the type's actual structure or definition, rather than its name or place of declaration, as in nominative type systems like C# or C.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript's structural type system was designed based on how JavaScript's dynamic duck typing system works during runtime.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following example is valid TypeScript code. As you can observe, "X" and "Y" have the same member "a," even though they have different declaration names. The types are determined by their structures, and in this case, since the structures are the same, they are compatible and valid.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};
type Y = {
    a: string;
};
const x: X = { a: 'a' };
const y: Y = x; // Valid"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>x</span>: <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>y</span>: <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> <span>// Valid</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">TypeScript Fundamental Comparison Rules</h3><a id="user-content-typescript-fundamental-comparison-rules" aria-label="Permalink: TypeScript Fundamental Comparison Rules" href="#typescript-fundamental-comparison-rules"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript comparison process is recursive and executed on types nested at any level.</p>
<p dir="auto">A type "X" is compatible with "Y" if "Y" has at least the same members as "X".</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;

<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, a type is a set of possible values. This set is also referred to as the domain of the type. Each value of a type can be viewed as an element in a set. A type establishes the constraints that every element in the set must satisfy to be considered a member of that set.
The primary task of TypeScript is to check and verify whether one set is a subset of another.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript supports various types of sets:</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>extends</code> keyword could be considered as a "subset of" in this context. It sets a constraint for a type. The extends used with a generic, take the generic as an infinite set and it will constrain it to a more specific type.
Please note that <code>extends</code> has nothing to do with hierarchy in a OOP sense (there is no this concept in TypeScript).
TypeScript works with sets and does not have a strict hierarchy, infact, as in the example below, two types could overlap without either being a subtype of the other type (TypeScript considers the structure, shape of the objects).</p>

<p dir="auto">A type can be assigned in different ways in TypeScript:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Declaration</h4><a id="user-content-type-declaration" aria-label="Permalink: Type Declaration" href="#type-declaration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the following example, we use x: X (": Type") to declare a type for the variable x.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};

// Type declaration
const x: X = {
    a: 'a',
};"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Type declaration</span>
<span>const</span> <span>x</span>: <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If the variable is not in the specified format, TypeScript will report an error. For instance:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};

const x: X = {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b', // Error: Object literal may only specify known properties
};"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>x</span>: <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span><span>,</span> <span>// Error: Object literal may only specify known properties</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Assertion</h4><a id="user-content-type-assertion" aria-label="Permalink: Type Assertion" href="#type-assertion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It is possible to add an assertion by using the <code>as</code> keyword. This tells the compiler that the developer has more information about a type and silences any errors that may occur.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = {
    a: string;
};
const x = {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b',
} as X;"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span> <span>as</span> <span>X</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the above example, the object x is asserted to have the type X using the as keyword. This informs the TypeScript compiler that the object conforms to the specified type, even though it has an additional property b not present in the type definition.</p>
<p dir="auto">Type assertions are useful in situations where a more specific type needs to be specified, especially when working with the DOM. For instance:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const myInput = document.getElementById('my_input') as HTMLInputElement;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>myInput</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'my_input'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>HTMLInputElement</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Here, the type assertion as HTMLInputElement is used to tell TypeScript that the result of getElementById should be treated as an HTMLInputElement.
Type assertions can also be used to remap keys, as shown in the example below with template literals:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type J<Type> = {
    [Property in keyof Type as `prefix_${string &amp;
        Property}`]: () => Type[Property];
};
type X = {
    a: string;
    b: number;
};
type Y = J<X>;"><pre><span>type</span> <span>J</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Type</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Property</span> <span>in</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>Type</span> <span>as</span> `prefix_${<span>string</span> <span>&amp;</span>
        <span>Property</span><span>}</span>`<span>]</span>: <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Type</span><span>[</span><span>Property</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>J</span><span>&lt;</span><span>X</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this example, the type <code>J&lt;Type&gt;</code> uses a mapped type with a template literal to remap the keys of Type. It creates new properties with a "prefix_" added to each key, and their corresponding values are functions returning the original property values.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is worth noting that when using a type assertion, TypeScript will not execute excess property checking. Therefore, it is generally preferable to use a Type Declaration when the structure of the object is known in advance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ambient Declarations</h4><a id="user-content-ambient-declarations" aria-label="Permalink: Ambient Declarations" href="#ambient-declarations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ambient declarations are files that describe types for JavaScript code, they have a file name format as <code>.d.ts.</code>. They are usually imported and used to annotate existing JavaScript libraries or to add types to existing JS files in your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">Many common libraries types can be found at:
<a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/">https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">and can be installed using:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm install --save-dev @types/library-name"><pre>npm install --save-dev @types/library-name</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For your defined Ambient Declarations, you can import using the "triple-slash" reference:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/// <reference path=&quot;./library-types.d.ts&quot; />"><pre><span>/// &lt;reference path="./library-types.d.ts" /&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can use Ambient Declarations even within JavaScript files using <code>// @ts-check</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>declare</code> keyword enables type definitions for existing JavaScript code without importing it, serving as a placeholder for types from another file or globally.</p>

<p dir="auto">Strict object literal checking, sometimes referred to as "freshness", is a feature in TypeScript that helps catch excess or misspelled properties that would otherwise go unnoticed in normal structural type checks.</p>
<p dir="auto">When creating an object literal, the TypeScript compiler considers it "fresh." If the object literal is assigned to a variable or passed as a parameter, TypeScript will throw an error if the object literal specifies properties that do not exist in the target type.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, "freshness" disappears when an object literal is widened or a type assertion is used.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples to illustrate:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = { a: string };
type Y = { a: string; b: string };

let x: X;
x = { a: 'a', b: 'b' }; // Freshness check: Invalid assignment

y = { a: 'a', bx: 'bx' }; // Freshness check: Invalid assignment

const fn = (x: X) => console.log(x.a);

fn(x);
fn(y); // Widening: No errors, structurally type compatible

fn({ a: 'a', bx: 'b' }); // Freshness check: Invalid argument

let c: X = { a: 'a' };
let d: Y = { a: 'a', b: '' };
c = d; // Widening: No Freshness check"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>a</span>: <span>string</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Inference</h3><a id="user-content-type-inference" aria-label="Permalink: Type Inference" href="#type-inference"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript can infer types when no annotation is provided during:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Variable initialization.</li>
<li>Member initialization.</li>
<li>Setting defaults for parameters.</li>
<li>Function return type.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = 'x'; // The type inferred is string"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>'x'</span><span>;</span> <span>// The type inferred is string</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The TypeScript compiler analyzes the value or expression and determines its type based on the available information.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">More Advanced Inferences</h3><a id="user-content-more-advanced-inferences" aria-label="Permalink: More Advanced Inferences" href="#more-advanced-inferences"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When multiple expressions are used in type inference, TypeScript looks for the "best common types." For instance:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = [1, 'x', 1, null]; // The type inferred is: (string | number | null)[]"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>'x'</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>// The type inferred is: (string | number | null)[]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If the compiler cannot find the best common types, it returns a union type. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = [new RegExp('x'), new Date()]; // Type inferred is: (RegExp | Date)[]"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span><span>(</span><span>'x'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type inferred is: (RegExp | Date)[]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript utilizes "contextual typing" based on the variable's location to infer types. In the following example, the compiler knows that <code>e</code> is of type <code>MouseEvent</code> because of the <code>click</code> event type defined in the lib.d.ts file, which contains ambient declarations for various common JavaScript constructs and the DOM:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="window.addEventListener('click', function (e) {}); // The inferred type of e is MouseEvent"><pre><span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// The inferred type of e is MouseEvent</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Type Widening</h3><a id="user-content-type-widening" aria-label="Permalink: Type Widening" href="#type-widening"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Type widening is the process in which TypeScript assigns a type to a variable initialized when no type annotation was provided. It allows narrow to wider types but not vice versa.
In the following example:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = 'x'; // TypeScript infers as string, a wide type
let y: 'y' | 'x' = 'y'; // y types is a union of literal types
y = x; // Invalid Type 'string' is not assignable to type '&quot;x&quot; | &quot;y&quot;'."><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>'x'</span><span>;</span> <span>// TypeScript infers as string, a wide type</span>
<span>let</span> <span>y</span>: <span>'y'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'x'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'y'</span><span>;</span> <span>// y types is a union of literal types</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> <span>// Invalid Type 'string' is not assignable to type '"x" | "y"'.</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript assigns <code>string</code> to <code>x</code> based on the single value provided during initialization (<code>x</code>), this is an example of widening.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript provides ways to have control of the widening process, for instance using "const".</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Const</h3><a id="user-content-const" aria-label="Permalink: Const" href="#const"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using the <code>const</code> keyword when declaring a variable results in a narrower type inference in TypeScript.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const x = 'x'; // TypeScript infers the type of x as 'x', a narrower type
let y: 'y' | 'x' = 'y';
y = x; // Valid: The type of x is inferred as 'x'"><pre><span>const</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>'x'</span><span>;</span> <span>// TypeScript infers the type of x as 'x', a narrower type</span>
<span>let</span> <span>y</span>: <span>'y'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'x'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'y'</span><span>;</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span> <span>// Valid: The type of x is inferred as 'x'</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">By using <code>const</code> to declare the variable x, its type is narrowed to the specific literal value 'x'. Since the type of x is narrowed, it can be assigned to the variable y without any error.
The reason the type can be inferred is because <code>const</code> variables cannot be reassigned, so their type can be narrowed down to a specific literal type, in this case, the literal type 'x'.</p>

<p dir="auto">From version 5.0 of TypeScript, it is possible to specify the <code>const</code> attribute on a generic type parameter. This allows for inferring the most precise type possible. Let's see an example without using <code>const</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function identity<T>(value: T) {
    // No const here
    return value;
}
const values = identity({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }); // Type infered is: { a: string; b: string; }"><pre><span>function</span> <span>identity</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// No const here</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type infered is: { a: string; b: string; }</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As you can see, the properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are inferred with a type of <code>string</code>   .</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, let's see the difference with the <code>const</code> version:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function identity<const T>(value: T) {
    // Using const modifier on type parameters
    return value;
}
const values = identity({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }); // Type infered is: { a: &quot;a&quot;; b: &quot;b&quot;; }"><pre><span>function</span> <span>identity</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Using const modifier on type parameters</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>identity</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span>: <span>'b'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type infered is: { a: "a"; b: "b"; }</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now we can see that the properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are inferred as <code>const</code>, so <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are treated as string literals rather than just <code>string</code> types.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Const assertion</h4><a id="user-content-const-assertion" aria-label="Permalink: Const assertion" href="#const-assertion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This feature allows you to declare a variable with a more precise literal type based on its initialization value, signifying to the compiler that the value should be treated as an immutable literal. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p dir="auto">On a single property:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const v = {
    x: 3 as const,

<p dir="auto">Type Narrowing is the process in TypeScript where a general type is narrowed down to a more specific type. This occurs when TypeScript analyzes the code and determines that certain conditions or operations can refine the type information.</p>
<p dir="auto">Narrowing types can occur in different ways, including:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conditions</h4><a id="user-content-conditions" aria-label="Permalink: Conditions" href="#conditions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">By using conditional statements, such as <code>if</code> or <code>switch</code>, TypeScript can narrow down the type based on the outcome of the condition. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x: number | undefined = 10;

if (x !== undefined) {
    x += 100; // The type is number, which had been narrowed by the condition
}"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>!==</span> <span>undefined</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span> <span>// The type is number, which had been narrowed by the condition</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Throwing or returning</h4><a id="user-content-throwing-or-returning" aria-label="Permalink: Throwing or returning" href="#throwing-or-returning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Throwing an error or returning early from a branch can be used to help TypeScript narrow down a type. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x: number | undefined = 10;

if (x === undefined) {
    throw 'error';
}
x += 100;"><pre><span>let</span> <span>x</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
<span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Other ways to narrow down types in TypeScript include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>instanceof</code> operator: Used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class.</li>
<li><code>in</code> operator: Used to check if a property exists in an object.</li>

<p dir="auto">The <code>any</code> data type represents literally "any" value, it is the default value when TypeScript cannot infer the type or is not specified.</p>
<p dir="auto">When using <code>any</code> TypeScript compiler skips the type checking so there is no type safety when <code>any</code> is being used. Generally do not use <code>any</code> to silence the compiler when an error occurs, instead focus on fixing the error as with using <code>any</code>  it is possible to break contracts and we lose the benefits of TypeScript autocomplete.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>any</code> type could be useful during a gradual migration from JavaScript to TypeScript, as it can silence the compiler.</p>
<p dir="auto">For new projects use TypeScript configuration <code>noImplicitAny</code> which enables TypeScript to issue errors where <code>any</code> is used or inferred.</p>

<p dir="auto">TypeScript does a good job of inferring types, especially when simple one, so these declarations in most cases are not necessary.</p>
<p dir="auto">On functions is possible to add type annotations to parameters:</p>

<p dir="auto">This is useful especially for  more complex functions as writing expliciting the return type before an implementation can help better think about the function.</p>

<p dir="auto">A Literal Type is a single element set from a collective type, it defines a very exact value that is a JavaScript primitive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Literal Types in TypeScript are numbers, strings, and booleans.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example of literals:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const a = 'a'; // String literal type
const b = 1; // Numeric literal type
const c = true; // Boolean literal type"><pre><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'a'</span><span>;</span> <span>// String literal type</span>
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// Numeric literal type</span>
<span>const</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>// Boolean literal type</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">String, Numeric, and Boolean Literal Types are used in the union, type guard, and type aliases.
In the following example you can see a type alias union, <code>O</code> can be the only value specified and not any other string:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type O = 'a' | 'b' | 'c';"><pre><span>type</span> <span>O</span> <span>=</span> <span>'a'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'b'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'c'</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Literal Inference</h2><a id="user-content-literal-inference" aria-label="Permalink: Literal Inference" href="#literal-inference"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Literal Inference is a feature in TypeScript that allows the type of a variable or parameter to be inferred based on its value.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the following example we can see that TypeScript considers <code>x</code> a literal type as the value cannot be changed any time later, when instead <code>y</code> is inferred as string as it can be modified any time later.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const x = 'x'; // Literal type of 'x', because this value cannot be changed
let y = 'y'; // Type string, as we can change this value"><pre><span>const</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>'x'</span><span>;</span> <span>// Literal type of 'x', because this value cannot be changed</span>
<span>let</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>'y'</span><span>;</span> <span>// Type string, as we can change this value</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In the following example we can see that <code>o.x</code> was inferred as a <code>string</code> (and not a literal of <code>a</code>) as TypeScript considers that the value can be changed any time later.</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type X = 'a' | 'b';

let o = {
    x: 'a', // This is a wider string
};

const fn = (x: X) => `${x}-foo`;

console.log(fn(o.x)); // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'X'"><pre><span>type</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>'a'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'b'</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>o</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>// This is a wider string</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>X</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>`<span><span>${</span><span>x</span><span>}</span></span>-foo`</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto">As you can see the code throws an error when passing <code>o.x</code> to <code>fn</code> as X is a narrower type.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can solve this issue by using type assertion using <code>const</code> or the <code>X</code> type:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let o = {

Const Enums have hardcoded values, erasing the Enum, which can be more efficient in self-contained libraries but is generally not desirable. Also, Const enums cannot have computed members.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reverse mapping</h3><a id="user-content-reverse-mapping" aria-label="Permalink: Reverse mapping" href="#reverse-mapping"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, reverse mappings in Enums refer to the ability to retrieve the Enum member name from its value. By default, Enum members have forward mappings from name to value, but reverse mappings can be created by explicitly setting values for each member. Reverse mappings are useful when you need to look up an Enum member by its value, or when you need to iterate over all the Enum members. Note that only numeric enums members will generate reverse mappings, while String Enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.</p>

<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, object types describe the shape of an object. They specify the names and types of the object's properties, as well as whether those properties are required or optional.</p>
<p dir="auto">In TypeScript, you can define object types in two primary ways:</p>
<p dir="auto">Interface which defines the shape of an object by specifying the names, types, and optionality of its properties.</p>

    <span>email</span>?: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Type alias, similar to an interface, defines the shape of an object. However, it can also create a new custom type that is based on an existing type or a combination of existing types. This includes defining union types, intersection types, and other complex types.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>any</code> type is a special type (universal supertype) that can be used to represent any type of value (primitives, objects, arrays, functions, errors, symbols). It is often used in situations where the type of a value is not known at compile time, or when working with values from external APIs or libraries that do not have TypeScript typings.</p>
<p dir="auto">By utilizing <code>any</code> type, you are indicating to the TypeScript compiler that values should be represented without any limitations. In order to maximizing type safety in your code consider the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Limit the usage of <code>any</code> to specific cases where the type is truly unknown.</li>
<li>Do not return <code>any</code> types from a function as you will lose type safety in the code using that function weakening your type safety.</li>
<li>Instead of <code>any</code> use <code>@ts-ignore</code> if you need to silence the compiler.</li>

<p dir="auto"><code>interface InterfaceName</code> or <code>type TypeName</code>: Defines the name of the interface.
<code>property1</code>: <code>Type1</code>: Specifies the properties of the interface along with their corresponding types. Multiple properties can be defined, each separated by a semicolon.

<p dir="auto">Merging and extension refer to two different concepts related to working with types and interfaces.</p>
<p dir="auto">Merging allows you to combine multiple declarations of the same name into a single definition, for example, when you define an interface with the same name multiple times:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface X {
    a: string;
}

interface X {
    b: number;
}

const person: X = {
    a: 'a',
    b: 7,
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>X</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>interface</span> <span>X</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>number</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> <span>person</span>: <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span>: <span>'a'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>b</span>: <span>7</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Extension refers to the ability to extend or inherit from existing types or interfaces to create new ones. It is a mechanism to add additional properties or methods to an existing type without modifying its original definition. Example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface Animal {
    name: string;
    eat(): void;
}

interface Bird extends Animal {
    sing(): void;
}

const dog: Bird = {
    name: 'Bird 1',
    eat() {
        console.log('Eating');
    },
    sing() {
        console.log('Singing');
    },
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>Animal</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>name</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eat</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>: <span><span>void</span></span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto">Declaration merging (augmentation):</p>
<p dir="auto">Interfaces support declaration merging, which means that you can define multiple interfaces with the same name, and TypeScript will merge them into a single interface with the combined properties and methods. On the other hand, types do not support declaration merging. This can be helpful when you want to add extra functionality or customize existing types without modifying the original definitions or patching missing or incorrect types.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface A {
    x: string;
}
interface A {
    y: string;
}
const j: A = {
    x: 'xx',
    y: 'yy',
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>j</span>: <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>y</span>: <span>'yy'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Extending other types/interfaces:</p>
<p dir="auto">Both types and interfaces can extend other types/interfaces, but the syntax is different. With interfaces, you use the <code>extends</code> keyword to inherit properties and methods from other interfaces. However, an interface cannot extend a complex type like a union type.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface A {
    x: string;
    y: number;
}
interface B extends A {
    z: string;
}
const car: B = {
    x: 'x',
    y: 123,
    z: 'z',
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    <span>y</span>: <span>number</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>interface</span> <span>B</span> <span>extends</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>z</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>car</span>: <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>'x'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span>: <span>123</span><span>,</span>
    <span>z</span>: <span>'z'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For types, you use the &amp; operator to combine multiple types into a single type (intersection).</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="interface A {
    x: string;
    y: number;
}

type B = A &amp; {
    j: string;
};

const c: B = {
    x: 'x',
    y: 123,
    j: 'j',
};"><pre><span>interface</span> <span>A</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    <span>y</span>: <span>number</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>j</span>: <span>string</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>c</span>: <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>x</span>: <span>'x'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>y</span>: <span>123</span><span>,</span>
    <span>j</span>: <span>'j'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Union and Intersection Types:</p>
<p dir="auto">Types are more flexible when it comes to defining Union and Intersection Types. With the <code>type</code> keyword, you can easily create union types using the <code>|</code> operator and intersection types using the <code>&amp;</code> operator. While interfaces can also represent union types indirectly, they don't have built-in support for intersection types.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type Department = 'dep-x' | 'dep-y'; // Union

type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};

type Employee = {
    id: number;
    department: Department;
};

type EmployeeInfo = Person &amp; Employee; // Intersection"><pre><span>type</span> <span>Department</span> <span>=</span> <span>'dep-x'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'dep-y'</span><span>;</span> <span>// Union</span>

<p dir="auto">The <code>class</code> keyword is used to define a class named "Person".</p>
<p dir="auto">The class has two private properties: name of type <code>string</code> and age of type <code>number</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The constructor is defined using the <code>constructor</code> keyword. It takes name and age as parameters and assigns them to the corresponding properties.</p>
<p dir="auto">The class has a <code>public</code> method named sayHi that logs a greeting message.</p>
<p dir="auto">To create an instance of a class in TypeScript, you can use the <code>new</code> keyword followed by the class name, followed by parentheses <code>()</code>. For instance:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const myObject = new Person('John Doe', 25);
myObject.sayHi(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 25 years old."><pre><span>const</span> <span>myObject</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>'John Doe'</span><span>,</span> <span>25</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto">Access Modifiers <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, and <code>public</code> are used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members, such as properties and methods, in TypeScript classes. These modifiers are essential for enforcing encapsulation and establishing boundaries for accessing and modifying the internal state of a class.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>private</code> modifier restricts access to the class member only within the containing class.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>protected</code> modifier allows access to the class member within the containing class and its derived classes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>public</code> modifier provides unrestricted access to the class member, allowing it to be accessed from anywhere."</p>

<p dir="auto">For TypeScript versions prior to 5, they should be enabled using the <code>experimentalDecorators</code> property in your <code>tsconfig.json</code> or by using <code>--experimentalDecorators</code> in your command line (but the following example won't work).</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>class</code> keyword in TypeScript, similar to JavaScript, is often referred to as syntactic sugar. It was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to offer a more familiar syntax for creating and working with objects in a class-based manner. However, it's important to note that TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, ultimately compiles down to JavaScript, which remains prototype-based at its core.</p>

<p dir="auto">JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript or TypeScript files. It is commonly used in React to define the HTML structure.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript extends the capabilities of JSX by providing type checking and static analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use JSX you need to set the <code>jsx</code> compiler option in your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. Two common configuration options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>"preserve": emit .jsx files with the JSX unchanged. This option tells TypeScript to keep the JSX syntax as-is and not transform it during the compilation process. You can use this option if you have a separate tool, like Babel, that handles the transformation.</li>
<li>"react": enables TypeScript's built-in JSX transformation. React.createElement will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All options are available here:

<p dir="auto">Node.js added support for ECMAScript Modules starting from version 15.3.0, and TypeScript has had ECMAScript Module Support for Node.js since version 4.7. This support can be enabled by using the <code>module</code> property with the value <code>nodenext</code> in the tsconfig.json file. Here's an example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{

    <span>"declaration"</span>: <span>true</span>
  }
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Node.js supports two file extensions for modules: <code>.mjs</code> for ES modules and <code>.cjs</code> for CommonJS modules. The equivalent file extensions in TypeScript are <code>.mts</code> for ES modules and <code>.cts</code> for CommonJS modules. When the TypeScript compiler transpiles these files to JavaScript, it will create <code>.mjs</code> and <code>.cjs</code> files.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use ES modules in your project, you can set the <code>type</code> property to "module" in your package.json file. This instructs Node.js to treat the project as an ES module project.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, TypeScript also supports type declarations in .d.ts files. These declaration files provide type information for libraries or modules written in TypeScript, allowing other developers to utilize them with TypeScript's type checking and auto-completion features.</p>

<p dir="auto">Assertion functions share similarities with type guards. Type guards were initially introduced to perform runtime checks and ensure the type of a value within a specific scope.
Specifically, a type guard is a function that evaluates a type predicate and returns a boolean value indicating whether the predicate is true or false. This differs slightly from assertion functions,where the intention is to throw an error rather than returning false when the predicate is not satisfied.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example of type guard:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const isNumber = (value: unknown): value is number => typeof value === 'number';"><pre><span>const</span> <span>isNumber</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span>: <span>unknown</span><span>)</span>: <span>value</span> is <span>number</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>typeof</span> <span>value</span> <span>===</span> <span>'number'</span><span>;</span></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Variadic Tuple Types are a features introduces in TypeScript version 4.0, let’s start to learn them by revise what is a tuple:</p>
<p dir="auto">A tuple type is an array which has a defined length, and were the type of each element is known:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type Student = [string, number];
const [name, age]: Student = ['Simone', 20];"><pre><span>type</span> <span>Student</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto">The term "variadic" means indefinite arity (accept a variable number of arguments).</p>
<p dir="auto">A variadic tuple is a tuple type which has all the property as before but the exact shape is not defined yet:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type Bar<T extends unknown[]> = [boolean, ...T, number];

type A = Bar<[boolean]>; // [boolean, boolean, number]
type B = Bar<['a', 'b']>; // [boolean, 'a', 'b', number]
type C = Bar<[]>; // [boolean, number]"><pre><span>type</span> <span>Bar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>unknown</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>boolean</span><span>,</span> ...<span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

<span>type</span> <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>[</span><span>boolean</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span> <span>// [boolean, boolean, number]</span>

<p dir="auto">In the previous code we can see that the tuple shape is defined by the <code>T</code> generic passed in.</p>
<p dir="auto">Variadic tuples can accept multiple generics make them very flexible:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type Bar<T extends unknown[], G extends unknown[]> = [...T, boolean, ...G];

type A = Bar<[number], [string]>; // [number, boolean, string]
type B = Bar<['a', 'b'], [boolean]>; // [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, boolean, boolean]"><pre><span>type</span> <span>Bar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>unknown</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>G</span> <span>extends</span> <span>unknown</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>...<span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>boolean</span><span>,</span> ...<span>G</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto">With the new variadic tuples we can use:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The spreads in tuple type syntax can now be generic, so we can represent higher-order operation on tuples and arrays even when we do not know the actual types we are operating over.</li>
<li>The rest elements can occur anywhere in a tuple.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Boxed types</h3><a id="user-content-boxed-types" aria-label="Permalink: Boxed types" href="#boxed-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Boxed types refer to the wrapper objects that are used to represent primitive types as objects. These wrapper objects provide additional functionality and methods that are not available directly on the primitive values.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you access a method like <code>charAt</code> or <code>normalize</code> on a <code>string</code> primitive, JavaScript wraps it in a <code>String</code> object, calls the method, and then throws the object away.</p>
<p dir="auto">Demonstration:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const originalNormalize = String.prototype.normalize;
String.prototype.normalize = function () {

<p dir="auto">TypeScript represents this differentiation by providing separate types for the primitives and their corresponding object wrappers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>string =&gt; String</li>
<li>number =&gt; Number</li>
<li>boolean =&gt; Boolean</li>
<li>symbol =&gt; Symbol</li>
<li>bigint =&gt; BigInt</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The boxed types are usually not needed. Avoid using boxed types and instead use type for the primitives,  for instance <code>string</code> instead of <code>String</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Covariance and Contravariance are used to describe how relationships work when dealing with inheritance or assignment of types.</p>
<p dir="auto">Covariance means that a type relationship preserves the direction of inheritance or assignment, so if a type A is a subtype of type B, then an array of type A is also considered a subtype of an array of type B. The important thing to note here is that the subtype relationship is maintained this means that Covariance accept subtype but doesn't accept supertype.</p>
<p dir="auto">Contravariance means that a type relationship reverses the direction of inheritance or assignment, so if a type A is a subtype of type B, then an array of type B is considered a subtype of an array of type A. The subtype relationship is reversed this means that Contravariance accept supertype but doesn't accept subtype.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notes: Bivariance means accept both supertype &amp; subtype.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example: Let's say we have a space for all animals and a separate space just for dogs.</p>
<p dir="auto">In Covariance, you can put all the dogs in the animals space because dogs are a type of animal. But you cannot put all the animals in the dog space because there might be other animals mixed in.</p>
<p dir="auto">In Contravariance, you cannot put all the animals in the dogs space because the animals space might contain other animals as well. However, you can put all the dogs in the animal space because all dogs are also animals.</p>

<p dir="auto">Type-Only Imports and Export allows you to import or export types without importing or exporting the values or functions associated with those types. This can be useful for reducing the size of your bundle.</p>
<p dir="auto">To use type-only imports, you can use the <code>import type</code> keyword.</p>
<p dir="auto">TypeScript permits using both declaration and implementation file extensions (.ts, .mts, .cts, and .tsx) in type-only imports, regardless of <code>allowImportingTsExtensions</code> settings.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import type { House } from './house.ts';"><pre><span>import</span> <span>type</span> <span>{</span> <span>House</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./house.ts'</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The following are supported forms:</p>

<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import type T from './mod';
import type { A, B } from './mod';
import type * as Types from './mod';
export type { T };
export type { T } from './mod';"><pre><span>import</span> <span>type</span> <span>T</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./mod'</span><span>;</span>

<p dir="auto">A <code>using</code> declaration is a block-scoped, immutable binding, similar to <code>const</code>, used for managing disposable resources. When initialized with a value, the <code>Symbol.dispose</code> method of that value is recorded and subsequently executed upon exiting the enclosing block scope.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is based on ECMAScript's Resource Management feature, which is useful for performing essential cleanup tasks after object creation, such as closing connections, deleting files, and releasing memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Due to its recent introduction in TypeScript version 5.2, most runtimes lack native support. You'll need polyfills for: <code>Symbol.dispose</code>, <code>Symbol.asyncDispose</code>, <code>DisposableStack</code>, <code>AsyncDisposableStack</code>, <code>SuppressedError</code>.</li>
<li>Additionally, you will need to configure your tsconfig.json as follows:</li>

But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.</p><p>Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.</p><p>Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.</p><p>More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.</p><p>Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. "I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying," he recalled.

But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a "house of cards".</p><p>To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.</p><p>We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was "degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.</p><p>The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.</p><p>Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.</p><p>"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated," said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. "There's all these different levels."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f2c/live/c77b7440-ec79-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Grey line "></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy.

All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.</p><p>And the mystery disease got a name: the "New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause".

Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling "flabbergasted" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a "diarrhea of symptoms".</p><p>Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.</p><p>He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said.

Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full "boots-on-the-ground" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p>But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. "Everybody received that email like a cold shower," he said.</p><p>None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.</p><p>But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.</p><p>"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking," Lanteigne said.

The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.</p><p>At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. "He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'."</p><p>Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p>"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that."</p><p>Marrero declined to discuss it. "Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment."</p><p>In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. "Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations," wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network.

Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. "I think I waited four months for that letter," Strickland recalled. "I kept phoning and asking."</p><p>Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero "did nothing for April," Strickland said. "I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients," he said.</p><p>Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.</p><p>Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. "It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero," she recalled. "Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time."</p><p>But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness.

"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND," Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. "And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me," she said.

When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.</p><p>"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet," stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. "He told her that she wasn't alone."</p><p>There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.</p><p>After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.</p><p>The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.</p><p>A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.</p><p>The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.</p><p>"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems," said her father Andre, angrily.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans.

He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back.

The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.</p><p>Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people "co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda".</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96aa/live/bcdfb3f0-e44c-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Lang stands outside the neurology centre where he works, in Toronto, looking down at the camera in a white lab coat.

JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised.

He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. "As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly," he said.

Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. "Lives hang in the balance," read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. "It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them," the letter said. "Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history."</p><p>The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.</p><p>Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. "I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty," she said.</p><p>Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.</p><p>"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families," Lang said.</p><p>"I would even go further," Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. "I would say they are being abused."</p><p>Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.</p><p>And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.</p><p>"It has to be a patient complaint," they said. "And all his patients love him."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f5d/live/040c5e10-ec7a-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="grey line "></p></div></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This morning I woke up and headed to my bomb shelter to grab the bike pump to inflate the tyres on my children’s bikes. The handle got slightly tangled up in the fibre optic cables so I lifted up the cables to free the pump.</p><p>Like cookie crumbs the fibre cable’s sleeve jackets crumbled in my hands.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/fibre_jacket_crumbling.jpg" width="" height="" alt="fibre no more"></p><hr><p>Before I could even utter “Oh fuck no”, another section of the cable exploded outwards with thin metal wires jutting out from what seems to be like strands of white plastic threads, which I assume is the Kevlar sheath. I think I must have stood in my pseudo server room in shock for a whole minute, unable to move or process what had happened. A main component of why I was in sheer horror was the fact that I had stupidly buried all of these cables under my cement flooring in PVC trunking from my shelter to all of the rooms in the flat. If this cable fails, the connection from the server room to a specific room would be permanently severed. The room for this particular cable turned out to be my home office where my homelab MS-A2 resided.</p><p>I had purchased these cables from <a href="https://www.fs.com/sg/products/70220.html">FS.com</a> roughly 3.5 years ago in 2022. Because I was burying the cables underground permanently, I opted to get the <strong>MiLiTaRy GrAdE</strong> armoured fibre cables for this purpose.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/original_order.png" width="" height="" alt="MILITARY GRADE"></p><hr><p>The cables had been kept spooled up with a radius of around 5cm for 3 whole years, lightly tied together with hook and loop cable fasteners and hung on laundry hooks in the shelter all this time.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/organisation.jpg" width="" height="" alt="How cables were stored"></p><hr><p>The destroyed cable is the only one that I had unravelled recently to patch into my UDM to enable SFP+ connection to my office space. As it turns out, armoured cables in this specific instance aren’t really meant for movement, it’s likely more of a bury and forget purpose. In hindsight I should’ve connected all of the cables to a fibre patch panel on the wall so that they would never move, then connect the patch panel to my UDM with easily replaceable LSZH cables.</p><p>But it’s too late now, all I can do is to salvage the situation. I headed out and purchased 3M self-bonding rubber electrical tape 23, and Temflex 160 vinyl electrical tape. The idea I had was to use the compression properties of the stretched rubber tape to hold the corrugated metal sheath and wire mesh in place, before wrapping a second vinyl protection layer outside with the 160.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/wrap.jpg" width="" height="" alt="wrapping away"></p><hr><p>However, the wrapping process itself requires me to slowly shift the cable around to hook onto higher ground to prevent kinks. The action itself triggered more jacket failures. Some of the failures actually forced the cable in a sharp right angle, which I am almost certain has caused kinks and cracks in the inner fibre strand. RIP.</p><hr><p><img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/shit.jpg" width="" height="" alt="shit">

<img src="https://alienchow.dev/images/fibre_disintegration/shit_shit_shit.jpg" width="" height="" alt="shit shit shit"></p><hr><p>At this point, I’m looking at rebuilding the entire sleeve jacket of anything that’s exposed and movable with electrical tape. What I had previously thought was a good idea to keep about 5-10m of slack to allow me to easily move my server rack around is now causing me more problems as good electrical tape ain’t cheap. I have to essentially repair around 10 metres of jacket without accidentally destroying parts inside trunking that I am unable to reach. This is assuming that the 4 other untouched cables wouldn’t spontaneously crumble as well. Based on how they felt in my hand, I think it is an inevitable outcome.</p><p>I’m pretty certain that datacentre technicians reading this by chance would mock my idiotic setup and I would be inclined to join in. This is not a good day.</p><p>On the dim side of things, at least it seems like fibre optic cables are pretty hardy. My MS-A2 SFP+ connection is still working and <code>speedtest-cli</code> is reporting around 4000/3000 Mbps up/down speeds to my ISP (10G fibre internet plan). UDM is seeing 6000/7000, so the fibre cable is definitely compromised. :(</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

The rendering present in the game was phenomenal for its time and as such received multiple graphics awards.&nbsp; To understand the what the developers achieve and could have been achieved we have to first understand the PC computing landscape 20 years ago**.</span></p><h2><span>2001&nbsp;</span></h2><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLxdhyphenhyphenUnEoFbXt3FVGdye-K6JS_SseYnF5RW3M8kOyzRa7zXXMJOKte_n5UoMWZBwuu32MHOoMCNo_BOtb9tMEvKquZP3JyHo-ftvL-n56nlaDLFIHcqVC2aSddJF5Yk_4abr5a8kZpise/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="580" data-original-width="1030" height="413" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLxdhyphenhyphenUnEoFbXt3FVGdye-K6JS_SseYnF5RW3M8kOyzRa7zXXMJOKte_n5UoMWZBwuu32MHOoMCNo_BOtb9tMEvKquZP3JyHo-ftvL-n56nlaDLFIHcqVC2aSddJF5Yk_4abr5a8kZpise/w733-h413/slide_show.gif" width="733"></span></a></p></div><p><span>Max Payne was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/12140/Max_Payne/">released targeting</a> directx 8.0 with specs of 450 Mhz cpu (singular) and 16 Mb graphics card. Two put this in perspective that is roughly three orders of magnitude less GPU memory than a modern RTX 2080. The DirectX 8.0 graphics API at least has pixel and vertex shaders but the spec had extreme limitations on caps like <a href="https://hardwaresecrets.com/directx-versions/">number of instructions</a>.&nbsp; The 450 Mhz cpu is more than two orders of magnitude slower than a modern PC cpu today.</span></p><p><span>So with this perspective in mind we can probably conclude** that the rendering will be limited to:</span></p><blockquote><ul><li><span>Forward only rendering (no render-to-texture)&nbsp;</span></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><span>No dynamic shadows&nbsp;</span></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><span>Very low resolution textures&nbsp;</span></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><span>Hundreds of polys on screen</span></li></ul></blockquote><p><span>So with these severe limitations how was such realism and fidelity possible? The answer is an amazing technical synergy of rendering smoke and mirrors.&nbsp; <b>Most of these techniques could be summarized as tricking the human visual perception into thinking complex rendering computations are being done live in realtime when they are actually have been precalculated. </b>The next sections will examine in detail each technique and how they contribute to the total graphical experience.</span></p><h2><span>Particle Effects</span></h2><p><span>The particle effects of this game are its best graphical feature. For a game that involves slowmo matrix style fighting with bullets and other mildly destructive weaponry this investment and care certainly pays off.&nbsp; Similar games of this time do not even come close to the effect fidelity found in this title**.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><span><img data-original-height="465" data-original-width="620" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3IpTKTfqJiTvyhq-RcvYWR_QEGC4Cp1-zb4TfQDgzEXMZDf4hXMV1QV6rdF55ikT5gp1fiChbzjdTXMIkrC4YWjxWE9hoOhEPUODBircm9G2JvZCxijcyOYHka3fR07Bs6mLwAHjfRdVL/w640-h480/wallshot_effects4.gif" width="640"></span></td></tr><tr><td><span>A bullet hitting a wall in slowmo.

This is very similar to the effect with the monitor if one replaces the electric effect with the grey fragments present here.

Soft clipping is normally implemented by reading the depth buffer which is not possible here. It might be possible to achieve soft clipping by CPU side manipulation of the particle quads that clip the ground plane. It might also be possible to do a ground plane representation in the pixel/vertex shader such that near plane quads fade out completely before touching the ground surface.</span></li><li><span>The particles do not interact with the environment&nbsp;at all. This is pretty common for particle systems in general. However there are situations where a few of these particles could have benefitted&nbsp;from a simple path trace of the static geometry. Given that the game is all about tracing bullets through the air this was definitely possible. There would be a limit on how many particles could do this but that could depend the dynamic&nbsp;scenario.</span></li><li><span>Finally the timing for decals to appear and the manner in which they appear is slightly offset from what is correct. This could be due to frame latencies in the engine itself but considering the excessive usage of slowmo in the title some timing cleanup would be beneficial.</span></li></ul><h2><span>Lighting</span></h2><p><span><span>Max Payne used prebaked lightmaps for static geometry.&nbsp; This means static geometry has an entirely separate texture layer that corresponds to the sum incoming irradiance.&nbsp; The reason why this is separate and not simply baked into the texture of static objects is because the high resolution albedo textures are reused everywhere in a scene. Each usage may have a different lighting condition which means they need to correspond to different parts of a texture.&nbsp; Since the light map uniquely covers the entire visible scene the texel density is quite low.&nbsp; It should also be noted that for Max Payne this appears to only be a light map and apparently not a Radiosity map with indirect reflections**.</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHSw8VWrsStEo8axdDg1EMsprvytvmHBHhQ8zy_f51FRrCxqr9jAhg8X-9keYNjsfI_As5UIZ66gREGMVMUOc24eV9Nd5zCDCNdi_93yWnsi3ItYf3DxjsGeEVB04U0mIHp4c5K6oLIASM/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="642" data-original-width="922" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHSw8VWrsStEo8axdDg1EMsprvytvmHBHhQ8zy_f51FRrCxqr9jAhg8X-9keYNjsfI_As5UIZ66gREGMVMUOc24eV9Nd5zCDCNdi_93yWnsi3ItYf3DxjsGeEVB04U0mIHp4c5K6oLIASM/s16000/20210704173626_1.jpg"></span></a></td></tr><tr><td><span>Light mapping shadow from shower wall.

In terms of the planar reflection trick, it would have been nice to see this trick used in a few more situations throughout the game. Specifically, there are a handful of mirrors in the game. Simple planar reflections in these cases would have made for a more dynamic rendering impression.</span></p><h2><span>Scenes</span></h2><p><span>In this final section we shall look at a screenshots from a few key scenes to get a sense of how all these techniques come together to produce a single compelling image.</span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxvuzmP_EtXEzoZ_fLi7vhh9s75taoxe2icv5O4WngarvXcy8QNFGRp7U1MxUVYl4iuIY1Y2i7ADcCCHRU5AdOoMkyqn2SP-xHAGzPTkLxOSJXbRMN8PPf1vBOAeNJpy61NxgDszW_A3ZH/"><span><img data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxvuzmP_EtXEzoZ_fLi7vhh9s75taoxe2icv5O4WngarvXcy8QNFGRp7U1MxUVYl4iuIY1Y2i7ADcCCHRU5AdOoMkyqn2SP-xHAGzPTkLxOSJXbRMN8PPf1vBOAeNJpy61NxgDszW_A3ZH/s16000/20210711161032_2.jpg"></span></a></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJ1IO79NnFIrAwpd2SzRzNAOu8J7Z8vPNZduWfOzzgv5k2WFG9BACXsKuSOCxi3_7aq9teY-wjrWEMw1FDuT8rFKtmDii-BVGMjo4ovH28BPC3Z08Wnu1uDEH629wS8Nonw5Dw-fFUjjBG/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJ1IO79NnFIrAwpd2SzRzNAOu8J7Z8vPNZduWfOzzgv5k2WFG9BACXsKuSOCxi3_7aq9teY-wjrWEMw1FDuT8rFKtmDii-BVGMjo4ovH28BPC3Z08Wnu1uDEH629wS8Nonw5Dw-fFUjjBG/s16000/20210711160913_1.jpg"></span></a></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOM-tdeoidPXRn50abrF5gTCCIipDT4GM7CPYtMzDwKUy3RRxucYoHCHwvDGnMNR0EhkkzG1Q-Q2bqM3el1epP7AGoJShbaa7MFvWDt4-XVk-59LPylqK0LdOxMAZFVOkQl3BqviBEX_uV/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOM-tdeoidPXRn50abrF5gTCCIipDT4GM7CPYtMzDwKUy3RRxucYoHCHwvDGnMNR0EhkkzG1Q-Q2bqM3el1epP7AGoJShbaa7MFvWDt4-XVk-59LPylqK0LdOxMAZFVOkQl3BqviBEX_uV/s16000/20210704220813_1.jpg"></span></a></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8UnFOrY_uqEtt3QAw7a1k4qXQqdfYj-sZwyQh6-6WxF9FttJrhzjYlT4zUSLN4hA_bRzpLioq9yhajyfYqggIRN3Yn4Vc-gE8q8JZLV_tbmFVSc-rXpraMdxW23vnhlIZ-iYsg76QoB7-/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8UnFOrY_uqEtt3QAw7a1k4qXQqdfYj-sZwyQh6-6WxF9FttJrhzjYlT4zUSLN4hA_bRzpLioq9yhajyfYqggIRN3Yn4Vc-gE8q8JZLV_tbmFVSc-rXpraMdxW23vnhlIZ-iYsg76QoB7-/s16000/20210711160512_1.jpg"></span></a></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrrki6XEMRL0AL3o6tgRPFLopjnENqlUFGSAUZGMIOFGYFabsPEyj8NQDSUcEwwWvS657MKt0ubSBjPmtb29qsQN7Hk_I_MOzkGpv76xjq_LgR6UrvJK98ljH1oDxS6EYQupw8Rs0FtRXb/"><span><img alt="" data-original-height="720" data-original-width="1280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrrki6XEMRL0AL3o6tgRPFLopjnENqlUFGSAUZGMIOFGYFabsPEyj8NQDSUcEwwWvS657MKt0ubSBjPmtb29qsQN7Hk_I_MOzkGpv76xjq_LgR6UrvJK98ljH1oDxS6EYQupw8Rs0FtRXb/s16000/20210718232917_1.jpg"></span></a></p><h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p><span>With a larger investment and perhaps different technical choices&nbsp;Max Payne could possibly have looked even better than it did in 2001.

<p>"Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music," family says announcing musician's death</p>
	</div><div><div>
	<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/bob-weir/" id="auto-tag_bob-weir" data-tag="bob-weir">Bob Weir</a>, the singer, songwriter, guitarist, and co-founder of the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/grateful-dead/" id="auto-tag_grateful-dead" data-tag="grateful-dead">Grateful Dead</a>, whose songs about sunshine daydreams and truckin’ helped turn the jam band into a 60-year musical empire, has died at age 78.</p><p>“It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” Weir’s family wrote in a statement. A date of death was not immediately available. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”</p></div>

</div></figure>



<p>
	“Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music,” the statement added. “His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling&nbsp;of family that generations of fans carry with them.&nbsp;Every chord he played, every word he sang was an integral part of the stories he wove. There was an invitation: to feel, to question, to wander, and to belong.”</p>



<p>
	As the band’s co-lead singer, writer, and guitarist beside Jerry Garcia, his elliptical riffs, eccentric song structures, and slightly off-kilter stage presence made him an intrinsic ingredient to the Dead, up to and beyond its demise following Garcia’s death in 1995. Weir often went under-recognized compared to the larger-than-life Garcia (one of the first songs he wrote in the Dead was called “The Other One”). Yet, the band’s bassist Phil Lesh characterized Weir’s contribution as that of “a stealth machine.”

	</p>




<p>
	Robert Hall Weir was born in San Francisco on October 16, 1947, to a college student who gave him up for adoption. He was raised in an affluent Bay Area suburb, where he managed to get kicked out of both preschool and the Cub Scouts, and suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia. At Fountain Valley, a Colorado school for boys with behavioral problems, he met<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> John Perry Barlow</a>, who would become his most frequent lyricist.

	</p>




<p>
	Weir began playing guitar at 13 and was soon hanging out at the Tangent, a Palo Alto folk club, where he performed bluegrass numbers with the Uncalled Four and first saw Garcia playing banjo during a “hoot” night. Weir picked up his first guitar licks from David Nelson and future Jefferson Airplane member Jorma Kaukonen.</p>



<p>
	On New Year’s Eve, 1965, Weir and his friends heard banjo music emerging from Dana Morgan’s Music Store. He went in and found Garcia, and the two decided to form a band. The acoustic Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the electric Warlocks, who changed their name to the Grateful Dead.

<p>
	As the youngest and best-looking member of the Dead, Weir had to pay some dues. Weir admitted that too much LSD during the group’s stint as house band for Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests made him withdrawn, especially as Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh were uniting more musically. “I was definitely low man on the totem pole,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 1989, “especially at the beginning. And for a long time I had to just shut up and take it.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	The lyrics to “The Other One” described Weir’s introduction to both LSD and Neal Cassady, the trickster hero of Jack Kerouac’s beat-generation masterpiece <em>On the Road</em>, with whom Weir shared a room in the Dead’s infamous 710 Ashbury Street house. In 1968, Weir and fellow founding member Ron “Pigpen” McKernan were booted from the band for their musical deficiencies, though both returned within months.</p>



<p>
	Throughout the Seventies, Weir thrived as a member of a band that could deliver music of nearly ineffable warmth and country-rock majesty – as on their pair of 1970 masterpieces, <em>Workingman’s Dead</em> and <em>American Beauty</em> – while also playing more freely improvised music to countless listeners. Weir sang the band’s country covers and his own material, and played rhythm guitar in a brilliantly eccentric manner that belied the job’s second-string implications – even while soundman Dan Healy was turning him down in the mix. Lesh described Weir’s technique as “quirky, whimsical and goofy,” while Weir claimed jazz pianist McCoy Tyner’s left hand as his greatest influence.

<p>
	With Pigpen’s death in 1972, Weir stepped into the second-vocalist role smoothly. <em>Ace</em>, his first solo album, established him as the band’s second most fruitful songwriting source with solo songs-turned-Dead standards like “Playing in the Band,” “One More Saturday Night,” and “Cassidy.”

	</p>




<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grateful Dead - Playing In The Band (Live in Oakland, CA, 12/31/85) [Official Video]" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlnQPlq8iVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	Usually alternating lead vocals with Garcia, he developed a repertoire that ranged from country-rock originals and rhythmically unorthodox tunes to his ambitious and gorgeous “Weather Report Suite.” He also began gigging outside the Dead with a vatiety of acts: First with Kingfish in 1974, then forming the Bob Weir Band with keyboardist Brent Mydland – who later joined the Dead – in the late Seventies. (They’d go on to release two albums with Bobby and the Midnites in the Eighties.) His second solo album, 1978’s <em>Heaven Help the Fool</em>, proved he could sound as slick as any other California rocker.</p>



<p>
	Over the course of the Eighties, Weir would have to compensate onstage as Garcia sank into drug addiction – and later admitted that he also sometimes served as “bag man” for the guitarist’s drugs. Garcia temporarily recovered toward the end of the decade, an era Weir lauded as the Dead’s finest. “For me, that was our peak,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2013. “We could hear and feel each other thinking, and we could intuit each other’s moves. Jerry, Brent, and I reached new plateaus as singers. We packed a punch.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	Though hit hard by Garcia’s August 1995 death, Weir continued to perform; as he famously sang in one Dead classic, “The Music Never Stopped.” His band RatDog played his Dead material and originals, and Weir eventually began singing Garcia’s own material in various 21st-century configurations of former Grateful Dead members, including the Other Ones, the Dead, and Furthur. After collapsing onstage with Furthur in 2013 and canceling RatDog performances in 2014, Weir admitted that he struggled with his own addiction to painkillers.</p>



<p>
	As the remaining Grateful Dead members approached their golden anniversary in 2015, Weir was the first to support a reunion, telling <em>Rolling Stone</em>, “If there are issues we have to get past, I think that we owe it to ourselves to man up and get past them. If there are hatchets to be buried, then let’s get to work. Let’s start digging.”</p>



<p>
	Following the surviving members’ Fare Thee Well concerts celebrating the Grateful Dead’s 50th anniversary in 2015, Weir enlisted one of the gig’s guests, John Mayer, to join him, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and other Dead associates in the new offshoot Dead &amp; Company. That group would keep the spirit of the Dead alive for another decade, culminating in a 2023 “Final Tour” and two stints at Las Vegas’ Sphere.

	</p>




<p>
	“We speak a language that nobody else speaks,” Weir <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bobby-weir-grateful-dead-company-interview-1235290296/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> last March. “We communicate, we kick stuff back and forth, and then make our little statement in a more universal language. For us, it’s a look or a motion with one shoulder, or the way you reflect a phrase or something that tips off the other guys where you’re going with this. And then they work on being where you’re headed, getting there with a little surprise for you. That’s a formula that’s worked real well for us over the years, and there just aren’t enough of us left now to do that anymore.”</p>



<p>
	Weir’s third and final solo studio album, <em>Blue Mountain</em>, arrived in 2016. Two years later, the guitarist embarked on yet another musical project as Bobby Weir and Wolf Bros, alongside bassist/producer Don Was and drummer Jay Lane.</p>



<p>
	In December 2024, shortly after the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/phil-lesh-grateful-dead-dead-1234809976/">death of Dead bassist Phil Lesh</a>, the Grateful Dead’s surviving members were recipients of the Kennedy Center honors. Dead &amp; Company marked the Grateful Dead’s 60th anniversary with a three-night stand at San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park in August. Those concerts marked Weir’s final performances, ending his “long strange trip” onstage.

	“Bobby’s final months reflected the same spirit that defined his life. Diagnosed in July, he began treatment only weeks before returning to his hometown stage for a three-night celebration of 60 years of music at Golden Gate Park. Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts. Another act of resilience,” Weir’s family added in their statement. </p>

	“There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again. He often spoke of a 300-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;And so we send him off the way he sent so many of us on our way: with a farewell that isn’t an ending, but a blessing. A reward for a life worth livin’.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p><i>TLDR:</i> Librario is a book metadata API that aggregates data from Google Books, ISBNDB, and Hardcover into a single response, solving the problem of no single source having complete book information. It's currently pre-alpha, AGPL-licensed, and available to try now[0].</p><p>My wife and I have a personal library with around 1,800 books. I started working on a library management tool for us, but I quickly realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and another might provide a good cover, but none provided everything.</p><p>So I started working on Librario, a book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources (Google Books, ISBNDB, Hardcover. Working on Goodreads and Anna's Archive next.), merges everything, and saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups. The idea is that the database gets stronger over time as more books are queried.</p><p>You can see an example response here[1], or try it yourself:</p><pre><code>  curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer librario_ARbmrp1fjBpDywzhvrQcByA4sZ9pn7D5HEk0kmS34eqRcaujyt0enCZ' \
  'https://api.librario.dev/v1/book/9781328879943' | jq .
  </code></pre><p>
This is pre-alpha and runs on a small VPS, so keep that in mind. I never hit the limits in the third-party services, so depending on how this post goes, I’ll or will not find out if the code handles that well.</p><p>The merger is the heart of the service, and figuring out how to combine conflicting data from different sources was the hardest part. In the end I decided to use field-specific strategies which are quite naive, but work for now.</p><p>Each extractor has a priority, and results are sorted by that priority before merging. But priority alone isn't enough, so different fields need different treatment.</p><p>For example:</p><p>- Titles use a scoring system. I penalize titles containing parentheses or brackets because sources sometimes shove subtitles into the main title field. Overly long titles (80+ chars) also get penalized since they often contain edition information or other metadata that belongs elsewhere.</p><p>- Covers collect all candidate URLs, then a separate fetcher downloads and scores them by dimensions and quality. The best one gets stored locally and served from the server.</p><p>For most other fields (publisher, language, page count), I just take the first non-empty value by priority. Simple, but it works.</p><p>Recently added a caching layer[2] which sped things up nicely. I considered migrating from <i>net/http</i> to <i>fiber</i> at some point[3], but decided against it. Going outside the standard library felt wrong, and the migration didn't provide much in the end.</p><p>The database layer is being rewritten before v1.0[4]. I'll be honest: the original schema was written by AI, and while I tried to guide it in the right direction with SQLC[5] and good documentation, database design isn't my strong suit and I couldn't confidently vouch for the code. Rather than ship something I don't fully understand, I hired the developers from SourceHut[6] to rewrite it properly.</p><p>I've got a 5-month-old and we're still adjusting to their schedule, so development is slow. I've mentioned this project in a few HN threads before[7], so I’m pretty happy to finally have something people can try.</p><p>Code is AGPL and on SourceHut[8].</p><p>Feedback and patches[9] are very welcome :)</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/" rel="nofollow">https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/</a></p><p>[1]: <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b33a8ab1bc3392093c" rel="nofollow">https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/a6c3b1130133f384cffd25b3...</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16" rel="nofollow">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/16</a></p><p>[3]: <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13" rel="nofollow">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/13</a></p><p>[4]: <a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14" rel="nofollow">https://todo.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/14</a></p><p>[5]: <a href="https://sqlc.dev/" rel="nofollow">https://sqlc.dev</a></p><p>[6]: <a href="https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/" rel="nofollow">https://sourcehut.org/consultancy/</a></p><p>[7]: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45419234</a></p><p>[8]: <a href="https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/" rel="nofollow">https://sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/</a></p><p>[9]: <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="nofollow">https://git.sr.ht/~pagina394/librario/tree/trunk/item/CONTRI...</a></p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

      <p><strong>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</strong> [Brown University] — Private equity firms acquired more than 500 autism therapy centers across the U.S. over the past decade, with nearly 80% of acquisitions occurring over a four-year span.</p><p>That’s according to a new study from researchers at Brown University’s <a href="https://cahpr.sph.brown.edu/">Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research</a>.</p><p>Study author Yashaswini Singh, a health economist at Brown’s School of Public Health, said the work highlights how financial firms are rapidly moving into a sensitive area of health care with little public scrutiny or data on where this is happening or why.</p><p>“The big takeaway is that there is yet another segment of health care that has emerged as potentially profitable to private equity investors, and it is very distinct from where we have traditionally known investors to go, so the potential for harm can be a lot more serious,” Singh said. “We're also dealing with children who are largely insured by Medicaid programs, so if private equity increases the intensity of care, what we're looking at are impacts to state Medicaid budgets down the road.”</p><p>The findings were <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2843100?resultClick=1" data-entity-type="external">published</a> in JAMA Pediatrics and offer one of the first national assessments of private equity’s growing role in autism therapies and services. Autism diagnoses among U.S. children have risen sharply in recent years, nearly tripling between 2011 and 2022, and autism has been in the national spotlight amid political debate claiming links between autism and childhood vaccines.</p><p>The findings suggest that investment has been concentrated in states with higher rates of autism diagnoses among children and states that have fewer limits on insurance coverage.</p><p>The researchers identified a total of 574 autism therapy centers owned by private equity firms as of 2024, spanning 42 states. Most of those centers were acquired between 2018 and 2022, the result of 142 separate deals. The largest concentrations of centers were in California (97), Texas (81), Colorado (38), Illinois (36) and Florida (36). Sixteen states had one or no private equity-owned clinics at the end of 2024.</p><p>States in the top third for childhood autism prevalence were 24% more likely to have private equity–owned clinics than others, according to the study.</p><p>The scale and speed of acquisitions underscore the growing trend of private equity’s entry into the market, the researchers say. According to Singh, the team was prompted to investigate that trend after hearing anecdotal reports from families and health providers about changes following private equity takeovers.</p><p>The primary concern is that private equity firms may prioritize financial gains over families, said Daniel Arnold, a senior research scientist at the School of Public Health.</p><p>“It's all about the financial incentives,” Arnold said. “I worry about the same types of revenue-generating strategies seen in other private equity-backed settings. I worry about children receiving more than the clinically appropriate amount of services and worsening disparities in terms of which children have access to services.”</p><p>To establish a baseline of where private equity firms are investing and why, the team used a mix of proprietary databases, public press releases and manual verification of archived websites to track changes in ownership. Unlike public companies, private equity firms and private practices are not required to disclose acquisitions, making data collection challenging and labor-intensive.</p><p>The team is now seeking federal funding to examine how private equity ownership affects outcomes, including changes in therapy intensity, medication use, diagnosis age or how long children stay in treatment. They seek to determine whether these investments are helping to meet real needs or are primarily a way to make money.</p><p>“Private investors making a little bit of money while expanding access is not a bad thing, per se,” Singh said. “But we need to understand how much of a bad thing this is and how much of a good thing this is. This is a first step in that direction.”</p><p>This study received funding from the National Institute on Aging (R01AG073286) and the National Institute on Mental Health (R01MH132128).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>By now, we’ve all heard the familiar refrain: “It’s for your safety.” It’s the soothing mantra of every government official who’s ever wanted a peek behind your digital curtains.</p>
<p>This week, with a move that would make East Germany blush, the UK government officially confirmed its intention to hand Ofcom&nbsp; (yes, that Ofcom, the regulator that once investigated whether Love Island was too spicy) the keys to your private messages.</p>
<p>The country, already experiencing rapidly declining civil liberties, is now planning to scan encrypted chats for “bad stuff.”</p>
<p>Now, for those unfamiliar, Ofcom is the UK’s communications regulator that has recently been given <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-tech-secretary-presses-ofcom-fast-track-online-safety-act">censorship pressure powers for online speech</a>.</p>
<p>It’s become the government’s Swiss Army knife for everything from internet censorship to now, apparently, full-blown surveillance.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-online-safety-act-strategic-priorities-ofcom-censorship-surveillance-age-verification">Online Safety Act</a>, Ofcom has been handed something called Section 121, which sounds like a tax loophole but is actually a legal crowbar for prying open encrypted messages.</p>
<p>It allows the regulator to compel any online service that lets people talk to each other, Facebook Messenger, Signal, iMessage, etc to install “accredited technology” to scan for terrorism or child abuse material.</p>
<p><strong>More:&nbsp;<a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/uk-government-encrypted-icloud-access-order-apple-privacy-surveillance">Starmer Adds To UK Civil Liberties Decline With Reckless iCloud Backdoor Demand</a></strong></p>
<p>The way this works is by scanning all your messages. Not just the suspicious ones. Not just the flagged ones. Every single message. On your device. Before they’re encrypted.</p>
<p>This is “client-side scanning,” which is a clever euphemism for “we’re turning your phone into a government informant.”</p>
<p>Let’s be clear about what’s at stake. End-to-end encryption is what keeps your private messages private.</p>
<p>But the UK’s plan effectively makes that encryption irrelevant. If the message gets scanned before it’s encrypted, the whole thing is about as useful as putting a padlock on a door that’s already wide open.</p>
<p>This isn’t some consequence. This is the point.</p>
<p>Lord Hanson of Flint, the man chosen to deliver this particularly Orwellian update in the House of Lords, confirmed that Ofcom is expected to start using these powers just as soon as it finishes its report.</p>
<p>“We have set a date of April 2026,” he said, presumably while polishing his best ‘nothing to see here’ smile, “and we expect to act extremely speedily once we have had the report back.”</p>
<p>Baroness Butler-Sloss, clearly tired of waiting for this dystopia to arrive on schedule, pushed for Ofcom to get on with it. “Work to do this now,” she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Baroness Berger popped up to promote something called “upload prevention technology.” It sounds like an antivirus program crossed with a puritanical school principal, and she claimed it can stop harmful content before it spreads. Lovely idea. Also, exactly how Chinese censorship works.</p>
<p>She also accused tech companies of lying when they say scanning encrypted messages isn’t possible. And maybe they are. But when your answer to that is “Well, we’ll just force them to comply by law,” you’re not solving the problem. You’re building a digital panopticon with the grace of a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem. Once you install the infrastructure to scan for one kind of content, however vile, it’s there forever. And that tool, like every government tool, will be “repurposed.”</p>
<p>It starts with child abuse material, because who’s going to defend not catching that? Then maybe a few terrorist memes. Then maybe “hate speech.” Then “misinformation.” Then a joke about the</p>
<p>Prime Minister’s haircut. And suddenly, you’re far from a democracy.</p>
<p>You’re just renting space in an open-air digital prison where your every word is silently filed away in a database next to your Amazon shopping history and that one embarrassing search from 2013.</p>
<p>We’ve been yelling about this for years. You cannot build a scanning system that only finds “the bad stuff.”</p>
<p>The government is playing the long game. Ofcom will issue its report by April 2026, followed by a “consultation,” which, let’s be honest, only ever goes one way, and then the Home Office will act “extremely speedily,” whatever that means in bureaucratic time.</p>
<p>What’s certain is this: if they get their way, private messaging in the UK will be gone.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, users started reporting that Ghostty was consuming absurd
amounts of memory, with one user reporting <strong>37 GB</strong> after 10 days of uptime.
Today, I'm happy to say <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/10251">the fix has been found and merged</a>.
This post is an overview of what caused the leak, a look at some of
Ghostty's internals, and some brief descriptions of how we tracked it down.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The leak was present since at least Ghostty 1.0, but it is only recently
that popular CLI applications (particularly Claude Code) started producing
the correct conditions to trigger it at scale. The limited conditions that
triggered the leak are what made it particularly tricky to diagnose.</p>
<p>The fix is merged and is available in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ghostty.org/docs/install/pre">tip/nightly releases</a>,
and will be part of the tagged 1.3 release in March.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-pagelist">The PageList</h2>
<p>To understand the bug, we first need to understand how Ghostty manages
terminal memory. Ghostty uses a data structure called the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/src/terminal/PageList.zig"><code>PageList</code></a>
to store terminal content. PageList is a doubly-linked list of
memory pages that store the terminal content (characters, styles, hyperlinks,
etc.).</p>
<div><p>PageList: A doubly-linked list of memory pages</p><div><p><span>Page 1</span><span>oldest</span><span>scrollback</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 2</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 3</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 4</span><span>newest</span><span>active screen</span></p></div></div>
<p>The underlying "pages" are not single <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)">virtual memory pages</a>
but they are a contiguous block of memory aligned to page boundaries
and composed of an even multiple of system pages.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>These pages are allocated using <code>mmap</code>. <code>mmap</code> isn't particularly fast,
so to avoid constant syscalls, we use a <strong>memory pool</strong>. When we need
a new page, we pull from the pool. When we're done with a page, we return
it to the pool for reuse.</p>
<p>The pool uses a <strong>standard size</strong> for pages. Think of it like buying
standard-sized shipping boxes: most things people ship fit in a standard box,
and having a standard box comes with various efficiencies.</p>
<p>But sometimes terminals need more memory than a standard page provides.
If a set of lines has many emoji, styles, or hyperlinks, we need
a larger page. In these cases, we allocate a <strong>non-standard page</strong>
directly with <code>mmap</code>, bypassing the pool entirely. This is typically a
rare scenario.</p>
<div><p>Two types of page allocations</p><div><div><p>Standard Pages (from pool)</p><div><p>• Fixed size</p><p>• Returned to pool when freed</p><p>• Reusable for future allocations</p></div></div><div><p>Non-Standard Pages (direct mmap)</p><div><p>• Variable size (larger than standard)</p><p>• Must call munmap to free</p><p>• Cannot be reused</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>When we "free" a page, we apply some simple logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the page is <code>&lt;= standard size</code>: return it to the pool</li>
<li>If the page is <code>&gt; standard size</code>: call <code>munmap</code> to free it</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the core background for terminal memory management in Ghostty,
and the idea itself is sound. A logic bug around an optimization is
what produced the leak, as we'll see next.</p>
<hr>

<p>There's one more background detail we need to cover to
understand the bug: scrollback pruning.</p>
<p>Ghostty has a <code>scrollback-limit</code> configuration that caps how much history
is retained. When you hit this limit, we delete the oldest pages in
the scrollback buffer to free up memory.</p>
<p>But this often happens in a super hot path (e.g. when outputting large
amounts of data quickly), and allocating and freeing memory pages is
expensive, even with the pool. Therefore, we have an optimization:
<strong>reuse the oldest page as the newest page</strong> when we reach the limit.</p>
<div><p>Scrollback pruning: reusing the oldest page</p><div><div><p>Before: at scrollback limit</p></div><div><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M19 14l-7 7m0 0l-7-7m7 7V3"></path></svg><p><span>Remove from front, reuse at back</span></p></div><div><p>After: page reused at end</p><div><p><span>Page 2</span><span>now oldest</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 3</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><p><span>Page 4</span></p><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M1 8h20m0 0l-4-4m4 4l-4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M23 16H3m0 0l4-4m-4 4l4 4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></div></div></div></div>
<p>This optimization works great. It requires zero allocations and uses
only some quick pointer manipulations to move the page from the
front to the back of the list. We do some metadata cleanup to "clear" the
page but otherwise leave the previous memory intact.</p>
<p>It's fast and empirically speeds up scrollback-heavy workloads significantly.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2>
<p>During the scrollback pruning optimization, we always
<strong>resized our page back to standard size</strong>. But we didn't resize the
underlying memory allocation itself, we only noted the resize in the
metadata. The underlying memory was still the large
non-standard <code>mmap</code> allocation, but now the PageList <em>thought</em> it was standard
sized.</p>
<div><p>How metadata desync causes the leak</p><div><div><p>1</p><div><p>Allocate non-standard page</p></div></div><div><p>2</p><div><p>Scrollback prunes &amp; reuses</p><p><strong>BUG:</strong> metadata reset to std_size, but mmap unchanged!</p></div></div><div><p>3</p><div><p>Free the page</p><p>std_size, assume pooled. <strong>munmap never called!</strong></p></div></div><div><p><span><span></span>Standard</span><span><span></span>Non-standard</span><span><span></span>Leaked</span></p></div></div></div>
<p>Eventually, we'd free the page under various circumstances (e.g. when
the user closes the terminal, but also other times). At that point,
we'd see the page memory was within the standard size, assume it
was part of the pool, and we would <em>never call <code>munmap</code></em> on it.
A classic leak.</p>
<p>This all seems pretty obvious, but the issue is that non-standard
pages are rare by design. The goal of our design and optimizations is
that standard pages are the common case and provide a fast-path. Only
very specific scenarios produce non-standard pages and they're usually
not produced in large quantities.</p>
<p>But the rise of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a>
changed this. For some reason, Claude Code's CLI produces a lot of
multi-codepoint grapheme outputs which force Ghostty to regularly
use non-standard pages. Additionally, Claude Code uses the primary screen
and produces a significant amount of scrollback output. These things
combined together created the perfect storm to trigger the leak
in huge quantities.</p>
<div><p>I want to be explicit that this bug is not Claude Code's fault. Claude Code is simply exercising
Ghostty in a way that exposes this long-standing bug.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>
<p>The fix is conceptually simple: <strong>never reuse non-standard pages</strong>.
If we encounter a non-standard page during scrollback pruning, we
destroy it properly (calling <code>munmap</code>) and allocate a fresh
standard-sized page from the pool.</p>
<p>The core of the fix is in the snippet below, but some extra
work was needed to fix up some other bits of accounting we have:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>if</span> <span>(</span>first<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>memory<span>.</span>len <span>&gt;</span> std_size<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    self<span>.</span><span>destroyNode</span><span>(</span>first<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>break</span> <span>:</span><span>prune</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We could've also reused the non-standard page and just retained the
large memory size, but until we have data that shows otherwise, we're
still operating under the assumption that standard pages are the common case
and it makes sense to reset back to a standard pooled page.</p>
<p>Other users have recommended more complex strategies (e.g. maintaining
some metrics on how often non-standard pages are used and adjusting
our assumptions accordingly), but more research is needed before
making those changes. This change is simple, fixes the bug, and aligns
with our current assumptions.</p>
<hr>

<p>As part of the fix, I added support for virtual memory tags on macOS
provided by the Mach kernel. This lets us tag our PageList memory allocations
with a specific identifier that shows up in various tooling.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>inline</span> <span>fn</span> <span>pageAllocator</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>Allocator</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>// In tests we use our testing allocator so we can detect leaks.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>builtin<span>.</span>is_test<span>)</span> <span>return</span> std<span>.</span>testing<span>.</span>allocator<span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>// On non-macOS we use our standard Zig page allocator.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>builtin<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>os<span>.</span>tag<span>.</span><span>isDarwin</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> std<span>.</span>heap<span>.</span>page_allocator<span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    <span>// On macOS we want to tag our memory so we can assign it to our</span>
</span><span>    <span>// core terminal usage.</span>
</span><span>    <span>const</span> mach <span>=</span> <span>@import</span><span>(</span><span>"../os/mach.zig"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> mach<span>.</span><span>taggedPageAllocator</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>application_specific_1<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now when debugging memory on macOS, Ghostty's PageList memory shows up
with a specific tag instead of being lumped in with everything else.
This made it trivial to identify the leak, associate it with the PageList,
and also verify that the fix worked by observing the tagged memory
being properly freed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="preventing-leaks-in-ghostty">Preventing Leaks in Ghostty</h2>
<p>We do a lot of work in the Ghostty project to find and prevent memory leaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>In debug builds and unit tests, we use leak-detecting Zig allocators.</li>
<li>The CI runs <code>valgrind</code> on our full unit test suite on every commit
to find more than just leaks, such as undefined memory usage.</li>
<li>We regularly run the macOS GUI via macOS Instruments to look for
leaks particularly in the Swift codebase.</li>
<li>We run every GTK-related PR using Valgrind (the full GUI) to look
for leaks in the GTK codepath that isn't unit tested.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has worked really well to date, but unfortunately it didn't catch
this particular leak because it only triggers under very specific
conditions that our tests didn't reproduce. The merged PR includes a
test that does reproduce the leak to prevent regressions in the future.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was the largest known memory leak in Ghostty to date, and the only
reported leak that has been confirmed by more than a single user.
We'll continue to monitor and address memory reports as they come in,
but remember that reproduction is the key to diagnosing and fixing memory leaks!</p>
<p>Big thanks to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/grishy">@grishy</a> who finally
got me a reliable reproduction so I could analyze the issue myself. Their
own analysis reached the same conclusion as mine, and the reproduction
let me verify both our understandings independently.</p>
<p>Thanks also to everyone who reported this issue with detailed diagnostics.
The community's analysis, especially around the <code>footprint</code> output and
VM region counting, gave me important clues that pointed toward the PageList
as the culprit.</p>
