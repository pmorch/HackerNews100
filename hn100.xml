  <p>Today, we announce our first Large Language Model release of 2024: <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-code-3b" target="_blank"><span>Stable Code 3B</span></a>. This new LLM is a follow-up to our previously released <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stablecode-llm-generative-ai-coding"><span>Stable Code Alpha 3B</span></a> and the first major Stable Code release, offering a new state-of-the-art model designed for code completion with multiple additional capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to CodeLLaMA 7b, Stable Code 3B is 60% smaller while featuring a similar high-level performance across programming languages. Based on our pre-existing <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-3b-4e1t" target="_blank"><span>Stable LM 3B</span></a> foundational model trained on 4 trillion tokens of natural language data, Stable Code was further trained on software engineering-specific data, including code. The model's compact size allows it to be run privately on the edge in real-time on modern laptops, even those without a dedicated GPU.</p><p>Stable Code 3B offers more features and significantly better performance across multiple languages with additional benefits such as support for Fill in the Middle capabilities (FIM) and expanded context size. Stable Code as a base is trained on sequences of up to 16,384 tokens but follows a similar approach to CodeLlama with the implementation of Rotary Embeddings, optionally allowing modification of the rotary base up to 1,000,000, further expanding the model’s context length up to 100k tokens.</p><p>Stable Code is trained on 18 programming languages (selected based on the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages" target="_blank"><span>2023 StackOverflow Developer Survey</span></a>) and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance (compared to models of similar size) on the MultiPL-E metrics across multiple programming languages tested.</p><p><strong>Performance Comparison</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Training Insights</strong></p><p>Our training pipeline consists of a multi-stage process similar to Codellama. We start with an LM pre-trained on natural language data, in this case, <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-3b-4e1t" target="_blank"><span>StableLM-3B-4e1t</span></a>, followed up with unsupervised fine-tuning on multiple code and code-related datasets, including CommitPack, GitHub Issues, StarCoder &amp; other Math datasets. In the second step, we further fine-tune the model with longer sequences of 16,384 tokens with the base modification suggested in CodeLLama. The new stable-code model also supports Flash Attention 2 and is available for use.</p><p>Further references to the data and model can be found in our <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-code-3b" target="_blank"><span>model card</span></a>. We will release a full technical report with additional details and ablations to be more transparent and open to the community.</p><p><strong>Commercial Applications</strong></p><p>Stay updated on our progress by signing up for our newsletter, and learn more about commercial applications by contacting us here.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/stabilityai" target="_blank"><span>Twitter</span></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stability.ai/" target="_blank"><span>Instagram</span></a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/66318622/"><span>LinkedIn</span></a>, and join our <a href="https://discord.gg/stablediffusion"><span>Discord Community</span></a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							

						<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
					</div><div lang="en" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text"><p>The number <b>6174</b> is known as <b>Kaprekar's constant</b><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kaprekar1955_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kaprekar1955-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kaprekar1980_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kaprekar1980-3">[3]</a></sup> after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">Indian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Kaprekar" title="D. R. Kaprekar">D. R. Kaprekar</a>. This number is renowned for the following rule:
</p>
<ol><li>Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits (leading zeros are allowed).</li>
<li>Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.</li>
<li>Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.</li>
<li>Go back to step 2 and repeat.</li></ol>
<p>The above process, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar%27s_routine" title="Kaprekar's routine">Kaprekar's routine</a>, will always reach its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)" title="Fixed point (mathematics)">fixed point</a>, 6174, in at most 7 iterations.<sup id="cite_ref-mathworld_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-mathworld-4">[4]</a></sup> Once 6174 is reached, the process will continue yielding 7641 – 1467 = 6174. For example, choose 1459:
</p>
<div>
<ul><li>9541 – 1459 = 8082</li>
<li>8820 – 0288 = 8532</li>
<li>8532 – 2358 = 6174</li>
<li>7641 – 1467 = <b>6174</b></li></ul>
</div><p>
The only four-digit numbers for which Kaprekar's routine does not reach 6174 are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repdigit" title="Repdigit">repdigits</a> such as 1111, which give the result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)" title="0 (number)">0000</a> after a single iteration. All other four-digit numbers eventually reach 6174 if leading zeros are used to keep the number of digits at 4. For numbers with three identical numbers and a fourth number that is one number higher or lower (such as 2111), it is essential to treat 3-digit numbers with a leading zero; for example: 2111 – 1112 = 0999; 9990 – 999 = 8991; 9981 – 1899 = 8082; 8820 – 288 = 8532; 8532 – 2358 = 6174.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="2"><table><tbody><tr>

<p>There can be analogous fixed points for digit lengths other than four; for instance, if we use 3-digit numbers, then most sequences (i.e., other than repdigits such as 111) will terminate in the value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/495_(number)" title="495 (number)">495</a> in at most 6 iterations. Sometimes these numbers (495, 6174, and their counterparts in other digit lengths or in bases other than 10) are called "Kaprekar constants".

<p>Great news! You've built a cool <a href="https://goo.gle/made-with-tfjs">Web AI application</a> 
that runs machine learning models directly on a user's device. It runs entirely
on the client-side web browser, without relying on the cloud. This on-device
design enhances user privacy, boosts performance, and reduces costs
significantly.</p>

<p>However, there's a hurdle. Your
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a> model can operate on
both CPUs (WebAssembly) and more powerful GPUs (through
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a> and
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release">WebGPU</a>). The question is:
<strong>how can you consistently automate browser testing with the selected hardware?</strong></p>

<p>Maintaining consistency is crucial for comparing machine learning model
performance over time as you iterate and improve them, prior to deployment for
real-world users to use on their device.</p>

<p>Setting up a consistent testing environment with GPUs can be harder than
expected. In this blog post, we'll share the problems we faced and how we solved
them, so you can improve your application's performance.</p>

<p>This isn't just for Web AI developers! If you're working on web gaming or
graphics, this post is valuable for you, too.</p>

<h2 id="what's-automation" data-text="What's in our automation toolbox" tabindex="-1">What's in our automation toolbox</h2>

<p>Here is what we are using:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>: A Linux-based Google Colab
<a href="https://colab.google/notebooks/">notebook</a> connected to an NVIDIA
T4 or V100 GPU. You can use other cloud platforms, such as Google Cloud
(GCP), if preferred.</li>
<li><strong>Browser</strong>: Chrome supports <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/webgpu">WebGPU</a>,
a powerful <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/from-webgl-to-webgpu">successor to WebGL</a>, that
brings the advancements of modern GPU APIs to the web.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> is a Node.js library that lets
you control browsers programmatically with JavaScript. With Puppeteer, we can
automate Chrome in headless mode, which means the browser runs without a
visible interface, on a server. We are using the improved
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/new-headless">new headless mode</a>, not the
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/headless-chrome">legacy</a> form.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="verify-environment" data-text="Verify the environment" tabindex="-1">Verify the environment</h2>

<p>The best way to check whether hardware acceleration is turned on in Chrome is to
type <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://gpu</code> into the address bar. You can
programmatically <a href="https://github.com/jasonmayes/headless-chrome-nvidia-t4-gpu-support/blob/main/examples/puppeteer/jPuppet.js">perform the equivalent with Puppeteer</a> 
with <code translate="no" dir="ltr">console.log</code> or save the full report as PDF to check manually:</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">/* Incomplete example.js */
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

// Configure launch parameters: Expands later
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new',
  args:  ['--no-sandbox']
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('chrome://gpu');

// Verify: log the WebGPU status or save the GPU report as PDF
const txt = await page.waitForSelector('text/WebGPU');
const status = await txt.evaluate(g =&gt; g.parentElement.textContent);
console.log(status);
await page.pdf({ path: './gpu.pdf' });

await browser.close();
</code></pre>
<p>Open <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://gpu</code> and you should have the following results:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Graphics feature status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenGL:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL2:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGPU:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p><b>Problems detected.</b><br>WebGPU has been disabled via blocklist or the command line.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Not a great start. It's fairly clear that hardware detection was failing.
<strong>WebGL, WebGL2, and WebGPU are essentially disabled or software only</strong>. We
aren't alone in this problem - there are numerous discussions online of people
in a similar situation, including on the official Chrome support channels
(<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1459930">1</a>),
(<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=765284">2</a>).</p>

<h2 id="enable-webgpu" data-text="Enable WebGPU and WebGL support" tabindex="-1">Enable WebGPU and WebGL support</h2>

<p>By default, Headless Chrome
<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1416283">disables GPU</a>.
To enable it on Linux, apply all of the following flags when launching Headless
Chrome:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--no-sandbox</code></strong> flag disables <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer/troubleshooting#set_up_a_chrome_linux_sandbox">Chrome's security sandbox</a>, which isolates the
browser process from the rest of the system. Running Chrome as root without
this sandbox is not supported.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--headless=new</code></strong> flag runs Chrome with the new and improved
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/new-headless">headless mode</a>, without any visible UI.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--use-angle=vulkan</code></strong> flag tells Chrome to use the
<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/HEAD/src/libANGLE/renderer/vulkan/README.md">Vulkan backend</a> 
for <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/">ANGLE</a>, which
translates OpenGL ES 2/3 calls to Vulkan API calls.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--enable-features=Vulkan</code></strong> flag enables Vulkan graphics backend for
compositing and rasterization in Chrome.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--disable-vulkan-surface</code></strong> flag disables the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">VK_KHR_surface</code> vulkan
instance extension. Instead of using a swapchain,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_blit">Bit blit</a> is used for the
present render result on screen.</li>
<li><strong><code translate="no" dir="ltr">--enable-unsafe-webgpu</code></strong> flag enables the experimental WebGPU API in
Chrome on Linux and disables the adapters blocklist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we combine all the changes we have made so far. Here is the complete script.</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">/* Complete example.js */
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

// Configure launch parameters
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new',
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--headless=new',
    '--use-angle=vulkan',
    '--enable-features=Vulkan',
    '--disable-vulkan-surface',
    '--enable-unsafe-webgpu',
  ]
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('chrome://gpu');

// Verify: log the WebGPU status or save the GPU report as PDF
const txt = await page.waitForSelector('text/WebGPU');
const status = await txt.evaluate(g =&gt; g.parentElement.textContent);
console.log(status);
await page.pdf({path: './gpu.pdf'});

await browser.close();
</code></pre>
<p>Run the script again. No WebGPU problems are detected and the value changes from
disabled to software only.</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Graphics feature status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenGL:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan:</td>
    <td><span>Disabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL2:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGPU:</td>
    <td><span>Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable.</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>However, hardware acceleration is still unavailable, the NVIDIA T4 GPU isn't
detected.</p>

<h2 id="install-drivers" data-text="Install the correct GPU drivers" tabindex="-1">Install the correct GPU drivers</h2>

<p>We investigated more closely the output of <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://gpu</code>, with some GPU experts
on the Chrome team. We found issues with the <a href="https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/3556#issuecomment-1499397023">default drivers installed on the
Linux Colab</a> 
instance, causing issues with Vulkan, leading to Chrome unable to detect the
NVIDIA T4 GPU at the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GL_RENDERER</code> level as shown in the following output. This
causes problems with Headless Chrome.</p>

<table>
  <caption>The default output doesn't detect NVIDIA T4 GPU.</caption>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Driver information</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GL_RENDERER</td>
    <td>ANGLE (Google, Vulkan 1.3.0 (SwiftShader Device (Subzero) (0x0000C0DE)), SwiftShader driver-5.0.0)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Installing the correct drivers that were compatible therefore fixes the issue.</p>

<table>
  <caption>Updated output after drivers are installed.</caption>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Driver information</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GL_RENDERER</td>
    <td>ANGLE (NVIDIA Corporation, Tesla T4/PCIe/SSE2, OpenGL ES 3.2 NVIDIA 525.105.17)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To install the correct drivers, run the following commands during setup. The
last two lines help you to log the outputs of what NVIDIA drivers detects along
with <code translate="no" dir="ltr">vulkaninfo</code>.</p>

<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">apt-get install -y vulkan-tools libnvidia-gl-525
</code>
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">// Verify the NVIDIA drivers detects along with vulkaninfo</code>
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">nvidia-smi</code>
<code translate="no" dir="ltr">vulkaninfo --summary</code>
</pre>

<p>Now run the script again and we get the following result. 🎉</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th colspan="2">Graphics feature status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OpenGL:</td>
    <td><span>Enabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan:</td>
    <td><span>Enabled</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL:</td>
    <td><span>Hardware accelerated but at reduced performance.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGL2:</td>
    <td><span>Hardware accelerated but at reduced performance.</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WebGPU:</td>
    <td><span>Hardware accelerated but at reduced performance.</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>By using the correct drivers and flags when running Chrome, we now have WebGPU
and WebGL support using the shiny, new headless mode.</p>

<h2 id="investigation" data-text="Behind the scenes: Our team's investigation" tabindex="-1">Behind the scenes: Our team's investigation</h2>

<p>After much research, we didn't find working methods for the environment we
needed to execute in Google Colab, although there were some
<a href="https://mirzabilal.com/how-to-enable-hardware-acceleration-on-chrome-chromium-puppeteer-on-aws-in-headless-mode">hopeful posts</a> 
that worked in other environments, which was promising. Ultimately, we weren't
able to replicate their success in the Colab NVIDIA T4 environment, as we had 2
key issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some combinations of flags allow detection of the GPU, but don't allow you to
actually use the GPU.</li>
<li>Examples of working solutions by third parties used the old Chrome headless
version, which at some point will be deprecated in favor of the
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/new-headless">new version</a>. We needed a solution
that worked with the new Headless Chrome to be better future proofed.</li>
</ol>

<p>We confirmed the under utilization of the GPU by running an
<a href="https://tensorflowjs-fashion-mnist-classifier.glitch.me/">example TensorFlow.js web page for image recognition</a>,
whereby we trained a model to recognize clothing samples (sort of like a "hello
world" of machine learning).</p>

<p>On a regular machine, 50 training cycles (known as epochs) should run in less
than 1 second each. Calling Headless Chrome in its default state, we could log
the JavaScript console output to the Node.js server-side command line to see how
fast these training cycles were actually taking.</p>

<p>As expected, each training epoch took much longer than expected (several
seconds), which suggests Chrome has fallen back to plain old JS CPU execution
instead of utilizing the GPU:</p>

  <figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>: Real-time capture showing how long each training epoch took to execute (seconds).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After fixing the drivers and using the right combination of flags for Headless
Chrome, rerunning the TensorFlow.js training example results in much faster
training epochs.</p>

<h2 id="summary" data-text="Summary" tabindex="-1">Summary</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7hOoCY6uGo">Web AI has grown exponentially</a> 
since its creation in 2017. With browser technologies such as WebGPU, WebGL, and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, a machine learning model's
mathematical operations can be further accelerated on the client side.</p>

<p>As of 2023 TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe Web crossed over 1 billion downloads of
models and libraries—a historic milestone and a sign of how web
developers and engineers are shifting to embrace <a href="https://goo.gle/made-with-tfjs">AI in their next generation
web apps to make some truly incredible solutions</a>.</p>

<p>With great success in usage comes great responsibility. At this level of usage
in production systems, the need arises for testing client-side, browser-based AI
models in a true browser environment, while also being scalable, automatable,
and within a known standardized hardware setup.</p>



<p>By harnessing the combined power of the new Headless Chrome and Puppeteer, you
can confidently test such workloads in a standardized and replicable
environment, ensuring consistent and reliable results.</p>

<p>TinyML or Tiny Machine Learning refers to the <strong>use of Machine Learning in microcontrollers</strong>. In systems that unlike those used in traditional ML have few resources, are systems that have little CPU, little RAM and extremely low power consumption in the order of magnitude of milliwatts or microwatts.</p>



<p>Its official website is the <a href="https://www.tinyml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TinyML Foundation</a>.</p>



<p>What is done is to reduce large models for use with equipment with very few resources and microcontrollers. The preferred field of the Makers.</p>




<p>I have started a series of 3 courses offered by Harvard for free</p>



<ol>
<li><em><a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning/harvard-university-fundamentals-of-tinyml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fundamentals of TinyML</a></em> (What do I build, what for and what are the problems)</li>



<li><em>Applications of TinyML</em> (data-driven, bias, etc) </li>



<li><em>Deploying TinyML</em> (where do we put our models, security and privacy)</li>
</ol>



<p>The following notes are from the first Fundamentals of TinyML where they explain what it is, when it is applied, the different techniques that are used, etc, etc.</p>



<p>Embedded systems using microcontrollers cannot work with the large models, as they have memories up to 256kB. Here are some examples of operating systems that can be used with microcontrollers</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.freertos.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeRTOS</a></li>



<li><a href="https://os.mbed.com/mbed-os/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mbed OS</a></li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.ikkaro.net/machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machine Learning</a> consists of algorithms that search for patterns in data.</p>



<p>With TinyML, techniques are used to compress these algorithms so that they remain effective in finding patterns in data.</p>



<p>There are 5 quintillion bytes of data produced daily by IoT and only less than 1% is analyzed.</p>



<h2><span id="Algorithm_compression_techniques">Algorithm compression techniques</span></h2>



<p>Some algorithm compression techniques are:</p>



<h3><span id="Pruning">Pruning</span></h3>



<p><strong>Pruning Synapsis:</strong> We remove network connections from the model. Sometimes it can decrease the accuracy.</p>



<p><strong>Pruning Neurons:</strong> We can also eliminate entire neurons from our model which reduces the computational demand of the network.</p>



<h3><span id="Quantization">Quantization</span></h3>



<p>It consists of discretizing the values within a small range. For example if we discretize a float within the range -128 to 127 we only have to traverse 256 values. Going from a float point value that is stored in 4 bytes to an integer value that is stored in 1 byte implies a x4 reduction in size.</p>



<p>Quantization is going to be critical in TinyML due to the limited resources available.</p>



<h3><span id="Knowledge_distillation">Knowledge distillation</span></h3>



<p>Apply our knowledge and know how to make the model small.</p>



<h2><span id="Tools">Tools</span></h2>



<p>We use Tensor Flow Lite. While tensorFlow is focused on ML Researcher, Tensor Flow Lite is for Application Developer.</p>



<h2><span id="Uses_of_TinyML">Uses of TinyML</span></h2>



<p>Although they are not cited, of course being on this website we can find <strong>uses of TinyML dedicated to the DIY, Maker and Hacker world</strong>.</p>



<h3><span id="Uses_of_TinyML_in_Industry">Uses of TinyML in Industry</span></h3>



<p>In Industry, in maintenance, to warn us when there are vibrations that indicate that there will be breakage, etc, etc. increases efficiency and reduces costs. The negative points are the accuracy that can give us false alarms. In case of false alarm whose responsibility is the operator or the system.</p>



<h3><span id="TinyML_in_the_environment">TinyML in the environment</span></h3>



<p>Instead of collecting data that then has to be processed, with TinyML we have real-time answers about changes in the environment, for example in the life of wild animals.</p>



<h3><span id="TinyML_for_humans">TinyML for humans</span></h3>



<p>Helps people with disabilities to perform more tasks without having to use their hands. Improving the UI and UX of applications to make them easier to use.</p>



<p>We build technology to improve our experience as humans. Technology has to help people</p>



<h2><span id="Risks_and_downsides">Risks and downsides</span></h2>



<ul>
<li>Will it work well across all population groups? </li>



<li>Is the privacy of our data assured? </li>



<li>Can we protect this data?</li>
</ul>



<p>We have to create technology based on human-centered AI. Design, development and deployment</p>

Those are some very big impacts. Now, let’s add in the nuance.</span></p><p><span>First, it is important to know that this effort was multidisciplinary, involving multiple types of experiments and hundreds of interviews, conducted by a great team, including the Harvard social scientists </span><a href="https://www.fabriziodellacqua.com/" rel="">Fabrizio Dell’Acqua</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=772797" rel="">Edward McFowland III</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=240491" rel="">Karim Lakhani</a><span>; </span><a href="https://www.hilalifshitz.com/" rel="">Hila Lifshitz-Assaf</a><span> from Warwick Business School and</span><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/kate-kellogg" rel=""> Katherine Kellogg </a><span>of MIT (plus myself). </span><a href="https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/contributors/saran-rajendran/" rel="">Saran Rajendran</a><span>, </span><a href="https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/contributors/lisa-krayer/" rel="">Lisa Krayer</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.bcg.com/about/people/experts/francois-candelon" rel="">François Candelon</a><span> ran the experiment on the BCG side, using a full 7% of its consulting force (758 consultants). They all did a lot of very careful work that goes far, far beyond the post. So, please </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321" rel="">look at the paper to make sure you get all the details</a><span> - especially if you have questions about numbers or methods. I need to simplify a lot to fit 58 pages of findings into a post, and any mistakes are mine, not my co-authors. Also, while we pre-registered these experiments, this is still a new working paper, so there might be errors or mistakes, and the paper is not yet peer-reviewed. With that in mind, let’s get to the details…</span></p><p>AI is weird. No one actually knows the full range of capabilities of the most advanced Large Language Models, like GPT-4. No one really knows the best ways to use them, or the conditions under which they fail. There is no instruction manual. On some tasks AI is immensely powerful, and on others it fails completely or subtly. And, unless you use AI a lot, you won’t know which is which.</p><p><span>The result is what we call the “Jagged Frontier” of AI. Imagine a fortress wall, with some towers and battlements jutting out into the countryside, while others fold back towards the center of the castle. That wall is the capability of AI, and the further from the center, the harder the task. Everything inside the wall can be done by the AI, everything outside is hard for the AI to do. The problem is that the wall is invisible, so some tasks that might logically seem to be the same distance away from the center, and therefore equally difficult – say, writing a sonnet and an exactly 50 word poem – are actually on different sides of the wall. The AI is great at the sonnet, but, because of how it conceptualizes the world in tokens, rather than words, it consistently produces poems of more or less than 50 words.&nbsp; Similarly, some unexpected tasks (</span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/automating-creativity" rel="">like idea generation</a><span>) are easy for AIs while other tasks that seem to be easy for machines to do (like basic math) are challenges for LLMs.</span></p><p>I asked the ChatGPT with Code Interpreter to visualize this for you:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png" width="330" height="336.1195054945055" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/237aac17-b0ac-4174-9c0b-6b3e5e9ba0be_1551x1580.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1483,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:330,&quot;bytes&quot;:93754,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Hey GPT, I want you to create an image to illustrate our new paper on the effects of AI and work.

We gave those who were allowed to use AI access to GPT-4, the same model everyone in 169 countries can access for free with Bing, or by paying $20 a month to OpenAI. No special fine-tuning or prompting, just GPT-4 through the API.</p><p>We then did a lot of pre-testing and surveying to establish baselines, and asked consultants to do a wide variety of work for a fictional shoe company, work that the BCG team had selected to accurately represent what consultants do. There were creative tasks (“Propose at least 10 ideas for a new shoe targeting an underserved market or sport.”), analytical tasks (“Segment the footwear industry market based on users.”), writing and marketing tasks (“Draft a press release marketing copy for your product.”), and persuasiveness tasks (“Pen an inspirational memo to employees detailing why your product would outshine competitors.”). We even checked with a shoe company executive to ensure that this work was realistic - they were. And, knowing AI, these are tasks that we might expect to be inside the frontier.</p><p>In line with our theories, and as we have discussed, we found that the consultants with AI access did significantly better, whether we briefly introduced them to AI first (the “overview” group in the diagram) or did not. This was true for every measurement, whether the time it took to complete tasks, the number of tasks completed overall (we gave them an overall time limit) or the quality of the outputs. We rated that quality using both human and AI graders, who agreed with each other (itself an interesting finding).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png" width="582" height="460.84435797665367" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1028,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:582,&quot;bytes&quot;:436765,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffa6d74-dc5d-45fc-9fe0-b1511556716a_1028x814.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We also found something else interesting, an effect that is increasingly apparent in other studies of AI: it works as a skill leveler. The consultants who scored the worst when we assessed them at the start of the experiment had the biggest jump in their performance, 43%, when they got to use AI. The top consultants still got a boost, but less of one. Looking at these results, I do not think enough people are considering what it means when a technology raises all workers to the top tiers of performance. It may be like how it used to matter whether miners were good or bad at digging through rock… until the steam shovel was invented and now differences in digging ability do not matter anymore. AI is not quite at that level of change, but skill levelling is going to have a big impact.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png" width="1228" height="610" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:610,&quot;width&quot;:1228,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:97820,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F970b3354-1bac-4146-a92f-57f65440f872_1228x610.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>But there is more to the story. BCG designed one more task, this one carefully selected to ensure that the AI couldn’t come to a correct answer. This wasn’t easy. As we say in the paper “since AI proved surprisingly capable, it was difficult to design a task in this experiment outside the AI’s frontier where humans with high human capital doing their job would consistently outperform AI.” But we identified a task that used the blind spots of AI to ensure it would give a wrong, but convincing, answer to a problem that humans would be able to solve. Indeed, human consultants got the problem right 84% of the time without AI help, but when consultants used the AI, they did worse – only getting it right 60-70% of the time.

In an experiment, he found that recruiters who used high-quality AI became lazy, careless, and less skilled in their own judgment. They missed out on some brilliant applicants and made worse decisions than recruiters who used low-quality AI or no AI at all. When the AI is very good, humans have no reason to work hard and pay attention. They let the AI take over, instead of using it as a tool. He called this “falling asleep at the wheel”, and it can hurt human learning, skill development, and productivity.</span></p><p>In our experiment, we also found that the consultants fell asleep at the wheel – those using AI actually had less accurate answers than those who were not allowed to use AI (but they still did a better job writing up the results than consultants who did not use AI). The authoritativeness of AI can be deceptive if you don’t know where the frontier lies.</p><p>But a lot of consultants did get both inside and outside the frontier tasks right, gaining the benefits of AI without the disadvantages. The key seemed to be following one of two approaches: becoming a Centaur or becoming a Cyborg. Fortunately, this does not involve any actual grafting of electronic gizmos to your body or getting cursed to turn into the half-human/half-horse of Greek myth. They are rather two approaches to navigating the jagged frontier of AI that integrates the work of person and machine.</p><p>Centaur work has a clear line between person and machine, like the clear line between the human torso and horse body of the mythical centaur. &nbsp;Centaurs have a strategic division of labor, switching between AI and human tasks, allocating responsibilities based on the strengths and capabilities of each entity. When I am doing an analysis with the help of AI, I often approach it as a Centaur. I will decide on what statistical techniques to do, but then let the AI handle producing graphs. In our study at BCG, centaurs would do the work they were strongest at themselves, and then hand off tasks inside the jagged frontier to the AI.</p><p><span>On the other hand, Cyborgs blend machine and person, integrating the two deeply. Cyborgs don't just delegate tasks; they intertwine their efforts with AI, moving back and forth over the jagged frontier. Bits of tasks get handed to the AI, such as initiating a sentence for the AI to complete, so that Cyborgs find themselves working in tandem with the AI. </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/embracing-weirdness-what-it-means" rel="">This is how I suggest approaching using AI for writing</a><span>, for example. It is also how I generated two of the illustrations in the paper (the Jagged Frontier image and the 54 line graph, both of which were built by ChatGPT, with my initial direction and guidance)</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png" width="1456" height="572" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:572,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:342709,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd38f8137-74ed-4772-b1e3-580a1c18f170_1955x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Our paper, along with a stream of excellent </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/secret-cyborgs-the-present-disruption" rel="">work </a><span>by other scholars, suggests that, regardless of the philosophic and technical debates over the nature and future of AI, it is already a powerful disrupter to how we actually work. And this is not a hyped new technology that will change the world in five years, or that requires a lot of investment and the resources of huge companies - it is here, NOW. The tools the elite consultants used to supercharge their work are the exact same as the ones available to everyone reading this post. And the tools the consultants used will soon be much worse than what is available to you. Because the technological frontier is not just jagged, it is expanding. I am very confident that in the next year, at least two companies will release models more powerful than GPT-4. The Jagged Frontier advances, and we have to be ready for that.</span></p><p>Even aside from any anxiety that statement might cause, it is also worth noting the other downsides of AI. People really can go on autopilot when using AI, falling asleep at the wheel and failing to notice AI mistakes. And, like other research, we also found that AI outputs, while of higher quality than that of humans, were also a bit homogenous and same-y in aggregate. Which is why Cyborgs and Centaurs are important - they allow humans to work with AI to produce more varied, more correct, and better results than either humans or AI can do alone. And becoming one is not hard. Just use AI enough for work tasks and you will start to see the shape of the jagged frontier, and start to understand where AI is scarily good... and where it falls short.</p><p>In my mind, the question is no longer about whether AI is going to reshape work, but what we want that to mean. We get to make choices about how we want to use AI help to make work more productive, interesting, and meaningful. But we have to make those choices soon, so that we can begin to actively use AI in ethical and valuable ways, as Cyborgs and Centaurs, rather than merely reacting to technological change. Meanwhile, the Jagged Frontier advances.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png" width="328" height="389.6967370441459" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1238,&quot;width&quot;:1042,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:328,&quot;bytes&quot;:462487,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e050e-a17e-41d4-9121-27cf464ab670_1042x1238.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mission Sending Files from Earth to a Satellite to Demonstrate How IPFS Can Improve Communications Across Long Distances</em></p><p>Filecoin Foundation (FF) successfully completed a first-of-its-kind mission deploying the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) in space. The recent demonstration involved sending files from Earth to orbit and back using an implementation of the IPFS protocol designed for space communications.</p><p>This mission, conducted with Lockheed Martin-developed software, demonstrated how IPFS – a decentralized content distribution system – can bring the benefits of decentralized technologies to space to enable better communications across long distances and resilience in challenging environments.</p><p>As part of the demonstration, <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf">the IPFS white paper</a> and an image of FF’s mascot (Biscuit, the “FileCorgi”) were transmitted to an orbiting LM LINUSS ™CubeSat and back using a purpose-built IPFS implementation that ran atop <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/lockheed-martin/en-us/news/features/2024/smartsat-equipped-satellite-uploads-new-mission-on-orbit.html">Lockheed Martin’s SmartSat technology</a>, a software platform that makes it easier to dynamically add and quickly change missions in orbit through simple app uploads.</p><p>This successful demonstration follows nearly three years of collaboration. FF and Lockheed Martin Space initially <a href="https://fil.org/blog/filecoin-foundation-and-lockheed-martin-bring-decentralized-storage-to-space/">announced the collaboration</a> in Davos in May 2022, and <a href="https://fil.org/blog/ff-x-lockheed-martin-mission-announcement/">announced details of the mission</a> in Davos in January 2023.</p><p>“IPFS is called the ‘interplanetary’ file system because, from the beginning, IPFS was envisioned as a technology that could enable networking in space,” said Marta Belcher, president and chair of FF. “We could not be more thrilled to make that vision a reality, thanks to the amazing team at Lockheed Martin Space.”</p><p>This mission demonstrates several key benefits of using IPFS for communications and networking in space:</p><p><em>Faster Communications</em> – Today’s centralized Internet model doesn’t work in space. In a centralized Internet model, data is retrieved from a particular server in a particular place. On Earth, the delay of retrieving that data may not be noticeable. But if you’re on the moon, there will be a multi-second delay each time you retrieve data from Earth. With IPFS, data doesn’t need to go back and forth from Earth with every click. That’s because, with IPFS, data is identified by what it is rather than where it is. Each piece of content has a unique “content ID.” When you look for a piece of content, that content is retrieved from wherever is closest, rather than being retrieved from a particular server in a particular place. That means if someone nearby already has that data, it only has to travel a short distance and can get to you quickly instead of traveling back and forth from Earth with every click.</p><p><em>Data Verification</em> – With IPFS, each piece of content has a unique identifier called a “content ID.” If a piece of content is altered, its content ID will be different as a result. That means that, by using IPFS, you can cryptographically verify that data has not been modified. This is also useful for authenticating data from space. For example, if a satellite takes photographs and then transmits them to the ground using IPFS, it is possible to cryptographically prove that those images were not tampered with, and are, in fact, the original images taken by the satellite.</p><p><em>Data Resilience</em> – One challenge with storing data in space is that the data can easily be corrupted by radiation, or the storage hardware can be damaged by debris. In a centralized Internet model, data is stored in a particular location on a particular piece of hardware, and when you are trying to retrieve that data, there is only one place you can retrieve it from. To put it another way: imagine that you recommend a book to a friend, but you don’t tell your friend the name of the book – instead, you tell your friend that the book is in the New York Public Library, on the third floor, on the second shelf from the left, five books over. That’s how today’s centralized Internet model works – you’re looking for content in a particular location on a particular server. But it makes much more sense to tell your friend the name of the book, and let them find it wherever is closest and most convenient. That’s how IPFS works. With IPFS, you can store many copies of the data in many different locations. When you retrieve data using IPFS, you are looking for a particular content ID rather than looking for data at a particular location. That content will be retrieved from wherever is closest – so if there are many copies of the data, it doesn’t matter if some of those copies have been lost or corrupted (as is often the case when data is being stored in space).</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
<article><header><time datetime="2024-01-16 12:27:07">
	16 ene 2024 / <a href="https://jcarlosroldan.com/code/">code</a>, <a href="https://jcarlosroldan.com/think/">think</a></time></header><p>It's no secret that authenticating into services is an unresolved topic. With time, we have managed to make them more secure, but that was at the expense of user experience. The new generation of mail codes and authenticator apps has moved us from the ease of one-click browser autocomplete to complex ordeals involving multiple steps and sometimes multiple devices.</p>
<p>Last month, I was logging into Notion after it automatically logged me out, and I couldn't help but think "It feels like I'm logging in here every second week; maybe I'm doing something wrong." After a long examination of the settings, I decided to open a ticket asking if the session length was indeed that short. The response from Notion's team was prompt and specific, a great example of customer service. However, the content of the answer was less pleasing.</p>
<p><img src="https://jcarlosroldan.com/static/172.png" alt="Notion response"></p>
<p>Notion is not alone in this; many other services enforce similarly short sessions and uncomfortable methods. This has me pondering the evolution of our authentication methods, from their ancient beginnings to modern complexities. Let's take a look at the history of authentication methods and rate them on two scales: user experience and security.</p>
<p>The first recorded password in western history is the book of Judges. Within the text, Gileadite soldiers used the word "shibboleth" to detect their enemies, the Ephraimites. The Ephraimites spoke in a different dialect so that they would say "sibboleth" instead. <strong>Experience ★★★★★:</strong> you just had to say a word. <strong>Security ☆☆☆☆☆:</strong> there's a single word to authenticate multiple users and it can be cracked by learning how to spell it.</p>
<p>Ancient Romans also relied on passwords in a similar manner called them "watchwords". Every night, roman military guards would pass around a wooden tablet with the watchword inscribed and every military man would pass the tablet around until every encampment marked their initials. During night patrols, soldiers would whisper the watchword to identify allies. <strong>Experience ★★★☆☆:</strong> you just had to say a word but you have to memorize it every day. <strong>Security ★☆☆☆☆:</strong> it changes every day, but it's still a single word, and without a "forgot password" button, a wrong answer would mean a spear in the gut.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the '20s, alcohol became illegal in the US, and speakeasies (illegal drinking establishments) were born. To enter the speakeasy, people had to quietly whisper a code word to keep law enforcement from finding out. Code words were ridiculous, to say the least: coffin varnish, monkey rum, panther sweat, and tarantula juice, to name a few. <strong>Experience ★★★★☆:</strong> you just had to say a word, and they were made to be memorable. <strong>Security ★☆☆☆☆:</strong> it's a single word, and it's not even a secret, but at least you don't get stabbed for getting it wrong.</p>
<p>The first recorded usage of a password in the digital age is attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_J._Corbat%C3%B3">Dr. Fernando Corbató</a>. In the 60's, monolithic machines could only work on one problem at a time, which meant that the queue of jobs waiting to be processed was huge and a lot of processing time was lost. He developed an operating system called the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) that broke large processing tasks into smaller components and gave small slices of time to each task. Since multiple users were sharing one computer, files had to be assigned to individual researchers and available only to them, so he gave every user a unique name and password to access their files stored in the database. However, these passwords were stored in a plaintext file in the computer and there were a few cases of accidental and intentional password leaks. <strong>Experience ★★★☆☆:</strong> you have to remember a user and password. <strong>Security ★★☆☆☆:</strong> it's one per user, but they're stored in plaintext.</p>
<p>To prevent the problem of plaintext passwords, <a href="https://jcarlosroldan.com/files/MorrisThompson79-password-hashing.pdf">Robert Morris and Ken Thompson</a> developed a simulation of a World War 2 crypto machine that scrambled the password before storing it into the system. This way, the system could ask for the password, scramble it, and compare it to the scrambled password stored in the system, a process called one-way hashing. This simulation was included in 6th Edition Unix in 1974, and got several improvements up to our days, but the basic idea remains the same. <strong>Experience ★★★☆☆:</strong> you have to remember a user and password. <strong>Security ★★★☆☆:</strong> it's no longer plaintext, but stealing it would still give you access to the system.</p>
<p><img src="https://jcarlosroldan.com/static/173.png" alt="A Hagelin rotor crypto machine"></p>
<p>Over time, many different problems arised from the fact that people use the same password for multiple services, so the industry started to push for unique passwords for each service. This was a problem for users, since they had to remember a lot of passwords, and password managers were borned. The first password manager was developed by <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> in 1997, and currently every major browser comes with a built-in one, often with an option to generate strong passwords and store them for you. <strong>Experience ★★★★☆:</strong> you have to remember a master password, but the browser remembers the rest. <strong>Security ★★★★☆:</strong> it's no longer plaintext, but the master password is the weakest link in the chain.</p>
<p>Phishing attacks and data breaches have made passwords a liability, so the industry has been pushing for multiple-factor authentication (MFA) for a while now. 2FA is a method of authentication that requires two different factors to verify your identity. The first factor is usually something you know, like a password, and the second factor is something you have, like a phone. This way, even if someone steals your password, they still need your phone to log in. There is a myriad of ways to implement 2FA, but the most common ones are SMS codes, authenticator apps, and mail codes. It is often used in conjunction with very short session lengths. <strong>Experience ☆☆☆☆☆:</strong> you have to remember something, have a phone or mail app, and it requires multiple steps. <strong>Security ★★★★☆:</strong> it's no longer a single factor, but it's still vulnerable to phishing attacks.</p>
<p>I, like most people, hate passwords and all means of authentication bureaucracy. And it looks like we're now at the lowest point in history in terms of UX. There is still hope with the rise of Single Sign-On (SSO) and biometrics. And certainly <a href="https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/">passkeys</a>, which are getting a lot of traction lately, are a step in the right direction.

Child custody is one of them.<p>I think with legal docs generally, you have to decide what the stakes are and act accordingly. In general, keep in mind that most lawyers won't take a case unless there's someone with deep pockets to sue. So for that $20k loan you give to a friend, a boilerplate template is fine; if they don't want to pay you back, a lawsuit is gonna cost you more than the loan anyway. You've got a new startup for website monitoring with 20 customers? Worry about growing your userbase, not the remote chance that you get sued and something in the boilerplate docs you used wasn't worded properly (of course, once you raise significant money or have significant revenue, those legal docs become much more important, and also this doesn't apply if you are working on something with significant risk, such as a medical device).</p><p>But child custody isn't one of those things. It is high stakes, the chances that your counterparty will sue you are very high, and a bad outcome might be one of the worst things that can happen to you. Personally, the possibility of losing custody of my children would be much more worrying to me than any financial lawsuit.

          - Insurance requirements from your insurer or your clients insurer
          - Clauses not there that should be there
          - Clauses there that are not good enough
          - Clauses there that should not be there
</code></pre>
Free/cheap docs are all fun and games until the shit hits the fan and you need to rely on them.  Its at that point you'll find yourself wishing you ponied up for a lawyer. Trust me, been there, done that, got the postcard, never again.<p>Paying a lawyer to help you with legal documents is a necessary business expense.  Just like paying taxes, either you pay upfront or you pay the penalty later.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nashby.github.io/2024/01/15/ruby-3-on-rails-1/">https://nashby.github.io/2024/01/15/ruby-3-on-rails-1/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39012235">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p><span>15 Jan 2024</span></p><p><code>Rails 8.0</code> has recently branched out on Github, and I found myself curious about the feasibility of running <code>Rails 1.0</code> on the latest Ruby version. While I was pretty sure it wouldn’t work right off the bat, I wondered: how many modifications would be necessary to at least reach the iconic “Welcome aboard! You’re riding the Rails!” screen?</p>

<p>So, let’s dive in. My starting point was this Gemfile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>source</span> <span>"https://rubygems.org"</span>
<span>gem</span> <span>"rails"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since I knew that it would be required to make some changes to Rails gems I install it with <code>bundle install --local</code>. This would allow for easier modifications later on. My first attempt was running <code>bundle exec rails --help</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>/activesupport-1.2.5/lib/active_support/inflector.rb:157: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting `then' or ',' or ';' or '\n' (SyntaxError)
        when 1: "#{number}st"
              ^
</code></pre></div>

<p>Indeed, older Ruby versions allowed the use of a colon in place of <code>then</code> in case/when expressions. This syntax is no longer supported, so I updated it across the codebase to match the current Ruby syntax.</p>

<p>Ok let’s try again with <code>bundle exec rails --help</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>cannot load such file -- parsedate (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh yeah, <code>parsedate</code> lib that was shipped with <code>Ruby 1.8</code> is not longer there. It was used to parse date strings, like so:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ParseDate</span><span>.</span><span>parsedate</span> <span>"Tuesday, July 5th, 2007, 18:35:20 UTC"</span>
<span># =&gt; [2007, 7, 5, 18, 35, 20, "UTC", 2]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not sure why it was returning an array but ok. Now I can replace it with <code>DateTime.parse</code> that returns <code>DateTime</code> object. So I’ve fixed that and tried to run it again. Ugh, another error:</p>

<div><pre><code>rails-1.0.0/lib/rails_generator/options.rb:124: syntax error, unexpected '[', expecting '|' (SyntaxError)
...make any changes.') { |options[:pretend]| }
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s some weird syntax. Turns out you could assign something to a hash right inside the block variable thing:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>opt</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'-p'</span><span>,</span> <span>'--pretend'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Run but do not make any changes.'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>options</span><span>[</span><span>:pretend</span><span>]</span><span>|</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>meaning that whatever you pass as <code>-p</code> option will end up being assigned to <code>options[:pretend]</code>. Basically it equals to</p>

<div><pre><code><span>opt</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'-p'</span><span>,</span> <span>'--pretend'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Run but do not make any changes.'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>o</span><span>|</span> <span>options</span><span>[</span><span>:pretend</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>o</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alrighty then. Rerun <code>bundle exec rails --help</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>no implicit conversion of Enumerator into Array
</code></pre></div>

<p>And it’s without any stacktrace. Great. Looks like something catches all the errors and just prints them. After
some investigation I’ve found this code:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>cache</span>
  <span>@cache</span> <span>||=</span> <span>sources</span><span>.</span><span>inject</span><span>([])</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>cache</span><span>,</span> <span>source</span><span>|</span> <span>cache</span> <span>+</span> <span>source</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In Ruby 1.8 <code>[].map</code> would return an array but now it returns <code>Enumerator</code> object and you can concat an <code>Array</code> with
<code>Enumerator</code> hence the error:</p>

<div><pre><code>irb(main):001&gt; [] + [].map
(irb):1:in `+': no implicit conversion of Enumerator into Array (TypeError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s an easy fix though. Let’s just call <code>.to_a</code> on the <code>source</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>def cache
  @cache ||= sources.inject([]) { |cache, source| cache + source.to_a }
end
</code></pre></div>

<p>Are we getting there?</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails --help

`load': cannot load such file -- config.rb (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>The code in question is</p>

<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'rbconfig'</span>

<span>DEFAULT_SHEBANG</span> <span>=</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>Config</span><span>::</span><span>CONFIG</span><span>[</span><span>'bindir'</span><span>],</span>
                            <span>Config</span><span>::</span><span>CONFIG</span><span>[</span><span>'ruby_install_name'</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Makes sense, in old Ruby <code>RbConfig</code> could be referenced with <code>Config</code> constant and now it’s only <code>RbConfig</code>. Fixed. Does it work now?</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails --help

Usage: /vendor/bundle/ruby/3.3.0/bin/rails /path/to/your/app [options]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Great Scott! It works! Let’s try to generate a new app:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails blog

undefined method `exists?' for class File
</code></pre></div>

<p>Dammit, <code>File.exists?</code>/<code>FileTest.exists?</code> were removed in Ruby 1.9. Let’s replace it with <code>File.exist?</code>/<code>FileTest.exist?</code> and try again:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails blog
      create
      create  app/controllers
      create  app/helpers
      create  app/models
      create  app/views/layouts
      create  config/environments
      create  components
      create  db
      create  doc
      create  lib
      create  lib/tasks
      create  log
      create  public/images
      create  public/javascripts
      create  public/stylesheets
      create  script/performance
      create  script/process
      create  test/fixtures
      create  test/functional
      create  test/mocks/development
      create  test/mocks/test
      create  test/unit
      create  vendor
      create  vendor/plugins
      create  Rakefile
      create  README
      create  app/controllers/application.rb
Cannot create Binding object for non-Ruby caller
</code></pre></div>

<p>Success! Is it though? It has generated an app but all the files are empty. And if you have a sharp eye you’ll have noticed this error:</p>

<div><pre><code>Cannot create Binding object for non-Ruby caller
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, no stacktracks, just some plain error. It took me some time to locate that line of code that was failing with such error but here it is:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>file</span><span>(</span><span>relative_source</span><span>,</span> <span>relative_destination</span><span>,</span> <span>template_options</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>file</span><span>|</span>
  <span># Evaluate any assignments in a temporary, throwaway binding.</span>
  <span>vars</span> <span>=</span> <span>template_options</span><span>[</span><span>:assigns</span><span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>{}</span>
  <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>binding</span>
  <span>vars</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>k</span><span>,</span><span>v</span><span>|</span> <span>eval</span> <span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>k</span><span>}</span><span> = vars[:</span><span>#{</span><span>k</span><span>}</span><span>] || vars['</span><span>#{</span><span>k</span><span>}</span><span>']"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>}</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Believe me, I really tried to figure you what this error was about given that it’s obviously a Ruby caller but luck wasn’t there for me. Then I tried to replace <code>binding</code> with <code>Kernel.binding</code>
and it worked… If you know what’s going on here please let me know! Maybe Rails were redefining <code>binding</code> somewhere?</p>

<p>Alright, let’s proceed:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec rails blog
      create
      create  app/controllers
      create  app/helpers
      create  app/models
      ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally! The app is generated, files are not empty. We’re close, I can smell it! Let’s try to start it:</p>

<div><pre><code> bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

`require': cannot load such file -- script/../config/boot (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sure, just some random load error. Turns out in Ruby 1.8 you could require a file with relative to current file path and now you can’t:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># In Ruby 1.8</span>
<span>require</span> <span>File</span><span>.</span><span>dirname</span><span>(</span><span>__FILE__</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>'/../config/boot'</span>

<span># In Ruby 1.9+</span>
<span>require_relative</span> <span>'../config/boot'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this one fixed we can try it one more time:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...

activerecord-1.13.2/lib/active_record/base.rb:708: circular argument reference - table_name (SyntaxError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ok this one should be trivial. The code in question:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>class_name</span><span>(</span><span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>table_name</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’m a bit surprised that this was working in Ruby 1.8. The error is pretty self-explanatory so I just renamed default argument value and continued with my life:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...

`load': cannot load such file -- big_decimal.rb (LoadError)
Did you mean?  bigdecimal
</code></pre></div>

<p>Right, <code>bigdecimal</code> is not required by default now. I’ll spare you some time and say that there was the same issue
with <code>rexml</code> and <code>net-smtp</code> gems (<code>net-smtp</code> is not even part of Ruby anymore and I had to add it to the <code>Gemfile</code>). So I fixed it and tried again:</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...
actionmailer-1.1.5/lib/action_mailer/quoting.rb:22: invalid multibyte escape: /[\000-\011\013\014\016-\037\177-\377]/ (SyntaxError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh yeah, Ruby 1.9 did a lot of changes to string encoding (you can read more on this <a href="http://graysoftinc.com/character-encodings/ruby-19s-string">here</a>) and now using raw bytes doesn’t work anymore. So I believe we can convert it to <code>/[\x00-\x11\x13\x14\x16-\x1F\x7F-\xFF]/n</code> and it’s going to work? Well, at least the issue was fixed (yeah, yeah who cares if we’ve just introduced some vulnerability? I don’t):</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...
`require': cannot load such file -- soap/rpc/driver (LoadError)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh ffs. It comes from <code>action_web_service</code> (god knows what was that back in the days) and lucky us we can remove this Rails component
from our stack with this config:</p>

<div><pre><code># Skip frameworks you're not going to use
config.frameworks -= [ :action_web_service ]
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nashby/nashby.github.io/assets/200500/1b81569a-5265-4e37-8d33-596c1c130f4b" alt="image"></p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

`require': cannot load such file -- soap/rpc/driver (LoadError)

rails-1.0.0/lib/rails_info.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected ')' (SyntaxError)
        map {|(name, )| name}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Cool cool, you could do <code>.map { |(param1, )| param1 }</code> in Ruby 1.8 to ommit the second block param. You can actually do it in Ruby 3.3 but you don’t need this extra comma:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>c: </span><span>3</span><span>}.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>|</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span> <span># =&gt; [:a, :b, :c]</span>
<span># or</span>
<span>{</span><span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>c: </span><span>3</span><span>}.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span>|</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span> <span># =&gt; [:a, :b, :c]</span>
<span># without</span>
<span>{</span><span>a: </span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>c: </span><span>3</span><span>}.</span><span>map</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>a</span><span>|</span> <span>a</span> <span>}</span> <span># =&gt;[[:a, 1], [:b, 2], [:c, 3]]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And one more time…</p>

<div><pre><code>bundle exec ruby script/server -p 3001

=&gt; Booting WEBrick...

</code></pre></div>

<p>Oh my God, we did it!</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nashby/nashby.github.io/assets/200500/3710f177-d1ad-47df-9d0c-b80670bf427e" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 21 24 54"></p>

<p>If for some reason you want to check the code here it is: https://github.com/nashby/rails-from-the-past</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure there are way more issues to fix to make it work properly but I’m not going to do it.
I’m just happy enough that I’ve got to the point where I can see this greeting screen! Fin.</p>

<p>And may Ruby be with you!</p>

<p>I originally wrote this blog post in 2019 (or maybe 2018 - my timestamps say that it was written before 1 May 2019). Recently I decided to revisit my old blog and found that <code>std::clamp</code> still generates less efficient assembly than <code>std::min(max, std::max(min, v))</code> even on the latest versions of GCC (13.2) and Clang (17.0.1).</p>
<p>Here’s my old blog post:</p>

<li><a href="#using-stdclamp">Using std::clamp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say you want to clamp a value v between 2 values, min and max. If v is greater than max, return max. If v is smaller than min, return min. Otherwise return v.</p>
<h2 id="ternary">Ternary</h2>
<p>Implementing it directly as per the description:</p>
<pre><code><span>double</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>double</span> v<span>,</span> <span>double</span> min<span>,</span> <span>double</span> max<span>)</span><span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> v <span>&lt;</span> min<span>?</span> min <span>:</span> v <span>&gt;</span> max<span>?</span> max <span>:</span> v<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>Identical output. Much better than before. Can we do better?</p>

<p>This is the idiomatic way to do clamp in C++ (and most other languages):</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;algorithm&gt;</span></span>
<span>double</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>double</span> v<span>,</span> <span>double</span> min<span>,</span> <span>double</span> max<span>)</span><span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> std<span>::</span><span>min</span><span>(</span>max<span>,</span> std<span>::</span><span>max</span><span>(</span>min<span>,</span> v<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>gcc 8.2:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):
        maxsd   xmm0, xmm1
        minsd   xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>clang 7.0:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):                            # @clamp(double, double, double)
        maxsd   xmm0, xmm1
        minsd   xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>Also seems to generate the best code.</p>

<p>Not very efficient.</p>
<p>EDIT: It’s been almost 5 years since I originally wrote this article, so I decided to try again using the latest versions of GCC and Clang:</p>
<p>gcc 13.2:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):
        maxsd   xmm1, xmm0
        minsd   xmm2, xmm1
        movapd  xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>clang 17.0.1:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):                            # @clamp(double, double, double)
        maxsd   xmm1, xmm0
        minsd   xmm2, xmm1
        movapd  xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>Still not the most efficient - it uses one more instruction than the <code>std::min(max, std::max(min, v))</code> implementation.</p>
<p>But how does the fastest implementation work you ask? Going through the code line by line:</p>
<pre><code>clamp(double, double, double):
        maxsd   xmm0, xmm1
        minsd   xmm0, xmm2
        ret
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>maxsd xmm0, xmm1</code> puts the max value of xmm0 and xmm1 into xmm0.</p>
<p>The <code>minsd xmm0, xmm2</code> puts the min value of xmm0 and xmm2 into xmm0.</p>
<p>Thus, after the first line, xmm0 contains the max of the lower bound and the value.</p>
<p>And after the second line, xmm0 contains the min of the upper bound and the previous result.</p>
<p>But let’s step through with gdb to confirm.</p>
<p>Source code:</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;algorithm&gt;</span></span>

<p>Pretty cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found it surprising that <code>std::clamp</code> still generates less efficient assembly than <code>std::min(max, std::max(min, v))</code> even on the latest versions of GCC (13.2) and Clang (17.0.1).</p>

      After a piece of software incorrectly showed that money had gone missing, a trusted, centuries-old British government corporation used its financial and legal might to convict and bankrupt hundreds of people who ran its branches. Some family members say their loved-ones were left so distressed they took their own lives.

      This could be the plot of a dystopian novel, but it describes the real-life ordeal that scores of the so-called sub-postmasters of the UK Post Office went through between 1999 and 2015. The government —&nbsp;which owns the Post Office — has described the scandal as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history.

      Over two decades, livelihoods and reputations were destroyed, families shattered, and savings lost. Out of thousands of affected sub-postmasters who ran small businesses in communities across Britain, 700 were convicted of criminal offences. Some spent time in prison.

      Jo Hamilton was running a post office in a small village in southern England in 2003 when her Horizon computer started to show a shortfall of £2,000 ($2,500). When she ran the numbers again, she told CNN, that amount “doubled in front of (her) eyes.”

The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says the government will introduce a new law to &quot;swiftly exonerate and compensate victims&quot; of wrongful prosecution of Post Office workers over a 16-year period starting just before the new millennium. Between 1999 and 2015, more than 700 Post Office branch managers received criminal convictions, and some were sent to prison, when the faulty Horizon IT system made it appear that money was missing from their sites. To date, 93 of these convictions have been overturned, leaving many others still fighting their convictions or to receive compensation. A recent television docudrama has thrust the issue back in the spotlight.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://1a3orn.com/sub/machine-learning-bans.html">https://1a3orn.com/sub/machine-learning-bans.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39009779">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've seen a few conversations where someone says something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been using an open-source LLM lately -- I'm a huge fan of not depending on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. But I'm really sad that the AI safety groups are trying to ban the kind of open-source LLM that I'm using.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone then responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What! Almost no one <em>actually</em> wants to ban open source AI of the kind that you're using! That's just a recklessly-spread myth! AI Safety orgs just want to ban a tiny handful of future models -- no one has tried to pass laws that would have banned current open-sourced models!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This second claim is false.</p>
<p>Many AI "safety" organizations or people have in the past advocated bans that would have criminalized the open-sourcing of models <em>currently extant</em> as of now, January 2024. Even more organizations have pushed for bans that would cap open source AI capabilities at more or less exactly their current limits.</p>
<p>(I use open-sourcing broadly to refer to making weights generally available, not always to specific open-source compliant licensing.)</p>
<p>At least a handful of the organizations that have pushed for such bans are well-funded and becoming increasingly well-connected to policy makers.</p>
<p>Note that I think it's <em>entirely understandable</em> that someone would not realize such bans have been the goal of some AI safety orgs!</p>
<p>For comprehensible reasons -- i.e., how many people judge such policies to be a horrible idea, including many people interested in AI safety -- such AI safety organizations have often directed the documents explaining their proposed policies to bureaucrats, legislative staffers, and so on, and not been proactive in communicating their goals to the public.</p>
<p>Note also that <strong>not all</strong> AI safety organizations or AI-safety concerned people are trying to do this -- although, to be honest, a disturbing number are.</p>
<p>At least a handful of people in some organizations believe -- as do I -- that open source has been increasingly <a href="https://www.beren.io/2023-11-05-Open-source-AI-has-been-vital-for-alignment/">vital for AI safety work</a>. Given how <em>past</em> ban proposals would have been harmful, I think many future such proposals are therefore likely to be harmful as well, especially given that the arguments for them look pretty much identical.</p>
<p>Anyhow, a partial list:</p>
<h2><strong>1: Center for AI Safety</strong></h2>
<p>The Center for AI Safety is a well-funded (i.e., with &gt; <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?organization-name=center-for-ai-safety">9 million USD</a>) 501c3 that focuses mostly on AI safety research and on outreach. You've probably heard of them because they gathered signatures for their <a href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk">sentence</a> about AI safety.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they are also involved in policy. In response to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) request for comment they <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/NTIA-2023-0005-1416">sent</a> proposed regulatory rules to them.</p>
<p>These rules propose defining "powerful AI systems" as any systems that meet or exceed certain measures for any of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Computational resources used to train the system</strong> (e.g., 10^23 floating-point operations or “training FLOP”; this is approximately the amount of FLOP required to train GPT-3. Note that this threshold would be updated over time in order to account for algorithmic improvements.) [Note from 1a3orn; this means updated downwards]</p>
<p><strong>Large parameter count</strong> (e.g., 80B parameters)</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark performance</strong> (e.g., &gt; 70% performance on the Multi-task Language Understanding benchmark (MMLU))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Systems meeting any of these requirements, according to the proposal, are subject to a number of requirements that would effectively ban open-sourcing them.</p>
<p>Llama 2 was trained with &gt; 10^23 FLOPs, and thus would have been banned beneath this rule. Fine-tunes of Llama 2 also obtain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/159l9ll/llama270bguanacoqlora_becomes_the_first_model_on/">greater than 70%</a>on the MMLU and thus <em>also</em> would have been banned beneath this rule.</p>
<p>Note that -- despite how this would have prevented the release of Llama 2, and thus thousands of fine-tunes, and enormous quantities of <a href="https://www.beren.io/2023-11-05-Open-source-AI-has-been-vital-for-alignment/">safety research</a> -- the document boasts that its proposals "only regulate a small fraction of the overall AI development ecosystem."</p>
<h2><strong>2: Center for AI Policy</strong></h2>
<p>The Center for AI Policy -- different from the Center for AI Safety! -- is a DC-based lobbying organization. The announcement they <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/unwRBRQivd2LYRfuP/introducing-the-center-for-ai-policy-and-we-re-hiring">made</a> about their existence made some waves -- because the rules that they initially proposed would have required the <em>already-released</em> Llama-2 to be regulated by a new agency.</p>
<p>However, in a recent interview they <a href="https://www.thebayesianconspiracy.com/2023/12/202-the-center-for-ai-policy-talks-government-regulation/">say</a> that they're "trying to use the lightest touch we can -- we're trying to use a scalpel." Does this mean that they have changed their views?</p>
<p>Well, they haven't made any legislation they're proposing visible yet. But in the same interview they say that models trained with more than 3x10^24 FLOPs or getting &gt; 85 on the MMLU would be in their "high risk" category, which according to the interview explicitly means they would be banned from being open sourced.</p>
<p>This would have outlawed the <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon-180b">Falcon 180b</a> by its FLOP measure, although -- to be fair -- the Falcon 180b was open-sourced by an organization in the United Arab Emirates, so it's not certain that it would matter.</p>
<p>As far as the MMLU measure, no open source model at this level has <em>yet</em> been released, but GPT-4 scores ~90% on the MMLU. Thus, this amounts to a law attempting to permanently crimp open source models beneath GPT-4 levels, an event I otherwise think is reasonably likely in 2024.</p>
<p>(I do not understand why AI safety orgs think that MMLU scores are a good way to measure danger.)</p>
<h2><strong>3: Palisade Research</strong></h2>
<p>This non-profit, headed by Jeffrey Ladish, has as its stated goal to "create concrete demonstrations of dangerous capabilities to advise policy makers and the public on AI risks." That is, they try to make LLMs do dangerous or scary things so politicians will do particular things for them.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Ladish himself literally <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1654319741501333504">called for government to stop the release of Llama 2, saying "we can prevent the release of a LLaMA 2! We need government action on this asap."</a></p>
<p>(He also said that he thought it would potentially cause millions of dollars of damage, and was <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1666653302355009537">more likely</a> to cause <strong>more</strong> than a billion dollars of damage than to cause less than a million.)</p>
<h2><strong>4. The Future Society</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/">The Future Society</a> is a think tank whose <a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/about-us/">goal</a> is to "align artificial intelligence through better governance." They boast 60 partners such as UNESCO and the Future of Life Institute, and claim to have spoke to over 8,000 "senior decision makers" and taught 4,000 students. They aim to provide guidance to both the EU and the US.</p>
<p>In one of their premier policy documents, <a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/heavy-is-the-head-that-wears-the-crown.pdf">"Heavy is the head that wears the crown"</a>, they define "Type 2" General Purpose AI (GPAI) as a kind trained with &gt; 10^23 FLOPs (but less than 10^26) or scoring &gt; 68% (but less than 88%) on the MMLU. Llama-2, again, falls into this category on both counts.</p>
<p>The document mandates that anyone creating a Type 2 GPAI must -- well, must do many things -- but must provide for "Absolute Trustworthiness," which seems to mean that the model must be incapable of doing anything bad whatsoever, and more to the point means that the provider of the model must be able to "retract already deployed models (roll-back &amp; shutdowns)." Open source models would be unable to meet this requirement, obviously.</p>
<p>Similarly, they say that providers would be "required to <strong>continuously monitor the model’s capabilities and behaviour</strong>, detecting any anomalies and escalating cases of concern to relevant decision makers," which is again impossible to do with an open source model.</p>
<p>Note that in accord with their policy recommendations, this group specifically calls out Meta's actions, dubbing the open-sourcing of Llama a "particularly egregious case of misuse." They also seem to believe that Apache licensing is unacceptable, explicitly calling the "no guarantee of fitness of purpose" clause in such a license "abusive."</p>
<p>Don't worry, though! The Future Society says that they <a href="https://thefuturesociety.org/about-us/">believe</a> that "legitimate and sustainable governance requires bringing to the table many different perspectives."</p>
<p>(My guess is that this is one of the major teams responsible trying to get the EU's rules to ban open source AI, but the institutional process by which the EU works is completely opaque to me and so I am only left guessing.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Note that the above is just a partial list of organizations or people who have made their policies or goals extremely explicit.</p>
<p>There are other organizations or people out there whose policies are less legible, but ultimately are equally opposed to open sourcing. Consider, for instance, <a href="https://www.safer-ai.org/">SaferAI</a> , whose CEO says he's fine <a href="https://x.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1710062142559285560?s=20">"with developing and deploying open source up to somewhere around Llama-1"</a>; or the <a href="https://pauseai.info/proposal">PauseAI</a> people, who think we should need approvals for training runs <a href="https://pauseai.info/proposal">"above a certain size (e.g. 1 billion parameters)"</a> and who accused <a href="https://metaprotest.org/">Meta of reckless irresponsibility</a> for releasing Llama-2.</p>
<p>Or there is the extremely questionable <a href="https://www.stop.ai/proposals">StopAI</a> group advised by Conjecture, which wishes to eliminate not merely all open source but all AI trained with &gt; 10^23 FLOPs.</p>
<p>Or there are surprisingly numerous people who want to completely change liability law, so that you cannot open-source a model without becoming liable for damage that it causes.</p>
<p>These and similar statements from them either outright imply or would be <em>hard to separate</em> from policies that would have effectively banned currently-extant open-source.</p>
<p>So, again -- it's <strong>just false</strong> to say that if AI safety groups haven't tried to ban models that already exist. They <em>already</em> would have banned models that are actively being used, if they had had their way in the past. They would have substantially contributed to a corporate monopoly on LLMs.</p>
<p>If you are like me, and think the proposed policies mentioned above are pretty bad -- the stupidity of a law in no way prevents it from being passed! The above groups have not dissolved in the last 6 months. They still hope to pass something like these measures. They are still operating on the same questionable epistemology.</p>
<p>The open-source AI movement is in general is <em>far behind</em> these groups and needs to get its legislative act together if the better organized "anti-open source" movement is not to obliterate it.</p>
<p>And I think it is better to call it the "anti-open source" movement than the AI safety movement.</p>
<p>The "environmentalist" movement helped get nuclear power plants effectively banned, thereby crippling a safe and low-carbon source of energy, causing immense harm to the environment and to humanity by doing so. They thought they were helping the environment. They were not.</p>
<p>I think that some sectors of the "AI safety" movement are likely on their way to doing a similar thing, by preventing human use of, and research into, an easily-steerable and deeply non-rebellious form of intelligence.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><p>I always liked <a href="https://3.14.by/en/read/toshiba-libretto-50ct">small laptops</a> and phones - but for some reason they fell out of favor of manufacturers ("bigger is more better"). Now if one wanted to get tiny laptop - one of the few opportunities would have been to fight for old Sony UMPC's on ebay which are somewhat expensive even today. Recently Raspberry Pi/CM4-based tiny laptops started to appear - especially <a href="https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-devterm">clockwork</a> products are neat, but they are not foldable like a laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced <a href="https://sipeed.com/licheepi4a">Lichee Console 4A</a> based on RISC-V SoC - I preordered it immediately and in early January I finally received it. Results of my testing, currently uncovered issues are below.<br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv0.jpg"></p><h2>Brief specs and internals</h2><p>
First of all, Lichee Console is tiny, 185 x 140 x 19 mm, 656g. Build is solid and high-quality, using mostly aluminum.  Keyboard has typical laptop key travel and to my feel comparable to Lenovo's but it is of course quite a bit smaller. I cannot type on it blindly (yet), but it is possible. The only inconvenient part of keyboard (in context of Linux) is compressed keys [,][.][/], which are often used in console. Trackpoint mouse is ok for someone who had it all these years on Lenovo laptops. </p><p>Lichee Console 4A runs on T-Head (Alibaba) TH1520 quad-core RISC-V SoC (4x <a href="https://img.102.alibaba.com/1627958419409/49652c9412c41cb6f39b36fed1244e6e.pdf">C910</a> cores). While TH1520 can clock up to 2.0/2.5Ghz, in Lichee Console it is tamed down to 1.5Ghz max, likely to help with thermal dissipation. Maximum configuration is quite serious for such tiny thing: maximum of 16Gb DDR4 RAM (I got this version) and maximum of 128Gb eMMC. There is a slot for 42mm SATA M.2 SSD, but it connected via ASM1153 USB3.0-&gt;SATA adapter. More on that later. </p><p>I would prefer working on M.2 SSD as you can keep the data if something else fails (eMMC is soldered on the board and will be expensive to recover). 42mm SATA SSD's are not very popular, and the best I was able to find was Transcend MTS400 256Gb (it is still in transit). There are many such SSD's from Chinese brands though. </p><p>Display has resolution of 1280x800 and looks to be IPS. No color shift at high angles. There is a webcam on the left side of the monitor - it is average quality full HD 30p (requires good lighting), landscape orientation. It is possible to connect external display via mini-HDMI (cable included). It worked fine on FullHD monitor, but unstable/non-working on 4k. </p><p>Battery is 2S 3000mAh. Charging can be done through USB-C (maximum 5V 2.2A, does not trigger 9/12V) or via 12V jack (which I personally will not use). 12V power brick came with Chinese/US plug, so if you want to use it - you will need an adapter. Jack external diameter is 3.45mm (central positive), if you would want to find a 12V PD trigger adapter for it (something <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006065089042.html">like this</a> but double check voltage). More on battery life below.</p><p>On the software side - Debian 12 with Xfce is preinstalled, built for 64-bit RISC-V. WiFi or Ethernet connection was straightforward, and Chrome-based browser was able to play YouTube video with no issues. apt update fetches packages from Chinese server. </p><p>Unboxing video below (no comments):</p><iframe width="1000" height="592" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8xCDL67qUU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><b>Build quality</b>:<br>
There was only 1 build quality issue on my sample: apparently aluminum bottom part of case was squeezing keyboard, or something was pressing and bending keyboard outwards slightly (~1mm), which was catching screen bottom when opening and making unhealthy snapping sound. After reassembly &amp; pressing on keyboard in the middle - the issue was resolved. </p><p>Disassembly/assembly is relatively complicated due to tight fit of aluminum bottom cover, and I do not recommend to disassemble the unit unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>I do not like metal clips holding lithium battery in place. After enough vibration and abuse, some swelling on the battery it is not unthinkable that they might bite into the battery and destroy the unit. Even if 0.1% of units will burn down due to this potential issue - this will be very sad. Plastic bracket for the battery or glue in place (unliked by many and hard to service) are well tested by the industry and safe. What makes it hard to do well is flex cables under the battery. On my unit I added kapton tape under and over the metal bracket to ensure it does not wiggle over the battery and has a harder time biting into the battery.<br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv1.jpg"></p><p>Unlike most laptops, Lichee Console uses 2 PCB's in addition to SOC module, and this will bite us later. IO board has microsd card slot, USB and analog audio. <br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv2.jpg"></p><p>SoC module is removable. Heat is transferred via silicon pad to a heatpipe glued to aluminum back cover. <br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv3.jpg"></p><h2>Benchmarks &amp; tests</h2>
<p><b>CPU &amp; Power</b></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>TH1520 @1.5Ghz</td><td>Raspberry Pi 4</td><td>Raspberry Pi 5</td></tr>
<tr><td>idle power</td><td>7.68 / 6W (with/without screen)</td><td>1.93W</td><td>2.42W</td></tr>
<tr><td>CoreMark 1 core</td><td>6900</td><td>7938</td><td>17725</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power 1 core</td><td>8.376W (with screen)</td><td>2.70W</td><td>4.47W</td></tr>
<tr><td>CoreMark 4 cores</td><td>25689</td><td>31532</td><td>69860</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power 4 cores</td><td>9.408W (with screen)</td><td>4.85W</td><td>7.35W</td></tr></tbody></table><p>
Here performance is slightly behind Raspberry Pi 4 due to clock speed being reduced from 2.0 to 1.5Ghz. Personally I find performance of Raspberry Pi 4 perfectly acceptable for console work, and I am satisfied with performance of TH1520 for my use. I have included Raspberry Pi 5 for comparison as it's already 2024, and later this year we'll (hopefully) see competing products using CM5. </p><p>What I don't like though is high static power consumption of Lichee Console. At idle system goes down to 300Mhz, and even with 3 cores manually parked - it still consumes ~6W (without screen). This static power consumption makes Lichee Console quite warm even at idle. Also, this gives us just ~2.5 hours of battery life without any heavy load. As USB charging is limited to 5V/2.2A - Lichee Console will charge extremely slowly when powered on (~3 hours to full charge when switched off and ~10 hours when switched on). Surely, 12V 3.45mm barrel charging is much faster. </p><p>Dynamic power consumption of C910 cores are rated at 200µW/MHz/core, which gives us 300mW dynamic power consumption for 1 core at 1.5Ghz, and 1.2W for 4 core load. Measurements confirm these numbers, so the only issue is high static power consumption. On ratio performance / dynamic power it is perfectly competitive to Raspberry Pi 4, it is only static part that hurts it. </p><p>To investigate high static power consumption I made thermal photo at idle:<br><img src="https://s.14.by/lv4.jpg"></p><p>Here we see that approximately half of power is dissipated by Via VL817 - USB 3.0 hub IC located right under SoC module. Less but still significant power is dissipated by ASM1153 USB-&gt;SATA adapter, despite no SATA drives connected. This is quite disappointing. If no software fix would be found to disable unused interfaces, I am personally considering de-soldering these IC's or disconnecting them from power. 5-6 vs 2.8 hours of battery life is more important for my use. </p><p>This high idle power consumption is probably why cooling fan is always on (thankfully it is quiet), even when I put Lichee Console inside the fridge :-)</p><p><b>WiFi &amp; Ethernet</b>
WiFi module is connected via SDIO. Practical speed via iperf3 is 122/115 Mbit/sec. "Not great, not terrible" - but good enough for regular use.<br>Wired Ethernet does 925/925 Mbit/sec without jumbo packets which is nearly as good as it gets. SoC has 2 Ethernet ports, only 1 is accessible on Lichee Console.</p><p><b>Disk performance</b><br>
<b>eMMC</b><br>
Random 4k: Writes 8102 IOPS, 31.6MiB/s. Reads 2502 IOPS, 9.77MiB/s<br>
Random 1Mb: Writes 202mb/s, Reads 130mb/s</p><p>Random access is slower than modern fast microsd cards, but sequential is acceptable (for eMMC).</p><p><b>MicroSD</b>:<br>
Testing fast MicroSD cards (Samsung Pro Ultimate, Sandisk Extreme Pro) which can negotiate fastest possible speed (up to 200Mb/s) - uncovered that they are <b>unstable</b> and operations fail with io errors. This is likely caused by extremely long signal path : from SoC, then to flex connector, then folded flex cable, then path across IO board. Old/slow MicroSD cards work reliably but at snail speed. Hopefully maximum interface speed for MicroSD can be reduced in software without affecting eMMC speed. </p><p><b>Currently missing/broken features (mostly software)</b>:<br>1) Bluetooth was failing to pair devices out of the box using GUI tools. <br>2) No sleep function. You have to switch off / boot up every time you open Lichee Console.<br>3) Not sure if there is sensor detecting closed screen. Right now when closed it just continues working with the screen on. <br>4) Adjustment of screen brightness does not work (it is always at max brightness, or off).<br>5) Suboptimal power management leading to high static power consumption: Is it possible to disable VL817/ASM1153? Is SoC supply voltage scaling correctly at idle?</p><p>I will update the article here as software is improved. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
My overall experience with Lichee Console is positive and I like it. It should be noted that at the moment it is more of a product for tinkering and not something that you can immediately use as-is for work with no changes. Substantial improvement will be required on software to fully utilize hardware capabilities (but this often happens with Linux on mobile platforms). Hardware has some flaws, they are unpleasant but not fatal (microsd stability at high speed, high idle power consumption). I am concerned about battery safety, and hopefully this is something that Sipeed can improve. </p><p>12nm TH1520 SoC offer competetive dynamic power consumption and sufficient performance, but lacks in IO (for desktop) which forced Sipeed to add additional interface ICs which happened to consume too much static power. </p><p>I hope that current rapid pace of RISC-V infrastructure development will continue and in the nearest years we'll see more RISC-V SoC's, this time with at least few lines of PCI-E - and we'll get even more exciting Linux-capable RISC-V devices.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>One of the most enlightening moments in my career was when I discovered a new coworker was making  more than me during my stint in S&amp;P Capital IQ. I remembered casually asking him one day “How much is your salary?”. When I found out it was $40,000 more than mine, I felt resentful, jealous, and unappreciated.  How could someone who had the same job title and the same experience make 40% more than me? After soon finding out, I started to leave the office earlier than usual, justifying it by the fact I wasn’t even getting paid fairly. I eventually left the company a few months later. They counter-offered me with a promotion and a salary bump, but by then, I felt too offended. The damage was already done.</p>



<p>So why do companies do this? Are they purposely trying to make their employees disgruntled ? Do they really think employees won’t find out? Or that they’ll stay anyway because they’re one of the best employers in the world? As someone who spent some time working with compensation teams later in my career, and saw “how the sausage was made”, I thought I’d shared some insight into <em>why</em> new hires get paid more than existing employees, and why the best way to get a bigger pay is to move to a new job.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 1: Companies actually want you to leave</strong></p>



<p>This might sound unbelievable but it’s true. A lot of companies have attrition goals. Heck, some Big Tech companies fire the bottom 10% of their team every year. They want people who have been around for a long time, and not pulling their weight to leave. So underpaying their current employees  fixes this problem, as it will ultimately lead to a % of these people leaving every year. Of course the problem with this is that this also affects high performers. </p>



<p><strong>Reason 2: Salary raises are capped every year, and hiring budgets &gt; budgets for raises</strong></p>



<p>While this probably doesn’t apply for small startups with no formal compensation structure, large companies often have strict policies around the how much of a raise they can give to any employee. </p>



<p>So as an example, let’s say the market average salary for your position was $70K when you started 2 years ago, but it jumped up to $100K now.  However, because your company can only give 5% maximum raises every year (because it’s tied to inflation, cost of living increase, or another metric), your salary will continue to lag the market average. </p>



<p>In addition, many managers often have a strict budget for raises/promotions every year, and it’s often lower than the budget for new hires. Even if your manager wanted to give you a large raise to match the market, they wouldn’t have the budget. And even if they had the budget, they probably would have a lot of explaining to do to their superiors on why they allocated a large part of it to your raise.</p>



<p>In short, there’s a lot more corporate bureaucracy in giving a raise than there is to giving a higher offer to a new hire.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 3: HR teams don’t realize the long-term implications of paying new employees more than tenured employees</strong></p>



<p>Trying to hire X more people is an immediate problem. And it’s a problem that recruiters  are highly incentivized to solve – after all, their commissions/compensation probably depends on it. And if they can’t hire someone, they’ll simply throw more money at them. Problem solved, right? To hell with our tenured employees who will be paid much less. That’s someone else’s problem…</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you talk to some HR teams, you’ll find there’s almost no consideration for how this inequity will impact their company in the long-term. They do a terrible job of quantifying the costs of employees leaving. The only cost they see in the P&amp;L line is the extra salary required to replace them, not the “hidden costs” such as the time to interview new candidates, training new employees, and the extra time to productivity, etc. All of these are just considered “the cost of doing business”.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 4: Employers overvalue experience collected elsewhere</strong></p>



<p>There’s also this phenomenon I see in many companies, where <strong><em>experience built elsewhere is often valued higher than the one built in house</em></strong>. I’ve personally experienced this many times in my career, when my company would bring in a new “shiny” person from a competitor, with decades of experience and armed with fresh insights/knowledge. I would often wonder: “I have the same exact experience as that person! Like… why didn’t you just promote me?!”Unfortunately, from a company’s perspective, their thinking is: our current team led to us being in a stagnant market position: So we need someone new, exciting to revamp everything and put us in the right course!</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think this is just a psychological habit among people. We hate price increases on products/services we already purchased, but easily spend more on new things. The same goes for employees.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 5: Retaining employees is a problem very few want to solve because of inertia</strong></p>



<p>Trying to retain your best talent is a messy, complicated, long term problem that very few people in an organization want to deal with. Unlike hiring new people, there aren’t many people if any, whose compensation depends on retention. So naturally, there’s a lot of inertia around solving it.</p>



<p>And they aren’t ignorant. HR and executives are often aware of the problem. They read the news, and they hear anecdotes from their peers. They even often have it on their to do list to address. But it’s a hard, complicated problem to solve. Because it involves difficult conversations that go up the chain of leadership, going through executive management, finance, HR, etc. It has a trickle-down effect on lots of people, on profitability projections, on compensation structures, and budgets and so on. It requires analyzing lots of data, research, forecasts, and approvals. So, naturally the problem slips down their priority list.</p>



<p>There’s also a lack of data around retention, and attributing it to compensation vs other reasons people leave (such as personal reasons, management, work/life balance, etc). After all, a certain % of your employees *will* leave every year – that’s natural. How do you filter through the “normal” activity from an “abnormal” level? It probably needs to be happening at a much larger frequency for organizations to notice. Meaning the problem can bubble along for quite a while before the scale of it becomes apparent.</p>



<p>When you hire someone new, on the other hand, you need to be competitive with the market. You can’t escape that. Either you pay an above market salary to them, or you lose them to a competitor. Thus, you have to look at salary data from salary surveys, or providers such as Pave and Ravio and make sure you’re competitive. Ultimately, salaries to new hires are going to keep pace at some level with market changes. </p>



<p><strong><em>So knowing all this, what can you do as an employee if you find out you’re getting paid less than your peers in the same level?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>1. Gather as much information about how compensation is managed in your company</strong></p>



<p>Before doing anything drastic, you should try to understand how compensation is managed in your company. One question you should try to ask your manager, your HR department, or other employees is “What is your compensation philosophy? How is our compensation determined? Who determines it?” </p>



<p>How you approach the question of getting a salary bump depends a lot on how each company answers this question. For example, in certain companies like Facebook, compensation isn’t determined by managers, so engaging with your manager isn’t going to be very productive. You’re better off trying to talk to someone up the leadership chain, or finding out how to get promoted. On the other hand, other companies give managers lots of decision-making power, and you’ll need to decide how to start a conversation with them tactfully.</p>



<p>Likewise, if you know your company benchmark their salaries to the 75% percentile of the market median/average, and your salary is in the 50th percentile, and you’re a high performer, that gives you some data to bring to the conversation. </p>



<p><strong>2. Have an open conversation with your manager about compensation</strong></p>



<p>Most people are afraid of having tough conversations about pay with their manager, but it’s important to remember that <strong><em>good managers don’t mind being asked about compensation</em></strong>. After all, that’s part of their job: to keep you productive/happy as an employee. When you have that first conversation, keep in mind that most companies are probably not going to give you that 20% raise overnight. So instead of demanding a raise, you should ask in the form of “Hi, I’ve been working for X years. I’ve done X, Y, and Z while I’ve been here. I know I’m paid at X% of the market average, while my coworkers/peers are paid above the market average. What do I need to do to get a raise next year?”</p>



<p>In addition to having market salary data, it’s worth having some tangible data about the impact you’re having in your company. By impact, I’m not talking about trivial things like # of lines of code, or the number of tickets you fixed. I’m talking about things like did you work on a feature that improved the speed of your website by 20%, leading to 10% more conversions? Did you automate some process that led to 20% more bugs? If you can map that impact out, it makes the conversation with your manager a lot easier.</p>



<p>Remember, the key is not to demand a raise, but to get to a mutual understanding with your manager, on how to get that raise in the future. Do you need to learn a few crucial skills first? Do you need to start mentoring junior people in the team? Do they  undervalue certain skills/experiences you might have that makes them hesitant to pay you a higher salary? Do they ask you to “prove” that you’re being underpaid or tell you that a raise is definitely not possible due to economic conditions? (this probably isn’t what you want to hear, but it’s all useful information!)</p>



<p><strong>3. Hand in a competing offer </strong></p>



<p>OK, so you’ve talked about a potential raise with your manager, and they said there’s just no way. Or the next year rolls around, and still no raise. What do you do?</p>



<p>This is going to sound aggressive, but in my experience, the #1 way to force their hand is to give your manager a competing offer. Of course this is easier said than done, but unless you’re up for promotion, it’s very very hard to get a huge raise if you don’t show them you’re seriously considering another company.</p>



<p>Now, that doesn’t mean you give your manager the middle finger! But tactfully, showing them your offer and saying something like “Company X has offered me this title + salary. I really enjoy working here, and don’t really want to leave. Can you come close to addressing my concerns of being underpaid relative to my peers in this company?”</p>



<p>This assume of course that you really want to continue working for them. If you feel you were disrespected, you probably are better off just taking the competing offer, and getting paid what you deserved in that new company. At the end of the day, it’s just not worth staying at a company that doesn’t value your knowledge/skills/experience if you can find another company that does value it.</p>

Manufacturers could optionally pay some standards company to add some safety label to it to help boost customer confidence but it should not be compulsory. We're all going to die eventually and this obsession with safety is unhealthy and probably kills more people than it protects (e.g. due to the mental distress they cause and false peace of mind which dumbs down consumers and makes them feel like they don't need to do their own research... Not to mention the social harms caused by the passive 'trust the experts' mindset).

USA!), then:  Wouldn't you prefer that there be at least some third-party testing to ensure that it is safe enough to not burn your house down?  And if you don't care about your own safety (because you know how to Do Your Own Research), then:  Wouldn't your kids and neighbors prefer this testing?</p><p>Maybe if you trust me (because you like the cut of my jib or something) then you'll believe me when I say that I had my engineering-type buddy go over the design and he said it was OK.</p><p>But caveat emptor:  <i>You should not trust me.</i>  I, the seller in a hypothetical truly-free market, am here to give you as little as I can get away with for as many dollars as I can take you for.</p><p>That's what UL helps with, in this context:  They're an impartial private company that tests products to ensure that they meet safety standards (most of which they designed themselves, but that's just a positive example of free enterprise at work).  They do charge [plenty of] money for this service, but they've got expenses to cover (and profit to make!) just as you or I do.</p><p>But there is no federal law or national regulation requiring US consumers to use only UL-listed toasters.  That's not a thing, and it has never been a thing.  Such a requirement may be a thing in some more-local jurisdictions, and/or also an important part of some insurance policies, but the overarching regulatory environment that you seem to be railing against in the context of toasters simply does not exist.

The net effect of all regulations like this means large classes of business are not feasible unless you have substantial capital. And availability of capital for good ideas is not at all evenly distributed in our society (the UK at least). This is just one more way that we are going to entrench low social mobility. Note also, it’s not just electronics regs that act in this way - our societies have become much more regulated and rule bound in my life time. Often things for good reason, but we should think about the ways in which this entrenches incumbents imo.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I could make one using a long piece of wire and a transformer. It is about making a toaster that has a certain standard and does not kill people, burn down houses and/or interferes with radio traffic. All kind of things that would suck.</p><p>If you can't clear that bar as a manufacturer, you shouldn't be one. You could still build things for yourself – but if you want to sell things to others they should be able to assume you are not out there to kill them without deeply researching your company, aquiring a degree in mechanical and electrical engineering, buying your product and disassembling it. And I say that as a person that would be able to do that, unlike most.

Take the adoption of Glyphosate for example. Had people not been reassured by the government that it was 100% safe, many people would not have used it. Consumers outsourcing trust to the government instead of the individuals who produce the goods is harmful because it creates an environment which gives untrustworthy people a competitive edge and a certain degree of protection from liability. It shifts some responsibility away from producers who understand the product best and towards government agencies whose interest is to help large private companies maintain market dominance.

When they sold out in '97, domestic toasters had been infeasible for years already. And this was for a company where all the knowledge, equipment, and facilities had beed paid for many decades before. (They invented the electric pop-up toaster for certain definitions of electric pop-up toaster.)<p>Toasters are refined brilliance, if done right. The concept of "done" is computed using an analog computer programmed by human experts. (Ok, its usually a bimetal strip but it is placed so that the cooling of the moist bread keeps it from going off and your lighter-darker input is biasing when it considers the toast done.)</p><p>Tear apart some toasters. There won't be anything in a modern cheap toaster that isn't absolutely required. Ask yourself why everything is the way it is.</p><p>Research the UL requirements. I have the corporate 2 pound copper ball that had to be dropped on things from prescribed heights and not cause malfunction. Make sure you can hit this targets with what you think you can build. Also check the CE, they might have more modern rules.</p><p>Be ready for litigation. Toasters catch fire. The toaster moguls were horrified whenever they saw someone's toaster under a cabinet. Decades after selling the business they were still being sued by mesothelioma suits for things like a repairman that got lung cancer and repaired home appliances, so he probably might have worked on one of their 1920's models with asbestos insulation. Don't let it stop you, but put the backup insurance into the expenses.

End of the day, americans might want to use their money for more important things than origin of manufacture, and they'd be smart to throw the paper money the government prints at Chinese underpaid labour giving them actual toasters in exchange, rather than give it to each other.<p>Don't forget, when you buy a toaster from China, you're basically making them bleed and sweat on it for nothing more than your currency they can only use to buy back stuff from you, if you'll allow it. It's a very good deal, so good US consumers should increase their chinese imports rather than decrease it. Or next thing they know, they'll be the ones sweating in sweatshops soldering around toasters for capital-rich Shanghaiese.

Some expensive Japanese toasters are more like grills or ovens, and sealing in steam seems to be key to their hyped results.</p><p>- commercial toasters and some like west bend have 'drop thru' toasting, where the toast drops out of the bottom when done instead of popping up. Nice design.</p><p>- Two slot toasters always power both slots even when toasting one slice.</p><p>- Many toasters don't allow you to change the timer mid-toast. I mean you can change it, but it doesn't do anything until next cycle. Also few indicate how much time is left.</p><p>- crumb trays don't work for many toasters, they're too narrow compared with all the places crumbs fall.</p><p>- expensive 'old school' toasters like Dualit just don't have the features, and are too clunky.</p><p>- the toasters with windows toast much more slowly (use tube heaters instead of a 'grid' of nichrome) and the window is useless anyway since the heater element makes everything orange.</p><p>- One thing I find amusing is some reviewers are testing these $100,$200 toasters with regular supermarket chorleywood bread.

A $200 toaster is already elitist, especially given that they don't seem to actually toast any better than the cheapest models. So why test with 'poor people's bread'? lol.<p>Seriously though, I have a bread machine, maybe the cheapest model (lidl equivalent) which I love because of how easy it is to repair, and I make my own bread with little effort for maybe 1/2 the price of supermarket bread, and a world of difference in quality.

You already received enough info on potential challenges in manufacturing toasters.</p><p>Instead, a good alternative solution might be to focus on making add-ons for toasters built by others. What are the concerns toaster users have? Identify those and see how you can solve some of those using software and hardware. For example, a few concerns might be around making a perfect toast or safety: how not to over-burn toasts, how to turn off toaster when smoke started to come out, etc. Solve a problem that toaster users might have.

You will figure out why things cost the amount they do, and you will wonder why, till you find all the tricks manufacturers pull off – with the most important one being economies of scale. There will be many prototypes, and sometimes you will end with something that is extremely cool, but entirely to expensive for what it does. Sometimes things will fail for unknown reasons. There are <i>tons</i> of regulations your device will need to respect (and you need to know them).</p><p>Why don't you start building the toaster in your sparetime and figure out whether that object is a thing that could sit on the right spot in the market with some automation? If the answer is that you lack the hardware skill, I would caution against moving forward unless you got the market side all figured out and <i>know</i> your product would work financially. Then this would be about finding a person that fills your gaps.

This means that the toaster will only last a few years. My repair was in this section. The heat eventually desoldered the mains pad on the PCB. You can maybe repair it once and get another year out of it, after that the PCB will be very charred and brittle. The fact that the PCB gets toasted a little bit every time probably isn't great for your health either, so I think I wouldn't recommend repairing toasters with this flaw, unless you have some clever plan to get around this problem. My new toaster is a name-brand one. And I don't see any light when it pops up, so maybe it's fine. I've also seen other name-brand toasters that were only replaced because they got filthy -- due to improper maintenance I must add :p</p><p>My toaster was mostly made of metal that was bent into the shape of a toaster, plus plastic on the outside. To disassemble it, you have to use pliers to bend some interlocking metal bits into a different shape. That should be pretty cheap to manufacture! The pop-op logic was very simple, not even sure if it used a chip or not. If it did, probably nothing digital, maybe just a 555. Single-sided cheap circuit board.</p><p>I want the following functions: stop button, extra long button, short button, single slot operation.</p><p>Most people are probably comfortable with a toaster that just lets you adjust the duration. But if you add sensors that can reliably(!) detect how much browner your toast or bread has become compared to when it was inserted, go for it. If that sensor goes haywire after two years, then don't bother IMO. If you can add odor or smoke sensors that react when the toast is burnt, that might be nice too. (Course they might go off when you run the toaster for the first time to burn off the lubricant(?), so that may add some complexity)

3) You’ve identified what seems like an awesome opportunity. Go chase it. Don’t spend too much time talking. Endless talk is the death of entrepreneurial endeavors. Do more talk less. Sounds like a super fun opportunity during which you’ll learn so much along the way.</p><p>4) Two entrepreneur credos:</p><p>A) when you see an opportunity the door is already closing. Get moving. Did I mention more talk less do?</p><p>B) the universe is interesting. The moment you start on an endeavor, the people you need to be successful just come out of the woodwork. It’s like you become attuned to the universe. Just gotta pay attention. Sorry - sounds preachy, but I’ve found it to be true over and over again. It’s like they find you through the cosmos.</p><p>Don’t listen to the naysayers.

I used to sell bikinis online, which was fun and profitable in the beginning. But once all those other boutique fashion brands started spamming Instagram, acquiring customers became too expensive so the entire operation wasn't profitable anymore. So try to estimate how much it'll cost you to advertise to prospective customers.

If the ui was running on it's own mcu, talking spi or whatever to the main controller, makers could differentiate with their own UIs. And hackers could hack.

Supplemental reading could certainly help of course, so I apologize that I have nothing to provide in that area, but if you're interested in it I'd recommend just jumping in with simple projects and learning on your own from there- with assistance from just searching around for fundamentals on google. I hate to be the quote person, but I think this one fits perfectly; "The best time to plant a tree was 100 years ago, but the second best time is now" or "A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step". Ignoring the cliche quotes, I'd just say the best thing you can do is dive in without any direct guidance and navigate the unknowns yourself. At the end of the day, starting off in the wrong direction is better than not starting at all. Good luck on your adventure!</span></p></div></td></tr>

Companies CAN compete with low-wage low-regulation areas but usually only on the high end.</p><p>You can buy toasters from Ritter that are made in Germany and they retail for around $200.</p><p>After a very cursory search I found a 1939 Sears catalog that listed an old-fashioned (a heating element surrounded by A-frame to hold the toast) toaster for $0.89 and a "Deluxe Automatic Toaster" for $8.95. A "Deluxe Automatic Toaster" is the kind that everyone buys today with adjustable toasting and automatic pop-up.</p><p>$8.95 in 1939 is... $200.</p><p>So you might want to start by doing some research into what people might want in a product once the price trends towards the high end of the market.

One pitfall I have observed with software folks moving in to manufacturing, such as programmers getting an MBA and PMP and moving into management is that the amount of time and money it takes to actually make a real physical object is almost incomprehensible to them.</p><p>Also incomprehensible are the very real and very important quality control and safety components to manufacturing.</p><p>Of course, if you worked on software in a safety-critical field this is old news.
