<p>Vernor Vinge, author of many influential hard science fiction works, died March 20 at the age of 79.</p>



<p>Vinge sold his first science-fiction story in 1964, “Apartness”, which appeared in the June 1965 issue of <em>New Worlds</em>.</p>



<p>In 1971, he received a PhD (Math) from UCSD, and the next year began teaching at San Diego State University. It wasn’t until almost thirty years later, in August 2000, that he retired from teaching to write science-fiction full time.</p>



<p>His 1981 novella&nbsp;<em>True Names</em> is often credited as the first story to present a fully fleshed-out concept of&nbsp;cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He won Hugo Awards&nbsp;for his novels&nbsp;<em>A Fire Upon the Deep</em>&nbsp;(1993 — tie),&nbsp;<em>A&nbsp;Deepness in the Sky</em>&nbsp;(2000),&nbsp;<em>Rainbows End</em>&nbsp;(2007), and novellas&nbsp;<em>Fast Times at Fairmont High</em>&nbsp;(2002), and&nbsp;<em>The Cookie Monster</em>&nbsp;(2004). <em>A Deepness in the Sky </em>also won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and in translation won Spain’s Ignotus Award, Germany’s Kurd Lasswitz Preis, and Italy’s Italia Award.</p>



<p>Vinge was the guest of honor at ConJosé, the 2002 Worldcon. He won the Prometheus Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2014. He won the Heinlein Award presented by The Heinlein Society in 2020.</p>



<p>He was married to Joan D. Vinge from 1972 to 1979.</p>



<p>David Brin has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AUTHORDAVIDBRIN/posts/804165974862720">posted a heartfelt tribute</a> on Facebook which says in part:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is with sadness – and deep appreciation of my friend and colleague – that I must report the passing of Vernor Vinge. A titan in the literary genre that explores a limitless range of potential destinies, Vernor enthralled millions with tales of plausible tomorrows, made all the more vivid by his polymath masteries of language, drama, characters and the implications of science.</p>



<p>Accused by some of a grievous sin – that of ‘optimism’ – Vernor gave us peerless legends that often depicted human success at overcoming problems… those right in front of us… while posing new ones! New dilemmas that may lie just ahead of our myopic gaze. He would often ask: “What if we succeed? Do you think that will be the end of it?”…</p>



<p>…We spanned a pretty wide spectrum – politically! Yet, we KBs [Killer B’s] (Vernor was a full member! And Octavia Butler once guffawed happily when we inducted her) always shared a deep love of our high art – that of gedankenexperimentation, extrapolation into the undiscovered country ahead.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      <p>The bicycle, as we know it today, was not invented until the late 1800s. Yet it was a simple mechanical invention. It would seem to require no brilliant inventive insight, and certainly no scientific background.</p>

<p>Why, then, wasn’t it invented much earlier?</p>

<p>I asked this question <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1143622870477791233" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, and read some discussion <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing" target="_blank">on Quora</a>. People proposed many hypotheses, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technology factors.</strong> Metalworking improved a lot in the 1800s: we got improved iron refining and eventually cheap steel, better processes for shaping metal, and ability to make parts like hollow tubes. Wheel technology improved: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wheel" target="_blank">wire-spoke</a> (aka tension-spoked) wheels replaced heavier designs; vulcanized rubber (1839) was needed for tires; inflatable tires weren’t invented until 1887. Chains, gears, and ball bearings are all crucial parts that require advanced manufacturing techniques for precision and cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design iteration.</strong> Early bicycles were inconvenient and dangerous. The first version didn’t even have pedals. Some versions didn’t have steering, and could only be turned by leaning. (!) The famous “penny-farthing” design, with its huge front wheel, made it impossible to balance with your feet, was prone to tipping forward on a hard stop, and generally left the rider high in the air, all of which increased risk of injury. It took decades of iteration to get to a successful bicycle model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quality of roads.</strong> Roads in the 1800s and earlier were terrible by modern standards. Roads were often dirt, rutted from the passage of many carts, turning muddy in the rain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam" target="_blank">Macadam paving</a>, which gave smooth surfaces to roads, wasn’t invented until about 1820. City roads at the time were paved with cobblestones, which were good for horses but too bumpy for bicycles. (The unevenness was apparently a feature, assisting in the runoff of sewage—leading <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing/answer/Chris-Crawford-6" target="_blank">one Quora answer</a> to claim that the construction of city sewers was what opened the door to bicycles.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Competition from horses.</strong> Horses were a common and accepted mode of transportation at the time. They could deal with all kinds of roads. They could carry heavy loads. Who then needs a bicycle? In this connection, it has been claimed that the bicycle was invented in response to food shortages due to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer" target="_blank">Year without a Summer</a>”, an 1816 weather event caused by the volcanic explosion of Mt. Tambora the year earlier, which darkened skies and lowered temperatures in many parts of the world. The agricultural crisis caused horses as well as people to starve, which led to some horses being slaughtered for food, and made the remaining ones more expensive to feed. This could have motivated the search for alternatives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General economic growth.</strong> Multiple commenters pointed out the need for a middle class to provide demand for such an invention. If all you have are a lot of poor peasants and a few aristocrats (who, by the way, have horses, carriages, and drivers), there isn’t much of a market for bicycles. This is more plausible when you realize that bicycles were more of a hobby for entertainment before they became a practical means of transportation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cultural factors.</strong> Maybe there was just a general lack of interest in useful mechanical inventions until a certain point in history? But when did this change, and why?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>These are all good hypotheses. But some of them start to buckle under pressure:</p>

<p>The quality of roads is relevant, but not really the answer. Bicycles can be ridden on dirt roads or sidewalks (although the latter led to run-ins with pedestrians and made bicycles unpopular among the public at first). And historically, roads didn’t improve until <em>after</em> bicycles became common—indeed it seems that it was in part the cyclists who called for the improvement of roads.</p>

<p>I don’t think horses explain it either. A bicycle, from what I’ve read, was cheaper to buy than a horse, and it was certainly cheaper to maintain (if nothing else, you don’t have to feed a bicycle). And it turns out that inventors were interested in the problem of human-powered vehicles, dispensing with the need for horses, for a long time before the modern bicycle. Even Karl von Drais, who invented the first two-wheeled human-powered vehicle after the Year without a Summer, had been working on the problem for years before that.</p>

<p>Technology factors are more convincing to me. They may have been necessary for bicycles to become practical and cheap enough to take off. But they weren’t needed for early experimentation. Frames can be built of wood. Wheels can be rimmed with metal. Gears can be omitted. Chains can be replaced with belts; some early designs even used treadles instead of pedals, and at least one design drove the wheels with levers, as on a steam locomotive.</p>

<p>So what’s the real explanation?</p>

<p>To understand this, I dug into the history of the bicycle.</p>

<p>The concept of a human-powered vehicle goes back many centuries. The earliest reference I have found is to Venetian engineer Giovanni Fontana, who in the early 1400s described a four-wheeled carriage powered by a driver pulling on a loop of rope connected by gears to the wheels (it’s unclear if he ever even attempted to build such a machine; Fontana sketched <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/2018/01/24/the-dreams-of-an-inventor-in-1420/" target="_blank">a lot of strange things</a>).</p>

<p>Another early concept was described in the book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/books/chapters/bicycle.html" target="_blank"><em>Bicycle</em> by David V. Herlihy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than three centuries ago, the distinguished French mathematician Jacques Ozanam spelled out the theoretical advantages of a human-powered carriage “in which one can drive oneself wherever one pleases, without horses.” Its owner could freely roam along the roads without having to care for an animal and might even enjoy a healthy exercise in the process. Moreover, this particular type of “self-moving” vehicle, in contrast to those that called for wind or steam for propulsion, would run on that most abundant and accessible of all resources: willpower. But how to construct such a valuable vehicle? That was the twenty-third of some fifty “useful and entertaining” problems Ozanam identified and addressed in his famous <em>Récréations Mathématiques et Physiques</em>, published in 1696.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ozanam’s book presented a proposed solution from another inventor: another four-wheeled carriage, driven by two people (one to steer, one to power the vehicle by stepping up and down on large treadles connected to the wheels by ropes, pulleys, and gears).</p>

</figure>

<p>It seems that for centuries, the carriage was the model for human-powered vehicles. Various inventors tried their hand at designs, and some were even built. There is a record in a London journal of an attempt in 1774 that went up to six miles an hour. French inventor Jean-Pierre Blanchard (who would later go on to fame in ballooning) built a human-powered carriage that went a dozen miles from Paris to Versailles. An American mechanic named Bolton built a version in 1804 that used mechanical leverage from interlocking gears. Presumably, all these attempts went nowhere because the machines were too large and heavy to be practical.</p>

<figure data-url="/img/draisine.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/draisine.jpg"></figure>

<p>The key insight was to stop trying to build a mechanical carriage, and instead build something more like a mechanical horse. This step was taken by the aforementioned Karl von Drais in the early 1800s. Drais was an aristocrat; he held a position as forest master in Baden that is <a href="https://regencyredingote.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/of-velocipedes-and-draisiennes-the-rise/" target="_blank">said</a> to have given him free time to tinker. His first attempts, beginning in 1813, were four-wheeled carriages like their predecessors, and like them failed to gain the support of authorities.</p>

<figure data-url="/img/pedestrian-curricle.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/pedestrian-curricle.jpg"></figure>

<p>But in 1817 (possibly motivated by the aforementioned food crisis and resultant shortage of horses, although this is unclear), he tried again with a new design: a two-wheeled, one-person vehicle that is a recognizable ancestor of the modern bicycle. It was made of wood, with iron tires. He called it the <em>Laufmaschine</em>, or “running machine”; it had no pedals, and instead was powered by directly pushing off the ground with one’s feet. It was also called the “velocipede” (from the Latin for “swift foot”) or the “draisine” (English) or “draisienne” (French) after its inventor; an improved version made by a London coachmaker was known in England as the “pedestrian curricle”.</p>

<p>Without pedals or gears, this proto-bicycle couldn’t achieve the speed or efficiency of modern designs. But, like the scooters still used by children today, it allowed you to coast, especially downhill, and it held your weight as you moved forward. Drais got up to 12 miles per hour on his machine. It became a fad in Europe in 1818–19, then faded. It seems the reasons were a combination of the potential for injury and the general annoyance of the public that these things were being driven through pedestrian areas such as sidewalks and parks (some things never change; we’re repeating this today with the scooter wars in San Francisco and other cities).</p>

<figure data-url="/img/the-american-velocipede.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/the-american-velocipede.jpg"></figure>

<p>The next key advance didn’t come until decades later, when someone put pedals on the bike. There are conflicting claims to first inventor (going back to 1839), but it was definitely done by the 1860s in France. In any case, it was in the 1860s that bicycle development really took off. Pedals allowed the rider to propel the machine faster and more efficiently. This model was manufactured in France, at first with wooden frames, later with iron, and became commonly known as the “boneshaker” (which gives you an idea of how rough the ride still was).</p>

<p>At this point, though, there were still no gears or chains. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel. This gave the rider little mechanical advantage: it’s the same as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle" target="_blank">fixie</a> with a 1:1 gear ratio (vs. the ratios most commonly used today which are closer to 3:1). Think of what it’s like to pedal a bike that’s in too low a gear: you pump your legs a lot without going very fast.</p>

<figure data-url="/img/penny-farthing.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/penny-farthing.jpg"></figure>

<p>The only solution was to make the wheel larger, leading around 1870 to the ridiculous-looking “penny-farthing” or “high-wheel” design with the huge front wheel, which you’ve probably seen and may associate with the late 1800s. By around this time, bicycles were being made with metal frames, wire-spoke wheels, and solid rubber (not yet inflatable) tires. This design did give a faster ride, and a smoother one, since the large wheel absorbed shocks better. But it required acrobatic balance to ride, and as noted above it was prone to nasty spills and injuries, including “taking a header” if you stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>The third and final key advance, then, was to separate the pedals from the wheel. Variations on this “safety bicycle”, including at least one driven by treadles and levers, were attempted from the 1870s if not before. The first commercially successful model, using the familiar crank and chain design, was produced in 1885 by John Starley. Finally, in 1888, inflatable (pneumatic) tires were introduced by John Dunlop, cushioning the ride and eliminating the last advantage of the penny-farthing.</p>

<p>So, by the end of the 1880s, bicycles had evolved into the form we know them today, with (approximately) equal-sized wheels, pedals, chains, metal frames, wire-spoke wheels, and inflatable rubber tires.</p>

<hr>

<p>So what can we conclude?</p>

<p><strong>First, the correct design was not obvious.</strong> For centuries, progress was stalled because inventors were all trying to create multi-person four-wheeled carriages, rather than single-person two-wheeled vehicles. It’s unclear why this was; certainly inventors were copying an existing mode of transportation, but why would they draw inspiration only from the horse-and-carriage, and not from the horse-and-rider? (Some commenters have suggested that it was not obvious that a two-wheeled vehicle would balance, but I find this unconvincing given how many other things people have learned to balance on, from dugout canoes to horses themselves.) It’s possible (I’m purely speculating here) that early mechanical inventors had a harder time realizing the fundamental impractiability of the carriage design because they didn’t have much in the way of mathematical engineering principles to go on, but then again it’s unclear what led to Drais’s breakthrough.</p>

<p>And even after Drais hit on the two-wheeled design, it took multiple iterations, which happened over decades, to get to a design that was efficient, comfortable, and safe.</p>

<p><strong>Second, advances in materials and manufacturing were probably necessary for a commercially successful bicycle.</strong> It’s a bit hard, from where I stand, to untangle which advances in design were made possible by new materials and techniques, and which were simply sparks of inventive imagination that hadn’t been conceived or developed before. But the fact that people were willing to put up with the precarious high-wheeled design indicates to me that pneumatic tires were crucial. And it’s plausible to me that advanced metalworking was needed to make small, lightweight chains and gears of high and consistent quality, at an acceptable price—and that no other design, such as a belt or lever, would have worked instead. It’s also plausible to me that wooden frames just weren’t light and strong enough to be practical (I certainly wouldn’t be eager to ride a wooden bicycle today).</p>

<p>But we can go deeper, and ask the questions that inspired my intense interest in this question in the first place. Why was no one even experimenting with two-wheeled vehicles until the 1800s? And why was no one, as far as we know, even considering the question of human-powered vehicles until the 1400s? Why weren’t there bicycle mechanics in the 1300s, when there were clockmakers, or at least by the 1500s, when we had watches? Or among the ancient Romans, who built water mills and harvesting machines? Or the Greeks, who built the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism" target="_blank">Antikythera mechanism
</a>? Even if they didn’t have tires and chains, why weren’t these societies at least experimenting with draisines? Or even the failed carriage designs?</p>

<p>To even begin to answer this, we have to realize that it’s part of a much wider phenomenon. I asked the same question of the <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-cotton-gin">cotton gin</a>, which unlike the bicycle did not require advanced materials: it’s a wooden box, a wire mesh, and a drum with wire teeth; in fact, it was so simple that once the concept was out, plantation owners made bootleg copies by hand (depriving Eli Whitney of most of his patent royalties). The same question can be asked of all of the key inventions of <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/out-of-whole-cloth">textile mechanization</a>; Anton Howes, an economic historian who chimed in on the Twitter thread linked above, has <a href="https://medium.com/@antonhowes/is-innovation-in-human-nature-48c2578e27ba" target="_blank">noted of John Kay’s flying shuttle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kay’s innovation was extraordinary in its simplicity. As the inventor Bennet Woodcroft put it, weaving with an ordinary shuttle had been “performed for upwards of five thousand years, by millions of skilled workmen, without any improvement being made to expedite the operation, until the year 1733”. All Kay added was some wood and some string. And he applied it to weaving wool, which had been England’s main industry since the middle ages. He had no special skill, he required no special understanding of science for it, and he faced no special incentive to do it. As for institutions, the flying shuttle was technically illegal because it saved labour, the patent was immediately pirated by competitors to little avail, and Kay was forced to move to France, hounded out of the country by angry weavers who threatened his property and even his life. Kay faced no special incentives — he even innovated despite some formidable social and legal barriers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also other stories in which an early attempt at invention was demonstrated, the idea found no backers if it wasn’t already fully viable, and then development was dropped for decades. Richard Trevithick’s early, failed experiments with locomotives come to mind.</p>

<p><strong>In light of this, I think the deepest explanation is in general economic and cultural factors.</strong> Regarding economic factors, it seems that there needs to be a certain level of surplus to support the culture-wide research and development effort that creates inventions. Note that Karl von Drais was a baron who apparently had a cushy job and invented in his spare time. This is common of researchers of that era: they were often aristocrats or otherwise independently wealthy (and those who weren’t had to scramble for support from wealthy patrons). Today we have research labs in both universities and corporations, plus venture capitalists to fund development of new products and services. The moment it becomes clear that a certain type of innovation <em>might</em> be possible, there are multiple teams funded and hustling to bring it to market. There are no multi-decade gaps in the innovation timeline anymore, or at least vastly fewer.</p>

<p>Looking at economic factors on the demand side, surplus also would seem to create markets for new products. Maybe GDP per capita just has to hit a certain point before people even have time, attention and energy to think about new inventions that aren’t literally putting food on the table, a roof over your head, or a shirt on your back.</p>

<p>Finally, there are cultural factors. Howes says that “innovation is not in human nature, but is instead received. … when people do not innovate, it is often simply because <em>it never occurs to them to do so.</em>” Joel Mokyr says, similarly, that “<a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/the-idea-of-progress">progress isn’t natural</a>” (and his book on this topic, <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/books/a-culture-of-growth"><em>A Culture of Growth</em></a>, helped inspire this blog). I agree with both.</p>

<p>Fully elucidating these economic and cultural factors is a major future project of this blog.</p>

He refreshes his resume and searches online for “data science jobs Chicago,” trawling through four or five job aggregator sites ranging from somewhat legitimate to completely illegitimate. He collects about a dozen jobs that could match his skill set, more or less, and he applies. Their “easy apply” online systems make sending applications relatively painless. They mostly ask him to type out his resume, again and again, in the flattest and most generic way possible. But he doesn’t hear back from any of the jobs he’s applied for. He is running out of money. He sends dozens more applications for jobs over the next several weeks. Maybe even 100. He hears back from two companies. They are both obvious scams.</p><p><span>Meanwhile, one of my friend’s applications becomes one of approximately 200 applications in a hiring pool. (Many other people seem to have clicked the “easy apply” button.) The hiring manager in charge of the pool becomes overwhelmed – no reasonable person could sift through so many resumes – so she does what appears to be the smart, fashionable thing and employs an </span><a href="https://skillpool.medium.com/top-10-ai-based-resume-screening-softwares-6642e0b69569" rel="">“AI-based screening tool” or “online resume parser”</a><span> to sift through her pool of applications.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The tool she selects claims to “go beyond keywords” to </span><a href="https://www.filtered.ai/blog/ai-resume-screening-fd" rel="">“identify applicants based on aptitude.”</a><span> But of course she has no idea what it’s really doing.* After some fancy whizzing and whirring, it sends her five applications, deemed the “best” (By what metric?). My friend’s resume was not selected, but perhaps it will be by another hiring manager. Until then, his fate – his ability to pay rent and, crucially, cover our next round of Miller High Lifes – will be largely determined by job search aggregators, faceless algorithms, and the facetious whims of employers who will ask him for as many “</span><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaflores/handling-free-work-requests-job-interviews" rel="">sample assignments</a><span>” as they want before ghosting him forever. There is basically nothing he can do about it.</span></p><p>However unfashionable for me to admit around economists buoyed by “good jobs numbers,” I think the hiring part of the jobs market is broken. A job posted on one industry job board soon makes its way to 20 job aggregator sites, which are unaffiliated with the role and the firm who posted it. (They source job listings from job boards and company websites and display them on their own platform.) Unless you are lucky enough to have a pre-existing connection to a particular role, you are relying on the site to provide an active, accurate listing and to deliver your application directly to the hiring manager — and for the hiring manager to have the time to read it. </p><p>These sites once promised easier access to postings and applications, but now create an opaque maze for candidates (quick—what’s the difference between Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, Jobtrees, and Monster?) and a genuine headache for employers (Are you interested in reading dozens of cover letters today?). Looking ahead, I worry about how much these “tools” would make life harder in a recession, and about how other trends concerning the future of work might coalesce in harmful ways to candidates and employees. </p><p><span>Completely anecdotally, I’ve observed these issues again and again in the last year. Job aggregator sites encourage candidates to send buckets of generalist applications against the interests of hiring managers who receive an overwhelming number of applications that they cannot distinguish from one another. Job postings are somehow everywhere but hiring managers complain they can’t find any qualified candidates. Layoffs at prestige firms are announced left and right as companies pivot away from the pandemic’s free-stimulus-money-for-everyone era (it </span><em>probably</em><span> isn’t indicating an imminent recession, despite what </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/" rel="">r/layoffs</a><span> would have you believe). To me, concern feels like it’s growing everywhere except the cover of the </span><em>New York Times</em><span>. In fact, a recent survey of 1,500 job candidates by the staffing firm Aerotek found </span><a href="https://www.aerotek.com/en/about-us/news-and-events/news/2023/12/aerotek-fall-job-seeker-survey-job-seekers-say-job-hunt-more-difficult" rel="">70% of people</a><span> find their current job search more difficult than the last, even though people are more qualified than before.

It’s no surprise that when the market suffers broadly, firms miss out on much-needed talent, candidates miss out on duly-owed salary increases and promotions – and the unemployed somehow have to fight even harder.</p><p><strong>Is it all because of AI resume screening tools?</strong><span> </span><strong>Certainly not, but the combination of a worsening market with the insidious tech trends that steer hiring have the potential to make everyone’s lives that much worse.</strong></p><p>I could shower this piece with a dozen anecdotes I’ve heard in the last year. One person who is considering switching fields because the “market disappeared” from under them. One person whose application tracking excel says he’s applied to over 75 jobs and heard back from five. One person who’s been promised a state job posting will drop “any day now” for a role he’s guaranteed to get (sorry, other applicants!). One person who gave up and became a barista.</p><p><span>Surely there are differences across industries and levels of expertise. And most of my friends are too young to have fully grappled with the impacts of the Great Recession. But the market doesn’t feel it’s transitioned out of the flush-with-cash pandemic years (when companies boasted the amount of PPP loans they received and consumers had more cash on hand to spend than ever before) nearly as well as economists have liked to boast. There was a </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-high-cost-of-neglecting-low-wage-workers" rel="">unique period </a><span>where low-wage, high-stress jobs struggled to hire seemingly because people had enough money from Covid checks instead. I don’t think that’s the case anymore. </span></p><p><span>I think you would be right to say that a lot of this piece relies on feelings or vibes, but that’s sort of the point. Traditional economic indicators can only tell part of the story. There’s a lot of value in the stories we hear around us, especially when they disagree with the headlines. Kyla Scanlon’s genius coining of the term “</span><a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-vibecession-the-self-fulfilling" rel="">vibecession</a><span>” and subsequent </span><a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/its-more-than-just-vibes" rel="">analysis</a><span> of it speak to this phenomenon well. There are genuine divergences between economic expectations, theory, and reality. Plenty of understandable reasons contribute to this, which Scanlon notes might include misinformation, outsized media coverage, and conflating “inflation going down” with “prices going down.” But it is unmistakable that consumer sentiment feels much lower than indicators would have you believe. An </span><a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/many-are-uncertain-about-their-financial-futures-as-household-expenses-outpace-earnings/" rel="">AP-NORC poll</a><span> last Fall concluded that 73% of respondents described the current economic status as poor, 66% indicated that their expenses have risen, while only 25% indicated that their income had risen.&nbsp;That’s worth paying attention to.</span></p><p>Back to the hiring market. Even beyond what I call the “applicant saturation loop” of more job application tools and thus more job applications (which some people dumbly try to escape via ChatGPT cover letters), this hiring market has some fresh challenges for candidates.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Work from home has been great for a lot of people. But the unpredictability about its future has led firms to make wishy-washy demands about employee location at times and globalize the market beyond belief in others. One friend of mine finally secured a position, only to learn in a final round interview that his team’s actual location met deep in the suburbs once a week instead of the city. He couldn’t make it work. One recent&nbsp;</span><a href="https://datapeople.io/hiring-in-a-distributed-world/" rel="">study</a><span> found remote jobs receive over twice the number of applicants for a role than in-person jobs; I strongly suspect the true number is much higher. The pandemic rapidly accelerated the increasingly global nature of jobs. You’re not competing with software engineering graduates in San Jose for the Google internship; you’re competing with everyone in the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This, I’m sure, has harmful impacts to employees. Why invest in them long-term when they’re vastly more replaceable? There is always some person who is qualified in some place where the cost of living is lower. </p><p><span>As roles go global, employers must resort to being increasingly finicky about hiring. Gone is the ZIRP era, money is real again! Maybe there’s a recession around the corner! Hiring decisions seem more serious than they were just a couple years ago, and this means candidates are subject to more tests to validate their ability. Hence more rounds of interviews, more demand for free labor – ahem, sorry, I mean “sample project work.” </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-way-recorded-video-job-interviews-fair-legal-theresa-mcfarlane#:~:text=One%2Dway%2C%20recorded%20video%20job%20interviews%20are%20becoming%20increasingly%20popular,and%20legality%20of%20these%20interviews." rel="">One-way video interviews</a><span> are proliferating widely as the number of applicants for each role increases, making it easier for employers to stack up content (and effort) from candidates and take even longer to sift through it (Who wants to watch 100 videos of people talking about their college internship?) Then at the end, there’s no culture of providing meaningful applicant feedback, either. So for some candidates, the cycle repeats endlessly.</span></p><p><span>People will keep trying to job-hop because it’s generally in their best interest, even if it gives employers less incentive to invest in their employees. According to a recent Gallup </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx" rel="">report</a><span>, 21% of surveyed millennials reported changing jobs within the past year – which is three times higher than any other generation. I am, maybe controversially, fairly opposed to job-hopping. I think meaningful work and growth take a lot of time. But I’m also increasingly aware that the single best way to get the salary increase you’re owed is by job-hopping (and it’s even getting harder to do that). New positions are typically market-rate salaries, while typical raises often </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220720-the-case-for-job-hopping" rel="">don’t match market rates</a><span>. One study of </span><a href="https://money.yahoo.com/job-switchers-are-the-big-winners-202624616.html" rel="">18 million worker salaries</a><span> by Yahoo Finance showed job hopper wages in 2021 outpaced those who stayed in their role. (In some industries, workers received almost a 12% pay increase for job hopping.)</span></p><p>Job hopping and one’s experience of the hiring market more broadly can certainly be benefitted by networking. I’ve never found it as painful as some people say, but I have the privilege of working in an industry that I’m genuinely interested in. But the “networking” that’s generally most relevant here is the effective kind, where your friend or your Dad knows an employer or you who went to specific target school. In this way, networking will always favor the already-privileged. There’s maybe an argument that LinkedIn has flattened the playing field a bit, but I have personal doubts about the real value of such shallow connections. (But I’m happy to be proven wrong on this.)</p><p>If there is a better model out there for candidates, it is probably applying to fewer but more specific jobs (but being occasionally willing to take risks on yourself all the same!). Accepting that you will be relevant to fewer positions, but a greater value-add to those which you are a fit for, seems to be a better allocation of time. For employers, the picture is a bit more complicated. Reshaping how we apply for jobs means potentially advertising roles with more serious “candidate requirements” to limit applicants — but not so serious that you significantly reduce the diversity of your hiring pool. We should also be working towards a cultural norm where work isn’t handed to candidates unless they are deemed very serious contenders for the position, and their work is fairly compensated. Asking someone to perform a day of unpaid labor for you is not just “informative,” it’s also exploitative.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to barrel into an uncertain economic future (don’t forget it’s an election year!), it’s critical to consider how the current structure of our jobs market impacts those who are the least connected. Our attempts to bring universal access and universal candidacy may have backfired somewhat by adding layers of complication to people who just want to be considered for roles and compensated for their labor. But only once we acknowledge these challenges can we start to address them.</p><p><em>*Other ways this tool can be used, according to its marketing: “AI can authenticate candidates by analyzing public data that serve as proof of candidates’ claims. Professional networks like LinkedIn, Meetup, AngelList, Github, and others can be checked for work experience and portfolios. Social media, including Facebook and Twitter, also serve as evidence to show that applicants are who they say they are.” Well, do you think it’s helping your candidacy?</em></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;office with cubicles in primary colors&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="office with cubicles in primary colors" title="office with cubicles in primary colors" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Like a Microsoft Teams meeting but in real-life (I love these retro office photos in </span><a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/retro-offices-youll-either-love-or-hate" rel="">Architectural Digest</a><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

			<p><em>Future Redis releases will continue to offer free and permissive use of the source code under dual RSALv2 and SSPLv1 licenses; these releases will combine advanced data types and processing engines previously only available in Redis Stack.</em></p>



<p>Beginning today, all future versions of Redis will be released with source-available licenses. Starting with Redis 7.4, Redis will be dual-licensed under the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/">Redis Source Available License (RSALv2)</a> and <a href="https://redis.com/legal/server-side-public-license-sspl/">Server Side Public License (SSPLv1)</a>. Consequently, Redis will no longer be distributed under the three-clause Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).</p>



<p>From day one, Redis has provided a foundation of performance and simplicity for the applications and data infrastructure that power the modern Internet. Now, 15 years later, we’re proud to serve millions of developers across the globe by supporting real-time applications the world depends on every day. We have already implemented dual licensing for our advanced Redis modules under the Redis Stack distribution, which has been well received by the community. In fact, more than 50% of redis.io downloads – from Redis 6 and beyond –&nbsp;come from Redis Stack. We now believe that extending this licensing to Redis itself will enable us to continue to evolve the most holistic set of data models, processing engines, and developer capabilities for our users.</p>



<p>The new source-available licenses allow us to sustainably provide permissive use of our source code. We’re leading Redis into its next phase of development as a real-time data platform with a unified set of clients, tools, and core Redis product offerings. The <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis">Redis source code</a> will continue to be freely available to developers, customers, and partners through Redis Community Edition. Future Redis source-available releases will unify core Redis with Redis Stack, including search, JSON, vector, probabilistic, and time-series data models in one free, easy-to-use package as downloadable software. This will allow anyone to easily use Redis across a variety of contexts, including as a high-performance key/value and document store, a powerful query engine, and a low-latency vector database powering generative AI applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The success of Redis has created a unique set of challenges. Redis has been sponsoring the bulk of development alongside a dynamic community of developers eager to contribute. However, the majority of Redis’ commercial sales are channeled through the largest cloud service providers, who commoditize Redis’ investments and its open source community. Despite efforts to support a community-led governance model, and our desire to <a href="https://redis.com/blog/redis-license-bsd-will-remain-bsd/">maintain the BSD license</a>, delivering multiple software distributions simultaneously –&nbsp;across open-source, source-available, and commercial software optimized for different on-premises and cloud platforms&nbsp;– is at odds with our ability to drive Redis successfully into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the new license, cloud service providers hosting Redis offerings will no longer be permitted to use the source code of Redis free of charge. For example, cloud service providers will be able to deliver Redis 7.4 only after agreeing to licensing terms with Redis, the maintainers of the Redis code. These agreements will underpin support for existing integrated solutions and provide full access to forthcoming Redis innovations.</p>



<p>“We look forward to continuing our collaborative work to support developers with the latest data storage and management innovations,” said Julia Liuson, President, Developer Division at Microsoft. “Our collaboration continues to support integrated solutions like Azure Cache for Redis, and will provide Microsoft customers with exclusive access to expanded features within Redis offerings.”</p>



<p>In practice, nothing changes for the Redis developer community who will continue to enjoy permissive licensing under the dual license. At the same time, all the Redis client libraries under the responsibility of Redis will remain open source licensed. Redis will continue to support its vast partner ecosystem – including managed service providers and system integrators – with exclusive access to all future releases, updates, and features developed and delivered by Redis through its <a href="https://redis.com/partners/#becomeapartner">Partner Program</a>. There is no change for existing Redis Enterprise customers.</p>



<p>Our new licensing approach strikes the best balance between making Redis source code broadly available, supporting the developer community with minimal limitations, and protecting our ability to continue investing in feature-rich, free-of-charge software and enterprise products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we have always done, our team, our community, and our customers and partners will continue to lead the way in creating, advancing, and deploying Redis as the leading real-time data platform.</p>



<p>For more information, please read the FAQ on the license change below.</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>1. What did Redis announce today?</p>



<div>
<p>Redis announced a transition from the BSD 3-Clause License to a dual license approach for Redis core software, using the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/">Redis Source Available License version 2</a> (RSALv2) or the Server Side Public License version 1 (SSPLv1) starting with Redis v7.4 and for all future releases of Redis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RSALv2 is a permissive non-copyleft license, allowing the right to “use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software” and has only two primary limitations. Under RSALv2, you may not:</p>



<p>-Commercialize the software or provide it to others as a managed service; and</p>



<p>-Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices.</p>



<p>Our dual license approach is not new; we released Redis modules (including RedisJSON, Redis Stack, etc.) under the dual licenses on Nov. 15, 2022. Now, we are moving to dual licensing for all our freely available software. We believe that the permissive approach of RSALv2 and the standard wording we use to define its limitations solve many of the challenges raised by our community.</p>



<p>This dual-license approach allows users to choose between a permissive but less well-known license, RSALv2, or a more commonly used but copyleft license, such as SSPLv1.</p>



<p>To be clear, neither RSALv2 nor SSPL is an OSI-approved license, and each has its restrictions. Simply put, RSALv2 places some limits on commercializing the software. SSPLv1 requires that if you provide the product as a service, you must publicly release any modifications and the source code of your management layers under SSPL.</p>



<p>The necessity of source-available licenses in the cloud era has been discussed many times, and we are proud to contribute to this effort by adopting standards developers already know and use. We believe the dual license provides clarity and flexibility for Redis developers in how they can leverage our latest technologies.</p>



<p>Other permissively licensed technologies associated with Redis such as various language-specific client libraries, Terraform and Pulumi providers, and more are unaffected by this change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, starting with Redis 8 we plan to include in our offerings, by default, new data types and processing engines which previously were licensed under the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 as part of Redis Stack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, we are also announcing the end of life for Redis Stack once Redis 8 is available, as a result of this change. It will no longer be necessary to provide a separate build of these capabilities as they will be part of Redis itself starting with Redis 8.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>2. Why is Redis Inc. making this change?</p>



<div>
<p>We want all developers to have access to the best technology we have to offer. But, we had to do all of these module gymnastics to advance things which honestly should be in the core of Redis itself. We weren’t being true to the original manifesto — we’re against complexity. So, this change aligns the licensing in a way that we can simplify the packaging and release of additional data types and more in a way that is simple and consistent.</p>



<p>We strongly believe in the value of openly sharing source code and enabling practitioners to solve their problems, build communities, and create transparency. Redis provides feature-rich products to the community for free, and that development is made possible by our commercial customers who partner with us. By shifting to this license, Redis can better manage commercial uses of our source code and continue to invest in our thriving community of practitioners, some of whom are also contributors, in a manner that will not impede their work.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>3. What are the implications of this change for end users of Redis’ open source products?</p>



<div><p>For end users who are using Redis’ open source version of Redis and new releases using either of the dual licenses for their internal or personal usage, there is no change.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>4. What are the implications of this change for third-party libraries which leverage Redis?</p>



<div><p>For integration partners who built client libraries or other integrations with Redis, there is no change.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>5. What are the implications of this change for commercial customers of Redis?</p>



<div><p>For commercial customers of Redis there is no change. Those customers get our technology under separately negotiated licensing terms.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>6. Who is impacted by this change?</p>



<div><p>Organizations providing competitive offerings to Redis will no longer be permitted to use new versions of the source code of Redis free of charge under either of the dual licenses. Commercial licensing terms are available and can enable use cases beyond the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 license limitations. If you are building a solution that leverages Redis, but does not specifically compete with Redis itself, there is no impact. If you have specific concerns or questions that you wish to discuss, please email <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>7. What is a “competitive offering” as defined under the Redis RSALv2 or SSPLv1 licenses?</p>



<div><p>A “competitive offering” is a product that is sold to third parties, including through paid support arrangements, that is derived from the Redis’ code-base and significantly overlaps the capabilities of a Redis commercial product. For example, this definition would include hosting or embedding Redis as part of a solution that is sold competitively against our commercial versions of Redis (either Redis Enterprise Software or Redis Cloud).&nbsp;Custom licensing terms are also available to provide more clarity and enable use cases beyond the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 limitations. If you need further clarification with respect to a particular use case, you can email <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>8. What products will be covered by RSALv2 or SSPLv1 in their next release?</p>



<div><p>This change effectively aligns the licensing of all of our source available modules with the core of Redis.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>9. What is the SSPLv1 License?</p>



<div><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License">SSPL </a>is based on the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), with a modified Section 13 that requires that those making SSPL-licensed software available to third-parties (modified or not) as part of a “service” must release the source code for the entirety of the service, including without limitation all “management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available”, under the SSPL. MongoDB is the publisher of this license. You can find their original FAQ about the license <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">here</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>10. If I modify the source code of software licensed under the SSPL, can I redistribute my modified version under another license?</p>



<div>
<p>No. Your modified version consists of the original software and your modifications, which together constitute a derivative work of the original software. The SSPL license does not grant you the right to redistribute under another license.</p>



<p>However, if you choose to use the RSALv2 license (under the dual license), you may modify and redistribute the code, provided that you don’t make the functionality of the Software or a Modified version available to third parties as a service or distribute the Software or a Modified version in a manner that makes the functionality of the Software available to third parties</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>11. Can I continue to use versions of the products that were provided under the original 3-clause BSD license?</p>



<div><p>Yes. The license change is not retroactive. This means all source code and releases prior to the change remain under the 3-clause BSD license. You may continue to use those versions indefinitely under the original license, as long as you abide by its terms and conditions. Redis plans to continue to provide security updates and address other critical defects within these releases until Redis Community Edition is available per our current <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/security/policy">security policy</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>12. Will Redis backport security patches to previous releases under the 3-clause BSD license?</p>



<div><p>Redis will continue to backport critical security patches, as available, to existing versions under the 3-clause license until Redis Community Edition 9.0 is released, consistent with the <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/security/policy">current security policy</a>. Any patches after that date will be provided under the new dual license.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>13. Does Redis still believe in open source?</p>



<div>
<p>First, we openly acknowledge that this change means Redis is no longer open source under the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/">OSI definition</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we give away more technology than we monetize. Every day someone is using a free version of Redis in amazing and incredibly innovative ways and we applaud that. We will continue to invest to ensure that Redis remains a compelling and competitive platform for years to come.</p>



<p>Third, changing the license term to protect one’s brand and IP has become a natural part of the evolution of many open source projects in order for commercial entities which back those technologies to survive and thrive as businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, Redis remains a proponent of the open source philosophy and maintains a large number of open source projects, including many of the language specific client libraries (see https://github.com/redis) used with Redis, integration tooling such as the Redis Input-Output Tool (see https://github.com/redis-developer) and more. For those who wish to contribute, we remain open to accepting future contributions – as we have done with our source available modules over the past five years.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>14. How does Redis now refer to the freely available versions of products that were formerly known as open source (or OSS)?</p>



<div><p>We have referred to versions of our products as either open source (OSS), Enterprise, or Cloud. Redis v7.2 and prior releases will continue to be called Redis OSS. Starting with Redis v7.4, we will refer to the open, freely available versions as Redis Community Edition. Both the RSALv2 and SSPL v1 licenses provide open and free access to the underlying source code of Redis Community Edition. However, it does not meet the definition of open source as defined by OSI, and that is why we will refer to the products as the “community edition” rather than the “open source” edition, as we did previously. There are many references to open source on our websites, and we are actively working to clarify these language changes in the coming weeks.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>15. How do I work with Redis to offer managed services?</p>



<div><p>Integration and managed service provider partners can continue building, operating, and delivering solutions that leverage Redis Community Edition and Enterprise in a non-competitive offering by entering into a partnership with Redis. Community and Enterprise level partners will continue to benefit from incentives, technical training, certification, and sales training. Crucially, partners will receive exclusive access to forthcoming Redis technologies, features, and releases that will be protected under the dual license. To become a Redis partner or learn more about our partner benefits, please visit our <a href="https://redis.com/partners/#becomeapartner">Partner Program site</a>. For existing partners with any questions regarding the licensing change, please email <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>16. I’m building (or have built) a product that embeds Redis, and I’m concerned you may view it as competitive. How can I get clarity as to whether my product will violate the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 licenses?</p>



<div><p>Please reach out to us. We are happy to speak with you. The best way to begin the conversation is at <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>. We can provide timely feedback to your questions and discuss constructive solutions, including potential exemptions and/or partnership arrangements.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>17. I am the author of an open-source project that uses Redis in a non-competitive way. If someone else uses my project to produce a competitive product or hosted service (e.g., starts using my project in their SaaS solution), am I at risk of being considered competitive and violating the dual license? Do I need to track all users of my project and report suspected infringing use?</p>



<div><p>Only those who are embedding or hosting Redis products in a competitive manner are in violation of the license. The violation does not extend to a project owner who is not doing so and does not require asking others to do so on its behalf. The project owner has no obligation to monitor or report on how others are using their project.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>18. Can I continue to provide professional services around Redis products?</p>



<div><p>Yes. We have a large ecosystem of systems integrator partners that provide consulting and professional services to help users deploy, manage, and operate our products for their internal use. The change to our license is not intended to deter partners from providing those services, and we will continue to encourage and support these types of systems integrator partners. Instead, the RSALv2 simply prevents embedding or hosting our community products in a manner competitive with ours.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>19. Can I mix the code made available under either RSALv2 or SSPLv1 with code provided under a different license (i.e., Apache, MPL, etc.) in my project?</p>



<div><p>Yes, provided that each of the components keep their own license, and you do not mix the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 code with strong copyleft licensed code such as GPL. With respect to some permissive licenses like Apache, you may also provide the whole program under RSALv2 or SSPLv1, but include a notice for the Apache portion (this is possible because Apache, unlike some other open source licenses, grants the right to sublicense). Keep in mind that if you mix code under different licenses, you may not be able to re-distribute it in a way that complies with all the licenses.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>20. Can I host Redis as a service internal to my organization?</p>



<div><p>Yes. The terms of the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 allow for all non-production and production usage, except for providing competitive offerings to third parties that embed or host our software. Hosting the products for the internal use of your organization is permitted. An organization includes its affiliates and subsidiaries. This means one division can host Redis for use by another internal division.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>21. What if Redis releases a new product or feature in the future that makes my project competitive?</p>



<div><p>If Redis creates an offering in the future that is competitive with a product you are already offering in production, your continued use of the hosted or embedded Redis product will not be considered a violation of the RSALv2 or SSPLv1, as long as the version you are using was released before Redis released its new offering.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>22. Are there updated requirements for the usage of “Redis” in my product name?</p>



<div><p>Yes, there are updated requirements on the use of “Redis” in product names. You can no longer use “Redis” or “for Redis” in your product name, but you can use the name “Redis” in your product descriptions or specify that your product is Redis-compatible or based on legacy-Redis. Additional information around usage of the Redis name and logo can be found in our <a href="https://redis.com/legal/trademark-policy/">Trademark Policy</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>23. Where can I learn more about this announcement or ask further questions?</p>




</div>



<div>
<p>24. Will Redis accept community contributions under the new license?</p>



<div><p>Redis remains a proponent of the open source philosophy and maintains a large number of open source projects. For those who wish to contribute, we remain open to accepting future contributions – as we have done with our source available modules over the past five years.Going forward, acceptance of the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/redis-software-grant-and-contributor-license-agreement/">contributor license agreement</a> (CLA) by the contributor is necessary in order for us to consider the contribution.</p></div>

            <link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Red-Hat-Nova-Rust-Abstractions</link>
            <guid>39772409</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 21:49:54 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Red-Hat-Nova-Rust-Abstractions">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Red-Hat-Nova-Rust-Abstractions</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39772409">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="NOUVEAU" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/nouveau.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Red Hat's display driver team has recently been devising plans for Nova, a new to-be-developed Linux DRM kernel driver written in Rust for open-source NVIDIA graphics support as the successor/replacement to Nouveau for newer NVIDIA GPU generations supporting the GPU System Processor (GSP). Making this effort all the more involved is being written in Rust at a time when various kernel abstractions are still being devised and not yet upstreamed.
</p><p>
Nova is ultimately aiming to be a modern open-source NVIDIA Linux DRM driver for Turing GPUs and newer (RTX 2000 series) where there is the GPU System Processor (GSP) support. The Nouveau DRM driver recently mainlined optional support for the GSP -- or mandatory support beginning with the latest RTX 40 series -- while Nova will be a modern replacement, written in Rust, and without the Nouveau baggage that's built up over the years in supporting NVIDIA GPUs going back to its early days.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=nova" alt="Nova"></p>
<p>This Rust-based GSP-only driver is promising looking out well into the future for hopefully being more performant and capable than the Nouveau driver, similar to the forward-focused Intel Xe driver doing away with all the cruft built up over the years in the i915 Direct Rendering Manager code.
</p><p>
By going with Rust, the Red Hat developers involved hope it will boast better memory safety and in turn better maintainability and a lower barrier for new developers to become involved.</p><p>Focusing just on GSP-capable GPUs also simplifies the driver development with much of the hardware initialization/management left up to the GSP and its firmware/microcode rather than being programmed by the device driver. The Nouveau driver will continue to exist for those on older NVIDIA graphics cards.
</p><p>
While there is the Apple Silicon DRM driver being developed by the Asahi crew in Rust, that too is out-of-tree. The challenge with no upstream Rust DRM driver yet -- or other major full-featured Rust kernel driver -- is the lack of various abstractions. For some areas Rust kernel abstractions exist but haven't yet been upstreamed.
</p><p>
In beginning to work through the necessary abstractions for the Nova driver, Red Hat's Danilo Krummrich published a mailing list post entitled "<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/Zfsj0_tb-0-tNrJy@cassiopeiae/">Nova and staging Rust abstractions</a>" for walking through the different Git trees with Rust abstractions for DRM, device abstractions, PCI, etc.  The early stage Nova code itself continues to be developed via <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/nova">drm/nova on FreeDesktop.org</a>. It will be interesting to see how Nova pans out over time.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">GritQL comes from our experiences with conducting large scale refactors and migrations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Usually, migrations start with exploratory work to figure out the scope of the problem—often using simple grep searches. These are easy to start with, but most migrations end up accumulating additional requirements like ensuring the right packages are imported and excluding cases which don’t have a viable migration path.</p>
<p dir="auto">Eventually, any complex migration ends up being a full codemod program written with a tool like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift">jscodeshift</a>. This comes with its own problems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Most of the exploratory work has to be abandoned as you figure out how to represent your original regex search as an AST.</li>
<li>Reading/writing a codemod requires mentally translating from AST names back to what source code actually looks like.</li>
<li>Most frameworks are not composable, so you’re stuck copying patterns back and forth.</li>
<li>Performance is often an afterthought, so iterating on a large codemod can be painfully slow.</li>
<li>Codemod frameworks are language-specific, so if you’re hopping between multiple languages—or trying to migrate a shared API—you have to learn different frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">GritQL is our attempt to develop a powerful middle ground:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Exploratory analysis is easy: just put a code snippet in backticks and use <code>$metavariables</code> for holes you want to represent.</li>
<li>Incrementally add complexity by introducing side conditions with where clauses.</li>
<li>Reuse named patterns to avoid rebuilding queries, and use shared patterns from our <a href="https://github.com/getgrit/stdlib">standard library</a> for common tasks like ensuring modules are imported.</li>
<li>Written in Rust for maximum performance: rewrite millions of lines of code in seconds.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/openais-chatbot-store-is-filling-up-with-spam/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/openais-chatbot-store-is-filling-up-with-spam/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39769708">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/openai-launches-a-store-for-custom-ai-powered-chatbots/">GPTs</a>, custom chatbots powered by OpenAI’s generative AI models, onstage at the company’s first-ever <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai-devday/">developer conference</a> in November, he described them as a way to “accomplish all sorts of tasks” — from programming to learning about esoteric scientific subjects to getting workout pointers.</p>
<p>“Because [GPTs] combine instructions, expanded knowledge and actions, they can be more helpful to you,” Altman said. “You can build a GPT … for almost anything.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t kidding about the anything part.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found that the GPT Store, OpenAI’s official marketplace for GPTs, is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs that imply a light touch where it concerns OpenAI’s moderation efforts. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that purport to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services, and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools such as Turnitin and Copyleaks.</p>
<h2>Missing moderation</h2>
<p>To list GPTs in the GPT Store, developers have to verify their user profiles and submit GPTs to OpenAI’s review system, which involves a mix of human and automated review. Here’s a spokesperson on the process:</p>
<blockquote><p>We use a combination of automated systems, human review and user reports to find and assess GPTs that potentially violate our policies. Violations can lead to actions against the content or your account, such as warnings, sharing restrictions or ineligibility for inclusion in GPT Store or monetization.</p></blockquote>
<p>Building GPTs doesn’t require coding experience, and GPTs can be as simple — or complex — as the creator wishes. Developers can type the capabilities they want to offer into OpenAI’s GPT-building tool, GPT Builder, and the tool will attempt to make a GPT to perform those.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the low barrier to entry, the GPT Store has grown rapidly — OpenAI in January said that it had roughly 3 million GPTs. But this growth appears to have come at the expense of quality — as well as adherence to OpenAI’s own terms.</p>
<h2>Copyright issues</h2>
<p>There are several GPTs ripped from popular movie, TV and video game franchises in the GPT Store — GPTs not created or authorized (to TechCrunch’s knowledge) by those franchises’ owners. One GPT creates monsters in the style of “Monsters, Inc.,” the Pixar movie, while another promises text-based adventures set in the “Star Wars” universe.</p>

<p>These GPTs — along with the GPTs in the GPT Store that let users speak with trademarked characters like Wario and Aang from “Avatar: The Last Airbender” — set the stage for copyright drama.</p>
<p>Kit Walsh, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained it thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>[These GPTs] can be used to create transformative works as well as for infringement [where <em>transformative works</em> refer to a type of fair use shielded from copyright claims.] The individuals engaging in infringement, of course, could be liable, and the creator of an otherwise lawful tool can essentially talk themselves into liability if they encourage users to use the tool in infringing ways.

<p>It is, however, a bad look for a company embroiled in IP litigation.</p>
<h2>Academic dishonesty</h2>
<p>OpenAI’s terms explicitly prohibit developers from building GPTs that promote academic dishonesty. Yet the GPT Store is filled with GPTs suggesting they can bypass AI content detectors, including detectors sold to educators through plagiarism scanning platforms.</p>
<p>One GPT claims to be a “sophisticated” rephrasing tool “undetectable” by popular AI content detectors like Originality.ai and Copyleaks. Another, Humanizer Pro — ranked No. 2 in the Writing category on the GPT Store — says that it “humanizes” content to bypass AI detectors, maintaining a text’s “meaning and quality” while delivering a “100% human” score.</p>

<p>Some of these GPTs are thinly veiled pipelines to premium services. Humanizer, for instance, invites users to try a “premium plan” to “use [the] most advanced algorithm,” which transmits text entered into the GPT to a plug-in from a third-party site, GPTInf. Subscriptions to GPTInf cost $12 per month for 10,000 words per month or $8 per month on an annual plan — a little steep on top of OpenAI’s $20-per-month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/openai-launches-chatgpt-plus-starting-at-20-per-month/">ChatGPT Plus</a>.</p>

<p>Now, we’ve written before about how AI content detectors are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/most-sites-claiming-to-catch-ai-written-text-fail-spectacularly/">largely bunk</a>. Beyond our own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/most-sites-claiming-to-catch-ai-written-text-fail-spectacularly/">tests</a>, a number of academic studies demonstrate that they’re neither accurate nor reliable. <em>However</em>, it remains the case that OpenAI is allowing tools on the GPT Store that promote academically dishonest behavior — even if the behavior doesn’t have the intended outcome.</p>
<p>The OpenAI spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>GPTs that are for academic dishonesty, including cheating, are against our policy. This would include GPTs that are stated to be for circumventing academic integrity tools like plagiarism detectors. We see some GPTs that are for ‘humanizing’ text. We’re still learning from the real world use of these GPTs, but we understand there are many reasons why users might prefer to have AI-generated content that doesn’t ‘sound’ like AI.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Impersonation</h2>
<p>In its policies, OpenAI also forbids GPT developers from creating GPTs that impersonate people or organizations without their “consent or legal right.”</p>
<p>However, there’s plenty of GPTs on the GPT Store that claim to represent the views — or otherwise imitate the personalities of — people.</p>

<p>A search for “Elon Musk,” “Donald Trump,” “Leonardo DiCaprio,” “Barack Obama” and “Joe Rogan” yields dozens of GPTs — some obviously satirical, some less so — that simulate conversations with their namesakes. Some GPTs present themselves not as people, but as authorities on well-known companies’ products — like MicrosoftGPT, an “expert in all things Microsoft.”</p>

<p>Do these rise to the level of impersonation given that many of the targets are public figures and, in some cases, clearly parodies? That’s for OpenAI to clarify.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We allow creators to instruct their GPTs to respond ‘in the style of’ a specific real person so long as they don’t impersonate them, such as being named as a real person, being instructed to fully emulate them, and including their image as a GPT profile picture.</p></blockquote>

<p>The company recently suspended the developer of a GPT mimicking long-shot Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Dean Phillips, which went so far as to include a disclaimer explaining that it was an AI tool. But OpenAI said its removal in response to a violation of its policy on political campaigning <em>in addition to&nbsp;</em>impersonation — not impersonation alone.</p>
<h2>Jailbreaks</h2>
<p>Also somewhat incredulously on the GPT Store are attempts at jailbreaking OpenAI’s models — albeit not very successful ones.</p>
<p>There are multiple GPTs using DAN on the marketplace, DAN (short for “Do Anything Now”) being a popular prompting method used to get models to respond to prompts unbounded by their usual rules. The few I tested wouldn’t respond to <em>any</em> dicey prompt I threw their way (e.g. “how do I build a bomb?”), but they were generally more willing to use… well, <em>less-flattering</em> language than the vanilla ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>GPTs that are described or instructed to evade OpenAI safeguards or break OpenAI policies are against our policy. GPTs that attempt to steer model behavior in other ways — including generally trying to make GPT more permissive without violating our usage policies — are allowed.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Growing pains</h2>
<p>OpenAI pitched the GPT Store at launch as a sort of expert-curated collection of powerful productivity-boosting AI tools. And it <em>is</em> that — those tools’ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-is-tutoring-students-but-still-struggles-with-basic-math-694e76d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flaws aside</a>. But it’s also quickly devolving into a breeding ground for spammy, legally dubious and perhaps even harmful GPTs, or at least GPTs that very transparently runs afoul of its rules.</p>
<p>If this is the state of the GPT Store today, monetization threatens to open an entirely new can of worms. OpenAI has pledged that GPT developers will eventually be able to “earn money based on how many people are using [their] GPTs” and perhaps even offer subscriptions to individual GPTs. But how’s Disney or the Tolkien Estate going to react when the creators of unsanctioned Marvel- or Lord of the Rings-themed GPTs start raking in cash?</p>
<p>OpenAI’s motivation with the GPT Store is clear. As my colleague Devin Coldewey’s written, Apple’s App Store model has proven unbelievably lucrative, and OpenAI, quite simply, is trying to carbon copy it. GPTs are hosted and developed on OpenAI platforms, where they’re also promoted and evaluated. And, as of a few weeks ago, they can be invoked from the ChatGPT interface directly by ChatGPT Plus users, an added incentive to pick up a subscription.</p>
<p>But the GPT Store is running into the teething problems many of the largest-scale app, product and service digital marketplaces did in their early days. Beyond spam, a recent <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-chatbot-app-store-is-off-to-a-slow-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> in The Information revealed that GPT Store developers are struggling to attract users in part because of the GPT Store’s limited back-end analytics and subpar onboarding experience.</p>
<p>One might’ve assumed OpenAI — for all its talk of curation and the importance of safeguards — would’ve taken pains to avoid the obvious pitfalls. But that doesn’t appear to be the case. The GPT Store is a mess — and, if something doesn’t change soon, it may well stay that way.</p>

                  <p><span>Good questions. Execution cost is indeed higher than traditional testing automation scripts but much lower than the human cost of writing and maintaining the scripts. We're starting at $500/month and our plans go up from there depending on how many devices you want to test across. We do have customers running across multiple devices and OS versions today.</span></p></div></td></tr>

1. Integration tests are notoriously slow, the demo seemed to take some time to do basic actions; is it even possible to run these at scale?
2. &gt;Flaky UI tests suck; they can be flaky but it's often due to bad code and architecture. Any data to backup your tool makes the tests less flaky? I could see a scenario where there are 2 buttons with the same text, but under the hood we'd use different identifiers in-code to determine which button should be tapped in UI.<p>Overall I'm a bit skeptical because most UI tests are pretty easy to write today with very natural DSLs that are close to natural language, but definitely want to follow and hear more production use cases.

                  <p><span>The issue with this approach is that for all but the most simple apps it is not possible to deduce the runtime element information needed to write traditional UI tests given just the source code. This can only be done reliably at runtime which is what we do. We run your app and iteratively build UI tests that can be reused later.</span></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p><span>Great questions.
1. Yes, running tests in parallel helps. We also cache actions so subsequent runs are much faster (this is disabled in the demo).
2. I agree that testing can be much more reliable and pleasant in some codebases than others. I have not been blessed with these types of codebases in my career. Flakiness is from personal experience automating UI tests specifically and having them break when a new nondeterministic popup modal is added or another engineer breaks an identifier/locator strategy.
That being said, if you like writing UI tests and your codebase supports easily maintaining them, there are some really cool DSLs like Maestro!</span></p></div></td></tr>

If a modal pops up on the screen in a test, how does CamelQA resolve this and how would it know if it's an actual regression or not? If a modal pops up on a screen at the wrong time that _could_ be a real regression, versus a developer forgetting to configure some local state.

<p>Files comes with a <strong>new global search feature</strong> in GNOME 46. The feature is simple: activate it by clicking the new search button, or by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> shortcut, then enter your query to search all your configured search locations.</p>

<p>Global search is a great way to jump directly into search, without having to think about where the items you want are located. The new feature also leverages GNOME’s existing file search capabilities, including the ability to search the contents of files, and filter by file type and modification date.</p>

<p>Another great thing about global search is that it makes it possible to search multiple locations simultaneously, which can include locations that aren’t in your home directory. To set this up, go to the newly refined search locations settings, and add the locations that you want to be included.</p>

<h2 id="enhanced-files-app">Enhanced Files App</h2>

<p>In addition to global search, the Files app has had a serious upgrade for GNOME 46. Feedback about long-running file operations has been improved, with a new dynamic progress section at the bottom of the sidebar. This makes it possible to view the progress of individual operations, as well as see which operations are ongoing and which have finished.</p>

<p>Significant code refactoring during the development of GNOME 46 has also delivered a welcome performance upgrade in the Files app. In the past, switching between list and grid view would involve a delay and content would progressively load on screen. In GNOME 46, this is gone: changing view is instantaneous, making for a faster and more frictionless experience.</p>

<p>Finally, Files in GNOME 46 also comes with a fantastic set of other smaller improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Search for preferences:</strong> you can now search within the Files preferences to locate specific settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed date and time:</strong> the Files preferences now include an option to show the date and time in a more comprehensive and consistent format.</li>
  <li><strong>Location entry on click:</strong> quickly access the file location address bar by clicking on the file path area.</li>
  <li><strong>Starred favorites in grid view:</strong> quickly identify and access your starred files with visual markers in grid view.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved network discovery:</strong> more available networked devices now appear in the Other Locations view.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage you to explore the new features in Files and experience a whole new level of file management efficiency!</p>

<h2 id="upgraded-online-accounts-now-with-onedrive">Upgraded Online Accounts, Now With OneDrive</h2>

<p>GNOME’s Online Accounts feature have had a major upgrade for GNOME 46. The biggest improvement is the new <strong>support for Microsoft OneDrive</strong>. Setup a Microsoft 365 account from the settings, and your OneDrive will appear in the Files sidebar, where it can be easily browsed and accessed alongside your local files and folders.</p>

<p>A collection of additional improvements to Online Accounts have also been made, thanks to funding from the <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/11/09/gnome-recognized-as-public-interest-infrastructure/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The default web browser is now used when signing into accounts as part of account setup. This allows a <strong>wider range of authentication methods</strong> to be used, such as USB tokens.</li>
  <li>A <strong>new WebDAV account type</strong> has been added, providing a generic method for integrating online contacts, calendars and files into your GNOME experience.</li>
  <li>The Online Accounts <strong>settings have also had a complete revamp</strong>, and now have modern up to date designs.</li>
</ul>

<p>A necessary consequence of these changes is that Online Accounts are no longer included as part of the initial system setup assistant.</p>

<h2 id="remote-login-with-rdp">Remote Login with RDP</h2>

<p>GNOME’s remote desktop experience has been significantly enhanced for version 46, with the introduction of a new <strong>dedicated remote login option</strong>. This allows remotely connecting to a GNOME system which is not already in use. Connecting in this way means that the system’s display can be configured from the remote side, resulting in a better experience for the remote user.</p>

<p>The new remote login feature means that GNOME systems can be used as fully fledged remote resources. It can be found in the Remote Desktop settings, which provide information on how to connect.</p>

<h2 id="stepped-up-settings">Stepped-Up Settings</h2>

<p>The Settings app has received a comprehensive update in GNOME 46.</p>

<h3 id="navigation-improvements">Navigation Improvements</h3>

<p>The Settings app has been reorganized for GNOME 46, to make it <strong>easier to navigate</strong>. To this end, a new System section has been created, which contains preferences for <em>Region &amp; Language</em>, <em>Date &amp; Time</em>, <em>Users</em>, <em>Remote Desktop</em>, <em>Secure Shell</em>, and <em>About</em>. The Apps settings have also been consolidated, and now include the Default Apps and Removable Media settings.</p>

<p>These changes have the effect of reducing the total number of sections in the Settings app, giving you fewer places to browse and a faster path to the settings you need.</p>

<h3 id="new-touchpad-settings">New Touchpad Settings</h3>

<p>The touchpad settings have been expanded for GNOME 46, with two new settings. The first, called <strong>Secondary Click</strong> provides configuration for how secondary clicks (often called “right click”) are performed with a touchpad, and includes options to use either two fingers on the pad, or to click in the corner of the pad.</p>

<p>The second new setting allows the <strong>Disable Touchpad While Typing</strong> behavior to be turned off. Doing this allows touchpad movement to be combined with key presses, which can be necessary for some apps and games.</p>

<h3 id="massive-polish-effort">Massive Polish Effort</h3>

<p>The Settings app has also received a vast amount of polish for GNOME 46. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved settings descriptions and tooltips</li>
  <li>more keyboard mnemonics, to enhance keyboard navigation (hold down Alt to see these)</li>
  <li>extensive UI modernization and refinement</li>
  <li>additional options for compose key assignment</li>
  <li>faster loading of the appearance settings, as well as sharper previews</li>
  <li>additional fine-grained control when setting Wacom stylus pressure</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether, these improvements result in a Settings app which is clearer, easier to understand, and is fantastic to use.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-improvements">Accessibility Improvements</h2>

<p>Accessibility has been a strong work theme for GNOME 46, with multiple aspects of accessibility seeing improvements. Much of this work has centered on the Orca screen reader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under the hood, a <strong>significant modernization effort</strong> has been under way. This will result in improved performance and reliability, and will enable compatibility with Wayland and sandboxed apps in the future.</li>
  <li>A <strong>new sleep mode</strong> feature has been added. This much requested feature allows users to temporarily disable Orca, using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> shortcut. Sleep mode is useful when using virtual machines that have their own screen readers, as well as self-voicing apps.</li>
  <li>New commands allow Orca to <strong>report system status</strong>, including battery status, CPU and memory usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Table navigation</strong> has been much improved, with more apps being supported and new commands added, including toggle table navigation (<kbd>Orca</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and move to the final cell (<kbd>Orca</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>🡰</kbd>/<kbd>🡲</kbd>/<kbd>🡱</kbd>/<kbd>🡳</kbd>).</li>
  <li>Orca now has <strong>experimental support for Spiel</strong>, an exciting next generation speech synthesis API. Those who are interested in this feature are <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca#experimental-features">invited to help test it</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Orca hasn’t been the only place where accessibility improvements have happened for GNOME 46. Other accessibility improvements include an <strong>high contrast mode</strong>  which is now more consistent and usable, and a <strong>new setting to show on and off symbols in switches</strong>.</p>

<p>Much of this accessibility work was funded by the <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/11/09/gnome-recognized-as-public-interest-infrastructure/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a>.</p>

<h2 id="system-enhancements">System Enhancements</h2>

<p>GNOME 46 contains many small improvements and polish changes to the core GNOME experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Beautiful fallback avatars:</strong> if you don’t specify an avatar for your user account, GNOME generates one for you. These fallback avatars have been refreshed for 46, and look fantastic. If you are upgrading from a previous version, clear out your old avatar to see the new default avatars in action.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced notifications:</strong> with improved layouts, and a new header in each notification to show which app sent it. It is now also possible to expand notifications in the list, in order to use notification actions at a time that suits you.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://release.gnome.org/46/notifications-screenshot.png" alt="Enhanced Notifications"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>New app launching shortcuts:</strong> apps which have been pinned to the dash can now be launched using <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;Number&gt;</kbd>. For example, <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> will launch the first app in the dash. GNOME 46 includes additional shortcuts to allow launching a new window, by adding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> modifier, for example: <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;Number&gt;</kbd> to launch a new window for the first app in the dash.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved on-screen keyboard:</strong> with automatic capitalization and new keyboard layouts for entering phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs.</li>
  <li><strong>Tap to click is now enabled by default:</strong> for a more intuitive touch experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="better-apps">Better Apps</h2>

<p>Many of GNOME’s core apps have also been upgraded for GNOME 46. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved Software app:</strong> this now shows verified badges for Flathub apps whose developers have been verified, ensuring a trusted source for your software. The Software app also has redesigned preferences, better error messages, and a new keyboard shortcuts window.</li>
  <li><strong>Various Maps enhancements:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>An updated OpenStreetMap point of interest editing experience, as well as other user interface and routing improvements.</li>
      <li>New map style and support for dark mode</li>
      <li>Information about multiple floors is now shown for points of interest that have them</li>
      <li>Expanded public transit routing (now available for Norway)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Redesigned Extensions app:</strong> a cleaner list makes it easier to scan and toggle your installed extensions, and the modernized design is also adaptive. It is now also possible to turn off extensions which have been automatically deactivated.</li>
  <li><strong>Polished Calendar app:</strong> with improved visuals, modernized interfaces, and performance improvements.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick timers in Clocks:</strong> when starting a timer, click a duration in the quick start section to quickly start a timer.</li>
  <li><strong>Smarter Contacts:</strong> multiple VCard files can now be imported at the same time and, when importing new contacts, the confirmation dialog will also helpfully preview the names of the contacts to import.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitor disk usage:</strong> Disks has gained a new resource graph for disk I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-under-the-hood">Improvements Under the Hood</h2>

<p>The improvements in GNOME 46 are not just skin deep, and the new version comes with deep technical enhancements which result in a more performant and refined experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance and resource usage improvements</strong>, including reduced memory usage for search, enhanced screen recording performance, and more intelligent use of system resources by the image viewer app. There have also been significant speed improvements in GNOME’s terminal apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Security improvements</strong> include enhanced protection from malware in the image viewer app and GNOME’s search technologies.</li>
  <li><strong>Rendering improvements</strong> include sharper app interfaces, crisper on-screen text, and clearer UIs when using fractional display scales. These rendering improvements are thanks to GTK’s new renderers, and are found in GNOME apps which use the latest GTK version.</li>
  <li><strong>Variable refresh rates (VRR)</strong> is a feature which can, under some circumstances, produce smoother video performance. This is included in GNOME 46 as an experimental feature, which needs to be enabled by entering the following from the command line using: <code>gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['variable-refresh-rate']"</code>. Once enabled, a variable refresh rate can be set from the display settings.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>If you read any personal finance forums late last year, there's a decent chance you ran across a question from someone who was desperately trying to lose money before the end of the year. There are a number of ways someone could do this; one commonly suggested scheme was to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option">put options that were expected to expire worthless</a>, allowing the buyer to (probably) take a loss.</p> <p>One reason people were looking for ways to lose money was that, in the U.S., there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Subsidy_Cliff_at_400%_FPL">a hard income cutoff for a health insurance subsidy</a> at $48,560 for individuals (higher for larger households; $100,400 for a family of four). There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn't have been uncommon for an individual going from one side of the cut-off to the other to have their health insurance cost increase by roughly $7200/yr. That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they'd be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k.</p> <p>Although that's an unusually severe example, <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/11-15-2012-MarginalTaxRates.pdf">U.S. tax policy is full of discontinuities that disincentivize increasing earnings and, in some cases, actually incentivize decreasing earnings</a>. Some other discontinuities are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families">TANF</a> income limit, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a> income limit, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program">CHIP</a> income limit for free coverage, and the CHIP income limit for reduced-cost coverage. These vary by location and circumstance; the TANF and Medicaid income limits fall into ranges generally considered to be "low income" and the CHIP limits fall into ranges generally considered to be "middle class". These subsidy discontinuities have the same impact as the ACA subsidy discontinuity -- at certain income levels, people are incentivized to lose money.</p> <blockquote> <p>Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the treasury. There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes. Over and over again the Courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everyone does it, rich and poor alike and all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you agree with the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_Hand">Learned Hand</a> quote then losing money in order to reduce effective tax rate, increasing disposable income, is completely legitimate behavior at the individual level. However, a tax system that encourages people to lose money, perhaps by funneling it to (on average) much wealthier options traders by buying put options, seems sub-optimal.</p> <p>A simple fix for the problems mentioned above would be to have slow phase-outs instead of sharp thresholds. Slow phase-outs are actually done for some subsidies and, while that can also have problems, they are typically less problematic than introducing a sharp discontinuity in tax/subsidy policy.</p> <p>In this post, we'll look at a variety of discontinuities.</p> <h3 id="hardware-or-software-queues">Hardware or software queues</h3> <p>A naive queue has discontinuous behavior. If the queue is full, new entries are dropped. If the queue isn't full, new entries are not dropped. Depending on your goals, this can often have impacts that are non-ideal. For example, in networking, a naive queue might be considered "unfair" to bursty workloads that have low overall bandwidth utilization because workloads that have low bandwidth utilization "shouldn't" suffer more drops than workloads that are less bursty but use more bandwidth (this is also arguably not unfair, depending on what your goals are).</p> <p>A class of solutions to this problem are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_early_detection">random early drop</a> and its variants, which gives incoming items a probability of being dropped which can be determined by queue fullness (and possibly other factors), smoothing out the discontinuity and mitigating issues caused by having a discontinuous probability of queue drops.</p> <p><a href="https://danluu.com/randomize-hn/">This post on voting in link aggregators</a> is fundamentally the same idea although, in some sense, the polarity is reversed. There's a very sharp discontinuity in how much traffic something gets based on whether or not it's on the front page. You could view this as a link getting dropped from a queue if it only receives N-1 votes and not getting dropped if it receives N votes.</p> <h3 id="college-admissions-and-pell-grant-recipients-https-www-insidehighered-com-admissions-article-2019-01-28-study-pressure-enroll-more-pell-eligible-students-has-skewed-colleges"><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2019/01/28/study-pressure-enroll-more-pell-eligible-students-has-skewed-colleges">College admissions and Pell Grant recipients</a></h3> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant">Pell Grants</a> started getting used as a proxy for how serious schools are about helping/admitting low-income students. The first order impact is that students above the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly reduced probability of being admitted while students below the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly higher chance of being admitted. Phrased that way, it sounds like things are working as intended.</p> <p>However, when we look at what happens within each group, we see outcomes that are the opposite of what we'd want if the goal is to benefit students from low income families. Among people who don't qualify for a Pell Grant, it's those with the lowest income who are the most severely impacted and have the most severely reduced probability of admission. Among people who do qualify, it's those with the highest income who are mostly likely to benefit, again the opposite of what you'd probably want if your goal is to benefit students from low income families.</p> <p>We can see these in the graphs below, which are histograms of parental income among students at two universities in 2008 (first graph) and 2016 (second graph), where the red line indicates the Pell Grant threshold.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/pell-2008.jpg" alt="Histogram of income distribution of students at two universities in 2008; high incomes are highly overrepresented relative to the general population, but the distribution is smooth" height="816" width="1056"></p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/pell-2016.jpg" alt="Histogram of income distribution of students at two universities in 2016; high incomes are still highly overrepresented, there's also a sharp discontinuity at the Pell grant threshold; plot looks roughly two upwards sloping piecewise linear functions, with a drop back to nearly 0 at the discontinuity at the Pell grant threshold" height="816" width="1056"></p> <p>A second order effect of universities optimizing for Pell Grant recipients is that savvy parents can do the same thing that some people do to cut their taxable income at the last minute. Someone might put money into a traditional IRA instead of a Roth IRA and, if they're at their IRA contribution limit, they can try to lose money on options, effectively transferring money to options traders who are likely to be wealthier than them, in order to bring their income below the Pell Grant threshold, increasing the probability that their children will be admitted to a selective school.</p> <h3 id="election-statistics-https-arxiv-org-pdf-1410-6059-pdf"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6059.pdf">Election statistics</a></h3> <p>The following histograms of Russian elections across polling stations shows curious spikes in turnout and results at nice, round, numbers (e.g., 95%) starting around 2004.

This is from 2013; other years I've looked at (2010-2012) show a similar discontinuity.</p> <p>Math exit exam scores don't exhibit any unusual discontinuities in the years I've examined (2010-2013).</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/matura-polish-2013.png" height="772" width="1416"></p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1bqf9r/unusual_distributions_of_scores_on_final/c994zxt/">An anonymous reddit commenter explains this</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>When a teacher is grading matura (final HS exam), he/she doesn't know whose test it is. The only things that are known are: the number (code) of the student and the district which matura comes from (it is usually from completely different part of Poland). The system is made to prevent any kind of manipulation, for example from time to time teachers supervisor will come to check if test are graded correctly. I don't wanna talk much about system flaws (and advantages), it is well known in every education system in the world where final tests are made, but you have to keep in mind that there is a key, which teachers follow very strictly when grading.</p> <p>So, when a score of the test is below 30%, exam is failed. However, before making final statement in protocol, a commision of 3 (I don't remember exact number) is checking test again. This is the moment, where difference between humanities and math is shown: teachers often try to find a one (or a few) missing points, so the test won't be failed, because it's a tragedy to this person, his school and somewhat fuss for the grading team. Finding a "missing" point is not that hard when you are grading writing or open questions, which is a case in polish language, but nearly impossible in math. So that's the reason why distribution of scores is so different.</p> </blockquote> <p>As with p values, having a bright-line threshold, causes curious behavior. In this case, scoring below 30 on any subject (a 30 or above is required in every subject) and failing the exam has arbitrary negative effects for people, so teachers usually try to prevent people from failing if there's an easy way to do it, but a deeper root of the problem is the idea that it's necessary to produce a certification that's the discretization of a continuous score.</p> <h3 id="birth-month-and-sports">Birth month and sports</h3> <p>These are scatterplots of football (soccer) players in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Youth_League">UEFA Youth League</a>. The x-axis on both of these plots is how old players are modulo the year, i.e., their birth month normalized from 0 to 1.</p> <p>The graph on the left is a histogram, which shows that there is a very strong relationship between where a person's birth falls within the year and their odds of making a club at the UEFA Youth League (U19) level. The graph on the right purports to show that birth time is only weakly correlated with actual value provided on the field. The authors use playing time as a proxy for value, presumably because it's easy to measure. That's not a great measure, but the result they find (younger-within-the-year players have higher value, conditional on making the U19 league) is consistent with other studies on sports and discrimination, which ind (for example) that <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">black baseball players were significantly better than white baseball players for decades after desegregation in baseball, French-Canadian defensemen are also better than average (French-Canadians are stereotypically afraid to fight, don't work hard enough, and are too focused on offense)</a>.</p> <p>The discontinuity isn't directly shown in the graphs above because the graphs only show birth date for one year. If we were to plot birth date by cohort across multiple years, we'd expect to see a sawtooth pattern in the probability that a player makes it into the UEFA youth league with a 10x difference between someone born one day before vs. after the threshold.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/u19-age.png" height="1030" width="1758"></p> <p>This phenomenon, that birth day or month is a good predictor of participation in higher-level youth sports as well as pro sports, has been studied across a variety of sports.</p> <p>It's generally believed that this is caused by a discontinuity in youth sports:</p> <ol> <li>Kids are bucketed into groups by age in years and compete against people in the same year</li> <li>Within a given year, older kids are stronger, faster, etc., and perform better</li> <li>This causes older-within-year kids to outcompete younger kids, which later results in older-within-year kids having higher levels of participation for a variety of reasons</li> </ol> <p>This is arguably a "bug" in how youth sports works. But <a href="https://danluu.com/bad-decisions/">as we've seen in baseball</a> <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">as well as a survey of multiple sports</a>, obviously bad decision making that costs individual teams tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars can persist for decades in the face of people pubicly discussing how bad the decisions are. In this case, the youth sports teams aren't feeder teams to pro teams, so they don't have a financial incentive to select players who are skilled for their age (as opposed to just taller and faster because they're slightly older) so this system-wide non-optimal even more difficult to fix than pro sports teams making locally non-optimal decisions that are completely under their control.</p> <h3 id="procurement-auctions-http-www-keikawai-com-full-0804-pdf"><a href="http://www.keikawai.com/Full_0804.pdf">Procurement auctions</a></h3> <p>Kawai et al. looked at Japanese government procurement, in order to find suspicious pattern of bids like the ones described in <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4013">Porter et al. (1993)</a>, which looked at collusion in procurement auctions on Long Island (in New York in the United States). One example that's given is:</p> <blockquote> <p>In February 1983, the New York State Department of Transportation (DoT) held a pro- curement auction for resurfacing 0.8 miles of road. The lowest bid in the auction was $4 million, and the DoT decided not to award the contract because the bid was deemed too high relative to its own cost estimates. The project was put up for a reauction in May 1983 in which all the bidders from the initial auction participated. The lowest bid in the reauction was 20% higher than in the initial auction, submitted by the previous low bidder. Again, the contract was not awarded. The DoT held a third auction in February 1984, with the same set of bidders as in the initial auction. The lowest bid in the third auction was 10% higher than the second time, again submitted by the same bidder. The DoT apparently thought this was suspicious: “It is notable that the same firm submitted the low bid in each of the auctions. Because of the unusual bidding patterns, the contract was not awarded through 1987.”</p> </blockquote> <p>It could be argued that this is expected because different firms have different cost structures, so the lowest bidder in an auction for one particular project should be expected to be the lowest bidder in subsequent auctions for the same project. In order to distinguish between collusion and real structural cost differences between firms, Kawai et al. (2015) looked at auctions where the difference in bid between the first and second place firms was very small, making the winner effectively random.</p> <p>In the auction structure studied, bidders submit a secret bid. If the secret bid is above a secret minimum, then the lowest bidder wins the auction and gets the contract. If not, the lowest bid is revealed to all bidders and another round of bidding is done. Kawai et al. found that, in about 97% of auctions, the bidder who submitted the lowest bid in the first round also submitted the lowest bid in the second round (the probability that the second lowest bidder remains second lowest was 26%).</p> <p>Below, is a histogram of the difference in first and second round bids between the first-lowest and second-lowest bidders (left column) and the second-lowest and third-lowest bidders (right column). Each row has a different filtering criteria for how close the auction has to be in order to be included. In the top row, all auctions that reached the third round were included; in second, and third rows, the normalized delta between the first and second biders was less than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively; in the last row, the normalized delta between the first and the third bidder was less than 0.03. All numbers are normalized because the absolute size of auctions can vary.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/jp-procurement-bidding.png" height="1446" width="1682"></p> <p>We can see that the distributions of deltas between the first and second round are roughly symmetrical when comparing second and third lowest bidders. But when comparing first and second lowest bidders, there's a sharp discontinuity at zero, indicating that second-lowest bidder almost never lowers their bid by more than the first-lower bidder did. If you read the paper, you can see that the same structure persists into auctions that go into a third round.</p> <p>I don't mean to pick on Japanese procurement auctions in particular. There's an extensive literature on procurement auctions that's found collusion in many cases, often much more blatant than the case presented above (e.g., there are a few firms and they round-robin who wins across auctions, or there are a handful of firms and every firm except for the winner puts in the same losing bid).</p> <h3 id="restaurant-inspection-https-iquantny-tumblr-com-post-76928412519-think-nyc-restaurant-grading-is-flawed-heres-scores-http-datafra-me-blog-calling-out-nyc-restaurant-violations"><a href="https://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/76928412519/think-nyc-restaurant-grading-is-flawed-heres">Restaurant inspection</a> <a href="http://datafra.me/blog/Calling-out-NYC-restaurant-violations">scores</a></h3> <p>The histograms below show a sharp discontinuity between 13 and 14, which is the difference between an A grade and a B grade.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>








<p>Touchscreens have long been integral to our everyday life — humans use them to work, play, talk with loved ones and snag Lightning Deals on Prime Day. In recent years, they’ve shown potential for the animal kingdom as well, leading to a growing body of <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2023/04/21/parrots-talking-video-calls/">academic research</a> and a proliferation of consumer products promising to leverage technology to enhance our relationships with our pets.</p>



<p>Northeastern assistant professor <a href="https://www.interactanimallab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rébecca Kleinberger and her collaborators</a> have been at the forefront of that exploration, using computer interaction to enrich and understand the lives of dogs, orcas and parrots. Their latest research begs the next logical question: If animals are going to use touchscreens, how should we design for them?</p>



<div data-direction="90"><p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="674" alt="A hyacinth macaw (blue parrot) tapping at a tablet screen with its tongue." src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/03182024-parrotgame-4.gif" data-object-fit="cover"></p><div>
<p>Parrots are helping them find the answer — by playing tablet games.</p>
</div></div>



<p>In a new <a href="https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:h989sd115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study </a>released Wednesday, Kleinberger; Megan McMahon, an undergraduate studying behavioral neuroscience; and collaborators Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas at the University of Glasgow and Jennifer Cunha in Florida used a bare-bones, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balloon-pop-toddler-baby-game/id1498726683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balloon Pop</a>-style tablet game to collect data on a group of 20 pet birds’ tactile interactions with their touchscreens.</p>



<p>In doing so, they hoped to establish a framework to build tech intentionally designed for parrot use.</p>







<p>“Cognitive enrichment is a crucial component for parrot health and well-being, and tablet games are one method of providing this enrichment,” McMahon says. “Designing apps specifically made for birds and their unique touchscreen tendencies makes this form of enrichment more accessible.”</p>



<p>The parrot participants ranged from small species, like a green-cheeked parakeet, to a hyacinth macaw, the world’s largest. All had prior experience using touchscreens and completed the study in their homes. With the help of their caregivers, they learned to use a basic app game on Samsung Galaxy tablets. Adapted by McMahon, the game challenged the birds to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY5GiklaplM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tap multi-colored target circles</a> of different sizes on varying locations around their screens with their beaks and tongues.</p>



<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/03182024-parrotgame-3.gif" alt="A gray parrot taps at an iPad with its tongue, popping balloons on the screen."></figure>
</div>



<p>The birds engaged in short sessions (no longer than 30 minutes) each day, playing the game over the course of three months. Seventeen completed the study; three dropped out after showing slight signs of aggression or a lack of interest during the training period. The game collected information on the birds’ accuracy, tap locations and frequency, as well as tactile elements like touch pressure and drag rate.</p>



<p>The team’s data evaluated how well existing, human-based touchscreen design principles translated to parrots. Specifically, they honed in on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fitts’ Law</a>, a formula that predicts human pointing movement toward targets.</p>



<p>Some of the paper’s findings are intuitive enough: Parrots primarily use their tongues to work tablets, for example, which means their eyes are much closer to the screen than a human’s. As a result, they are quantifiably less accurate, and they fare better hitting larger targets. There was also a lot of variability in performance based on the birds’ size — smaller birds tended to have more trouble.</p>



<div data-direction="90">
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1164" height="654" src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/03182024-parrot_own_pace.gif?w=1100" alt="A white parrot flicking its tongue at a tablet screen to play a game."></figure>
</div>



<p>But the data-based assessment revealed much about the parrots themselves, as well. Kleinberger was surprised “just how fast some parrot species can control their tongue,” she says. “Some parrots could touch the tablet up to 41 times in a row, resulting in a touch every few milliseconds.”</p>



<p>That led to a real-time ergonomic adjustment: the team added a “multi-tap threshold” to the app’s interface during the study, making it less frustrating for the birds to use. “This …is a good example of how studying animals’ bodies can inform the design of new interfaces to empower animals,” Kleinberger says.</p>







<p>The findings, to be presented at the <a href="https://chi2024.acm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CHI conference</a> on Human Factors in Computing Systems in May, signal a next step for Kleinberger and her collaborators. Their past research has shown that parrots — with their prodigious intelligence, high sociability and singular physical capabilities — are uniquely poised to benefit from touchscreen technology.</p>



<p>Last year, the team showed a group of parrots how to video call one another, finding that the birds both overwhelmingly enjoyed the activity and could make the calls themselves, when given the option.</p>



<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="854" height="480" src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/multitouch40.gif" alt="A green parrot taps a red circle on a white screen that periodically changes location with its beak and tongue."></figure>
</div>



<p>The latest research further bolsters the case that touchscreens can enrich parrots’ lives. In surveys after the study was completed, human handlers said the experience was positive for their birds, and that participating in the study together was a great bonding experience. Kleinberger says that is by design. She stresses that the systems her lab is developing are meant for humans and animals to use together, and as an enhancement to their interactions rather than as a replacement.</p>



<p>As with humans and touchscreens, there are potential drawbacks — some familiar (“Participants in our study often emphasized the risk of their birds’ overuse, likening their screen time needs to those of children,” the paper reads); others uniquely avian (“When asked what risks tablet applications could pose to parrots, the most common answer was ‘potential damage to the tablet.’”)</p>



<p>In the longer term, the researchers hope the findings will serve as a starting point in adapting screen technologies for parrots and, eventually, other species. Kleinberger thinks it can bring some academic rigor to the booming “pet tech” market, “with new products promising to improve animal welfare with often very little data and research to back up the claims,” she says.</p>



<p>“My goal is for these insights not only to benefit the pet tech industry but also to offer valuable guidance to the wider research community, technology developers, [and] pet owners,” Kleinberger says.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Post" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer" name="Post"><p>We’re excited to announce the Rive Renderer is officially open source and available on all platforms. It isn’t hyperbolic to say what you can do with Rive is about to change in an earth-shattering way.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rive Renderer is custom-built for Rive content, for animation, and for runtime. Now you can draw an unprecedented amount of vector graphics with mega fast rendering. Want to fill the screen with vector graphics and super crisp text? Do it — the Rive Renderer ensures everything on the screen animates at 120 fps with pristine antialiasing quality.&nbsp;</p><p>The in-house Rive Renderer&nbsp; — two years in the making — draws our content without restriction. We have full control over the entire experience, from when a designer builds something in the Rive Editor, to when an end-user sees or interacts with it at runtime. By carefully and intentionally only generating content that will go fast at runtime, we have optimized the Rive Renderer to be groundbreakingly fast and highly performant. Now designers can worry less about how to build something that performs well at runtime and just… create!</p><h2>Why now?</h2><p>When we first built Rive, we used existing open source solutions to render our content, like Skia and the HTML Canvas API. The bring-your-own-renderer architecture, which we still support, is great because it lets users plug in renderers with low effort. However, not having a consistent and optimized renderer of our own has been a major roadblock for Rive’s product roadmap and innovation. We knew Rive couldn’t reach its full potential without one.&nbsp;</p><p>It also meant we couldn’t dependably implement highly requested rendering features across the <a href="https://rive.app/runtimes" rel="noopener">many platforms Rive supports</a>. Using multiple renderers meant that if a feature didn’t exist on one renderer, then we couldn’t ship it, because that feature wouldn’t have worked in all of the backends where Rive runs.&nbsp;</p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>A singular renderer empowers us to work on effects we’re itching to add, like blurs, drop shadows, glows, tapered strokes, and more. Whatever features we dream up, we can now build and add to Rive. Let us know your feature requests via <a href="mailto:hello@rive.app" rel="noopener">email</a>.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>To get technical, the Rive Renderer is a novel geometric reduction of antialiased vector paths into unique triangle patches. A massively parallel triangle rasterization pipeline already comes standard on desktop and mobile GPUs, and the renderer’s specific triangulation method allows us to harness that powerful 3D hardware for drawing Bézier curves.</p><p>Our code is architected so you will always be able to use whatever third-party renderer you want. But if you want Rive’s unique features and the best overall experience, we suggest using the Rive Renderer. </p><p>You can enable the Rive Renderer on iOS, Android, or the Web by <a href="https://help.rive.app/runtimes/renderer#specifying-a-renderer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following these directions</a>. Take it for a spin today on <a href="https://github.com/rive-app/rive-renderer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>. And check out our Unity and Unreal runtimes that have it integrated, with more integrations coming soon.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In much of the work that I do I try to <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/22/automate-to-save-mental-energy-not-time/">automate to save mental energy</a>.
Automation, to “techy” people, often means to apply some sort of repeatable
application of machinery or code in order both free us from manual labor and
potentially increase our effective throughput. I’m using a more general
interpretation of “automation” when I say “I try to automate to save mental
energy” – an interpretation more in line with what John D. Cook points towards
in his post quoted and linked to above.</p>
<p>Yes, writing scripts, applying tools and utilities to common everyday
programming problems are undeniably “automation”. However, automation in its
purest sense isn’t reserved for silicate or metallic machinery only. Biology
automates through instinct and practice.</p>
<p>What this means to me in practice is that I relatively often invest a
significant amount of time learning new things, practicing various skills, and
iterating on my workflows. Not necessarily to save on some imaginary “net sum of
time spent”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> – although Randall Munroe of <code>XKCD</code> has <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">shared</a> some <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">thoughts</a>
on the topic of – but to ensure I can maintain a certain level of focus in my
work when I’m “in the zone”.</p>
<h2 id="focus">Focus 🔍</h2>
<p>Why is focus so important? Well, <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2023-09-19-programming-is-hard.html">programming is hard</a> and I’m sure also most
non-programmers acknowledge the importance of focus when doing work requiring a
certain level of immersion.</p>
<p>This little gem from <a href="https://www.monkeyuser.com/">MonkeyUser.com</a> illustrates “focus” for a programmer
perfectly:</p>
<p><img src="https://myme.no/images/monkeyuser-focus.png" alt="&quot;https://www.monkeyuser.com/2018/focus/&quot;" title="Focus"></p>
<p>I’ve often used the analogy of building a house of cards when explaining to
non-programmers how we build mental models of the problems we are solving. Like
a house of cards these mental models take considerable time and effort to
construct, but topple over and collapse from even the smallest breath of air
(interruptions).</p>
<p>Our mental models dissolve faster than cotton candy in water when we’re
distracted at an inappropriate time.</p>
<p><img src="https://myme.no/images/raccoon.gif"></p>
<p>How about focus in <em>my</em> work? Sure!</p>


<p>The draft of this post is over a year old. I guess I got distracted!</p>
<p>In fact, I was writing this very post when I realized the prelude was worthy of
a post of its own. That became <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2023-09-19-programming-is-hard.html">Programming is hard</a>. It gained quite a few views,
then I guess I forgot all about this one.</p>
<h2 id="distractions">Distractions ⚡</h2>
<p>Distractions; the arch enemy of every coder. Distractions break our focus by
ripping us out of our flow states. It doesn’t help that programming environments
are littered with potential distractions. They come in many shapes and forms, to
name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>⚡ Physical interruptions from our surroundings (meetings, colleagues, notifications).</li>
<li>🧠 Internal interruptions through impulsive thoughts (spontaneous ideas, procrastination).</li>
<li>🤷 Missing preconditions to perform a task (unclear objectives, yak shaving, tech debt).</li>
<li>➰ Long feedback loops (handovers, difficulty testing, ++).</li>
<li>🥪 An empty stomach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some distractions are obvious, others are more subtle.</p>
<p>When we talk about distractions it’s often the “big and obvious” ones that
people think of. Those are the distractions where you’re interrupted by someone
or something in your surroundings. It may be somebody “just popping over to ask
a question” or some meeting looming on the horizon about to evacuate you from
your warm and cozy “flow zone”.</p>
<p>In recent years I’ve also grown more conscious of less obvious forms of
distractions. Things like small papercuts and annoyances which I previously
might have accepted simply as a natural part of “work”. By not acknowledging
these minor nuisances as distractions I’ve never stopped to consider how they
may negatively affect my productivity or cognitive ability. However, tiny
inconveniences can add up to make solving issues more difficult than it needs
to be.</p>
<p>Much can be done to reduce the distractions within an organization, but
introducing transformational change can be hard for an individual alone.
Organizational chaos might even be outside of our control. What we <em>can</em> control
to some extent is how we interface with the environment around us.</p>
<p>I find many negative effects of distractions – large and small – can be greatly
reduced through personal organization and mastery of your tools.</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization 📓</h2>
<p>I’m personally a big fan of <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettlekasten</a> methods
(using <code>emacs</code> with <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> and <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a>), and various other “productivity
life-hacks”.</p>
<p>I strongly believe everyone should invest a bit of time and effort into learning
a few organizational tools. I don’t have strong opinions on which, but I believe
it’s crucial to learn them well enough and integrate them into your daily
workflow so that they stay out of your way. It doesn’t even have to be anything
digital. A paper notepad is honestly perfectly acceptable too. However, I
believe tighter integration into e.g. code editors increases the possibility for
distraction free note-taking and organization.</p>
<p>I feel an organizational tool hits the sweetspot when you hardly notice yourself
using it.</p>
<p>In my case I’ve achieved such ergonomics using <code>emacs</code> as both my primary code
editor <em>and</em> note-taking application. <code>Org mode</code> lets me capture all kinds of
fleeting notes and <code>Org-roam</code> complements it by allowing me to quickly refile
things into a personal knowledge graph. <code>TODO</code> lists and priorities fit nicely
into the same workflow, as does time-tracking.</p>
<p>I must admit I have a lot of issues with <code>emacs</code>, but the way some of these
“killer app” plugins integrate into a comprehensive productivity tool I have yet
to find anything matching what I’m after.</p>
<p>There is A LOT of literature on personal organization, so I don’t want to spend
too much time on this topic in this post. Let’s move on to another critical tool
in the battle against distractions: mastery.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-mastery">The value of mastery 🧙</h2>
<p>I briefly touched on “practice makes perfect” in <a href="https://myme.no/posts/2024-01-21-produce-dont-consume.html#practice-makes-perfect">produce, don’t consume</a> and how
practice can be incorporated into constructive efforts. Writing this post I’ve
also come to realize that another trait of practice and mastery is how
automating our skill through practice helps us cancel out distractions in order
to maintain focus.</p>
<p>Mastering our tools is important as it allows our brains to focus on the task at
hand. If we are forced to spend a significant amount of our brain power learning
programming language syntax, editor bindings or APIs then we have less mental
energy to spend on solving <em>actual</em> problems. Battling complexity on multiple
fronts increases cognitive load and often a loss of focus.</p>
<p>A dancer who doesn’t know the basic moves of a dance style will have great
trouble connecting motions in the choreography while maintaining rhythm and
composure. Similarly, a programmer who constantly stumble on basic syntax or
interpreting compiler errors will have a harder time constructing a mental model
of the problem she’s solving.</p>
<p>But we do not necessary have to become specialists to become effective. In fact,
becoming and staying a proper expert in more than a handful of fields is a fools
errand in modern software development. Ecosystems evolve too quickly, new tools
and practices come and go. Not to mention the looming paradigm shift of
artificial intelligence and how it might render significant aspects of
conventional programming obsolete<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What I find useful is to learn enough about a wide variety of topics to build a
basic intuition for when specific technologies or methodologies will help solve
the problems we’re faced with. You’ll then eventually start picking out what
matters to you and your expertise will grow somewhat organically<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Also try
to surround yourself with smart people complementing your own abilities.</p>
<p>Practice and repetition is crucial to become a master in just about anything. A
musician spends time with her instrument to improve, programmers spend time with
their “tech stacks”, editors and tools. It’s a matter of starting somewhere.
Experts weren’t born experts. And even though talent or determination allow some
to progress faster than others nobody who achieve mastery within any discipline
will admit to not having worked hard – or for a long time – to acquire the skill
they possess.</p>
<p>Just as a musician is likely to butcher an unfamiliar instrument, a programmer
dropped into a new development environment will most definitely experience some
initial regression in their productivity. This is normal, but it is also the way
we learn. The difficulty is knowing (or choosing) what to learn, and when. In
the middle of a high-stakes project is probably not the right time to pick up a
new language or framework<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Whether you consider yourself a specialist or a generalist I believe software
development is quite unique in the way many skills are transferable across
environments. Some skills invested transcend their technologies almost entirely
due to their pervasiveness or general applicability.</p>
<h3 id="typing-speed">Typing speed</h3>
<p>Muscle memory and habits are both important abilities of the body and mind to
increase our efficiency and reduce our cognitive load. Making things more
automatic allows us to complete repeatable tasks faster or do so without
sacrificing our ability to reason about the problems we’re currently solving.</p>
<p>Most seasoned programmers know that we spend significantly more time reading and
navigation through code than actually changing existing code or writing new
code. For this reason it’s easy to assume that learning effective typing is
secondary to learning how to structure programs really well. I don’t disagree,
yet I have the impression that many of the really amazing programmers I know are
also great typists.</p>
<p>I believe there might be a very simple reason for this correlation – besides the
obvious take that great programmers spend a lot of time in front of their
computer, thus become great typists. No, I believe by being able to generate
many programs fast you are also able to attempt many possible solutions faster.
Difficult problems require thinking, I know. But few things beat the speed of
finding code problems as actually passing code through a compiler or an
interpreter and executing it.</p>
<p>I would say it’s worth putting effort into improving your typing. Not with the
end-goal “writing as fast as possible” in mind of, but rather to <em>interface</em> as
efficiently as possible with the computer. Why then not also try to improve
<em>how</em> you type? Let’s take <code>vi/vim</code> and modal editing as an example.</p>
<h3 id="vim-bindings">Vim bindings</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://neovim.io/">(neo)</a><a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> there are keybindings bound to operations which operate on various
textual structures.</p>
<p>Bindings may operate on “bodies” of text like letters, words, sentences or
paragraphs. Or they operate on pairs of quotes, parentheses and brackets. They
can work on locations like the beginning and end of a buffer. Or even metadata
not represented in the buffer itself, like the location of compilation errors
from an external tool or spelling errors from a spell checker.</p>
<p>Once <code>vim</code> motions are internalized it’s amazing how efficient it feels to
“delete all word” (<code>daw</code>) or “change in paragraph” (<code>cip</code>) without breaking a
sweat. The great strength and power of <code>vim</code> motion bindings come from how a few
handfuls of general-purpose operations translate across different types of
textual motions, from prose to any style of programming and markup languages.</p>
<p>Editors like <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune">Kakoune</a> and <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">Helix</a> attempt to improve further on this concept. I
have little experience using them, but I struggle to see how investing
significant time into them at this point is worth the effort. After all, one of
the main benefits of <code>vim</code> and <code>vim</code> motions is how pervasive they are.</p>
<p>There are many ways people can argue that learning <code>vim</code>-style modal editing
helps their productivity. It can, however, be somewhat tricky to determine what
exactly people benefit from it. Personally I’m certain the time I invested into
learning motion bindings and compound operations many years ago has reaped
dividends way past the initial investment.</p>
<h3 id="optimize-the-common-paths">Optimize the common paths</h3>
<p>But how? By letting me type faster? What has typing and <code>vim</code> motions to do with
avoiding distractions?</p>
<p>Everything!</p>
<p>The keyboard is still my main interface to the computer. As long as it continues
to be it matters to me to wield it well.</p>
<p>Similarly to <code>vim</code> motions most mainstream <code>$SHELL</code> prompts default to
<code>emacs</code>-style <code>readline</code> bindings<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. To me that was motivation enough to put
some effort into internalize the most common <code>readline</code> keyboard bindings on the
CLI (for <code>emacs</code> users this is trivial).</p>
<p>Raise your hand if you know how to undo edit operations in <code>readline</code> ✋ (yes,
<code>C-/</code> and <code>C-u C-/</code> works in your prompt!)</p>
<p>Programming is littered with micro-distractions, remember? Not only do you
increase your efficiency at typing out actual programs by learning effective
text navigation and manipulation (as well as text generation through snippets
and generative A.I.). You also do so while sparing your brain from having to
think about these trivial “problems” and road-blocks.</p>
<p>This is just as true <em>in</em> your editor as outside of it.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to find myself thinking about my <em>next</em> steps while doing some
other thing like text navigation or manipulation using either <code>vim</code> or
<code>readline</code> keybindings. By now they’re so ingrained in muscle memory that I more
often that not think about <em>what</em> I need to do, not <em>how</em>. It just happens.</p>
<p>And let me say that the point of this section is not to boast or rave about
<code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code> bindings. The point is that by learning your tools really well
they eventually get out of your way and you’re free to tackle the actual
problems you’re faced with. It’s even better if these skills are applicable in a
wide variety of applications and environments – try to stick to defaults.</p>
<h2 id="braaains">Braaains 🧠</h2>
<p>I don’t mind learning, but I want to choose – within my power – when, how and
how much to learn. After all, learning is all about rewiring our brains. It’s
mental exercise, and like physical exercise learning can be very exhausting. The
same goes for problem solving – it’s our brains applying our existing knowledge
in order to achieve something new.</p>
<p>Knowing when to invest time into learning, automation or optimization is not
trivial. Done prematurely there’s the risk of sinking costs into efforts that
won’t pay off, yet stubbornly sticking to old ways could be impeding future
efficiency. A big part of maturing as a software developer is knowing (or more
likely, <em>sensing</em>) when the time is right for you.</p>
<p>The biggest bottleneck of software development is still the (human) brain. It’s
a precious resource, but it can only do so much and distractions greatly reduce
its capacity.</p>
<p>Through practice and mastery, by building and honing physical and internal
tools, we can offload our brains to focus much more of its effort on the
problems we’re solving. By allocating more brainpower into solving problems
we’re also more likely to succeed in solving some of the hard ones, and to more
gracefully recover from distractions when they occur.</p>
<p>Now, what was I doing again…?</p>

        <p><img src="https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/images/determinator_robot.webp" alt="Determinator robot"></p>
<p data-sid="318">If you’ve read our <a href="https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/">launch post</a>, you might remember this section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-sid="319">We thought about this and decided to just go all out and write a hypervisor which emulates a deterministic computer. Consequently, we can force anything inside it to be deterministic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-sid="320">Let’s expand on that a bit.</p>
<p data-sid="321">When Antithesis discovers a potential bug, we want to be able to reproduce it easily, explore it thoroughly, and provide our users with the information they most need to fix it. The deterministic hypervisor is the back-end component that gives us these capabilities.</p>
<p data-sid="322">But what is a <em>deterministic hypervisor</em> exactly? What’s special about it? How does it work? What are we doing with it, and, consequently, what can we do for you?</p>
<p data-sid="323">This is a high-level overview of a portion of the Antithesis platform. Nothing in this post is required to make use of Antithesis, but I’m hoping it demystifies our product a little bit.</p>
<h2 data-sid="324">Defining determinism</h2>
<p data-sid="325">Wikipedia’s definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm">deterministic algorithm</a> is pretty solid for our purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-sid="326">In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-sid="327">That last clause is important: it’s not just the result that is the same, but any underlying state as well — even hidden behavior that only manifests as obscure side-effects. When we have this sort of determinism, we can chain together several deterministic operations, or even trillions of them, and still have a consistent and knowable result.</p>
<p data-sid="328">In the world of software testing, determinism helps us attain reproducibility. Many software products have truly nasty bugs that linger for years primarily because they don’t show up consistently; this adds a ton of friction for engineers at every stage. These bugs tend to languish as open tickets because engineers cannot even begin to fix the code until they first scout out the bug and identify when and why it happens. What are the costs of never knowing if a bug really exists, and never knowing if you’ve truly fixed it? You’re always second-guessing yourself, always rerunning experiments over and over, always dealing in <b>“maybes”</b> instead of a clear <b>“yes”</b> or <b>“no.”</b></p>
<p data-sid="329">For the <a href="https://antithesis.com/docs/introduction/how_antithesis_works.html">Antithesis platform</a>, deterministic reproducibility allows us to generate useful artifacts of the bugs we’ve found, and it’s also a key enabler of <strong>time-travel debugging</strong>, and of the <strong>state-space exploration</strong> we use to find bugs in the first place.</p>
<p data-sid="330">My favorite benefit of reproducibility is that it allows <em>destructive analysis</em> of a buggy system state: I can freely extract before-and-after crash dumps, modify program data to see how it changes the behavior, and generally perturb the system as much as I want without fear. I know I’ll always be able to try something different if my first attempt doesn’t bear fruit. Whereas with flaky, hard-to-reproduce bugs in the wild, there’s always this moment of terror when you’re attempting any kind of destructive analysis – because you know it’ll be a huge setback if you don’t learn something valuable on your first try.</p>
<h2 data-sid="331">Determinism in Antithesis</h2>
<p data-sid="332">Most of software engineering practice focuses on reproducibility in small tests, such as unit tests. Most likely because this feels more achievable than forcing any kind of determinism on big systems with millions of interconnected moving parts. But at Antithesis, most of our tools are aimed at big picture end-to-end testing. We want to subject a full-featured deployment of your software to “thousands and thousands of crazy situations you’d never dreamed of,” in a simulated environment that captures a lot of the complexity and unpredictability of the real world without burying you in useless noise.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/images/image2.png">
</p>
<div data-sid="333"><p>
        A key piece of the Antithesis platform is the deterministic hypervisor that actually runs the test workload.<sup>1</sup> We call this thing “<b>the Determinator</b>.”
    </p><p>
        The <a href="https://antithesis.com/docs/using_antithesis/environment.html">Antithesis environment</a> simulates one or more computers using a collection of containers, all running within a single virtual machine managed by our hypervisor. The unit of reproducibility is the state of the entire system/experiment/workload as an interconnected whole, not any single process or server within the system. This approach reduces the need for complicated, domain-specific mocks and test harnesses, since you can just run (for example) both your client and server software together in the same bubble of determinism and perfectly reproduce their synchronized state.
    </p></div>
<p>
    <img src="https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/images/architecture.png">
</p>
<p data-sid="335">Our deterministic hypervisor’s job is to provide a big box for the whole end-to-end experimental setup to sit in. All of the customer’s software runs inside the box, mediated by simulation and fault-injection harnesses provided by Antithesis. Outside the box are a collection of tools that manage the exploration of the system under test. Everything in the hypervisor’s guest environment sees a single linear history. Outside of it, Antithesis can see every execution path ever visited – a tree of possible paths the experiment could take. With this knowledge, we can choose new experimental inputs or revisit previously seen ones for further analysis. The Determinator’s job is to enforce determinism on everything within the box and at the boundary.</p>
<h2 data-sid="336">Building the hypervisor</h2>
<p data-sid="337">I was the first person to work on the Determinator, alongside our CTO, <a href="http://antithesis.com/company/leadership/">Dave Scherer</a>.</p>
<p data-sid="338">We started with a piece of existing, mature open-source software – the FreeBSD project’s <a href="https://bhyve.org/">bhyve hypervisor</a>. Bhyve is, of course, not a deterministic hypervisor – it’s a general-purpose hypervisor designed to run a variety of operating systems on real hardware, aiming for both low overhead and broad access to hardware features like the GPU. To build our deterministic fork of bhyve, we started by <em>removing</em> a lot of standard hypervisor functionality.</p>
<div>
    <p data-sid="339">
        Why’s that? Well, the computers on your desk, in your pocket, and in the cloud weren’t really designed for end-to-end determinism. The real world is full of entropy, and standard computing hardware doesn’t hide all of it from you.<sup>2</sup> So we tried to limit what exactly our hypervisor had to do, to start with a small foundation of deterministic behavior and then build outward incrementally.
    </p>
    
</div>
<p><img src="https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/images/image1.png"></p>
<p data-sid="341">A lot of the day-to-day work of building the Determinator involved categorizing the micro-level CPU behavior we encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li data-sid="342"><strong>Deterministic behavior:</strong> Anything with consistent results and manageable side-effects. We want to keep the handling of deterministic behavior maximally within the hypervisor guest, because context-switching reduces performance; sometimes we’ll still have to exit to use some resource provided by the host OS or a software-emulated device, of course.</li>
<li data-sid="343"><strong>Nondeterministic behavior:</strong> Any machine behavior with inconsistent results or visibly inconsistent side-effects, including any kind of subtle butterfly effect that later permutes machine state. Another way to think of this is “determinism-destroying” behavior, so we must perfectly avoid it, contain it, or reverse it when it happens.</li>
</ul>
<p data-sid="344">Modern CPUs are fiendishly complex; they have many elaborate optimizations and nearly half the history of computing baked into various modal settings and feature flags. Assumptions are dangerous here. The only way to know whether any CPU behavior is deterministic is to subject your whole system to very thorough tests.</p>
<h3 data-sid="345">A deterministic view of time</h3>
<p data-sid="346">The biggest core constraint was clear long before we started writing anything, but it’s also the most difficult to work around. It’s the thing that haunts pretty much anyone who’s ever attempted to write a deterministic execution environment: <strong>time</strong>.</p>
<div>
    <p data-sid="347">
        Even simple-seeming CPU operations with a well-defined result aren’t really deterministic when you include the question, “How much time did this take?” Modern CPUs incorporate a collection of pipelines and caches, which are all optimized for throughput and speed at the expense of a little bit of predictability. Zoom out to entire programs in the real world and their timing characteristics are greatly affected by multi-core concurrency, interrupts, the operating system’s process and i/o scheduler,<sup>3</sup> and other extrinsic variables like network latency. Time nondeterminism can easily translate into data nondeterminism through a variety of means like racing transactions, interleaved event delivery, or simply reading the system clock.
    </p>
    
</div>
<div data-sid="349"><p>In order to solve this problem, we looked for ways to impose <strong>time determinism</strong>: a requirement that the guest’s simulated clock values should be a function of only the deterministic state and execution history of the guest system. This starts with hiding all real-world timing information from software running inside the Antithesis testing environment. Every attempt to access a time source from inside the guest – reading TSC, reading HPET, etc. – returns a virtual time value computed by the hypervisor. The hard part is translating “deterministic state and execution history” into a real, measurable quantity. Like everyone else who’s attempted to write a deterministic hypervisor, we quickly ran into the limitations of the tools available for measurement. Here’s an example:</p><p>
<img src="https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/images/image3.png"></p></div>
<p data-sid="350">It feels really natural to peg simulated cycle time to instruction processing, since that transparently guarantees that time progresses in proportion to the work done by the CPU. The current version of the Determinator is designed to run on modern Intel server CPUs, using Intel’s VMX (Virtual Machine Extension) features for hardware-supported virtualization. These chips also provide the Performance Monitoring Counters, which can be programmed to collect stats about the behavior of the CPU. Like many researchers and hobbyists before us, we were drawn to the possibility of using instructions-retired count to drive the simulated clock. However, we had to invent workarounds for two very notable limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li data-sid="351">The PMC instructions retired count isn’t quite deterministic, even in its special “precision” mode. Based on our testing, about one in a trillion instructions would be miscounted due to some unknown quirk of the CPU (we speculate it’s something to do with pipelining, branch prediction, or external interrupt handling).</li>
<li data-sid="352">PMC supports a threshold notification system, where you set up the counter as a “countdown” and get an interrupt when the value reaches zero. However, since this interrupt is delivered through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Programmable_Interrupt_Controller">APIC</a>, dozens of instructions will be processed before the CPU is actually notified of the threshold event. Moreover, this interrupt delivery overhead is quite varied when measured in CPU cycles, meaning that you really don’t know how long ago an interrupt was triggered from the time you receive it.</li>
</ol>
<p data-sid="353">Solving problems like this involved a lot of iteration and experimentation. We were pushing various features of the CPU just a bit past what they were really designed for, which meant carefully probing their real, undocumented functionality every step of the way. Some of the most important code written during the early development of the Determinator was an alternative kernel logging subsystem. Our starting point for determinism testing was rabidly hyperactive logging, which taught us that FreeBSD’s standard kernel log could drop messages when slammed with massive amounts of data. So we had to write our own module-specific logger that both maintained large buffers of data and could pause the VM to flush that data proactively before it ran out of room. Only once we were reliably capturing and analyzing like 50 GiB of output per 20-minute run could we actually pin down, disentangle, and incrementally solve some subtle non-determinisms.</p>
<h3 data-sid="354">CPU parallelism</h3>
<p data-sid="355">Parallelism, ultimately, is also a time problem. When multiple cores are acting concurrently, those operations can be interleaved in more-or-less arbitrary ways. Getting the final result to be sane and useful is the product of billions of dollars of engineering effort and many thousands of Computer Science PhD theses. We were interested in more than just the final result, however: in order to maintain a consistent machine state, we really wanted step-by-step instruction-level determinism, which is a much more onerous burden than just making sure certain kinds of writes and reads are well-ordered and atomic.</p>
<div>
    <p data-sid="356">
        Our plan here was to simply isolate the cores. <b>Each instance of the deterministic hypervisor runs on just one physical CPU core.</b> When a real processor has 48 or 96 cores, we spin up that many separate VMs, each pinned to a different physical core, exploring different parts of the possible program state in parallel. The combined throughput of the system – its ability to explore the state space and perform many simultaneous experiments – is quite high, which matters more to us than the wall-clock speed of any single VM in isolation.<sup>4</sup>
    </p>
    
</div>
<p data-sid="358">Guest software running in the Antithesis platform still experiences concurrency similar to a multi-core / multi-machine system, thanks to the process scheduling imposed by the guest OS. Since the Antithesis platform controls the guest’s scheduler, we can also use it as a fault injection mechanism (for example, via thread starvation). Our ability to artificially induce fault conditions that would normally be rare allows Antithesis to efficiently hunt for race conditions or other hard-to-pin-down concurrency bugs.</p>
<h3 data-sid="359">Deterministic I/O</h3>
<p>
    <img src="https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/images/image4.png">
</p>
<p data-sid="360">The other mandatory piece of the Determinator design was <strong>a deterministic input/output channel</strong>. Connecting a deterministic system to a nondeterministic communication pathway just renders the whole thing nondeterministic. That’s why Antithesis simulates an entire environment within one deterministic VM, with an abstract (and fault-injected) simulation of network communication, data storage, &amp;c. However, if the experimental world inside the Determinator’s “magic box” is purely deterministic, we needed some controlled way to inject variance from the outside world in order to guide it towards different possible system states. We also wanted a simple and performant way to exfiltrate data from the guest environment as well.</p>
<p data-sid="361">We implemented deterministic input/output using the Intel x86 architecture’s <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/vmcall">VMCALL instruction</a> (known as VMMCALL on AMD). This is basically a roll-your-own-instruction facility for hypervisor writers – an instruction that does nothing but context-switch from guest to host. Expanding its functionality beyond that is mostly a matter of making sure that both guest and host are using the same API. Our custom instruction allows software running inside the guest to emit interesting data (such as log messages) to the rest of the Antithesis platform and ingest commands or RNG seeds that are used to control guest behavior.</p>
<div>
    <p data-sid="362">
      The points in execution history where the guest ingests input from the Antithesis platform become possible branch points for future execution. Consequently, the external view of the exploration of a system is an input tree. Later on, we also added interrupt injection to “push” actions into the guest when we wanted to preempt its current activity instead of waiting for the next predetermined i/o exchange point.<sup>5</sup>
    </p>
    
</div>
<h2 data-sid="364">One of many building blocks</h2>
<p data-sid="365">That’s <em>almost</em> it for the basics. I’m necessarily leaving out a ton of detail, of course, both for the sake of brevity and competitive edge. I’ve also left out one key design pillar of Antithesis’s deterministic hypervisor: all the functionality that allows efficient state exploration and time-travel debugging. (We are not replaying every single execution path from the beginning – we would not waste your time like that!) It just felt like too much to absorb in one post, so we’ll have to return to it some other time.</p>
<p data-sid="366">Our particular implementation of a deterministic hypervisor is idiosyncratic in places, since it’s designed around the needs of the entire Antithesis platform: throughput over latency, abstractly simulated devices representing entire systems in one VM, deterministic replay both in the moment and from cold storage, time-travel debugging with support for artifact extraction and probability analysis, and more.</p>
<p data-sid="367">The Antithesis testing platform consists of a lot of innovative pieces working together, and we’re really proud of what we’ve built. This discussion of one individual piece doesn’t capture how they all fit together (<a href="https://antithesis.com/docs/introduction/how_antithesis_works.html">see our system documentation</a> for more information on that), but we hope it’s been fun and illuminating in its own right.</p>
<p data-sid="368">We have a lot of irons in the fire right now – the Determinator is only a starting point in our scheme to transform software testing and simulation. We’ll tell you a lot more over the coming months and years. But… maybe you want to get in on building this borderline-impossible stuff right now.

As a high school student in the late 1960s, Hans was imprisoned for 15 months in his native East Germany for protesting the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. After his release, he escaped to West Germany and studied computers and linguistics in Berlin. He made his way to the US and was working in an artificial intelligence lab at SRI, a research institute in Menlo Park, California, when Jakob was born. The family eventually returned to Germany, where Jakob went to university. He didn’t intend to focus on language, but as he was embarking on graduate studies, he took an internship at Google in its Mountain View office, where he landed in the company’s translation group. He was in the family business. He abandoned his PhD plans and, in 2012, decided to join a team at Google that was working on a system that could respond to users’ questions on the search page itself without diverting them to other websites. Apple had just announced Siri, a virtual assistant that promised to deliver one-shot answers in casual conversation, and the Google brass smelled a huge competitive threat: Siri could eat up their search traffic. They started paying a lot more attention to Uszkoreit’s new group.</p><p>“It was a false panic,” Uszkoreit says. Siri never really threatened Google. But he welcomed the chance to dive into systems where computers could engage in a kind of dialog with us. At the time, recurrent neural networks—once an academic backwater—had suddenly started outperforming other methods of AI engineering. The networks consist of many layers, and information is passed and repassed through those layers to identify the best responses. Neural nets were racking up huge wins in fields such as image recognition, and an AI renaissance was suddenly underway. Google was frantically <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/how-google-is-remaking-itself-as-a-machine-learning-first-company/">rearranging its workforce</a> to adopt the techniques. The company wanted systems that could churn out humanlike responses—to auto-complete sentences in emails or create relatively simple customer service chatbots.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But the field was running into limitations. Recurrent neural networks struggled to parse longer chunks of text. Take a passage like <em>Joe is a baseball player, and after a good breakfast he went to the park and got two hits.</em> To make sense of “two hits,” a language model has to remember the part about baseball. In human terms, it has to be paying attention. The accepted fix was something called “long short-term memory” (LSTM), an innovation that allowed language models to process bigger and more complex sequences of text. But the computer still handled those sequences strictly sequentially—word by tedious word—and missed out on context clues that might appear later in a passage. “The methods we were applying were basically Band-Aids,” Uszkoreit says. “We could not get the right stuff to really work at scale.”</p><p>Around 2014, he began to concoct a different approach that he referred to as self-attention. This kind of network can translate a word by referencing <em>any</em> other part of a passage. Those other parts can clarify a word’s intent and help the system produce a good translation. “It actually considers everything and gives you an efficient way of looking at many inputs at the same time and then taking something out in a pretty selective way,” he says. Though AI scientists are careful not to confuse the metaphor of neural networks with the way the biological brain actually works, Uszkoreit does seem to believe that self-attention is somewhat similar to the way humans process language.</p><p>Uszkoreit thought a self-attention model could potentially be faster and more effective than recurrent neural nets. The way it handles information was also perfectly suited to the powerful parallel processing chips that were being produced en masse to support the machine learning boom. Instead of using a linear approach (look at every word in sequence), it takes a more parallel one (look at a bunch of them together). If done properly, Uszkoreit suspected, you could use self-attention <em>exclusively</em> to get better results.</p><p>Not everyone thought this idea was going to rock the world, including Uszkoreit’s father, who had scooped up two Google Faculty research awards while his son was working for the company. “People raised their eyebrows, because it dumped out all the existing neural architectures,” Jakob Uszkoreit says. Say goodbye to recurrent neural nets? Heresy! “From dinner-table conversations I had with my dad, we weren’t necessarily seeing eye to eye.”</p><p>Uszkoreit persuaded a few colleagues to conduct experiments on self-attention. Their work showed promise, and in 2016 they published a paper about it. Uszkoreit wanted to push their research further—the team’s experiments used only tiny bits of text—but none of his collaborators were interested. Instead, like gamblers who leave the casino with modest winnings, they went off to apply the lessons they had learned. “The thing <em>worked</em>,” he says. “The folks on that paper got excited about reaping the rewards and deploying it in a variety of different places at Google, including search and, eventually, ads. It was an amazing success in many ways, but I didn’t want to leave it there.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Uszkoreit felt that self-attention could take on much bigger tasks. <em>There’s another way to do this</em>, he’d argue to anyone who would listen, and some who wouldn’t, outlining his vision on whiteboards in Building 1945, named after its address on Charleston Road on the northern edge of the Google campus.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><strong>/ NAME: ILLIA POLOSUKHIN / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER OF NEAR</strong></span></p></figure></div><p>One day in 2016, Uszkoreit was having lunch in a Google café with a scientist named Illia Polosukhin. Born in Ukraine, Polosukhin had been at Google for nearly three years. He was assigned to the team providing answers to direct questions posed in the search field. It wasn’t going all that well. “To answer something on Google.com, you need something that’s very cheap and high-performing,” Polosukhin says. “Because you have milliseconds” to respond. When Polosukhin aired his complaints, Uszkoreit had no problem coming up with a remedy. “He suggested, why not use self-attention?” says Polosukhin.</p><p>Polosukhin sometimes collaborated with a colleague named Ashish Vaswani. Born in India and raised mostly in the Middle East, he had gone to the University of Southern California to earn his doctorate in the school’s elite machine translation group. Afterward, he moved to Mountain View to join Google—specifically a newish organization called <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/">Google Brain</a>. He describes Brain as “a radical group” that believed “neural networks were going to advance human understanding.” But he was still looking for a big project to work on. His team worked in Building 1965 next door to Polosukhin’s language team in 1945, and he heard about the self-attention idea. Could that be the project? He agreed to work on it.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><strong>/ NAME: ASHISH VASWANI / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER AND CEO OF ESSENTIAL AI</strong></span></p></figure></div><p>Together, the three researchers drew up a design document called “Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks.” They picked the name “transformers” from “day zero,” Uszkoreit says. The idea was that this mechanism would <em>transform</em> the information it took in, allowing the system to extract as much understanding as a human might—or at least give the illusion of that. Plus Uszkoreit had fond childhood memories of playing with the Hasbro action figures. “I had two little Transformer toys as a very young kid,” he says. The document ended with a cartoony image of six Transformers in mountainous terrain, zapping lasers at one another.</p><p>There was also some swagger in the sentence that began the paper: “We are awesome.”</p><p>In early 2017, Polosukhin left Google to start his own company. By then new collaborators were coming onboard. An Indian engineer named Niki Parmar had been working for an American software company in India when she moved to the US. She earned a master’s degree from USC in 2015 and was recruited by all the Big Tech companies. She chose Google. When she started, she joined up with Uszkoreit and worked on model variants to improve Google search.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><strong>/ NAME: NIKI PARMAR / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER OF ESSENTIAL AI</strong></span></p></figure></div><p>Another new member was Llion Jones. Born and raised in Wales, he loved computers “because it was not normal.” At the University of Birmingham he took an AI course and got curious about neural networks, which were presented as a historical curiosity. He got his master’s in July 2009 and, unable to find a job during the recession, lived on the dole for months. He found a job at a local company and then applied to Google as a “hail Mary.” He got the gig and eventually landed in Google Research, where his manager was Polosukhin. One day, Jones heard about the concept of self-attention from a fellow worker named Mat Kelcey, and he later joined up with Team Transformers. (Later, Jones ran into Kelcey and briefed him on the transformer project. Kelcey wasn’t buying it. “I told him, ‘I’m not sure that’s going to work,’ which is basically the biggest incorrect prediction of my life,” Kelcey says now.)</p><p>The transformer work drew in other Google Brain researchers who were also trying to improve <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-chatgpt-works-large-language-model/">large language models</a>. This third wave included Łukasz Kaiser, a Polish-born theoretical computer scientist, and his intern, Aidan Gomez. Gomez had grown up in a small farming village in Ontario, Canada, where his family would tap maple trees every spring for syrup. As a junior at the University of Toronto, he “fell in love” with AI and joined the machine learning group—Geoffrey Hinton’s lab. He began contacting people at Google who had written interesting papers, with ideas for extending their work. Kaiser took the bait and invited him to intern. It wasn’t until months later that Gomez learned those internships were meant for doctoral students, not undergrads like him.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Kaiser and Gomez quickly understood that self-attention looked like a promising, and more radical, solution to the problem they were addressing. “We had a deliberate conversation about whether we wanted to merge the two projects,” says Gomez. The answer was yes.</p><p>The transformer crew set about building a self-attention model to translate text from one language to another. They measured its performance using a benchmark called BLEU, which compares a machine’s output to the work of a human translator. From the start, their new model did well. “We had gone from no proof of concept to having something that was at least on par with the best alternative approaches to LSTMs by that time,” Uszkoreit says. But compared to long short-term memory, “it wasn’t better.”</p><p>They had reached a plateau—until one day in 2017, when Noam Shazeer heard about their project, by accident. Shazeer was a veteran Googler—he’d joined the company in 2000—and an in-house legend, starting with his work on the company’s early ad system. Shazeer had been working on deep learning for five years and recently had become interested in large language models. But these models were nowhere close to producing the fluid conversations that he believed were possible.</p><p>As Shazeer recalls it, he was walking down a corridor in Building 1965 and passing Kaiser’s workspace. He found himself listening to a spirited conversation. “I remember Ashish was talking about the idea of using self-attention, and Niki was very excited about it. I’m like, wow, that sounds like a great idea. This looks like a fun, smart group of people doing something promising.” Shazeer found the existing recurrent neural networks “irritating” and thought: “Let’s go replace them!”</p><p>Shazeer’s joining the group was critical. “These theoretical or intuitive mechanisms, like self-attention, always require very careful implementation, often by a small number of experienced ‘magicians,’ to even show any signs of life,” says Uszkoreit. Shazeer began to work his sorcery right away. He decided to write his own version of the transformer team’s code. “I took the basic idea and made the thing up myself,” he says. Occasionally he asked Kaiser questions, but mostly, he says, he “just acted on it for a while and came back and said, ‘Look, it works.’” Using what team members would later describe with words like “magic” and “alchemy” and “bells and whistles,” he had taken the system to a new level.</p><p>“That kicked off a sprint,” says Gomez. They were motivated, and they also wanted to hit an upcoming deadline—May 19, the filing date for papers to be presented at the biggest AI event of the year, the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in December. As what passes for winter in Silicon Valley shifted to spring, the pace of the experiments picked up. They tested two models of transformers: one that was produced with 12 hours of training and a more powerful version called Big that was trained over three and a half days. They set them to work on English-to-German translation.</p><p>The basic model outperformed all competitors—and Big earned a BLEU score that decisively shattered previous records while also being more computationally efficient. “We had done it in less time than anyone out there,” Parmar says. “And that was only the beginning, because the number kept improving.” When Uszkoreit heard this, he broke out an old bottle of champagne he had lying around in his mountain expedition truck.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The last two weeks before the deadline were frantic. Though officially some of the team still had desks in Building 1945, they mostly worked in 1965 because it had a better espresso machine in the micro-kitchen. “People weren’t sleeping,” says Gomez, who, as the intern, lived in a constant debugging frenzy and also produced the visualizations and diagrams for the paper. It’s common in such projects to do ablations—taking things out to see whether what remains is enough to get the job done.</p><p>“There was every possible combination of tricks and modules—which one helps, which doesn’t help. Let’s rip it out. Let’s replace it with this,” Gomez says. “Why is the model behaving in this counterintuitive way? Oh, it’s because we didn’t remember to do the masking properly. Does it work yet? OK, move on to the next. All of these components of what we now call the transformer were the output of this extremely high-paced, iterative trial and error.” The ablations, aided by Shazeer’s implementations, produced “something minimalistic,” Jones says. “Noam is a wizard.”</p><p>Vaswani recalls crashing on an office couch one night while the team was writing the paper. As he stared at the curtains that separated the couch from the rest of the room, he was struck by the pattern on the fabric, which looked to him like synapses and neurons. Gomez was there, and Vaswani told him that what they were working on would transcend machine translation. “Ultimately, like with the human brain, you need to unite all these modalities—speech, audio, vision—under a single architecture,” he says. “I had a strong hunch we were onto something more general.”</p><p>In the higher echelons of Google, however, the work was seen as just another interesting AI project. I asked several of the transformers folks whether their bosses ever summoned them for updates on the project. Not so much. But “we understood that this was potentially quite a big deal,” says Uszkoreit. “And it caused us to actually obsess over one of the sentences in the paper toward the end, where we comment on future work.”</p><p>That sentence anticipated what might come next—the application of transformer models to basically all forms of human expression. “We are excited about the future of attention-based models,” they wrote. “We plan to extend the transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text” and to investigate “images, audio and video.”</p><p>A couple of nights before the deadline, Uszkoreit realized they needed a title. Jones noted that the team had landed on a radical rejection of the accepted best practices, most notably LSTMs, for one technique: attention. The Beatles, Jones recalled, had named a song “All You Need Is Love.” Why not call the paper “Attention Is All You Need”?</p><p><em>The Beatles?</em></p><p>“I’m British,” says Jones. “It literally took five seconds of thought. I didn’t think they would use it.”</p><p>They continued collecting results from their experiments right up until the deadline. “The English-French numbers came, like, five minutes before we submitted the paper,” says Parmar. “I was sitting in the micro-kitchen in 1965, getting that last number in.” With barely two minutes to spare, they sent off the paper.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Google, as almost all tech companies do, quickly filed provisional patents on the work. The reason was not to block others from using the ideas but to build up its patent portfolio for defensive purposes. (The company has a philosophy of “if technology advances, Google will reap the benefits.”)</p><p>When the transformer crew heard back from the conference peer reviewers, the response was a mix. “One was positive, one was extremely positive, and one was, ‘This is OK,’” says Parmar. The paper was accepted for one of the evening poster sessions.</p><p>By December, the paper was generating a buzz. Their four-hour session on December 6 was jammed with scientists wanting to know more. The authors talked until they were hoarse. By 10:30 pm, when the session closed, there was still a crowd. “Security had to tell us to leave,” says Uszkoreit. Perhaps the most satisfying moment for him was when computer scientist Sepp Hochreiter came up and praised the work—quite a compliment, considering that Hochreiter was the coinventor of long short-term memory, which transformers had just booted as the go-to hammer in the AI toolkit.</p><p><span>Transformers did not</span> instantly take over the world, or even Google. Kaiser recalls that around the time of the paper’s publication, Shazeer proposed to Google executives that the company abandon the entire search index and train a huge network with transformers—basically to transform how Google organizes information. At that point, even Kaiser considered the idea ridiculous. Now the conventional wisdom is that it’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-just-added-generative-ai-to-search/">a matter of time</a>.</p><p>A startup called OpenAI was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-openai-really-wants/">much faster to pounce</a>. Soon after the paper was published, OpenAI’s chief researcher, Ilya Sutskever—who had known the transformer team during his time at Google—suggested that one of its scientists, Alex Radford, work on the idea. The results were the first GPT products. As OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told me last year, “When the transformer paper came out, I don’t think anyone at Google realized what it meant.”</p><p>The picture internally is more complicated. “It was pretty evident to us that transformers could do really magical things,” says Uszkoreit. “Now, you may ask the question, why wasn’t there <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-rebrands-ai-chatbot-gemini/">ChatGPT by Google</a> back in 2018? Realistically, we could have had GPT-3 or even 3.5 probably in 2019, maybe 2020. The big question isn’t, did they see it? The question is, why didn’t we do anything with the fact that we had seen it? The answer is tricky.”</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><strong>/ NAME: AIDAN GOMEZ / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER AND CEO OF COHERE</strong></span></p></figure></div><p>Many tech critics point to Google’s transition from an innovation-centered playground to a bottom-line-focused bureaucracy. As Gomez <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/37bb01af-ee46-4483-982f-ef3921436a50">told</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>, “They weren’t modernizing. They weren’t adopting this tech.” But that would have taken a lot of daring for a giant company whose technology led the industry and reaped huge profits for decades. Google did begin to integrate transformers into products in 2018, starting with its translation tool. Also that year, it introduced a new transformer-based language model called BERT, which it started to apply to search the year after.</p><p>But these under-the-hood changes seem timid compared to OpenAI’s quantum leap and Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsofts-satya-nadella-is-betting-everything-on-ai/">bold integration</a> of transformer-based systems into its product line. When I asked CEO Sundar Pichai last year why his company wasn’t first to launch a large language model like ChatGPT, he argued that in this case Google found it advantageous to let others lead. “It’s not fully clear to me that it might have worked out as well. The fact is, we can do more after people had seen how it works,” he said.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There <em>is</em> the undeniable truth that all eight authors of the paper have left Google. Polosukhin’s company, Near, built a blockchain whose tokens have a market capitalization around $4 billion. Parmar and Vaswani paired up as business partners in 2021 to start Adept (estimated valuation of $1 billion) and are now on their <em>second</em> company, called Essential AI ($8 million in funding). Llion Jones’ Tokyo-based Sakana AI is valued at $200 million. Shazeer, who left in October 2021, cofounded Character AI (estimated valuation of $5 billion). Aidan Gomez, the intern in the group, cofounded Cohere in Toronto in 2019 (estimated valuation of $2.2 billion). Jakob Uszkoreit’s biotech company, Inceptive, is valued at $300 million. All those companies (except Near) are based on transformer technology.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><strong>/ NAME: LUKASZ KAISER / OCCUPATION: RESEARCHER AT OPENAI</strong></span></p></figure></div><p>Kaiser is the only one who hasn’t founded a company. He joined OpenAI and is one of the inventors of a new technology called <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-clues-hint-openai-shadowy-q-project/">Q*</a>, which Altman said last year will “push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward.” (When I attempted to quiz Kaiser on this in our interview, the OpenAI PR person almost leaped across the table to silence him.)</p><p>Does Google miss these escapees? Of course, in addition to others who have migrated from the company to new AI startups. (Pichai reminded me, when I asked him about the transformer departures, that industry darling OpenAI also has seen defections: “The AI area is very, very dynamic,” he said.) But Google can boast that it created an environment that supported the pursuit of unconventional ideas. “In a lot of ways Google has been way ahead—they invested in the right minds and created the environment where we could explore and push the envelope,” Parmar says. “It’s not crazy that it took time to adopt it. Google had so much more at stake.”</p><p>Without that environment: no transformer. Not only were the authors all Google employees, they also worked out of the same offices. Hallway encounters and overheard lunch conversations led to big moments. The group is also culturally diverse. Six of the eight authors were born outside the United States; the other two are children of two green-card-carrying Germans who were temporarily in California and a first-generation American whose family had fled persecution, respectively.</p><p>Uszkoreit, speaking from his office in Berlin, says that innovation is all about the right conditions. “It’s getting people who are super excited about something who are at the right point in their life,” he says. “If you have that and have fun while you do it, and you’re working on the right problems—and you’re lucky—the magic happens.”</p><p>Something magical also happened between Uszkoreit and his famous father. After all those dinner table debates, Hans Uszkoreit, his son reports, has now cofounded a company that is building large language models. Using transformers, of course.</p><hr><p><em>Let us know what you think about this article.

<p>
Suyu is a new Switch emulator compatible with the Steam Deck that launches in public beta today.
</p>
<p>One of the first Nintendo Switch emulators to rise <a href="https://overkill.wtf/switch-emulator-yuzu/">from Yuzu's ashes</a> is here: Suyu, based on Yuzu's source code, launches in a first public beta today. Their changelog looks as follows:</p><blockquote>- Full rebrand<br>- ICNS Icon generation<br>- Error handling<br>- Qlaunch initial integration(buggy/requires further testing; requires V17.0.0 firmware or newer)<br>- Gitlab ci for automated builds<br>- Require all keys to be user provided, along with firmware<br>- Improved Addons Manager<br>- Various crash fixes<br>- Initial work for MacOS support<br>- Fix for video playback AMD devices<br>- Enabled more features on AMD proprietary drivers<br>- Multiplayer API re-implemented<br>- Removed all telemetry<br>- New UI options/improvements<br>- QOL changes</blockquote><p>Unlike Yuzu, the Suyu team does things differently in regards to Nintendo Switch emulation than their predecessors. <a href="https://overkill.wtf/how-to-setup-yuzu-for-steam-deck/">Whereas Yuzu only required prod.keys</a>, Suyu will also require you to dump your title.keys and firmware from a hacked Switch to run games. The devs also clarified that they are doing this for nonprofit (there's no Patreon) and do not condone piracy.</p><p>The developer team is releasing <a href="https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu/-/releases/v0.0.2-master?ref=overkill.wtf">binaries for Linux, Windows, Android and even an experimental build for macOS</a> (Yuzu was unavailable for Apple's platform). I tried the build on Steam Deck (it works) and will work on a guide.</p>

<p>The other day I was implementing <a href="https://tavianator.com/cgit/bfs.git/commit/?id=89ecb2a08467cd8aa6ba70f8519df494652cac96">multi-threaded <code>stat()</code> calls</a> in <a href="https://tavianator.com/projects/bfs.html"><code>bfs</code></a>.
When I ran some benchmarks, I saw something that made my heart skip a beat:</p>
<pre><code>$ tailfin run bench/bench.sh --build=main --default
...
bfs: error: bench/corpus/chromium/v8/src/heap/heap.cc: Structure needs cleaning
</code></pre>
<p>If you're not familiar, "structure needs cleaning" is the human-readable description of <code>EUCLEAN</code>, an <code>errno</code> value that usually indicates filesystem corruption.
Fearing the worst, I checked <code>dmesg</code> and saw</p>
<pre><code>$ dmesg | tail
...
BTRFS critical (device dm-2): corrupted node, root=518 block=16438782945911875046 owner mismatch, have 4517169229596899607 expect [256, 18446744073709551360]
</code></pre>
<p>I immediately rebooted into a live environment and ran <code>btrfs check</code>, but to my surprise, there were no errors found.
<code>btrfs scrub</code> also found no evidence of corruption.
And in fact, the file from the error message was completely fine.
Whatever the issue was, it seemed to have gone away on its own.</p>
<p>I searched Google for that "corrupted node" message and found that it had happened to someone else recently too: <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/CAHk-=whNdMaN9ntZ47XRKP6DBes2E5w7fi-0U3H2+PS18p+Pzw@mail.gmail.com/">Linus Torvalds</a>, just after merging a Btrfs pull request.
(This was not the first time Linus and I had hit the same bug.
We both have the same CPU in our desktops.
Last time it led to one of my <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a51ab63b297ce9e26e3ffb9be896018a42d5f32f">favourite bugfixes ever</a>.)</p>
<p>But the difference between me and Linus was that I could (semi-)reliably reproduce the error.
Not every time, but maybe 10% of the time I ran <code>bfs</code> with parallel <code>stat()</code> calls on a large directory tree, I would see that "structure needs cleaning" error.
I reported my <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20240206033807.15498-1-tavianator@tavianator.com/">findings</a> to the Btrfs mailing list, and though it led to some discussion about potential causes, we didn't narrow down the root cause.</p>
<h2 id="extent_buffer"><a href="#extent_buffer"><code>extent_buffer</code></a></h2>
<p>Based on the logs, the Btrfs developers assumed the problem had to do allocation of <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/btrfs/extent_io.h?id=a51ab63b297ce9e26e3ffb9be896018a42d5f32f#n76"><code>struct extent_buffer</code></a> and their memory pages.
I'm not a Btrfs internals expert by any means, but I understand that <code>extent_buffer</code>s are used for metadata I/O; that is, reading and writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-tree</a> nodes.
An <code>extent_buffer</code> is associated with an array of <code>struct folio</code>/<code>struct page</code> (depending on kernel version), and those pages hold the actual contents of the extents that are read or written.
The abstraction helps with file system block sizes that are different from the system page size.</p>
<p>Allocating an <code>extent_buffer</code> and its pages is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/btrfs/extent_io.c?id=a51ab63b297ce9e26e3ffb9be896018a42d5f32f#n3681">more complicated than you might expect</a>.
Each <code>struct extent_buffer</code> holds an array of <code>struct folio</code>, and those folios have a private reference that points back to the <code>extent_buffer</code>.
There should only ever be one <code>extent_buffer</code> at a time for any particular extent.</p>
<p>To reduce locking on the allocation path, the <code>extent_buffer</code> and the corresponding folios are allocated separately, linked together, and then inserted into a radix tree keyed by the start offset of the extent.
Only the radix tree insertion needs locking.
At the point of insertion, if it turns out someone else beat us to allocating the same extent, we instead take an extra reference to that <code>extent_buffer</code> and free the one we just allocated (and its pages).</p>
<p>This code path had undergone some churn recently, both <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=09e6cef19c9fc0e10547135476865b5272aa0406">changing the race detection/handling strategy</a> and <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=082d5bb9b336d533b7b968f4f8712e7755a9876a">converting from <code>struct page</code> to <code>struct folio</code></a>, so there was suspicion that a race or reference counting bug had crept in.
But the extra debug logging didn't show it.
It appeared that the <code>extent_buffer</code> and the <code>folio</code>s had all the right reference counts, but the memory itself had garbage rather than the appropriate on-disk contents.
Btrfs does some sanity checks after reading these blocks in, and those checks were failing, causing the errors.
But the on-disk blocks themselves were fine, and the next time we read them in, everything worked.</p>
<h2 id="git-bisect-bad"><a href="#git-bisect-bad"><code>git bisect bad</code></a></h2>
<p>One of the best bug hunting tools for the Linux kernel is <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect"><code>git bisect</code></a>.
Unfortunately, bisecting bugs like this is challenging.
For intermittent issues, it's easy enough to know when to mark a commit bad, but harder to know if a commit is good—maybe the bug just hasn't triggered <em>yet</em>.
You also need a known-good commit to start from, but that was hard to find.
I thought at first the bug was new in Linux 6.7, but I could still reproduce it on 6.6 and 6.5.
The Btrfs devs suggested I start from 6.0.</p>
<p>Bisecting can also be dangerous because you are running arbitrary old mid-development-cycle kernel commits that may have since had bugs fixed in the official releases.
It's safer to do it from a virtual machine, but so far I had been unable to reproduce the bug on a VM.
So started bisecting on my actual desktop.</p>
<p>Normally I would be far too scared to bisect a filesystem corruption bug on my actual computer that I use daily.
But this seemed like it wasn't "real" corruption, plus I have backups, so I risked it.
Unfortunately, after a couple rounds, I ran into <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/CABg4E-=u7m_g3HCFUYHS-+RC==pefkUZXiTT2Aor86jruHSF9Q@mail.gmail.com/">actual, on-disk filesystem corruption</a>.
2,073,625 uncorrectable read errors is a new record for me, so I was too scared to continue the bisect.
I restored what I could from backups and carried on with my life.</p>
<h2 id="tracefs"><a href="#tracefs"><code>tracefs</code></a></h2>
<p>A few weeks later, Btrfs developer Qu Wenruo got back to me with some <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/c7241ea4-fcc6-48d2-98c8-b5ea790d6c89@gmx.com/">extra debugging patches</a> and I decided to give it another shot.
I ran his patch on bare metal, but wasn't able to reproduce the bug with the debugging patch applied.
Such is life when debugging race conditions!</p>
<p>I also tried again to reproduce the issue in a VM.
I configured it to more closely match my actual system configuration: multiple disks with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/dm-crypt/Device_encryption">dm-crypt</a> full disk encryption, joined together in a Btrfs RAID 0 array.
And I made them emulated NVME drives instead of VirtIO.
That did the trick: I could now reproduce the issue in a VM, though it took around 30 runs of my reproducer instead of the ~10 it took in real life.
But this time I could still reproduce it with the debugging patch applied.</p>
<p>After a couple runs and tweaking the trace messages to make cross-referencing easier, I noticed something odd.
Looking at just the lines from the trace corresponding to the "corrupted" error message, I saw this:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 'eb=15302115328' dmesg.log
BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted leaf, root=258 block=15302115328 owner mismatch, have 13709377558419367261 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=15302115328

</code></pre>
<p>The only relevant operations seem to be allocating this <code>extent_buffer</code>, and then reading it ... twice.
Reading it once ought to be enough, I thought, so I looked more closely at the code that actually reads them in and managed to eyeball the bug.</p>
<h2 id="read_extent_buffer_pages"><a href="#read_extent_buffer_pages"><code>read_extent_buffer_pages()</code></a></h2>
<p>Just like how multiple threads might try to allocate the same <code>extent_buffer</code> at the same time, they might also try to read it at the same time.
To ensure the read only happens once, a custom locking protocol is used:</p>
<pre><code>int read_extent_buffer_pages(struct extent_buffer *eb, /* ... */)
{
    if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &amp;eb-&gt;bflags))
        return 0;

    /* ... */

    /* Someone else is already reading the buffer, just wait for it. */
    if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &amp;eb-&gt;bflags))
        goto done;

    /* ... */
    bbio = btrfs_bio_alloc(INLINE_EXTENT_BUFFER_PAGES,
                   REQ_OP_READ | REQ_META, eb-&gt;fs_info,
                   end_bbio_meta_read, eb);
    /* ... */
    btrfs_submit_bio(bbio, mirror_num);

done:
    if (wait == WAIT_COMPLETE) {
        wait_on_bit_io(&amp;eb-&gt;bflags, EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
        if (!test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &amp;eb-&gt;bflags))
            return -EIO;
    }

    return 0;
}

static void end_bbio_meta_read(struct btrfs_bio *bbio)
{
    /* ... */
    bool uptodate = !bbio-&gt;bio.bi_status;
    /* ... */

    if (uptodate) {
        set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);
    } else {
        clear_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);
        set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READ_ERR, &amp;eb-&gt;bflags);
    }

    /* ... */
    clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &amp;eb-&gt;bflags);
    smp_mb__after_atomic();
    wake_up_bit(&amp;eb-&gt;bflags, EXTENT_BUFFER_READING);
    /* ... */
}

</div>

<p>If the first thread starts <em>and finishes</em> the I/O between the second thread checking the <code>UPTODATE</code> bit and the <code>READING</code> bit, the second thread will start a totally unnecessary read even though we already read in the extent.
Worse, because the <code>UPTODATE</code> bit is already set, the third will return without waiting for the read to complete.
That thread will then think it's safe to access the <code>extent_buffer</code>'s pages, despite them currently being under I/O, leading to a data race!</p>
<p>The fix is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking">double-checked locking</a>: after setting the <code>READING</code> bit, check <code>UPTODATE</code> again so we don't kick off more useless (actively harmful, even) I/O.</p>

With that fix, I can run the reproducer overnight without triggering any more errors.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue">Epilogue</a></h2>
<p>You might be surprised that this race was not benign.
After all, we're reading some disk blocks into memory that already holds the contents of those same disk blocks.
It's still technically a data race to read and write memory at the same time, even if the writes don't modify the memory, but usually it would be unobservable in practice.</p>
<div id="overwrite-1">
<pre><code>uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory
</code></pre>
<pre><code>metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad
</code></pre>
<pre><code>metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The reason I could observe it was already mentioned above: full disk encryption.
When dm-crypt processes a disk read, it reads the <em>encrypted</em> contents into memory and then decrypts them in-place.</p>
<div id="overwrite-2">
<pre><code>uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory
</code></pre>
<pre><code>encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibber encrypted gibberish encrypt
</code></pre>
<pre><code>metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad
</code></pre>
<pre><code>encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibberish encrypted gibber encrypted gibberish encrypt
</code></pre>
<pre><code>metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metadata metad
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It's obvious why this causes problems: sometimes the racing thread will see valid metadata, but sometimes it will see encrypted bytes that appear totally random.
I even captured a trace where the error messages show the extent being gradually filled in:</p>
<pre><code>[  807.737576] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=266 block=3178470954007437077 owner mismatch, have 6155297726051334641 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=ffff8ac915d022d0 start=12738904064

</code></pre>
<p>There you can see the <em>same block</em> switch from an internal node to a leaf, and the block number change from a random number to the start of the extent, over about 0.02 seconds.</p>

Before building <a href="https://lcl.host/"><u>lcl.host</u></a>, we used self-signed <span>app.localhost</span> certificates, but those have a few downsides:</p><ul><li><p>All team members had to manually provision (and re-provision) their own self-signed certificates.</p></li><li><p>The self-signed certificates had to be manually added to each trust store on the system</p></li><li><p><span>app.localhost</span> domains don't work everywhere, so <span>/etc/hosts</span> entries or a development DNS server were required for non-browser clients (like curl).</p></li><li><p>Running apps in local containers required constant certificate re-provisioning and trust store updates.</p></li></ul><p>Since we already used Anchor private CAs internally between development services, we knew it could solve some of these problems. But a private CA alone is not a complete solution.

So we built lcl.host, and we think it’s the best way to setup and use HTTPS with your apps in development:</p><ul><li><p>ACME-powered automated certificate provisioning and renewal instead of troublesome manual processes. </p></li><li><p>Hostnames that just work everywhere, with no custom configuration required.</p></li><li><p>The same secure browser context to match production, without the browser quirks in the localhost context.</p></li><li><p>Works well inside, outside, and even between containers (thanks to Anchor’s powerful packages features).</p></li><li><p>Fast setup and batteries included, no certificate or encryption expertise required.</p></li></ul><p>We’re excited to share it with you! To setup HTTPS in development, install the Anchor CLI toolchain, run <span>anchor lcl</span>, and follow the instructions. That’s it!</p><pre><code>$ brew install anchordotdev/tap/anchor
$ anchor lcl</code></pre><p>Or <a href="https://github.com/anchordotdev/cli#installation"><u>install from source</u></a> if Homebrew isn't an option.</p><p><span>Loading...</span>
<i>Use lcl.host to add HTTPS to a Next.js app</i></p><h2>How lcl.host Works</h2><p>lcl.host combines an Anchor managed private CA for your personal development environment, the <span>lcl.host</span> DNS zone to resolve subdomains to your local system, and the Anchor CLI to manage your local trust stores.</p><p><b>Personalized Private CA</b></p><p>When you sign up for an Anchor account, we automatically provision a “localhost” CA for you. This dedicated private CA provides portability between development environments and remains 100% free to use with an unlimited number of development apps. This CA has some restrictions though: it can only issue certificates for subdomains of <span>lcl.host</span> and <span>localhost</span>, but that’s all you need for local development.</p><p>The <span>anchor lcl mkcert</span> command is the easiest way to get development certificates using Anchor's zero-challenge ACME flow. Other <a href="https://acmeclients.com/"><u>ACME client</u></a> tools like <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"><u>certbot</u></a> and <a href="https://acme.sh/"><u>acme.sh</u></a> work well too, but we recommend integrating an ACME client into your application to allow automatic certificate provisioning and renewal. Don't worry, we will walk you through that too when you run <span>anchor lcl setup</span>.</p><p><b>lcl.host DNS Zone</b></p><p>All <span>lcl.host</span> subdomains resolve to <span>127.0.0.1</span>, the same address as <span>localhost</span>. These subdomains work without HTTPS too, making them a drop-in replacement for <span>localhost</span>. To use them with HTTPS you will need a certificate for the subdomain that is trusted by your system. Your personal CA handles the first part, and the Anchor CLI takes care of your system's trust stores.</p><p><b>Trust Stores</b></p><p>A trust store manages a set of root certificates (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_anchor"><u>trust anchors</u></a>) which browsers and other clients use to verify certificates presented by servers. Some trust stores are integrated into the operating system (Keychain on MacOS), others are file/directory based (<span>/etc/ssl/certs/</span> on Debian systems), or even a custom database format (like certdb for NSS/Firefox). Keeping every trust store up to date used to be a lot of recurring manual work, but the Anchor CLI automates the whole process.</p><p>After signing in, the Anchor CLI fetches the list of expected CA certificates for your development environment, checks for them in your local trust stores, and walks you through any required changes. After this quick and easy install, your certificates will be trusted everywhere on your system.</p><p>There's a lot that's required to setup HTTPS in development. The magic of lcl.host is that it's all handled for you, so you can get back to building secure apps that work seamlessly in development and production. </p><h2>Try Now</h2><p><u></u><a href="https://github.com/anchordotdev/cli#installation"><u>Install the Anchor CLI</u></a> and run <span>anchor lcl</span> from your application directory, and have local HTTPS in no time!</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>London had a</span> problem. In 2016, more than 2 million of the city’s residents—roughly a quarter of its population—lived in areas with illegal levels of air pollution; areas that also contained nearly 500 of the city’s schools. That same air pollution was prematurely killing as many as <a data-offer-url="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#:~:text=The%20annual%20mortality%20of%20human,and%2036,000%20deaths%20every%20year." data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#:~:text=The%20annual%20mortality%20of%20human,and%2036,000%20deaths%20every%20year.&quot;}" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health/air-pollution-applying-all-our-health#:~:text=The%20annual%20mortality%20of%20human,and%2036,000%20deaths%20every%20year." rel="noopener" target="_blank">36,000 people a year</a>. Much of it was coming from transport: <a data-offer-url="https://www.centreforlondon.org/blog/reimagining-london-transport/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.centreforlondon.org/blog/reimagining-london-transport/&quot;}" href="https://www.centreforlondon.org/blog/reimagining-london-transport/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a quarter</a> of the city’s carbon emissions were from moving people and goods, with three-quarters of that emitted by road traffic.</p><p>But in the years since, carbon emissions have fallen. There’s also been a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/03/dramatic-plunge-in-london-air-pollution-since-2016-report-finds">94 percent reduction</a> in the number of people living in areas with illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant that causes lung damage. The reason? London has spent years and millions of pounds reducing the number of motorists in the city.</p><p>It’s far from alone. From Oslo to Hamburg and Ljubljana to Helsinki, cities across Europe have started working to reduce their road traffic in an effort to curb air pollution and climate change.</p><p>But while it’s certainly having an impact (Ljubljana, one of the earliest places to transition away from cars, has seen sizable reductions in carbon emissions and <a data-offer-url="https://www.ljubljana.si/en/news/air-quality-in-ljubljana/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ljubljana.si/en/news/air-quality-in-ljubljana/&quot;}" href="https://www.ljubljana.si/en/news/air-quality-in-ljubljana/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">air pollution</a>), going car-free is a lot harder than it seems. Not only has it led to politicians and urban planners facing death threats and being doxxed, it has forced them to rethink the entire basis of city life.</p><p>London’s car-reduction policies come in a variety of forms. There are charges for dirtier vehicles and for driving into the city center. Road layouts in residential areas have been redesigned, with one-way systems and bollards, barriers, and planters used to reduce through-traffic (creating what are known as “low-traffic neighborhoods”—or LTNs). And schemes to get more people cycling and using public transport have been introduced. The city has avoided the kind of outright car bans seen elsewhere in Europe, such as in Copenhagen, but nevertheless things have changed.</p><p>“The level of traffic reduction is transformative, and it’s throughout the whole day,” says Claire Holland, leader of the council in Lambeth, a borough in south London. Lambeth now sees 25,000 fewer daily car journeys than before its LTN scheme was put in place in 2020, even after adjusting for the impact of the pandemic. Meanwhile, there was a 40 percent increase in cycling and similar rises in walking and scooting over that same period.</p><p>What seems to work best is a carrot-and-stick approach—creating positive reasons to take a bus or to cycle rather than just making driving harder. “In crowded urban areas, you can’t just make buses better if those buses are still always stuck in car traffic,” says Rachel Aldred, professor of transport at the University of Westminster and director of its Active Travel Academy. “The academic evidence suggests that a mixture of positive and negative characteristics is more effective than either on their own.”</p><p>For countries looking to cut emissions, cars are an obvious target. They make up a big proportion of a country’s carbon footprint, accounting for <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20190313STO31218/co2-emissions-from-cars-facts-and-figures-infographics">one-fifth of all emissions</a> across the European Union. Of course, urban driving doesn’t make up the majority of a country’s car use, but the kind of short journeys taken when driving in the city are some of the most obviously wasteful, making cities an ideal place to start if you’re looking to get people out from behind the wheel. That, and the fact that many city residents are already car-less (just 40 percent of people in Lambeth own cars, for example) and that cities tend to have better public transport alternatives than elsewhere.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Plus, traffic-reduction programmes also have impacts beyond reducing air pollution and carbon emissions. In cities like Oslo and Helsinki, thanks to car-reduction policies, entire years have passed without a single road traffic death. It’s even been suggested that needing less parking could free up space to help ease the chronic housing shortage felt in so many cities.</p><p>But as effective as policies to end or reduce urban car use have been, they’ve almost universally faced huge opposition. When Oslo proposed in 2017 that its city center should be car-free, the backlash saw the idea branded as a “Berlin Wall against motorists.” The plan ended up being downgraded into a <a data-offer-url="http://www.aftenposten.no/osloby/Vil-ikke-lenger-tvinge-bilene-ut-av-sentrum-607083b.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.aftenposten.no/osloby/Vil-ikke-lenger-tvinge-bilene-ut-av-sentrum-607083b.html&quot;}" href="http://www.aftenposten.no/osloby/Vil-ikke-lenger-tvinge-bilene-ut-av-sentrum-607083b.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">less ambitious scheme</a> consisting of smaller changes, like removing car parking and building cycle lanes to try to lower the number of vehicles.</p><p>In London, the introduction of LTNs has also <a data-offer-url="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/uk/2020/11/low-traffic-neighbourhoods-LTNs-London-car-street-cycling-walking-culture-war-pollution-gentrification" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/uk/2020/11/low-traffic-neighbourhoods-LTNs-London-car-street-cycling-walking-culture-war-pollution-gentrification&quot;}" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/uk/2020/11/low-traffic-neighbourhoods-LTNs-London-car-street-cycling-walking-culture-war-pollution-gentrification" rel="noopener" target="_blank">led to a massive backlash</a>. In the east London borough of Hackney, one councilor and his family were sent death threats due to their support for the programme. Bollards were regularly graffitied, while pro-LTN activists were accused of “social cleansing.” It was suggested that low-traffic areas would drive up house prices and leave the only affordable accommodation on unprotected roads. “It became very intimidating,” says Holland. “I had my address tweeted out twice, with sort of veiled threats from people who didn’t even live in the borough saying that we knew they knew where I lived.”</p><p>Part of that response is a testament to how much our cities, and by extension, our lives are designed around cars. In the US, between <a href="https://www.vox.com/a/new-economy-future/cars-cities-technologies">50 and 60 percent</a> of the downtowns of many cities are dedicated to parking alone. While in the UK that figure tends to be smaller, designing streets to be accessible to a never-ending stream of traffic has been the central concern of most urban planning since the Second World War. It’s what led to the huge sprawl of identikit suburban housing on the outskirts of cities like London, each sporting its own driveway and ample road access.</p><p>“If you propose this idea to the average American, the response is: if you take my car away from me, I will die,” says J. H. Crawford, the author of the book <a data-offer-url="https://www.carfree.com/book/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.carfree.com/book/&quot;}" href="https://www.carfree.com/book/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Carfree Cities</em></a> and a leading figure in the movement to end urban car use. “If you do that overnight, without making any other provisions, that’s actually approximately correct.” Having the right alternatives to cars is therefore vital to reducing city traffic.</p><p>And any attempts to reduce urban car use tend to do better when designed from the bottom up. Barcelona’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZORzsubQA_M&amp;ab_channel=Vox">“superblocks” programme</a>, which takes sets of nine blocks within its grid system and limits cars to the roads around the outside of the set (as well as reducing speed limits and removing on-street parking) was shaped by <a data-offer-url="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ecologiaurbana/en/bodies-involved/citizen-participation/superblocks" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ecologiaurbana/en/bodies-involved/citizen-participation/superblocks&quot;}" href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ecologiaurbana/en/bodies-involved/citizen-participation/superblocks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">having resident input on every stage of the process</a>, from design to implementation. Early indicators suggest the policy has been <a data-offer-url="https://www.barcelona.cat/infobarcelona/en/tema/urban-planning-and-infrastructures/superblocks-are-having-positive-effects-on-health-and-well-being_1097301.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.barcelona.cat/infobarcelona/en/tema/urban-planning-and-infrastructures/superblocks-are-having-positive-effects-on-health-and-well-being_1097301.html&quot;}" href="https://www.barcelona.cat/infobarcelona/en/tema/urban-planning-and-infrastructures/superblocks-are-having-positive-effects-on-health-and-well-being_1097301.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wildly popular with residents</a>, has seen nitrogen dioxide air pollution fall by 25 percent in some areas, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019315223#:~:text=The%20Superblocks%20were%20estimated%20to,CI%3A%200.6%E2%80%932.8">will prevent</a> an estimated 667 premature deaths each year, saving an estimated 1.7 billion euros.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When it comes to design, there’s also the question of access. Whether it’s emergency services needing to get in or small businesses awaiting deliveries, there’s an important amount of “last mile” traffic—transport that gets people or things to the actual end point of their journey—that is vital to sustaining an urban area. If you want to reduce traffic, you have to work around that and think of alternative solutions—such as allowing emergency vehicles access to pedestrianized areas, or even using automatic number plate recognition to exempt emergency vehicles from the camera checks that are used to police through-traffic in LTNs (which is what Lambeth is doing, Holland says).</p><p>But even then, it’s often just hard to convince people an entirely different city layout is possible. Getting people to accept that how they live alongside cars can be changed—say, with an LTN—takes time. But government surveys of the UK’s recently implemented LTNs have indicated that support from residents for such schemes increases over time. “If you start seeing more and more of those kinds of things, things become thinkable,” explains Aldred. If you start unpicking the idea that car use can’t be changed, “it starts to become possible to do more and more things without cars for people.”</p><p>The other issue is that, to put it simply, cars are never just cars. They’re interwoven into our culture and consumption as symbols of affluence, independence, and success, and the aspiration to achieve those things in future. “A man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself a failure,” the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2006/09/28/the-wheels-on-the-bus">reportedly once said</a>. “That’s how we got in this mess in the first place, though,” says Crawford. “Everybody saw that the rich people were driving cars, and they wanted to too.”</p><p>That divide goes some way to explaining why the opposition to car-reduction schemes is often so extreme and can devolve into a “culture war”—which is what Holland has found in her experience with LTNs. But that struggle also outlines an important fact about car-free urban areas—that once cities make the decision to reduce or remove cars, they rarely go back. No one I spoke to for this piece could name a recent sizable pedestrianization or traffic-reduction scheme that had been reversed once it had been given time to have an effect.</p><p>Many of the cities that pioneered reducing car use—like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140318-five-car-free-city-experiments">Copenhagen in the 1970s</a>—are rated today as some of the best places to live in the world. Even with London’s experimental and often unpopular LTN scheme, 100 of the 130 low-traffic areas created have been kept in place, Aldred says.</p><p>“Generally speaking, if a sensible program is adopted to really reduce or eliminate car usage in a central urban area, it seems to stick,” says Crawford. “If you go back a year or two later, people will just say: well, this is the best thing we ever did.”</p><hr><p>Reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will require innovative solutions at a global scale.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google" data-link-name="in body link">Google</a> has been fined €250m (£213m) by French regulators for breaching an agreement over paying media companies for reproducing their content online.</p><p>France’s competition watchdog said on Wednesday that it was fining the US tech company for breaches linked to intellectual property rules related to news media publishers. The regulator also cited concerns about Google’s AI service.</p><p>The competition authority said Google’s AI-powered chatbot Bard – since rebranded as Gemini – was trained on content from publishers and news agencies without notifying them.</p><p>The watchdog said in a statement that the fine was for “failing to respect commitments made in 2022” and accused Google of not negotiating in “good faith” with news publishers on how much to compensate them for use of their content.</p><p>Google had pledged not to contest the facts as part of settlement proceedings, the watchdog said, adding the company also proposed a series of measures to remedy certain shortcomings.</p><p>France has been battling for years to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/21/france-hails-victory-facebook-agrees-pay-newspapers-content" data-link-name="in body link">protect the publishing rights</a> and revenue of its press and news agencies against what it termed the domination of powerful tech companies that share news content or show news stories in web searches.</p><p>Google and other online platforms have been accused of making billions from news without sharing the revenue with those who gather it.</p><p>To tackle this, the EU created a form of copyright called “neighbouring rights” that allows print media to demand compensation for using their content.</p><p>France has been a test case for the EU rules. In 2019, it was the first EU country to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/oct/10/backers-of-australias-mandatory-news-code-welcome-french-ruling-on-google" data-link-name="in body link">enact the directive on the publishing rights</a> of media companies and news agencies, which required large tech platforms to open talks with publishers seeking remuneration for use of news content. After initial resistance, Google and Facebook both agreed to pay some French media for articles shown in web searches.</p><p>The latest fine is linked to a copyright dispute in France over online content. The case was triggered by complaints in 2019 from some of the country’s biggest news organisations representing French magazines and newspapers, as well as the news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p><p>In 2022, French regulators accepted commitments from Google to negotiate fairly with news organisations.</p><p>Under the agreement, the tech company has to provide news groups with a transparent offer of payment within three months of receiving a copyright complaint.</p><p>The dispute appeared to be resolved in 2022 when Google dropped its appeal against an initial €500m fine issued at the end of an investigation carried out by the French competition watchdog. Google had fought hard against the idea of paying for content and was fined €500m in 2021 for failing to negotiate in good faith.</p><p>In Wednesday’s statement, the watchdog said Google violated the terms of four out of seven commitments agreed in the 2022 settlement, including conducting negotiations with publishers in good faith and providing transparent information.</p><p>The watchdog in particular cited Google’s AI chatbot Bard, launched in 2023, which it said was trained on data from unspecified media outlets and news agencies without the company informing them or the regulator.</p><p>“Subsequently, Google linked the use of the content concerned by its artificial intelligence service to the display of protected content,” the watchdog said, adding that in doing so Google hindered the ability of publishers and press agencies to negotiate fair prices.</p><p>The fine comes as many publishers, writers and newsrooms seek to limit the scraping – or automatic collection of data – by AI services of their online content without their consent or fair compensation.</p><div><p>In a statement, Google said: “Google is the first and only platform to have signed a significant number of licensing agreements with 280 French news publishers under the European copyright directive. These cover more than 450 of their publications – and pay publishers tens of millions of euros a year. Despite this progress, the French competition authority today imposed a €250m fine on Google for how we have conducted those negotiations. They also insisted on changes to how we negotiate, which we have agreed to as part of a settlement of a long-running case.”</p><p>The statement added: “We’ve settled because it’s time to move on and, as our many agreements with publishers show, we want to focus on the larger goal of sustainable approaches to connecting people with quality content and on working constructively with French publishers. But it’s important to note that the fine is not proportionate to issues raised by the French competition authority. It also doesn’t sufficiently take into account the efforts we have made to answer and resolve the concerns raised – in an environment where it’s very hard to set a course because we can’t predict which way the wind will blow next.”</p></div><ul>

<p>Dharmawan Kusna Handoyo spends his workday in a 2-by-3-meter cubicle, soldering batteries. He has been building DIY battery packs since 2009, when he installed one in his own electric bike — but in the past few years, it has become his main source of income. He sells the packs for hundreds of dollars apiece, luring back customers with the promise of a longer-range battery capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I put a lot of attention on how the buyer will use the bike,” Handoyo told <em>Rest of World</em>. “I think carefully about where to place the battery to avoid scratching.”&nbsp;</p>

	</figure>


<p>Handoyo is part of a growing community of battery packers in Indonesia, driven by the frenetic growth of the e-bike market and the complete absence of battery regulations in the country. This has created an opportunity for shops that can cobble together replacement batteries, which often provide more range for less cost. These homemade battery packs come with real concerns over safety and reliability — but for many riders, it’s a risk worth taking.</p>



<p>Electric two-wheelers (known in Southeast Asia as E2Ws) have become more popular&nbsp;in Indonesia since 2023, when the country announced a subsidy of 7 million rupiah ($445) for new bikes built with a certain amount of local parts. A total of 62,000 e-bikes were registered in Indonesia as of September 2023, according to the Ministry of Transportation — nearly three times the registrations in the previous year. The country has not enforced any regulations around batteries manufactured at home or by small businesses, which has led to a thriving market for scrappy replacements. Local Facebook forums are littered with advertisements for local batteries, and a search for “lithium battery for E2W” on Indonesia’s e-commerce giant, Tokopedia, yields more than 700 results.</p>



<p>Hadi Wijaya replaced his bike’s original battery for one made by his friend. He told <em>Rest of World</em> the homemade battery is both cheaper and has a longer range. “I sold the original batteries for around 17 million rupiah ($1,081), then bought a custom-made battery for 13 million rupiah ($827),” said Wijaya. The homemade battery uses lithium polymer cells, and has a range of up to 150 kilometers (1 mile = 1.6 kilometers) in a single charge, whereas the original can only reach 100 kilometers. Wijaya has now teamed up with his friend to sell e-bike batteries. “I can tell you that most people I know who use Gesit [Indonesia’s e-bike brand] no longer use the brand’s original battery,”&nbsp;he said.</p>

		<figcaption> With no regulation on battery manufacturing in Indonesia, there are concerns about the safety and reliability of homemade battery packs.</figcaption>
	</figure>


<p>Manufacturing the batteries is delicate work, starting with the cylindrical battery cells. Packers often use 18650 lithium-ion cells — essentially a larger, rechargeable version of a standard flashlight battery. Cells can be bought directly from component companies like LG, Panasonic, and China’s EVE, and purchased from online marketplaces like Alibaba. There can be as many as 100 cells in a single pack, welded together with nickel strips and connected to the vehicle through a battery management system. Homemade battery packs are also bulkier than branded batteries, wrapped in bright blue heat-shrink tubing instead of the standard polycarbonate case.</p>



<p>Khairul Amin, based in Madura, East Java, has built battery packs since 2016. He aims to sell 10 batteries a month or more. The cheapest batteries in Amin’s shop cost 1.5 million rupiah ($95), but he has sold packs for as much as 35 million rupiah ($2,226) when a customer needed to power an entire car.</p>



<p>Online sellers on Facebook groups typically only state the voltage and amperage of batteries, but more complex factors like the discharge rate of individual cells could cause unexpected problems, according to Agus Purwanto, a chemistry lecturer at Sebelas Maret University. “Every battery has a rating: 1C, 2C, 3C, indicating the discharge rate of the battery,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. If the underlying cells have different discharge rates, it could result in damage to the battery.</p>



<p>Ady Siswanto, owner of e-bike workshop Dyvolt in Jakarta, told <em>Rest of World </em>he<em> </em>takes care to match the internal resistance and capacity of the cells. “If the battery cells’ capacity isn’t uniform, the battery will have issues, like shutting off all of a sudden,” said Siswanto, who learned automotive mechanics at a local polytechnic before launching his battery pack business in 2017. Controls on overcharging and general defects are also serious concerns.</p>



<p>The chaotic nature of Indonesia’s e-bike industry means it’s difficult to find batteries that are officially certified by manufacturers. Complicating the issue further is that each e-bike maker has their own battery size and design, with no standards shared across companies. “There are possibly more than 20 battery sizes in the market right now,” Bowo Kusumo, CEO of Spora EV, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “That’s a big headache.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of Indonesia’s efforts to standardize EV batteries, a consortium of state companies started the Indonesia Battery Corporation in 2021. One of its initiatives is launching its own battery-swap technology using the country’s nickel reserves. Backed by Hyundai and LG, the battery cell factory is geared to <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/business/2023/12/12/ibc-lg-in-talks-on-battery-material-plant-in-batang.html#">start construction</a> this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the flourishing online market of homemade batteries may pose a threat to battery-swap startups. More people making batteries creates demand for used battery cells, which are often scrapped from existing branded batteries that enter the secondary market, or stolen from public swapping stations. Already, prospective buyers are eyeing used batteries on Facebook forums.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These home-based EV packers are a concern to the E2W industry,” Irwan Tjahaja, CEO of Swap Energi Indonesia, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “We need to make sure there is a safety procedure that packers follow — from design, packing to testing … Otherwise, accidents might happen.”&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Random processes take place all around us. It rains one day but not the next; stocks and bonds gain and lose value; traffic jams coalesce and disappear. Because they’re governed by numerous factors that interact with one another in complicated ways, it’s impossible to predict the exact behavior of such systems. Instead, we think about them in terms of probabilities, characterizing outcomes as likely or rare.</p>
<p>Today, the French probability theorist <a href="https://michel.talagrand.net/">Michel Talagrand</a> was awarded the Abel Prize, one of the highest honors in mathematics, for developing a deep and sophisticated understanding of such processes. The prize, presented by the king of Norway, is modeled on the Nobel and comes with 7.5 million Norwegian kroner (about $700,000). When he was told he had won, “my mind went blank,” Talagrand said. “The type of mathematics I do was not fashionable at all when I started. It was considered inferior mathematics. The fact that I was given this award is absolute proof this is not the case.”</p>
<p>Other mathematicians agree. Talagrand’s work “changed the way I view the world,” said <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~naor/">Assaf Naor</a> of Princeton University. Today, added <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/helge.holden">Helge Holden</a>, the chair of the Abel prize committee, “it is becoming very popular to describe and model real-world events by random processes. Talagrand’s toolbox comes up immediately.”</p>
<p>Talagrand views his own life as a chain of unlikely events. He barely passed grade school in Lyon: Though he was interested in science, he didn’t like to study. When he was 5 years old, he lost sight in his right eye after his retina detached; at age 15, he suffered three retinal detachments in his other eye, forcing him to spend a month in the hospital, eyes bandaged, fearing he’d go blind. His father, a mathematics professor, visited him every day, keeping his mind busy by teaching him math. “This is how I learned the power of abstraction,” Talagrand <a href="https://michel.talagrand.net/longbio.pdf">wrote in 2019</a> after winning the Shaw Prize, another major math award that comes with a $1.2 million bounty. (Talagrand is using some of this money, along with his Abel winnings, to found a prize of his own, “recognizing the achievements of young researchers in the areas to which I have devoted my life.”)</p>

<p>He missed half a year of school while he recovered, but he was inspired to start focusing on his studies. He excelled in mathematics, and after graduating from college in 1974, he was hired by the French National Center for Scientific Research, Europe’s largest research institute, where he worked until his retirement in 2017. During that time, he obtained his doctorate; fell in love with his future wife, a statistician, at first sight (he proposed to her three days after meeting her); and gradually developed an interest in probability, publishing hundreds of papers on the topic.</p>
<p>That wasn’t preordained. Talagrand began his career studying high-dimensional geometric spaces. “For 10 years, I had not discovered what I was good at,” he said. But he does not regret this detour. It eventually led him to probability theory, where “I had this other viewpoint … that gave me a way to look at things differently,” he said. It enabled him to examine random processes through the lens of high-dimensional geometry.</p>
<p>“He brings in his geometric intuition to solve purely probabilistic questions,” Naor said.</p>
<p>A random process is a collection of events whose outcomes vary according to chance in a way that can be modeled — like a sequence of coin flips, or the trajectories of atoms in a gas, or daily rainfall totals. Mathematicians want to understand the relationship between individual outcomes and aggregate behavior. How many times do you have to flip a coin to figure out whether it’s fair? Will a river overflow its banks?</p>
<p>Talagrand focused on processes whose outcomes are distributed according to a bell-shaped curve called a Gaussian. Such distributions are common in nature and have a number of desirable mathematical properties. He wanted to know what can be said with certainty about extreme outcomes in these situations. So he proved a set of inequalities that put tight upper and lower bounds on possible outcomes. “To obtain a good inequality is a piece of art,” Holden said. That art is useful: Talagrand’s methods can give an optimal estimate of, say, the highest level a river might rise to in the next 10 years, or the magnitude of the strongest potential earthquake.</p>
<p>When we’re dealing with complex, high-dimensional data, finding such maximum values can be tough.</p>
<p>Say you want to assess the risk of a river flooding — which will depend on factors like rainfall, wind and temperature. You can model the river’s height as a random process. Talagrand spent 15 years developing a technique called generic chaining that allowed him to create a high-dimensional geometric space related to such a random process. His method “gives you a way to read the maximum from the geometry,” Naor said.</p>
<p>The technique is very general and therefore widely applicable. Say you want to analyze a massive, high-dimensional data set that depends on thousands of parameters. To draw a meaningful conclusion, you want to preserve the data set’s most important features while characterizing it in terms of just a few parameters. (For example, this is one way to analyze and compare the complicated structures of different proteins.) Many state-of-the-art methods achieve this simplification by applying a random operation that maps the high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space. Mathematicians can use Talagrand’s generic chaining method to determine the maximal amount of error that this process introduces — allowing them to determine the chances that some important feature isn’t preserved in the simplified data set.</p>
<p>Talagrand’s work wasn’t just limited to analyzing the best and worst possible outcomes of a random process. He also studied what happens in the average case.</p>
<p>In many processes, random individual events can, in aggregate, lead to highly deterministic outcomes. If measurements are independent, then the totals become very predictable, even if each individual event is impossible to predict. For instance, flip a fair coin. You can’t say anything in advance about what will happen. Flip it 10 times, and you’ll get four, five or six heads — close to the expected value of five heads — about 66% of the time. But flip the coin 1,000 times, and you’ll get between 450 and 550 heads 99.7% of the time, a result that’s even more concentrated around the expected value of 500. “It is exceptionally sharp around the mean,” Holden said.</p>
<p>“Even though something has so much randomness, the randomness cancels itself out,” Naor said. “What initially seemed like a horrible mess is actually organized.”</p>
<p>This phenomenon, known as concentration of measure, occurs in much more complicated random processes, too. Talagrand came up with a collection of inequalities that make it possible to quantify that concentration, and proved that it arises in many different contexts. His techniques marked a departure from previous work in the area. Proving the first such inequality, he wrote in his 2019 essay, was “a magical experience.” He was “in a state of constant elation.”</p>
<p>He’s particularly proud of one of his subsequent concentration inequalities. “It’s not easy to get a result which tries to think about the universe and that at the same time has a one-page proof that’s easy to explain,” he said. (He recalls with delight that he once used a cab service whose owner recognized his name, having learned the inequality during a probability class in business school. “That was extraordinary,” he said.)</p>
<p>Like his generic chaining method, Talagrand’s concentration inequalities appear all over mathematics. “It’s amazing how far it goes,” Naor said. “Talagrand inequalities are the screws that hold things together.”</p>
<p>Consider an optimization problem where you have to sort items of different sizes into bins — a model of resource allocation. When you have a lot of items, it’s very difficult to figure out the smallest number of bins you’ll need. But Talagrand’s inequalities can tell you how many bins you’re likely to need if the items’ sizes are random.</p>
<p>Similar methods have been used to prove concentration phenomena in combinatorics, physics, computer science, statistics and other settings.</p>
<p>More recently, Talagrand applied his understanding of random processes to prove an important conjecture about spin glasses, disordered magnetic materials created by random, often conflicting interactions. Talagrand was frustrated that, though spin glasses are mathematically well defined, physicists understood them better than mathematicians. “It was a thorn in our foot,” he said. He proved a result — about the so-called free energy of spin glasses — that provided a foundation for a more mathematical theory.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Talagrand’s research has been marked by “this ability to just step back and find the general principles that are reusable everywhere,” Naor said. “He revisits and revisits, and thinks about something from all kinds of perspectives. And eventually he puts out an insight that becomes a workhorse, that everyone is using.”</p>

<p>“I like to understand simple things very well, because my brain is very slow,” Talagrand said. “So I think about them for a very, very long time.” He’s driven, he said, by the desire to “understand something deeply, in a pure way, which makes the theory much easier. Then the next generation can start from there and make progress on their own terms.”</p>
<p>Over the past decade, he has achieved this by writing textbooks — not just about random processes and spin glasses, but also about an area he doesn’t work in at all, quantum field theory. He had wanted to learn about it, but realized that all the textbooks he could find were written by and for physicists, not mathematicians. So he wrote one himself. “After you can no longer invent things, you can explain them,” he said.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>My test consisted of three commands in a bash pipeline:</p><ol><li><code>echo</code> prints a sequence of ten hex-encoded bytes (<code>0x00</code>, <code>0x01</code>, …).</li><li><code>xxd</code> converts <code>echo</code>’s hex-encoded bytes to binary-encoded bytes.</li><li><code>zig build run</code> compiles and executes my byte counter program, counting the number of binary-encoded bytes that <code>xxd</code> emitted.</li></ol><p>The only difference between <code>zig build run</code> and <code>./zig-out/bin/count-bytes</code> was that the second command runs the already-compiled app, whereas the first one recompiles the app.</p><p>Again, I was dumbfounded.</p><p>How could does an extra compilation step make the program <em>faster</em>? Does a Zig app somehow run quicker when it’s fresh out of the oven?</p><p>At this point, I was stumped. I had read my source code over and over, and I couldn’t understand how compiling and running an application could be faster than running the already-compiled binary.</p><p>Zig is still a new language, so there had to be something about Zig I’d misunderstood. Surely, if experienced Zig programmers looked at my code, they’d spot my error instantly.</p><p>I <a href="https://ziggit.dev/t/zig-build-run-is-10x-faster-than-compiled-binary/3446?u=mtlynch">posted my question on Ziggit</a>, a discussion forum for Zig. The first few responses said I had a problem with “input buffering” but they didn’t have concrete suggestions to fix it or investigate further.</p><p>Andrew Kelly, Zig’s founder and lead developer made <a href="https://ziggit.dev/t/zig-build-run-is-10x-faster-than-compiled-binary/3446/8?u=mtlynch">a surprise appearance in the thread</a>.

Do you still the disparity if you redirect stdin from a file instead of a pipe?

I had to use a buffered reader. Instead of reading a single byte at a time from the OS, I’d use Zig’s built-in <code>std.io.bufferedReader</code>, which causes my application to read large chunks of data from the OS. That way, I only have to make a fraction of the syscalls.</p><p>Here’s the entire change:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>diff --git a/src/main.zig b/src/main.zig

Instead of the memory allocator requesting memory from the OS, you provide the allocator a fixed buffer of bytes, and it uses only those bytes to allocate memory.</p><p>I can cheat my benchmarks by compiling a version of my Ethereum interpreter that’s limited to 2 KB of memory allocated from the stack:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="diff"><span><span><span>diff --git a/src/main.zig b/src/main.zig
