    </div><p>Researchers at The Park Center for Mental Health, Australia, have added to the growing body of evidence that cat ownership is a major risk factor for schizophrenia and quantified the risk at more than double.</p>

                                        
                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                    <p>In a paper, "Cat Ownership and Schizophrenia-Related Disorders and Psychotic-Like Experiences: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis," <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/schbul/sbad168/7458104?redirectedFrom=fulltext">published</a> in <i>Schizophrenia Bulletin</i>, the team details the connections between youth cat ownership and later-in-life schizophrenia-related diagnosis.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted an extensive study search across various databases and gray literature from January 1, 1980, to May 30, 2023, without geographical or language limitations. They included studies reporting original data on cat ownership and schizophrenia-related outcomes. Out of 1,915 identified studies, 17 were used from 11 different countries.</p>
<p>Cat ownership was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia-related disorders. The unadjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) was 2.35, and the adjusted estimate was 2.24, indicating an over twofold increase in the odds of developing schizophrenia-related disorders among all individuals exposed to cats.</p>
<p>While some studies suggest childhood exposure to cats might be associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia-related disorders, the exact age or specific time frame of exposure is not clearly defined across all studies.</p>
<p>One included study from Finland initially reported higher scores on perceptual aberration, schizoid, and social anhedonia scales for those exposed to cats under age seven, though they limited their conclusion to perceptual aberration. Another study from the UK found associations between cat exposure during childhood (at 4 and 10 years) and higher psychotic-like experiences at age 13.</p>
<p>The research suggests that the critical window of exposure needs to be better defined and might be influenced by various factors. More robust investigations are needed to precisely identify the specific period of exposure that might pose the highest risk for schizophrenia-related disorders associated with youth cat exposure.</p>
<p>The overall risk trend focuses on the interaction between the developing brain and feline exposure. But of course, it is not just hanging out with cat personalities that is to blame for the higher risk. There is a causal agent operating unseen in the cat environment that is likely the true culprit—Toxoplasma gondii.</p>

                                                                                                        <!-- Google middle Adsense block -->
    
                                                                                                                                            <h2>Toxoplasmosis</h2>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, an infection that around 25% of the world population has gotten at some point.</p>
<p>It is the reason kitty litter bags have a warning label for pregnant women to avoid contact with cat feces, as toxoplasmosis infection is the leading cause of newborn blindness globally, as well as later vision loss, mental disability, and seizures.</p>
<p>Toxoplasmosis can be a significant cause of death among people with severely weakened immune systems. A daily drug is taken by patients with AIDS, undergoing organ transplant, or with intense chemotherapy treatments just to counter the effects of this one parasite.</p>
<p>T. gondii has previously been linked with all sorts of neurological impairments and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/behavioral+changes/" rel="tag">behavioral changes</a>, from guilt issues to novelty seeking and increased car accidents. Some presentations of schizophrenia can be reversed by antiprotozoal drugs, suggesting that a T. gondii infection may have been the root cause of those case symptoms.</p>
<p>A 2012 <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meta-analysis/" rel="tag">meta-analysis</a> of 38 studies, "Toxoplasma gondii and Other Risk Factors for Schizophrenia," also <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/38/3/642/1867672">published</a> in <i>Schizophrenia Bulletin</i>, found that patients with schizophrenia were nearly three times more likely to have toxoplasma antibodies in their blood, suggesting past infections were far more prevalent with the pathology.</p>
<p>A striking find in that study, while comparing risk factors for schizophrenia, was the discrepancy between the risk associated with having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia (RR 6.99–9.31) and the risk associated with specific genetic polymorphisms (OR 1.09–1.24). While a family disease pattern can suggest the involvement of shared genes, it can also point to nongenetic factors like environmental exposure to an infectious agent, like a chemical superfund site, or cats.</p>
<p>Toxoplasmosis has also been linked to various wildlife illnesses, as behavioral changes in <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/wild+animals/" rel="tag">wild animals</a> often result in poor survival strategies. Rats, for example, become unafraid of cats while infected. It is a common comorbidity for most California sea lions found distressed or dead to have a toxoplasma infection. If anyone is wondering how a sea lion has contact with a cat, try to see a sandy beach from a cat's perspective. That and the human habit of flushing cat litter have created a massive problem for marine mammals.</p>

                                                                                                                                            <h2>Why cats?</h2>
<p>The connection to cats has to do with T. gondii's affinity for reproducing only in domestic cats. This affinity may be related to the lack of a single enzyme in feline guts, delta-6-desaturase.</p>
<p>While any mammal can become infected by the parasite, the digestive enzyme delta-6-desaturase prevents the parasite from getting high enough levels of linoleic acid the parasite requires to fuel reproduction.</p>
<p>Unlike all other mammals, cats are full of linoleic acid due to not producing the data-6-desaturase enzyme that would convert linoleic acid to oleic acid. So, the parasite only reproduces in cat intestines.</p>
<p>Cats then shed oocytes (protozoan parasite eggs) by the millions when they defecate, trapping them on fur and paw used to dutifully cover up their deposit, tracking them wherever a cat's paw may wander.</p>
<p>With the parasite completing its lifecycle, it may not affect the rest of cat biology. In humans and other animals, the failure to turn into the larger reproductive form allows the tiny parasite to migrate past the blood-brain barrier, where the disruption occurs.</p>
<p>The missing enzyme and the independent social lives of outdoor cats, mingling in shared sandboxes and loose garden soils around the world, make cat contact the primary vector for the infection. The secondary vector would be anything that has been in contact with a cat, such as a kitchen counter or any surface a cat has walked on or rubbed against.</p>
<p>While social media has clearly made the case that society would crumble without cats, it is important for all cat owners never to allow their cats outdoors to prevent the continued spread of the T. gondii parasite.</p>
<p>It is even more important that parents, with or without cats, understand the danger cat-borne <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/parasites/" rel="tag">parasites</a> can pose to the long-term <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health/" rel="tag">mental health</a> of their children.</p>

<p>Microsoft's OpenAI headaches might not be going away following reports that now the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is considering an investigation into the Windows giant's investment in the company.</p>
<p>At question, should the FTC opt to open a formal examination, is whether any antitrust rules have been broken. Despite the money poured into it over the years, OpenAI <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/our-structure">was founded as a non-profit</a> in 2015, and Microsoft's investment does not amount to control of the company.</p>
<p>Microsoft chief communications officer Frank X Shaw underlined attempts to dampen down industry talk of a probe: "While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions."</p>

    

<p><i>The Register</i> contacted the FTC for its view on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-08/ftc-makes-preliminary-antitrust-queries-into-microsoft-openai?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reports</a> and will update should we receive a response.</p>

        


        

<p>Microsoft has invested upwards of $10 billion in OpenAI to fund the computing power needed to train AI models. To see a return, Microsoft is shoehorning ChatGPT into every corner of its portfolio. However, the recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/21/microsoft_openai_altman_nadella/">departure and subsequent return</a> of OpenAI boss Sam Altman rattled execs in Microsoft HQ.</p>
<p>As such, the Windows vendor parachuted a non-voting observer into OpenAI's board.</p>

</ul>
<p>At the end of last week, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/microsofts_relationship_with_openai_now/">launched</a> a consultation to ask interested parties to comment on Microsoft's relationship with ChatGPT developer, and if it could be construed as a merger that potentially skews competition.</p>
<p>If so, the CMA will itself launch an official inspection.</p>

        

<p>The FTC has already begun <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/13/ftc_openai_investigation/">investigating</a> OpenAI's ChatGPT over privacy and reputational concerns. It is also no stranger to Microsoft. Despite the company's $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard seemingly going ahead in October, the FTC has continued its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2210077-microsoftactivision-blizzard-matter">attempts</a> to undo the merger.</p>
<p>In October, the UK's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/13/cma_criticizes_microsoft_as_it/">CMA gave Microsoft's $69 billion buy of Activision Blizzard the green light</a> but criticized the tactics employed by Microsoft to push through the deal.</p>
<p>"Businesses and their advisors should be in no doubt that the tactics employed by Microsoft are no way to engage with the CMA," said the regulator's CEO, Sarah Cardell. ®</p>

            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>Earlier this week, both the House Committee on the Judiciary (HJC) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) marked up two very different bills (</span><a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/RCP_6570_xml.pdf"><span>H.R. 6570</span></a><span> - Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act in HJC, and HR 6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 in HPSCI), both of which would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)—but in very different ways. Both bills head to the House floor next week under a procedural rule called “</span><a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS20313.html"><span>Queen of the Hill</span></a><span>,” where the bill with the most votes gets sent to the Senate for consideration.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>While renewing any surveillance authority remains a complicated and complex issue, this choice is clear - we urge all Members to vote NO on the Intelligence Committee’s bill, </b><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20231207/116666/BILLS-118pih-ReformandreauthorizeauthoritiesoftheForeignIntelligenceSurveillanceActof1978.pdf"><b>H.R.6611, the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023</b></a><b>.</b></p>

<p><span>TELL congress: Defeat this bad 702 Bill<br></span></p>
<p><span>On Nov. 16, HPSCI </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/intelligence-committees-proposals-702-reauthorization-bill-are-beyond-bad"><span>released a report </span></a><span>calling for reauthorization of Section 702 with essentially superficial reforms. The bill that followed, H.R. 6611, was as bad as expected. It would renew the mass surveillance authority Section 702 for another eight years. It would create new authorities that the intelligence community has sought for years, but that have been denied by the courts. It would continue the indiscriminate collection of U.S. persons’ communications when they talk with people abroad for use by domestic law enforcement. This was not the intention of this national security program, and people on U.S. soil should not have their communications collected without a warrant because of a loophole.</span></p>
<p><span>As a reminder, Section 702 was designed to allow the government to warrantlessly surveil non-U.S. citizens abroad for foreign intelligence purposes. Increasingly, it’s this U.S. side of digital conversations that domestic law enforcement agencies trawl through—all without a warrant. FBI agents have been using the Section 702 databases to conduct millions of invasive searches for Americans’ communications, including those of </span><a href="https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/e9e72454-4156-49b9-961a-855706216063/2023%20PCLOB%20702%20Report%20(002).pdf#page=157"><span>protesters</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/e9e72454-4156-49b9-961a-855706216063/2023%20PCLOB%20702%20Report%20(002).pdf#page=157"><span>racial justice activists</span></a><span>, 19,000 </span><a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/21/2021_FISC_Certification_Opinion.pdf#page=29"><span>donors</span></a><span> to a congressional campaign, </span><a href="https://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/22nd_Joint_Assessment_of_FISA_702_Compliance_CLEARED_REDACTED_FOR_PUBLIC_RELEASE.pdf#page=60"><span>journalists</span></a><span>, and even </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/21/fbi-improper-search-senator-court"><span>members of Congress</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, the HPSCI bill authorizes the use of this </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/deja-vu-fbi-proves-again-it-cant-be-trusted-section-702"><span>unaccountable and out-of-control</span></a><span> mass surveillance program as a new way of vetting asylum seekers by sifting through their digital communications. According to </span><a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/2023/FISC_2023_FISA_702_Certifications_Opinion_April11_2023.pdf"><span>a newly released Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) opinion</span></a><span>, the government has sought some version of this authority for years, but was repeatedly denied it, only receiving court approval for the first time this year. Because the court opinion is so heavily redacted, it is impossible to know the current scope of immigration- and visa-related querying, or what broader proposal the intelligence agencies originally sought.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This new authority proposes to give immigration services the ability to audit entire communication histories before deciding whether an immigrant can enter the country. This is a particularly problematic situation that could cost someone entrance to the United States based on, for instance, their own or a friend’s political opinions—as happened to a </span><a href="https://time.com/5663283/harvard-student-visa-ismail-ajjawi-lebanon/"><span>Palestinian Harvard student</span></a><span> when his social media account was reviewed when coming to the U.S. to start his semester.</span></p>
<p><span>The HPSCI bill also includes a call “to define Electronic Communication Service Provider to include equipment.” Earlier this year, the FISA Court of Review released a </span><a href="https://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/2023_FISC-R_ECSP_Opinion.pdf"><span>highly redacted opinion</span></a><span> documenting a fight over the government's attempt to subject an unknown company to Section 702 surveillance. However, the court agreed that under the circumstances the company did not qualify as an "electronic communication service provider" under the law. Now, the HPSCI bill would expand that definition to include a much broader range of providers, including those who merely provide hardware through which people communicate on the Internet. Even without knowing the details of the secret court fight, this represents an ominous expansion of 702's scope, which the committee introduced without any explanation or debate of its necessity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By contrast, the House Judiciary Committee bill, H.R. 6570, the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act, would actually address a major problem with Section 702 by banning warrantless backdoor searches of Section 702 databases for Americans’ communications. This bill would also prohibit law enforcement from purchasing Americans’ data that they would otherwise need a warrant to obtain, a practice that circumvents core constitutional protections. Importantly, this bill would also renew this authority for only three more years, giving Congress another opportunity to revisit how the reforms are implemented and to make further changes if the government is still abusing the program.</span></p>
<p><span>EFF has long fought for significant changes to Section 702. By the government’s own numbers, violations are still occurring at a rate of more than </span><a href="https://www.intelligence.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/2023/FISC_2023_FISA_702_Certifications_Opinion_April11_2023.pdf#page=85"><span>4,000 per year</span></a><span>. Our government, with the FBI in the lead, has come to treat Section 702—enacted by Congress for the surveillance of foreigners on foreign soil —as a domestic surveillance program of Americans. This simply cannot be allowed to continue. While we will continue to push for further reforms to Section 702, we urge all members to reject the HPSCI bill.</span></p>

Typically, there is a division between licensing and product divisions. When a company uses patent licensing, usually there will be some patents that protect products they produce while a licensing arm will license patents to noncompetitive products. A few rare companies like ARM have a </span><a href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/arm-the-biggest-ipo-of-the-year-is" rel="">business model</a><span> entirely organized around patenting, which produces profit margins that exceed those of software companies—truly epic. This is separate, of course, from non-practicing entities, also known as NPEs or patent trolls, that purchase patents for the purposes of suing other companies—true licensing companies like ARM develop their own IP through R&amp;D.</span></p><p><span>Qualcomm does not respect this dichotomy. Qualcomm is a very active firm with over 24,000 active patent families and a patent portfolio of 140,000 global patents.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-136758509" href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/the-secret-behind-qualcomms-margins#footnote-1-136758509" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> In fact, their San Diego headquarters has a wall of some of their most famous patents. They are patenting every day, from 5G and 6G modems, where they </span><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/12/why-qualcomm-is-the-true-leader-in-5g" rel="">claim</a><span> to have the most license agreements of any company, to </span><a href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/drafting-patents-for-ai-tips-for" rel="">AI applications</a><span>. Unlike most companies, Qualcomm will not just sell you a chip. Qualcomm incorporated its patent licensing business alongside its chip business. In other words, to even purchase a Snapdragon, you have to agree to a patent license. This means that Qualcomm is able to double-dip where most companies divide their revenue streams. Because of this, they </span><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2022/08/how-qualcomm-is-helping-to-foster-a-more-inclusive-patent-ecosys" rel="">call</a><span> themselves a “champion” of patent rights and engage actively with the patent community. These businesses are divided between QTL, or Qualcomm Technology Licensing, and QCT, or Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, which actually makes chips.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-136758509" href="https://blog.withedge.com/p/the-secret-behind-qualcomms-margins#footnote-2-136758509" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span></p><p><span>The financial impact, as told on their annual </span><a href="https://investor.qualcomm.com/financial-information/sec-filings/content/0000804328-23-000055/0000804328-23-000055.pdf" rel="">10-K filing</a><span>, is staggering. In 2023, QTL brought in $5.3 billion in revenue but $3.6 billion in profits, a 68% margin. While this is only 15.9% of revenue, it is a staggering 49.3% of Qualcomm’s entire net income. Although in 2023 Qualcomm’s margins were hit, generally they achieve a profit margin exceeding 29%, which is far above the </span><a href="https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html" rel="">industry average</a><span> of 22.74%. In an industry that is ruthlessly competitive, this is an impressive achievement and has been recognized by investors on Wall Street.</span></p><p><span>These licenses are very expensive. First, Qualcomm does not negotiate on a product-by-product basis, which makes sense in a market with millions of SKUs. Instead, they </span><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/the-devil-is-in-the-detail-the-qualcomm-take-on-patent-licensing-iam.pdf" rel="">negotiate product definitions</a><span> and take a cut of every product that meets that definition—so for example, Apple would not pay a license for each individual iPhone but rather would pay across all iPhone models. QTL extracts a license for its Standard Essential Patents even when the companies do not use any QCT products. They are not afraid to litigate patent infringement and even brought </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/04/qualcomm-and-apple-agree-to-drop-all-litigation/" rel="">Apple to their heels</a><span> after two years of bitter fighting, worth a reported $4.5 billion in the first year. </span></p><p>More astoundingly, the license is taken as a percentage of the value of the licensed product, regardless of the percentage of value that the chips, primarily modems, represent. This is incredibly aggressive. Even ARM has not accomplished that feat. But then, ARM has to contend with open-source competitors like RISC-V, while Qualcomm’s lead is so vast that no one has been able to replace them. Primarily, this is because the testing requirements are so severe: to properly test a modem, one must use it all over the world with cell towers from dozens of cell phone carriers. It is a complex task that takes years and billions of dollars. </p><p><span>Qualcomm’s tactics have attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission and faced monopoly accusations. Qualcomm actually faced an antitrust lawsuit, </span><em>Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm</em><span>, where it lost the case at the district court level (though it was reversed unanimously by the Ninth Circuit). There have been other notable and related cases over the years, most notably </span><em>Continental Automotive v. Avanci</em><span>, which was quite controversial and finally put to bed in 2022 while still leave many Standard Essential Patent questions unanswered. Some observers </span><a href="https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/alerts/2019/06/continental-v-avanci--wireless-sep-licensing-presents-challenges-to-automotive-industry" rel="">noted</a><span> that the </span><em>Continental</em><span> case echoed </span><em>Qualcomm</em><span>, but unlike in </span><em>Continental</em><span>, Qualcomm does not try to get around its obligations as a Standard Essential Patent holder by refusing to license to suppliers. </span></p><p>Qualcomm’s licensing business is best-in-class and an example many companies can learn from. There is a lesson in how truly essential companies can use intellectual property to boost their business. But the use of the Qualcomm patents also shows the requirements: any company that attempts the same strategy must be prepare for ample litigation and be so technologically ahead that no one can catch it.</p><ul><li><p><span>In an attempt to cut pharma prices, the Biden administration threw its support behind aggressive “march-in rights” for the National Institutes of Health (</span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/06/drug-prices-march-in-rights-white-house-pharma-patents/" rel="">Stat News</a><span>)</span></p></li><li><p><span>An analysis of how the famous laser patents would have held up in light of the recent </span><em>Amgen</em><span> decision; a very interesting example of legal alternate history (</span><a href="https://ipwatchdog.com/2023/12/03/laser-lessons-supreme-court-undermined-pioneering-laser-patents/id=170134/" rel="">IP Watchdog</a><span>) </span></p></li><li><p><span>A new CRISPR patent fight might be brewing with the advent of a new treatment by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (</span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084152/the-first-crispr-cure-might-kickstart-the-next-big-patent-battle/" rel="">MIT Tech Review</a><span>)</span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/22-1906.OPINION.12-4-2023_2231550.pdf" rel="">VLSI Technology v.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Every SQL statement is limited to return a single, possibly denormalized, table. This design decision has far reaching consequences. (1.) for databases users in terms of slow query performance, long query result transfer times, usability-issues of SQL in web applications and object-relational mappers. In addition, (2.) for database architects it has consequences when designing query optimizers leading to logical (algebraic) join enumeration effort, memory consumption for intermediate result materialization, and physical operator selection effort. So basically, the entire query optimization stack is shaped by that design decision. In this paper, we argue that the single-table limitation should be dropped. We extend the SELECT-clause of SQL by a keyword 'RESULTDB' to support returning a result database. Our approach has clear semantics, i.e. our extended SQL returns subsets of all tables with only those tuples that would be part of the traditional (single-table) query result set, however without performing any denormalization through joins. Our SQL-extension is downward compatible. Moreover, we discuss the surprisingly long list of benefits of our approach. First, for database users: far simpler and more readable application code, better query performance, smaller query results, better query result transfer times. Second, for database architects, we present how to leverage existing closed source systems as well as change open source database systems to support our feature. We propose a couple of algorithms to integrate our feature into both closed-source as well as open source database systems. We present an initial experimental study with promising results.

<p>Yesterday the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously approved the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116666/documents/BILLS-118pih-ReformandreauthorizeauthoritiesoftheForeignIntelligenceSurveillanceActof1978.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023</a> (FRRA), which would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA 702).&nbsp;The full House is expected to vote on this bill next Tuesday.&nbsp;Like other competing reauthorization bills that have been introduced (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/congress-government-surveillance-ecpa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116659/documents/BILLS-118HRih-U1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>), the FRRA would impose new restrictions on the government’s access to and use of information about U.S. persons that has been incidentally acquired pursuant to FISA 702, a provision that permits the government to conduct warrantless surveillance of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the FRRA is ostensibly a reform bill, it contains one notable provision that would&nbsp;<strong>significantly expand</strong>&nbsp;the government’s authority under FISA 702 by broadening the definition of “electronic communication service providers” (ECSPs) whom the government may compel to assist in FISA 702 surveillance.&nbsp;The statutory definition of ECSP currently covers:</p>



<p>(1) a telecommunications carrier;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(2) a provider of an electronic communication service or a remote computing service, as defined in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act;&nbsp;</p>



<p>(3) “<strong>any other communication service provider who has access to wire or electronic communications either as such communications are transmitted or as such communications are stored</strong>”; and&nbsp;</p>



<p>(4) an officer, employee, or agent of any such entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Section 504 of the FRRA would broaden the “catch all” definition in (3) above to cover:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<strong>any service provider&nbsp;</strong>who has access to wire or electronic communications either as such communications are transmitted or as such communications are stored&nbsp;<strong>or equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store such communications</strong>.”</p>



<p>Section 504 would also expand the definition in (4) above to include not only an officer, employee, or agent of an ECSP, but also any “<strong>custodian</strong>” of such an entity.</p>



<p>These changes would vastly widen the scope of businesses, entities, and their affiliates who are eligible to be compelled to assist 702 surveillance.&nbsp;By including any “service provider”—rather than any “other&nbsp;<strong>communication</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>service provider”—that has access not just to communications, but also to the “equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store . . . communications,” the expanded definition would appear to cover data centers, colocation providers, business landlords, shared workspaces, or even hotels where guests connect to the Internet. And the addition of the term “custodian” in (4) above could be understood to sweep in any third party involved in providing equipment, storage, or even cleaning services to such entities.</p>



<p>The FRRA’s new definition of ECSP would effectively overrule recent decisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zwillgen.com/privacy/fisc-and-fisc-r-decisions-section-702-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interpreted the current “catch all” definition much more narrowly</a>, seemingly to exclude those communication service providers who merely have access to equipment on which communications are transmitted or stored.&nbsp;The expanded definition would also effectively restore the broad assistance provision of Section 702’s predecessor, the Protect America Act, which Congress specifically rejected when it originally enacted Section 702 as part of the FISA Amendments Act.&nbsp;The new definition, when combined with NSA’s ability to conduct “upstream collection,” could give the government warrantless access to any communication system in America through which any one-side-foreign communication could be found.</p>



<p>If the FRRA is enacted in its current form, the broadened definition of ECSP could put U.S. companies that offer co-location computer storage and commercial landlords at a competitive disadvantage to foreign service providers and property owners given the possibility that customer or tenant communications could be obtained from them.</p>

		<p>This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the central ideas that underpin deep learning. It is intended both for newcomers to machine learning and for those already experienced in the field. Covering key concepts relating to contemporary architectures and techniques, this essential book equips readers with a robust foundation for potential future specialization. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid evolution, and therefore this book focusses on ideas that are likely to endure the test of time.</p>

		<p>The book is organized into numerous bite-sized chapters, each exploring a distinct topic, and the narrative follows a linear progression, with each chapter building upon content from its predecessors. This structure is well-suited to teaching a two-semester undergraduate or postgraduate machine learning course, while remaining equally relevant to those engaged in active research or in self-study.</p>

		<p>A full understanding of machine learning requires some mathematical background and so the book includes a self-contained introduction to probability theory. However, the focus of the book is on conveying a clear understanding of ideas, with emphasis on the real-world practical value of techniques rather than on abstract theory. Complex concepts are therefore presented from multiple complementary perspectives including textual descriptions, diagrams, mathematical formulae, and pseudo-code.</p>

		<p><i>Chris Bishop wrote a terrific textbook on neural networks in 1995 and has a deep knowledge of the field and its core ideas. His many years of experience in explaining neural networks have made him extremely skilful at presenting complicated ideas in the simplest possible way and it is a delight to see these skills applied to the revolutionary new developments in the field.</i></p>

		<p><strong>- Geoffrey Hinton</strong></p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><i>With the recent explosion of deep learning and Al as a research topic, and the quickly growing importance of Al applications, a modern textbook on the topic was badly needed. The "New Bishop" masterfully fills the gap, covering algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning, along with modern deep learning architecture families, as well as how to apply all of this to various application areas.</i></p>

		<p><strong>- Yann LeCun</strong></p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><i>This excellent and very educational book will bring the reader up to date with the main concepts and advances in deep learning with a solid anchoring in probability. These concepts are powering current industrial Al systems and are likely to form the basis of further advances towards artificial general intelligence.</i></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.cerebras.net/blog/introducing-gigagpt-gpt-3-sized-models-in-565-lines-of-code">https://www.cerebras.net/blog/introducing-gigagpt-gpt-3-sized-models-in-565-lines-of-code</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38603207">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GigaGPT is Cerebras’ implementation of Andrei Karpathy’s nanoGPT – the simplest and most compact code base to train and fine-tune GPT models. Whereas nanoGPT can train models in the 100M parameter range, gigaGPT trains models well over 100B parameters. We do this without introducing additional code or relying on third party frameworks – the entire <a href="https://github.com/Cerebras/gigaGPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo</a> is just 565 lines of code. Instead gigaGPT utilizes the large memory and compute capacity of Cerebras hardware to enable large scale training on vanilla torch.nn code. With no modifications, gigaGPT supports long context lengths and works with a variety of optimizers.</p>
<h3>Why gigaGPT</h3>
<p>While the transformer architecture is simple, training a large transformer on a large number of GPUs is hard. Beyond a few billion parameters, vanilla GPT models run out of memory on even the latest GPUs. Training larger models requires breaking up models into smaller pieces, distributing them to multiple GPUs, coordinating the workload among the workers, and assembling the results. This is typically done via LLM scaling frameworks such as Megatron, DeepSpeed, NeoX, Fairscale, and Mosaic Foundry. Though powerful, these frameworks introduce significant complexity.</p>
</div><div><p>A small model such as nanoGPT requires just 639 lines of code to implement. To implement a 20B parameter model using Nvidia Megatron model requires 20,507 lines of code – a 32x increase in complexity. Even though this code doesn’t need to be written from scratch, implementing, debugging, and maintaining such a project is a major undertaking. Many ML teams struggle to get these frameworks to work and few manage to converge models with decent utilization. gigaGPT shows that on Cerebras hardware you can have the best of both worlds – a compact, hackable codebase and the ability to train GPT-3 sized models with long context.</p>
<h3>The Models</h3>
</div><div><p>gigaGPT implements the basic GPT-2 architecture in a way that matches nanoGPT. In particular, we use learned position embeddings, standard attention, and biases throughout the model. These choices were made primarily to stick closely to nanoGPT and can easily be changed. We validate gigaGPT by training four models with 111M, 13B, 70B, and 175B parameters. All the models tested use the OpenWebText dataset using the GPT-2 tokenizer with preprocessing code taken from nanoGPT. As the goal of this project was to create a clean, performant, and usable code base for others to use rather than to train state of the art models ourselves, our validation was geared towards functional correctness rather than convergence, downstream performance, or other similar metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only GPT model that scales from millions to hundreds of billions of parameters without specialized parallelization techniques.</p>
<h3>gigaGPT-111M</h3>
</div><p>The 111M config was inspired by Cerebras-GPT. It uses the same model dimensions, learning rate, batch size, and training schedule and differ from Cerebras-GPT primarily in their dataset. The loss trend looks good and roughly matches what we observed for the corresponding Cerebras-GPT configuration despite the different choice of dataset. While we were writing gigaGPT, we performed thorough side-by-side numerical checks against a trusted reference code base, so seeing this loss trend isn’t surprising, but it’s always nice to get the confirmation of a converged model.</p><p>As with the 111M configuration, the 13B configuration also closely matches the model of that size from Cerebras-GPT in model dimensions, learning rate, batch size, and training schedule. Over the first hundred steps we see a few minor loss spikes, but nothing the model can’t recover from. A 13B model training run takes a substantial amount of compute so we stop after about 100 training steps. At this point we’re well past the scale that nanoGPT can accommodate, but gigaGPT handles it without a problem.</p><div><p>The 70B configuration is loosely inspired by Llama-2 70B. It takes its model dimensions and from that work and trains for the same 2T parameters as Llama-2 70B with a similar batch size. The learning rate used is slightly more conservative, as previous groups have noticed more instabilities when using learned position embeddings compared to RoPE . Since our goal wasn’t to converge the model, we didn’t perform rigorous hyperparameter selection. Even so, loss appears to be decreasingly steadily and training is fairly stable. At 70B gigaGPT continues to show great performance and scaling. Even though we grew the model size by two orders of magnitude, and made no effort to optimize for throughput, utilization remains equal or better than previous runs; we just wrote it, ran it, and immediately saw fast results. This model code is also trivial to scale out despite having been written as a single monolithic model – gigaGPT-70B works from 1 to 64 systems such as the Condor Galaxy 1 by just editing a single flag in the configuration file.</p>
<h3>gigaGPT-175B</h3>
<p>After validating the 70B model, we were curious to further probe the limits of model scale that gigaGPT could accommodate. We changed the model dimensions of the 70B config to match what was reported in the original GPT-3 paper, scaled the learning rate and initialization using common heuristics, and launched a run. The few steps we trained weren’t of much interest from a convergence perspective, but the model ran without any issues at the same utilization as the 70B model. What’s most notable here for ML practitioners is that going large does not cause Cerebras hardware to run out of memory. Based on the results we believe gigaGPT can scale to models in excess of 1 trillion parameters.</p>
<h3>How gigaGPT Works</h3>
<p>The gigaGPT model does not use any sharding or pipelining techniques because it fits entirely into the system memory of Cerebras hardware. To briefly recap: Cerebras Wafer Scale Clusters are comprised of 1 to 192 Cerebras CS-2 systems supported by accompanying CPU server nodes that store parameters (MemoryX), data and an interconnect (SwarmX). Unlike GPU based clusters, compute and memory are de-coupled. The entire model – upward of trillions of parameters – is stored in a dedicated MemoryX appliance. The model weights are streamed to the wafer one layer at a time during training. By storing models in large, unified memory systems, we obviate the need to break models apart using complex frameworks. All model training from 1 to 192 systems is done using standard mini batches aka data parallelism.</p>
<p>gigaGPT is comprised mainly of model.py and train.py. Looking more closely at the model code, we see that it looks quite similar to concise GPT implementations written for GPUs. It is built from `torch.nn` components without use of any fancy external libraries like xFormers or DeepSpeed. In fact, the model code is quite boring. Compared to nanoGPT, we rewrote the attention layer to use primitive torch ops instead of fused attention algorithms and to expose the attention mask as an argument to the attention layer to increase flexibility. Other than that, the differences compared to nanoGPT are mainly cosmetic.</p>
<p>Likewise, the main training loop is also very simple. It utilizes `cerebras_pytorch` (a custom PyTorch wrapper specialized for CS System execution) as a drop-in replacement for calls to standard torch APIs. There are only a couple of parts of this file that will look new to someone who is already familiar with PyTorch, in particular the use of a few decorators to section off different sections of functionality as well as the use of a `cerebras_pytorch.backend` scope for model creation. Overall the code is easy to understand, familiar looking to PyTorch users, and easy to modify and customize.</p>
<p>Training a large model across a huge cluster requires careful orchestration of multiple independent jobs running across heterogeneous hardware, on its face a very daunting challenge. The `cerebras_pytorch` package is the solution to this problem and is the crux of what allows the gigaGPT code to be so simple. `cerebras_pytorch` wraps some PyTorch functionality that users will already be familiar with and adds a small number of new APIs that help simplify the distributed computing needs of the problem. In this section we will walk through the code of gigaGPT’s `train.py` to better illuminate these APIs.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the end of the `main` function which contains the high-level logic for the training loop and work backwards through the definitions of each of the components it uses.</p>
<pre>for step, batch in enumerate(executor, start=global_step + 1):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if step &gt; config.num_steps:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss = training_step(batch)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; log_loss(loss, step)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save_checkpoint(step)</pre>
<p>This is a simple starting point, so we don’t need to spend too much time here. Let’s first take a closer look at the `executor` used above.</p>
<pre>    dataloader = cstorch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        get_dataloader,
        data_path,
        config.sequence_length,
        config.batch_size,
        config.seed,
    )
    executor = cstorch.utils.data.DataExecutor(
        dataloader,
        num_steps=config.num_steps - global_step,
        checkpoint_steps=config.checkpoint_steps,
        cs_config=cs_config,
        writer=writer,
    )</pre>
<p>For Cerebras system runs, there are dedicated CPU nodes that handle loading data and feeding it into the model. `cstorch.utils.data.DataLoader` handles the job of defining the dataloader instance that will run on each of these worker nodes. It takes a function that returns a dataloader instance for ease of setting up independent properly sharded dataloaders on each worker node. This `cstorch.utils.data.DataLoader` object is then fed into a `DataExecutor`, which is responsible for the top-level coordination of all the different independent tasks required for the run.</p>
<p>Next, let’s look more closely at the components involved in defining a single training step. Internally, `cerebras_pytorch` uses PyTorch LTC to trace the compute graph associated with the training job and maps this compute graph down to operations that can be run on the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE). Accordingly, the first step towards defining the training logic is to create the model instance in a way that enables it to be traced later. This is accomplished by the following code at the top of `train.py::main`:</p>
<pre>    backend = cstorch.backend(config.backend, use_cs_grad_accum=True)
    …

    with backend.device:
        model = GPTModel(model_config)

    compiled_model = cstorch.compile(model, backend)
</pre>
<p>With this model definition along with an optimizer and learning rate scheduler that are created with APIs that directly mirror PyTorch APIs, we are now ready to define the logic of a basic training step.</p>
<pre>    @cstorch.trace
    def training_step(batch):
        input_ids, labels = batch
        loss = compiled_model(input_ids, labels)
        loss.backward()
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(list(all_params), config.max_gradient_norm)
        optimizer.step()
        lr_scheduler.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        return loss
</pre>
<p>The body of this function is fairly standard training code. The only interesting part is the `@cstorch.trace` decorator. This signals to the framework that the code in the function is intended to be traced and run on CS system. No tensors can be eagerly executed within this scope, which means the code in here can’t include any logging functionality or python conditionals. For that, we need a different decorator:</p>
<pre>    @cstorch.step_closure
    def log_loss(loss, step):
        rate = executor.profiler.rate()
        global_rate = executor.profiler.global_rate()

        logger.info(
            f"| Step={step}, "
            f"Loss={loss.item():.5f}, "
            f"Rate={rate:.2f} samples/sec, "
            f"GlobalRate={global_rate:.2f} samples/sec"
        )
        writer.add_scalar("loss", loss.item(), step)
        writer.add_scalar("samples_per_second", global_rate, step)
</pre>
<p>This logging code requires eagerly executing tensor values and doesn’t need to run on the WSE, so we wrap it in a `@cstorch.trace decorator`. Checkpointing code works similarly, except that we want to make sure that it only runs every `checkpoint_steps` steps for whatever value of `checkpoint_steps` we pass into the `DataExecutor` above. For this we have the `@cstorch.checkpoint_closure` decorator. Functions wrapped in this decorator can be called at any time but will only execute if the current step is a checkpoint step.</p>
<pre>@cstorch.checkpoint_closure
    def save_checkpoint(step):
        checkpoint_path = out_dir.joinpath(f"checkpoint_{step}.mdl")
        state_dict = {
            "model": model.state_dict(),
            "optimizer": optimizer.state_dict(),
            "lr_scheduler": lr_scheduler.state_dict(),
            "global_step": step,
            "model_config": asdict(model_config),
        }
        cstorch.save(state_dict, checkpoint_path)
        logger.info(f"Saved checkpoint to {checkpoint_path}")
</pre>
<p>With that, we’re done defining the functions we used in the main training loop we started with. After a couple of lines of code to fill in the gaps of checkpoint loading, config handling, etc, we end up with a `train.py` which in just 156 lines of code is able to seamlessly coordinate training jobs across huge distributed clusters.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</div><div><p>We’d like to thank Andrei Karpathy for creating nanoGPT and inspiring this work. We believe simple, hackable, and performant code is essential for advancing machine learning research. By combining the benefits of a compact code base and the ability to train GPT-3 scale models, gigaGPT on Cerebras hardware represents a significant leap towards more accessible, scalable, and efficient AI model training. If you’re working with the Cerebras platform, we encourage you to experiment with gigaGPT and share your feedback.</p>

              <p>
                    We present W.A.L.T, a transformer-based approach for photorealistic video generation via diffusion modeling. Our approach has two key design decisions. First, we use a causal encoder to jointly compress images and videos within a unified latent space, enabling training and generation across modalities. Second, for memory and training efficiency, we use a window attention architecture tailored for joint spatial and spatiotemporal generative modeling. Taken together these design decisions enable us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on established video (UCF-101 and Kinetics-600) and image (ImageNet) generation benchmarks without using classifier free guidance. Finally, we also train a cascade of three models for the task of text-to-video generation consisting of a base latent video diffusion model, and two video super-resolution diffusion models to generate videos of 512 x 896 resolution at 8 frames per second.

                      We encode images and videos into a shared latent space. The transformer backbone processes these latents
                      with blocks having two layers of window-restricted attention: spatial layers capture spatial relations in both images and video, while
                      spatiotemporal layers model temporal dynamics in videos and passthrough images via identity attention mask. Text conditioning is done via
                      spatial cross-attention.</span>

<article>
 <section>
    <p>When we think “a fast AOT WebAssembly compiler and runtime”, we typically think about V8, Wasmer, WasmEdge or Wasmtime.</p>

<p>All of these have in common that they are large, complicated pieces of software, that come with a lot of overhead, and only work on a limited set of platforms.</p>

<p>But how about transpiling WebAssembly code to C source code, and leveraging the state-of-the-art optimization passes of C compilers?</p>

<p>This is the approach taken by the <code>wasm2c</code> tool from the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">WABT</a> package, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/stage1/wasm2c.c">single-file WebAssembly transpiler</a> used to <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/goodbye-cpp/">bootstrap the Zig compiler</a>.</p>

<p>The output of these tools is really a line-by-line conversion of the WebAssembly code to dumb, unoptimized C code.</p>

<p>There are instant benefits to this. First, the ouptut is kinda human readable, which is useful for debugging. A WebAssembly function shows up as a regular C function, that can be directly called from C or any language with a C FFI.</p>

<p>Take existing C code, compile it to WebAssembly, transpile it back to C, and you get the same code, but sandboxed. The transformation acts as a sanitizer that improves safety by restricting the range of virtual memory accessible to each instance.</p>

<p>Of course, that works with any WebAssembly module, no matter what original languages it was written in.</p>

<p>With this approach, assembling different WebAssembly modules also becomes very easy.</p>

<p>Startup time is negligible. There’s no overhead. No runtime either. Just WebAssembly functions directly transpiled to C functions, that are trivial to embed in any project.</p>

<p>The reponsibility to compile that source code to native code is left to a regular C compiler. If the generated C source code is portable enough, this is also a great way to compile and run WebAssembly on embedded targets and new operating systems, that require custom compilers.</p>

<p>This approach can also greatly improve security and reliability. Because they don’t perform any optimization, WebAssembly to C transpilers are extremely small and simple. And the resulting code can even be compiled with formally-verified C compilers such as <a href="https://compcert.org/">CompCert</a> for high assurance code generation.</p>

<p>But how about features, usability and performance?</p>

<h2 id="w2c2">w2c2</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turbolent/w2c2">w2c2</a> is probably the most advanced of these transpilers.</p>

<p>Among other things, it supports many WebAssembly extensions, including WASI-core and threads.</p>

<p>This is a fantastic piece of software, but it unfortunately requires a bit of work to setup and use.</p>

<h2 id="installing-w2c2">Installing w2c2</h2>

<p>Clone the <code>w2c2</code> repository:</p>

<div><pre><code>git clone &lt;https://github.com/turbolent/w2c2&gt;
<span>cd </span>w2c2
</code></pre></div>

<p>Compile it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mkdir </span>build
<span>cd </span>build
cmake <span>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</span><span>=</span>Release ..
make
</code></pre></div>

<p>Define where the files will be installed:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>W2C2_DIR</span><span>=</span>/tmp/w2c2
</code></pre></div>

<p>Install them:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>install</span> <span>-d</span> <span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/<span>{</span>bin,lib,include/<span>{</span>w2c2,wasi<span>}}</span>
<span>install</span> <span>-s</span> w2c2/w2c2 <span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/bin/
<span>install </span>wasi/libw2c2wasi.a <span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/lib/
<span>install</span> <span>-m</span> 0644 ../w2c2/w2c2_base.h <span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/include/w2c2/
<span>install</span> <span>-m</span> 0644 ../wasi/wasi.h <span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/include/wasi/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alright, let’s get back to the root directory, and add <code>w2c2</code> to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>cd</span> ../..
<span>export </span><span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/bin:<span>$PATH</span>
rehash <span># only needed on some shells such as zsh</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>On macOS, the <code>w2c2</code> command weights about 150KB only. Yes, that’s all we need to compile WebAssembly modules.
For reference, the <code>wasmer</code> executable alone is 42MB large.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-webassembly-file">Creating a WebAssembly file</h2>

<p>Next, let’s clone the Zig project boilerplate in order to get an example WebAssembly module:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mkdir test</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd test
</span>zig init
zig build <span>-Dtarget</span><span>=</span>wasm32-wasi <span>-Doptimize</span><span>=</span>ReleaseSmall <span>\</span>
  <span>-Dcpu</span><span>=</span>baseline+bulk_memory+sign_ext+nontrapping_fptoint
</code></pre></div>

<p>The resulting WebAssembly module can be found in <code>zig-out/bin/test.wasm</code>.</p>

<p>By defaut, WebAssembly modules created by Zig aim at maximizing portability, so they target the <code>baseline</code> virtual CPU, that doesn’t enable any WebAssembly extension.</p>

<p>However, bulk memory, sign extension and non-trapping floating point are not a problem for <code>w2c2</code>, so we enable them.</p>

<p>The above example doesn’t use threads, but since Zig supports WASI threads, we could add <code>+atomic</code> to the list of features in order to run multithreaded WebAssembly code.</p>

<h2 id="compiling-webassembly-to-c">Compiling WebAssembly to C</h2>

<p>Now that we have a <code>test.wasm</code> WebAssembly module, the time has come to convert it to C.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mkdir </span>transpiled <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd </span>transpiled

w2c2 <span>-p</span> ../zig-out/bin/test.wasm test.c
</code></pre></div>

<p>The above command creates the <code>test.c</code> and <code>test.h</code> files, containing a C version of our WebAssembly module.</p>

<p>Since the module was named <code>test</code>, automatically generated functions are given <code>test</code> prefix. This allows multiple modules to be used together in the same application without name collisions.</p>

<p>Let’s try compiling this to native code, using a C compiler.</p>

<div><pre><code>zig cc test.c <span>-I</span><span>.</span> <span>-I</span><span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/include <span>-L</span><span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/lib <span>-lw2c2wasi</span>

<p>The code contains our translated functions, but we still need to instantiate the module and call functions in order to get an application we can actually run.</p>

<p>Let’s create a <code>main.c</code> file to do so:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
#include</span> <span>&lt;w2c2_base.h&gt;</span><span>

    <span>abort</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>wasmMemory</span> <span>*</span><span>wasiMemory</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>instance</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>test_memory</span><span>((</span><span>testInstance</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>instance</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>environ</span><span>;</span>

<span>{</span>
    <span>testInstance</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>

    <span>testInstantiate</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>wasiInit</span><span>(</span><span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>argv</span><span>,</span> <span>environ</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>stderr</span><span>,</span> <span>"failed to initialize WASI</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

    <span>testFreeInstance</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In WebAssembly commands, the entry point is named <code>_start()</code>. Functions transpiled to C are named <code>&lt;module name&gt;_&lt;function name&gt;</code>, so in order to call the <code>_start()</code> function, we simply call <code>test__start()</code> with the instance as an argument.</p>

<p>Now that we have a main function, let’s compile all this, and link the <code>w2c2</code> WASI-core implementation by the way since our test example uses it.</p>

<div><pre><code>zig cc <span>-o</span> <span>test</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-s</span> main.c test.c <span>\</span>
  <span>-I</span><span>.</span> <span>-I</span><span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/include/w2c2 <span>-I</span><span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/include/wasi <span>\</span>
  <span>-L</span><span>"</span><span>$W2C2_DIR</span><span>"</span>/lib <span>-lw2c2wasi</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Done!</p>

<p>We can now run our application:</p>

<div><pre><code>./test

All your codebase are belong to us.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Yep, that’s it! Our WebAssembly module got converted into a small, self-contained, native executable. Executable size and memory usage are ridiculously small compared to traditional runtimes.</p>

<h2 id="how-about-speed">How about speed?</h2>

<p>Certainly, code blindly transpiled to C cannot be as efficient as a dedicated WebAssembly compiler, right?</p>

<p>Let’s compile the famous <a href="https://libsodium.org/">libsodium</a> test/benchmark suite to WebAssembly:</p>

<div><pre><code>zig build <span>-Denable_benchmarks</span> <span>-Dtarget</span><span>=</span>wasm32-wasi <span>-Doptimize</span><span>=</span>ReleaseFast <span>\</span>
  <span>-Dcpu</span><span>=</span>baseline+bulk_memory+sign_ext+nontrapping_fptoint
</code></pre></div>

<p>The resulting tests are placed into the <code>zig-out/bin</code> directory.</p>

<p>Now, let’s try a pretty heavy one, such as the Ed25519 signature test: <code>zig-out/bin/sign.wasm</code>.</p>

<p>The tests print the time they take to complete, excluding initialization and finalization.</p>

<p>First, with <code>wasmtime</code>, enabling all the supported extensions:</p>

<div><pre><code>❯ <span>time </span>wasmtime run <span>--wasm-features</span><span>=</span>all test.wasm
625928560000

wasmtime run <span>--wasm-features</span><span>=</span>all /tmp/test.wasm  124.76s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 2:05.21 total
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, after transpiling the module to C using <code>w2c2</code> and compiling it with <code>zig cc</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>❯ <span>time</span> ./test
361604070000

./test  73.38s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 1:13.65 total
</code></pre></div>

<p>You got that right. A naive transpilation to C almost always beats dedicated WebAssembly compilers, sometimes by a large margin. That may change over time, though.</p>

<h2 id="downsides">Downsides</h2>

<p>Of course, there are downsides. An obvious one being that this is incompatible with just-in-time compilation or singlepass compilation. Compilation is not fast, since an initial transpilation pass is required.</p>

<p>The wasm-to-C approach would thus not be a good fit for running arbitrary code in a Web browser.</p>

<p>But no matter what the runtime is, with the <code>wasm32</code> target, memory accesses are limited to 32-bit offsets.
Taking advantage of this and virtual memory, runtimes usually add guard pages around each instance’s memory in order to catch accesses outside the reserved areas.</p>

<p>But the code currently generated by <code>w2c2</code> doesn’t automatically setup these guard pages. This is still left to the application.</p>

<p>As an alternative to guard pages, for <code>wasm64</code> or on platforms without virtual memory, some traditional WebAssembly compilers can decorate memory accesses with bound-checking code. <code>w2c2</code> currently can’t, but it totally could.</p>

<p>In spite of having excellent support for WebAssembly extensions, WASI-core and WASI-threads, <code>w2c2</code> intentionally doesn’t have bells and whistles, some of them being critical for some applications. For example, traditional runtimes often support gas metering and preemption, which are mandatory for many applications.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-for-you">Is it for you?</h2>

<p>If the justification to use WebAssembly is the ability to improve code safety, then <code>w2c2</code> (and the generic wasm-to-C approach) is for you. The result will be small, efficient and easy to use in any language with a C FFI.</p>

<p>On platforms not supported by big runtimes, <code>w2c2</code> may also work for you, and the resulting native code will be faster than interpreters such as <code>wasm3</code>.</p>

<p>For all other cases, traditional runtimes still offer way more features and flexibility.</p>

Props to the entire Beeper team for working basically 24/7 to get Beeper Mini working again. Huge thanks to you, the Beeper and broader community, for supporting us.</p><p>Beeper Mini launched on Tuesday and rocketed to top 20 of Play Store charts. It was an instant hit. From what we can tell, Beeper Mini was the fastest growing paid Android application launch in history. In the first 48 hours, it was downloaded by more than 100,000 people.</p><p><span>The reason for its success is clear: </span><strong>Android and iPhone customers desperately want to be able to chat together with high quality images/video, encryption, emojis, typing status, read receipts, and all modern chat features.</strong><span> We all want a fun, easy and secure way to chat. For a glorious 3 days last week, Beeper Mini made this possible.</span></p><p>On Friday, we started getting reports that Beeper Cloud and Beeper Mini users could not send or receive messages. We investigated the issue and started working on a fix.</p><p><span>Within 24 hours, we fixed the issue for Beeper Cloud and published an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/onbeeper/status/1733537832520855925" rel="">update</a><span>. Beeper Cloud users can now send and receive messages. It’s working exactly as it did before Friday. </span></p><blockquote><p>Note: Beeper Cloud’s new Oct 2023 iMessage bridge never used Mac relay servers and still does not today. It uses a similar method to Beeper Mini, but runs on a cloud server.</p></blockquote><p><span>At the same time, we took steps to deregister all phone numbers associated with Beeper Mini, and we sent push notifications to all users updating them on the situation. In hindsight, our timing was a mistake: </span><strong>we should have communicated to our users sooner.</strong><span> We’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused by the outage.</span></p><p><span>Today, less than 3 days later, </span><strong>we are publishing an update to fix Beeper Mini.</strong><span> Users can now sign in, send and receive messages. Beeper Mini is back.</span></p><p>Despite reaching out, we still have not heard anything directly from Apple.</p><p><span>I got a call from David Pierce over at </span><em>The Verge</em><span> on Saturday. Apple had sent them a </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23995150/beeper-imessage-android-apple-statement" rel="">statement</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>At Apple, we build our products and services with industry-leading privacy and security technologies designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information safe. We took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage. These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks. We will continue to make updates in the future to protect our users.</p></blockquote><p><span>We—of course—expected a response. What we didn’t expect was 1984-esque doublespeak. The statement is complete </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt" rel="">FUD</a><span>. </span><strong>Beeper Mini made communication between Android and iPhone users more secure. That is a fact.</strong></p><p>Make no mistake, the changes Apple made on Friday were designed to protect the lock-in effect of iMessage. The end result is that iPhone customers have less security and privacy than before.</p><p>Before Beeper Mini, Messages app (the default chat app on iPhone) forced all iPhone customers to send unencrypted, unsecure green bubble SMS messages to Android friends, family and colleagues. Even worse, when iPhone customers added an Android phone number to an existing iMessage secure encrypted group chat, the Messages app would by default switch the entire group chat to using unencrypted, unsecure SMS. This immediately made communication between iPhone customers in the group chat less secure.</p><p>Beeper Mini fixed this problem (and many others), and made it possible for Android and iPhone customers to enjoy a secure, easy and high quality chat experience. We are working to make chat more secure, and enable consumer choice. </p><p><span>Many people have asked, ‘why don’t people just use Signal or WhatsApp?’. The answer is that Messages App is the default chat app for all iPhone customers. Not only is it the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect" rel="">default</a><span>, iOS makes it impossible to change the default chat app. In the US, where the majority of people have iPhones, this means that the easiest way to chat is by tapping on your friend’s name in your contact list and hitting the ‘message’ button.</span></p><p><span>We deeply object to the allegation that Beeper Mini ‘poses significant risks to user security and privacy’. This is completely untrue. As we explained above, the opposite is actually true. Beeper Mini increases the security and privacy of both Android and iPhone customers. To prove this, we published a detailed </span><a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works" rel="">blog post</a><span> about how the app keeps data secure and private. Beeper Mini is end-to-end encrypted. The underlying connection method is </span><a href="https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush#dataplist-and-mac-serial-numbers" rel="">open source</a><span>, for anyone to review.</span></p><p>Today, we’re taking that dedication to security and privacy even further.</p><ol><li><p>If Apple doubts the security and privacy of our app, we’re willing to share the entire Beeper Mini codebase with a mutually agreed upon 3rd party security research firm.</p></li><li><p>If Apple insists, we would consider adding a pager emoji 📟️ to metadata on all messages sent via Beeper Mini. This would make it easy for Messages App to filter out any messages from Beeper Mini users.</p></li></ol><p>At the end of the day, we are committed to building the best chat app on earth. We will continue working on that.</p><p><strong><span>Eric Migicovsky and Brad Murray</span><br></strong><span>Beeper cofounders</span><br></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="article-body">
<p><span>In 1950, Icelandic researcher Jón </span>Eyþórsson came across a gathering of fuzzy green puff balls, the size of small gerbils, scattered across Hrútárjökull Glacier in the southeast of the country. Curiously, the mossy balls weren’t attached to the ground, and many were green on all sides, indicating they must slowly turn so that the entire exterior sees the sun at some point, theorized Eyþórsson. That fall, he <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/joklamys/E6AB707070CB9F7C15B4D043CC9A018A">wrote a letter to the editor</a> of the<em> Journal of Glaciology</em>. “I call these mossy balls <em>Jökla-mýs</em>, literally ‘glacier mice,’” he wrote, “and you will have noted, Sir, that rolling stones can gather moss.”</p>
<p>The term “glacier mice” has gone on to befuddle folks ever since. “I don’t like the term ‘glacier mice,’” says high mountain ecologist Scott Hotaling of Utah State University. “I saw it and I was like, ‘Oh, these are actual mammals living on <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/categories/glaciers">glaciers</a>.’ And that’s not even remotely what they are.” Hotaling prefers “glacier moss balls.” “They’re still surprisingly cute and herd around the glacier together—they’re awfully neat in that way.”</p>
<p>Whatever you call them, they’re cute and it turns out, quite confusing for scientists. Moss balls like these form around an irritant such as a small rock or accumulation of dust, similar to how a pearl forms around a grain of sand in an oyster. Their pillowy bodies are moss, through and through. While they’re considered rare—they require a perfect combination of glacier, moss spores, and substrate—they’ve been found, on occasion, all over the world, from the Himalayas to South America to Alaska. “They’re global but rare everywhere,” says glaciologist Tim Bartholomaus at University of Idaho. Despite being much loved by glaciologists and those lucky enough to spot them, there’s a lot we still don’t know about these mossy mysteries.</p>

<p>Previously unaware of the phenomenon, Bartholomaus came across a colony of the moss balls while setting up research equipment on Root Glacier in Alaska in 2006. “I was floored, and perplexed,” he says. In 2009, he and another researcher tagged 30 of them—ranging from hamster- to rat-size—with wire and glass beads, like friendship bracelets. For 54 days they tracked the balls as they moved slowly across the ice. They continued to check on the moss balls throughout the year, and returned in 2010 and 2012 to see what the little herd was up to. Hotaling, while he didn’t lay eyes on these specific fluff balls, helped with the data.</p>
<p>In 2020 in the journal <em>Polar Biology</em>, they <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s00300-020-02675-6?sharing_token=HN75pdcTvlF-_qsfv-ejJPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5WBKeqwPhH-J_RhmuMGX2k3CByeg6kB7QTeIlLQSOoB6DjLsODKdvpBOXYhu0izw-R4ZZso2efOF9pMLeCch14qWcomyhamEEkykx_VMBcm4ktfWg4Zvv0uPCad7ye94s%3D">reported that the balls slowly rolled in unison</a>, up to a couple inches a day, and could live for at least six years. The balls moved at about the same speed, in the same direction, and changed direction in coordinated fashion. The team theorized, like the few moss ball enthusiasts before them, that the balls move because they shield the ice beneath them from melting, causing them to eventually roll off their icy pedestals. While this has been observed, that alone wouldn’t lead the balls in any single direction.</p>

<p>The factors that orchestrate their coordinated movements is still a mystery. Researchers tried explaining this phenomenon with incline, wind, sunlight—but nothing quite lined up. “We don’t really know why they moved the way they do,” says Hotaling. “My guess is there’s some combination of things happening, like wind, solar radiation, and micro-topography on the glacier—like melt channels and little ridges that aren’t being captured in our study. It was quite the surprise to not be able to explain it with what we thought were kind of the only options.”</p>
<p>Today, the moss balls of Root Glacier are still around, says Bartholomaus, though he hasn’t done an exhaustive search to see if any still sport their bracelets. At the moment, no one is on the case to try to solve this adorable green mystery. “Nobody’s lives depend on this,” says Bartholomaus, “so it doesn’t really go beyond a kind of curiosity.” Travel to glaciers is time-consuming and expensive, both researchers point out, and while moss balls are fascinating, some things are okay with a little mystery. “Scientists are trained to explain things, often with tons of caveats,” says Hotaling. “We rarely just say, ‘I don’t know.’” While Hotaling would still love to research more on moss balls, glacial researchers have more pressing issues.</p>

<p>Climate change and melting glaciers will surely have an impact on the moss balls—whether that means more or less, scientists can’t say for certain. Hotaling is more concerned with this bigger picture. “It’s not really just about glacier moss balls, says Hotaling, “it’s about this kind of entire system that’s going away and that we know very little about.”</p>
<p>Like the deep ocean, high-mountain ecosystems are full of mysteries, and each new discovery in glacial areas around the world can be as alarming as it is exciting. “No one could really imagine that glacier moss balls are a thing. The way they work and the way they move in concert, like a little herd on the glacier, that’s just not something that I would have just guessed was out there,” Hotaling says. “For me, it highlights the general issue of climate change and high-mountain and high-latitude ice, and that these places are extremely underexplored, and they’re very understudied. It makes me wonder what else is out there, and what else is being lost?”</p>

<p><span><b>FORAYS INTO FOUR DAYS:</b></span> When the United Auto Workers started at the bargaining table with Detroit auto companies months ago, they had some eye catching demands: Historic pay raises. Job protections. And, for a moment, a shorter work week.</p><p><b>They won </b><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/30/uaw-big-3-labor-biden-economy-00124368#:~:text=What%20the%20pending%20UAW%2DBig,off%20President%20Joe%20Biden's%20plate." target="_blank"><b>some of those things</b></a><b>, in unprecedented fashion</b>. A 32-hour work week wasn’t one of them.</p><p>The union’s negotiations thrust the idea to the top of the media’s consciousness. But if there’s a wider movement toward shorter hours, unions won’t necessarily be the only force at the forefront of it, advocates told Shift.</p><p><b>“We should be rationally talking about policies </b>that will take us, in an orderly fashion, to a new norm,” Rep. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/198829" target="_blank">Mark Takano</a> (D-Calif.) said in an interview.</p><p><b>Between the rise of generative artificial intelligence</b> this year and the reckoning of work-life balance that came with the Covid-19 pandemic, efforts to shorten the workweek have accelerated.</p><p><b>Much of the experimentation so far, though, has come from small </b>and medium businesses, looking at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/02/21/four-day-work-week-results-uk/" target="_blank">pilot</a> <a href="https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2023/12/08/world-of-hr-south-africa-tries-a-four-day-workweek" target="_blank">cases</a> that indicate reworking the work day improved employee well-being while maintaining productivity. While still rare, four-day-a-week job postings are up on Indeed, <a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2023/10/30/october-2023-us-labor-market-update/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioscloser&amp;stream=top" target="_blank">according to the platform</a>. In Europe, Lamborghini just last week agreed with its unions to reduce production workers’ hours without reducing pay, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lamborghini-introduces-four-day-week-production-workers-2023-12-05/" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a>.</p><p><b>Jon Leland, chief strategy officer at Kickstarter</b> and co-founder of the Four Day Workweek Campaign, is one executive who took the plunge. And he sees AI as a potentially transformative force in the equation.</p><p><b>“Does everyone just keep churning out stuff</b> all the time and have that value accrue to shareholders?” Leland said. He would rather distribute the productive value of AI, he said, not just in the form of money, but also time.</p><p><b>The upheaval has also inspired some state and federal legislators. </b>Takano this year <a href="https://legislation.politicopro.com/bill/US_118_HR_1332" target="_blank">reintroduced</a> a bill that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to standardize a 32-hour workweek, after which overtime pay would kick in. Labor organizations including the AFL-CIO and SEIU backed it, along with a handful of Democrats.</p><p>A Senate version could come next year, said Jon Steinman, another co-founder of the Four Day Workweek Campaign. Sen. <a href="https://directory.politicopro.com/congress/member/51605" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) has already come out publicly <a href="https://x.com/SenSanders/status/1646555149643440129?s=20" target="_blank">in favor</a> of the idea.</p><p><b>Some folks are skeptical at the idea</b> of a societal overhaul in favor of working less. Liberty Vittert, a statistician who has advocated against the four-day week, said she worries about a slippery slope that could hurt the U.S. in its competition with China. Some arrangements could also open the door for more part-time jobs as companies look to fill working hours, which don’t typically provide the same benefits as full-time work, she said.</p><p><b>Federal legislation is highly unlikely to become law </b>anytime soon, given that this split Congress has struggled with labor issues far less controversial than changing the entire structure of workers’ calendars. But true believers are inspired by the pace of the conversation between employers, workers, lawmakers and tech.</p><p><b>“My bottom line is technology for the sake of human happiness,” </b>Takano said, adding: “To make liberal democracy sustainable … we have to be sure capitalism and technology serves humanity, not the other way around.”</p><p><b>GOOD MORNING.</b> It’s Monday, Dec. 11.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The city of New York recently witnessed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/nyregion/queens-murders-exonerated-settlement.html">record payout</a> to George Bell, falsely convicted of murder in 1999, after it emerged <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=5976">prosecutors had deliberately hidden evidence</a> casting doubt on his guilt, giving false statements in court. Bell is the latest in a long line of people, especially Black Americans, unfoundedly convicted. More recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/27/nyregion/wayne-gardine-jabar-walker-exonerations.html">Jabar Walker and Wayne Gardine</a> were cleared after decades in prison. Conviction integrity units across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/opinion/randall-dale-adams-judicial-system.html">North</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/wrongful-conviction-review-process-indigenous-black-systemic-issues-1.6752736">America</a> have found serious flaws with many long-standing convictions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Alarmingly for scientists, misleading forensic and expert evidence is too often a deciding factor in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/let-rsquo-s-keep-the-science-in-forensic-science/">such miscarriages of justice</a>; of the <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/NRE%20Annual%20Report%202022.pdf">233 exonerations in 2022 alone</a> recorded by the National Registry of Exonerations, deceptive forensic evidence and expert testimony was a factor in 44 of them. In an era of high-tech forensics, the persistence of such brazen miscarriages of justice is more than unsettling. The National Institute of Justice, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, has just published <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/news/news-release/nij-assesses-impact-forensic-science-wrongful-convictions">a report</a> that found certain techniques, including footprint analysis and fire debris, in forensic science were <a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/impact-false-or-misleading-forensic-evidence-wrongful-convictions">disproportionately associated with wrongful conviction</a>. The same report found expert testimony that “reported forensic science results in an erroneous manner” or “mischaracterized statistical weight or probability” was often the driving force in false convictions. The disconcerting reality is that illusions of scientific legitimacy and flawed expert testimony are often the catalyst for deeply unsound convictions.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This paradox arises because scientific evidence is highly valued by juries, which often lack the expertise to correctly interpret or question it. Juries with a lower understanding of the potential limitations of such evidence are more likely to convict <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20100329/DNA-evidence-often-overwhelms-jurors-to-convict-wrongly-says-research.aspx">without questioning the evidence</a> or its context. This is exacerbated by undue trust in expert witnesses, who may overstate evidence or underplay uncertainty. As a 2016 <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_forensic_science_report_final.pdf">presidential advisors report</a> warned, “expert witnesses have often overstated the probative value of their evidence, going far beyond what the relevant science can justify.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The debacle of British pediatrician Roy Meadow serves as a powerful exemplar of precisely this. Famed for his influential “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow%27s_law">Meadow’s law</a>,” which asserted that one sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious, and three is murder until proved otherwise, Meadow was a frequent expert witness in trials in the United Kingdom. His penchant for seeing sinister patterns, however, stemmed not from real insight, but from terrible statistical ineptitude. In the late 1990s, Sally Clark suffered a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/17/childrensservices.uknews">double tragedy</a>, losing two infant sons to sudden infant death syndrome. Despite scant evidence of anything beyond misfortune, Clark was tried for murder, with Meadows testifying to her guilt.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In court, Meadow testified that families like the Clarks had a one-in-8,543 chance of a sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) case. Thus, he asserted, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1179752/">the probability of two cases in one family was this squared, roughly one-in-73 million</a> of two deaths arising by chance alone. In a rhetorical flourish, he likened it to successfully backing an 80-to-1 outsider to win the Grand National horse race over four successive years. This seemingly unimpeachable, damning statistic figure convinced both jury and public of her guilt. Clark was demonized in the press and imprisoned for murder.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Yet this verdict horrified statisticians, for several reasons. To arrive at his figure, Meadow simply multiplied probabilities together. This is perfectly correct for truly independent events like roulette wheels or coin-flips, but fails horribly when this assumption is not met. By the late 1990s, there was <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/ajrccm.164.3.9910045">overwhelming</a> <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/104/4/e43/62359/Epidemiology-of-SIDS-and-Explained-Sudden-Infant">epidemiological</a> evidence that SIDS ran in families, rendering assumptions of independence untenable. More subtle but as damaging was a trick of perception. To many, this appeared equivalent to a one-in-73-million chance Clark was innocent. While this implication was &nbsp;intended by the prosecution, such an inference was a statistical error so ubiquitous in courtrooms it has a fitting moniker: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/179/9/1125/103523">the prosecutor’s fallacy.</a></p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy">base-rate fallacy</a> arises because while multiple cases of SIDS are rare, so too are multiple maternal infanticides. To determine which situation is more likely, the relative likelihood of these two competing explanations must be compared. In Clark’s case, this analysis would have shown that the probability of two SIDS deaths vastly exceeded the infant murder hypothesis. The Royal Statistical Society issued a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080407224224/http:/www.rss.org.uk/PDF/RSS%20Statement%20regarding%20statistical%20issues%20in%20the%20Sally%20Clark%20case,%20October%2023rd%202001.pdf">damning indictment</a> of Meadow’s testimony, echoed by a paper in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1117305/"><em>British Medical Journal</em></a>. But such rebukes did not save Clark from years in jail.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">After a long campaign, Clark’s verdict was overturned in 2003, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jul/15/NHS.uknews1">several other women</a> convicted by Meadow’s testimony were subsequently exonerated. The General Medical Council found Meadow guilty of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4685511.stm">professional misconduct</a> &nbsp;and barred him from practicing medicine. But Clark’s vindication was no consolation for the heartbreak she had suffered, and she died an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/7082411.stm">alcohol-related death in 2007</a>. The prosecutor’s fallacy emerges constantly in problems of conditional probability, leading us sirenlike towards precisely the wrong conclusions—and undetected, sends innocent people to jail.&nbsp;</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Earlier this year, Australia pardoned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/05/kathleen-folbigg-pardoned-after-20-years-in-jail-over-deaths-of-her-four-children">Kathleen Folbigg</a> after 20 years in jail after a conviction for murdering her four children in 2003 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/07/kathleen-folbigg-science-sheds-new-light-on-case-of-mother-convicted-of-murdering-her-children">based on Meadow’s</a> discredited law. Dutch nurse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_de_Berk_case">Lucia de Berk</a> was convicted of seven murders of patients in 2004, based on ostensible statistical evidence. While convincing to a jury, it also <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09332480.2018.1549809">appalled statistical experts</a>, who lobbied for a reopening of the case. Again, the case against de Berk pivoted entirely on the prosecutor’s fallacy, and her conviction was overturned in 2010.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This isn’t just historical occurrence. The veneer of science and expert opinion has such an aura of authority that when invoked in open court, it is rarely challenged. Even effective techniques like blood splatter and DNA analysis can be misused in unsound convictions, underpinned by variants of the prosecutor’s fallacy. A suspect’s rare blood type (5 percent) matching traces at a scene, for example, does not imply that guilt is 95 percent certain. A hypothetical town of 2,000 potential suspects has 100 people matching that criterion, which renders the probability that the suspect is guilty in the absence of other evidence at just 1 percent.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Worse is when the science cited is so dubious as to be useless. One recent analysis found <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/psychological-assessment-in-legal-contexts-are-courts-keeping-junk-science-out-of-the-courtroom.html">only about 40 percent of psychological measures</a> cited in courts have strong evidentiary background, and yet they are rarely challenged. Entire techniques like <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/10/forensic-bitemark-analysis-not-supported-sufficient-data-nist-draft-review">bite-mark analysis</a> have been shown to be effectively useless despite convictions still turning on them. <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/cognitive-neuroscience/polygraph">Polygraph tests</a> are so utterly inaccurate as to be deemed inadmissible by courts, and yet remain perversely popular with swathes of American law enforcement.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This can and does ruin lives. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/FBI-Admits-Pseudoscientific-Hair-Analysis-Used-in-Hundreds-of-Cases-180955070/">Hair analysis</a>, dismissed by forensics experts worldwide as pseudoscientific, was embraced by the FBI for its ability to get convictions. But this hollow theater of science condemned innocent people, disproportionately affecting people of color like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/23/fbi-evidence-single-hair-kirk-odom">Kirk Odom</a>, who languished in prison for 22 years for a rape he did not commit. Odom was but one victim of this illusory science; a 2015 report found hundreds of cases in which <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-testimony-on-microscopic-hair-analysis-contained-errors-in-at-least-90-percent-of-cases-in-ongoing-review">hair examiners made erroneous statements</a> in inculpating defendants, including 33 cases that sent defendants to death row, nine of whom were already executed by the time the report saw daylight. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lung-float-test-stillbirths-boston-university-northeastern-law?taid=656841097bdf63000121093e">As noted by ProPublica</a>, the use of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_float_test">lung float” tests</a> to supposedly differentiate between stillbirth and murder is being challenged by experts. Despite the fact the test is highly fallible, it has already been used to justify imprisoning women who lost children for murder, raising alarm over yet another potential manifestation of the prosecutor’s fallacy.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">While science and statistics are crucial in the pursuit of justice, their uncertainties and weaknesses must be as clearly communicated as strengths. Evidence and statistics demand context, lest they mislead rather than enlighten. Juries and Judges need to be educated on standards of scientific and statistical evidence, and to understand what to demand of expert testimony, before courts send people to prison. Without improved scientific and statistical integrity in courtrooms, the risk of convicting innocent people can neither be circumvented nor ignored.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><em>This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of&nbsp;</em>Scientific American.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text"> <p>Undo and redo have been a staple operation of text editors probably since the first typo was ever made, yet there has not been a lot of innovation around refining the idea of what undo and redo <em>could</em> be. Let’s explore what I mean…</p>
<h2 id="on-the-subject-of-undo">On The Subject of Undo</h2>
<h3 id="undo">Undo</h3>
<p>In order to understand how to change undo we first need to understand what the fundamental operation of ‘undo’ is supposed to do. I have always learned best through example so let’s assume you start with the string <code>"Hello"</code> and you start typing the sequence <code>" World!"</code>:</p>
<p><span>Hello<span id="undo-basic"></span></span></p>
<p>In the scenario above, when the undo operation is invoked (typically CTRL+z) what is the typical expectation? There are a myriad of possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Undo would delete the entire string <code>" World!"</code> since it was all part of the same insert operation.</li>
<li>Undo would delete only the last character added, <code>'!'</code>
</li>
<li>Undo would delete the sequence of characters within some time threshold of each keystroke.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many approaches to what the undo operation should do and each one has its own merits. The approach I use is close to #1 where the undo operation will undo blocks of the same style of edit. I find this approach to be useful for my workflow. If you are interested in reading a bit more about how popular text editors more concretely implement undo/redo I encourage you to check out <a href="https://www.mattduck.com/undo-redo-text-editors">Undo/redo implementations in text editors</a> by Matt Duck who very carefully breaks down the approaches of several editors.</p>
<p>There are a few properties of undo that are very nice to have:</p>
<ol>
<li>The undo operation should create a corresponding redo operation, more on redo later.</li>
<li>If undo is applied to the beginning of edit history, the system should report that an undo is not possible and do nothing as a result.</li>
<li>If you undo (or redo) to the point of the last save of the document the system should recognize that there is nothing to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having #3 is very important to me because it helps me understand where my last ‘committed’ work was during an edit session. It seems like a small “nice to have feature” but the system recognizing various points in history is essential for the feature we’re about to implement.</p>
<h3 id="redo">Redo</h3>
<p>Redo is really quite similar to undo in many ways. Let’s take our example of <code>"Hello World!"</code>, and apply an undo operation (using the preferred implementation above):</p>
<p><span>Hello<span id="redo-basic"></span></span></p>
<p>Redo is the complement to undo and it should perform the same operation that the undo operation just removed. Since there’s a dependency on undo in order to redo it implies that the redo operation cannot be applied on a document which has had no undo operations performed. Furthermore, a redo operation should inherit all the same properties that undo has, e.g. the system should be aware of redo operations as a moment in time rather than a regular operation.</p>
<h3 id="perils-of-undo-and-redo">Perils of Undo and Redo</h3>
<p>Undo and redo are fantastic operations to have in our editor toolbox, in fact in the way I edit documents today I would argue that undo and redo are a fundamental operation. There are some drawbacks in the way that undo and redo tend to work in most text editors though. To help illustrate what I mean, let’s go back to our <code>"Hello World!"</code> example one more time:</p>
<p><span>Hello<span id="undo-history-break"></span></span></p>
<p>If we apply undo to remove <code>" World!"</code> and start typing again, most editors will remove the redo state. There are some interesting approaches to help combat this problem, one that comes to mind is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html">Emacs undo system</a> which keeps undo operations in a separate buffer after you edit again so you can undo that undo and get back to the point where you can redo after an initial undo.</p>
<p>To get a better idea of exactly what happens in most editors, let’s see a small graph of the situation above:</p>
<p> <img src="https://cdacamar.github.io/images/undo-redo-graph-initial.png"></p>
<p>In our initial state, all we’ve done is inserted the text <code>" World!"</code>. When we apply the undo operation we get:</p>
<p> <img src="https://cdacamar.github.io/images/undo-redo-graph-undo.png"></p>
<p>However, after we insert the new string <code>" Cameron!"</code> we end up orphaning the original <code>" World!"</code> node because the history in most editors is intended to be linear:</p>
<p> <img src="https://cdacamar.github.io/images/undo-redo-graph-insert.png"></p>
<p>Perhaps with <a href="https://github.com/cdacamar/fredbuf">fredbuf</a> we could do better…</p>
<h2 id="rethinking-undo">Rethinking Undo</h2>
<h3 id="basic-idea">Basic Idea</h3>
<p>Since fredbuf is a purely functional data structure, we have the ability to very cheaply store any reference to an editor buffer state. So what if we created a graph out of it? What if instead of having a linear list of undos and redos that fredbuf currently has as a builtin, perhaps we could manage a graph of editor states ourself so we could then use some kind of system of UI to navigate it and ‘snap’ back to any of these states.</p>
<p>Imagine we now store the undo/redo data in the following type of structure:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>UndoRedoNode</span><span>;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>UndoRedoNodePtr</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>unique_ptr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>UndoRedoNode</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>UndoRedoChildren</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>UndoRedoNodePtr</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>UndoRedoNode</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>UndoRedoChildren</span> <span>children</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PieceTree</span><span>::</span><span>RedBlackTree</span> <span>point</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using the definition above, we can create a graph of undo/redo nodes. There might be a question of, why do we need <code>children</code> to be an array? This comes back to our last example where we showed the string <code>" Cameron!"</code> inserted. If the undo operation were applied yet again and a new string entered, we would create yet another branch at the root node, so we need the capability of the structure above to refer to all possible states.</p>
<h3 id="visualization">Visualization</h3>
<p>Now that we know how we need to model the data, how do we view it? Graph visualization is a massive topic and there are many intuitive ways to view various types of graphs. The graph we are building with our undo data is closer to a tree (but we can talk about how to turn this into something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> in the future). While editing I have always found it useful to associate timestamps with historical data, as they help me get a better idea for roughly what that change might have been, so visualizing the time the change was made is sensible to me. Additionally, since the tree is a sequence made over time it made sense to me to lay out the tree horizontally with branches moving towards the right of the screen, somewhat like a <a href="https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/">git branch structure visualization</a>.</p>
<p>When looking at an undo graph in particular it is generally not sufficient for me to simply see the nodes, I also need to see <em>what</em> those nodes contain so I can make an informed decision about whether or not I actually want to apply that undo/redo operation. Enter, the diffing method. The most natural way for me to see deltas in edits is good ol’ <code>diff</code>. Let’s look at a diff of adding <code>" World!"</code> to <code>"Hello"</code>:</p>

<p>Since I work with git extensively, this is exactly the kind of thing I want to see in the UI as I navigate from the current edit to some other edit in the past. It allows me to reason about the changes the jump will cause. This means there is only one last problem to solve: implementing the diff algorithm in the editor for various types of snap points. Luckily for us, there is a fantastic series of posts by James Coglan (<a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2017/02/12/the-myers-diff-algorithm-part-1/">“The Myers diff algorithm”</a>) which goes over all the gory details of how to implement the popular Myers diff algorithm—I can’t recommend this series enough for anyone interested in implementing their own diff algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h3>
<p>Now that we have the data structure and the visualization strategy down, let’s see how it looks all together. Let’s go back to that example where we branched the UI states but had no way to recover the redo of <code>"Hello"</code>:</p>
<p><span>Hello<span id="undo-history-break2"></span></span></p>
<p>And here’s that same series of edits made in fred:</p>
<p> <img src="https://cdacamar.github.io/images/fred-diff-demo.gif"></p>
<p>When you enter the undo/redo graph mode the editor allows you to navigate to any edit made at any point in time. Additionally, the UI will display the diff from the current edit to the selected node in the upper left-hand corner. It sort of turns your editor into a small source control system!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What did I learn from this?</p>
<ol>
<li>Immutable data structures remain a fascinating point of interest for me. They enable so many interesting avenues to solve problems.</li>
<li>The Myers diff algorithm is incredibly easy to implement, but takes a lot of time to understand what is happening so that you can render it properly.</li>
<li>It is going to be hard for me to go back to linear undo/redo of most editors <img title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" height="20" width="20">.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re also interested in text editor design, the C++ language, or compilers have a chat with me over on Twitter. I’m always interested in learning and sharing any knowledge that could prove to be useful to others.</p>
<p>Until next time! <i></i></p></section></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What &amp; Why?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Marmot is a distributed SQLite replicator with leaderless, and eventual consistency. It allows you to build a robust replication
between your nodes by building on top of fault-tolerant <a href="https://nats.io/" rel="nofollow">NATS JetStream</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">So if you are running a read heavy website based on SQLite, you should be easily able to scale it out by adding more SQLite replicated nodes.
SQLite is probably the most ubiquitous DB that exists almost everywhere, Marmot aims to make it even more ubiquitous for server
side applications by building a replication layer on top.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick Start</h2>
<p dir="auto">Download <a href="https://github.com/maxpert/marmot/releases/latest">latest</a> Marmot and extract package using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="tar vxzf marmot-v*.tar.gz"><pre><code>tar vxzf marmot-v*.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">From extracted directory run <code>examples/run-cluster.sh</code>. Make a change in <code>/tmp/marmot-1.db</code> using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="bash > sqlite3 /tmp/marmot-1.db
sqlite3 > INSERT INTO Books (title, author, publication_year) VALUES ('Pride and Prejudice', 'Jane Austen', 1813);"><pre><code>bash &gt; sqlite3 /tmp/marmot-1.db
sqlite3 &gt; INSERT INTO Books (title, author, publication_year) VALUES ('Pride and Prejudice', 'Jane Austen', 1813);
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now observe changes getting propagated to other database <code>/tmp/marmot-2.db</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="bash > sqlite3 /tmp/marmot-2.db
sqlite3 > SELECT * FROM Books;"><pre><code>bash &gt; sqlite3 /tmp/marmot-2.db
sqlite3 &gt; SELECT * FROM Books;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should be able to make changes interchangeably and see the changes getting propagated.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Out in wild</h2>
<p dir="auto">Here are some official, and community demos/usages showing Marmot out in wild:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HycGtLjlikI" rel="nofollow">2-node HA for edge Kubernetes - Using Marmot</a></li>
<li><a href="https://maxpert.github.io/marmot/demo" rel="nofollow">Scaling Isso with Marmot on Fly.io</a></li>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/GQ5x8pc9vuI" rel="nofollow">Scaling Keystone 6 with Marmot 0.4.x</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is the difference from others?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Marmot is essentially a CDC (Change Data Capture) and replication pipeline running top of NATS. It can automatically configure appropriate
JetStreams making sure those streams evenly distribute load over those shards, so scaling simply boils down to adding more nodes, and
re-balancing those JetStreams (auto rebalancing not implemented yet).</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a few solutions like <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite">rqlite</a>, <a href="https://dqlite.io/" rel="nofollow">dqlite</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/superfly/litefs">LiteFS</a> etc. All of them either are layers on top of SQLite (e.g.
rqlite, dqlite) that requires them to sit in the middle with network layer in order to provide
replication; or intercept physical page level writes to stream them off to replicas. In both
cases they require a single primary node where all the writes have to go, and then these
changes are applied to multiple readonly replicas.</p>
<p dir="auto">Marmot on the other hand is born different. It's born to act as a side-car to your existing processes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Instead of requiring single primary, there is <strong>no primary</strong>! Which means <strong>any node can make changes to its local DB</strong>.
Marmot will use triggers to capture your changes, and then stream them off to NATS.</li>
<li>Instead of being strongly consistent, Marmot is <strong>eventually consistent</strong>. Which means no locking, or blocking of nodes.</li>
<li>It does not require any changes to your existing SQLite application logic for reading/writing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Making these choices has multiple benefits:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You can read, and write to your SQLite database like you normally do. No extension, or VFS changes.</li>
<li>You can write on any node! You don't have to go to single primary for writing your data.</li>
<li>As long as you start with same copy of database, all the mutations will eventually converge
(hence eventually consistent).</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What happens when there is a race condition?</h2>
<p dir="auto">In Marmot every row is uniquely mapped to a JetStream. This guarantees that for any node to publish changes for a row it has to go through
same JetStream as everyone else. If two nodes perform a change to same row in parallel, both of the nodes will compete to publish their
change to JetStream cluster. Due to <a href="https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/clustering/jetstream_clustering#raft" rel="nofollow">RAFT quorum</a>
constraint only one of the writer will be able to get its changes published first. Now as these changes are applied (even the publisher applies
its own changes to database) the <strong>last writer</strong> will always win. This means there is NO serializability guarantee of a transaction
spanning multiple tables. This is a design choice, in order to avoid any sort of global locking, and performance.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto">Right now there are a few limitations on current solution:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Marmot does not support schema changes propagation, so any tables you create or columns you change won't be reflected.
This feature is being <a href="https://github.com/maxpert/marmot/discussions/59" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/maxpert/marmot/discussions/59/hovercard">debated</a> and will be available in future
versions of Marmot.</li>
<li>You can't watch tables selectively on a DB. This is due to various limitations around snapshot and restore mechanism.</li>
<li>WAL mode required - since your DB is going to be processed by multiple processes the only way to have multi-process
changes reliably is via WAL.</li>
<li>Marmot is eventually consistent - This simply means rows can get synced out of order, and <code>SERIALIZABLE</code> assumptions
on transactions might not hold true anymore. However your application can choose to redirect writes to single node
so that your changes are always replayed in order.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Leaderless replication never requiring a single node to handle all write load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Ability to snapshot and fully recover from those snapshots. Multiple storage options for snapshot:</p>

</li>
<li>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h2>
<p dir="auto">Starting 0.8+ Marmot comes with embedded <a href="https://nats.io/download/" rel="nofollow">nats-server</a> with JetStream support. This not only reduces
the dependencies/processes that one might have to spin up, but also provides with out-of-box tooling like
<a href="https://github.com/nats-io/natscli">nat-cli</a>. You can also use existing libraries to build additional
tooling and scripts due to standard library support. Here is one example using Deno:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="deno run --allow-net https://gist.githubusercontent.com/maxpert/d50a49dfb2f307b30b7cae841c9607e1/raw/6d30803c140b0ba602545c1c0878d3394be548c3/watch-marmot-change-logs.ts -u <nats_username> -p <nats_password> -s <comma_seperated_server_list>"><pre><code>deno run --allow-net https://gist.githubusercontent.com/maxpert/d50a49dfb2f307b30b7cae841c9607e1/raw/6d30803c140b0ba602545c1c0878d3394be548c3/watch-marmot-change-logs.ts -u &lt;nats_username&gt; -p &lt;nats_password&gt; -s &lt;comma_seperated_server_list&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The output will look something like this:
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22441/196061378-21f885b3-7958-4a7e-994b-09d4e86df721.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22441/196061378-21f885b3-7958-4a7e-994b-09d4e86df721.png" alt="image"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Production status</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>v0.8.x</code> introduced support for embedded NATS. This is recommended version for production.</li>
<li><code>v0.7.x</code> moves to file based configuration rather than CLI flags, and S3 compatible snapshot storage.</li>
<li><code>v0.6.x</code> introduces snapshot save/restore. It's in pre-production state.</li>
<li><code>v0.5.x</code> introduces change log compression with zstd.</li>
<li><code>v0.4.x</code> introduces NATS based change log streaming, and continuous multi-directional sync.</li>
<li><code>v0.3.x</code> is deprecated, and unstable. DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CLI Documentation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Marmot picks simplicity, and lesser knobs to configure by choice. Here are command line options you can use to
configure marmot:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>config</code> - Path to a TOML configuration file. Check out <code>config.toml</code> comments for detailed documentation
on various configurable options.</li>
<li><code>cleanup</code> (default: <code>false</code>) - Just cleanup and exit marmot. Useful for scenarios where you are
performing a cleanup of hooks and change logs.</li>
<li><code>save-snapshot</code> (default: <code>false</code> <code>Since 0.6.x</code>) - Just snapshot the local database, and upload snapshot
to NATS/S3 server</li>
<li><code>cluster-addr</code> (default: none <code>Since 0.8.x</code>) - Sets the binding address for cluster, when specifying
this flag at-least two nodes will be required (or <code>replication_log.replicas</code>). It's a simple
<code>&lt;bind_address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code> pair that can be used to bind cluster listening server.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Since <code>v0.8.4</code> Marmot will automatically expose a leaf server on <code>&lt;bind_address&gt;:&lt;port + 1&gt;</code>. This is
intended to reduce the number for flags. So if you expose cluster on port <code>4222</code> the port <code>4223</code> will
be automatically a leaf server listener.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>cluster-peers</code> (default: none <code>Since 0.8.x</code>) - Comma separated list of <code>nats://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code> peers of
NATS cluster. You can also use (Since version <code>v0.8.4</code> ) <code>dns://&lt;dns&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code> to A/AAAA record lookups.
Marmot will automatically resolve the DNS IPs at boot time to expand the routes with value of
<code>nats://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code> value, where <code>&lt;ip&gt;</code> is replaced with all the DNS entries queried. There
are two additional query parameters you can use:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>min</code> - forcing Marmot to wait for minimum number of entries (e.g. <code>dns://foo:4222/?min=3</code> will require
3 DNS entries to be present before embedded NATs server is started)</li>
<li><code>interval_ms</code> - delay between DNS queries, which will prevent Marmot from flooding DNS server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>leaf-server</code> (default: none <code>Since v0.8.4</code> )- Comma separated list of <code>nats://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code>
or <code>dns://&lt;dns&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code> just like <code>cluster-peers</code> can be used to connect to a cluster
as a leaf node.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thirty years ago, a botanist in Germany had a simple wish: to see the inner workings of woody plants without dissecting them. By bleaching away the pigments in plant cells, Siegfried Fink managed to <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/hfsg.1992.46.5.403/html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create transparent wood</a>, and he published his technique in a niche wood technology journal. The 1992 paper remained the last word on see-through wood for more than a decade, until a researcher named Lars Berglund stumbled across it.</p>
<p>Berglund was inspired by Fink’s discovery, but not for botanical reasons. The materials scientist, who works at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, specializes in polymer composites and was interested in creating a more robust alternative to transparent plastic. And he wasn’t the only one interested in wood’s virtues. Across the ocean, researchers at the University of Maryland were busy on a related goal: harnessing the strength of wood for nontraditional purposes.</p>
<p>Now, after years of experiments, the research of these groups is starting to bear fruit. Transparent wood could soon find uses in super-strong screens for smartphones; in soft, glowing light fixtures; and even as structural features, such as color-changing windows.</p>
<p>“I truly believe this material has a promising future,” says Qiliang Fu, a wood nanotechnologist at Nanjing Forestry University in China who worked in Berglund’s lab as a graduate student.</p>
<p>Wood is made up of countless little vertical channels, like a tight bundle of straws bound together with glue. These tube-shaped cells transport water and nutrients throughout <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2018/what-makes-tree-tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tree</a>, and when the tree is harvested and the moisture evaporates, pockets of air are left behind. To create see-through wood, scientists first need to modify or get rid of the glue, called lignin, that holds the cell bundles together and provides trunks and branches with most of their earthy brown hues. After bleaching lignin’s color away or otherwise removing it, a milky-white skeleton of hollow cells remains.</p>
<p>This skeleton is still opaque, because the cell walls bend light to a different degree than the air in the cell pockets does—a value called a refractive index. Filling the air pockets with a substance like epoxy resin that bends light to a similar degree to the cell walls renders the wood transparent.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The material the scientists worked with is thin—typically less than a millimeter to around a centimeter thick. But the cells create a sturdy honeycomb structure, and the tiny wood fibers are stronger than the best carbon fibers, says materials scientist Liangbing Hu, who leads the research group working on transparent wood at the University of Maryland in College Park. And with the resin added, transparent wood outperforms plastic and glass: In tests measuring how easily materials fracture or break under pressure, transparent wood came out around three times stronger than transparent plastics like Plexiglass and about 10 times tougher than glass.</p>
<p>“The results are amazing, that a piece of wood can be as strong as glass,” says Hu, who highlighted the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-matsci-010622-105440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features of transparent wood</a> in the 2023 Annual Review of Materials Research.</p>
<p>The process also works with thicker wood but the view through that substance is hazier because it scatters more light. In their original studies from 2016, Hu and Berglund both found that millimeter-thin sheets of the resin-filled wood skeletons let through 80 to 90 percent of light. As the thickness gets closer to a centimeter, light transmittance drops: Berglund’s group reported that 3.7-millimeter-thick wood—roughly two pennies thick—transmitted only 40 percent of light.</p>
<p>The slim profile and strength of the material means it could be a great alternative to products made from thin, easily shattered cuts of plastic or glass, such as display screens. The French company Woodoo, for example, uses a similar lignin-removing process in its wood screens, but leaves a bit of lignin to create a different color aesthetic. The company is tailoring its recyclable, touch-sensitive digital displays for products, including car dashboards and advertising billboards.</p>
<p>But most research has centered on transparent wood as an architectural feature, with windows a particularly promising use, says Prodyut Dhar, a biochemical engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology Varanasi. Transparent wood is a far better insulator than glass, so it could help buildings retain heat or keep it out. Hu and colleagues have also used polyvinyl alcohol, or PVA—a polymer used in glue and food packaging—to infiltrate the wood skeletons, making transparent wood that conducts heat at a rate <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.201907511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five times lower than that of glass,</a> the team reported in 2019 in Advanced Functional Materials.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://orlp.net/blog/magical-fibonacci-formulae/">https://orlp.net/blog/magical-fibonacci-formulae/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38599168">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<time datetime="2023-02-06">2023-02-06</time>
<p>The following Python function computes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
sequence</a>, without loops,
recursion or floating point arithmetic:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>f=</span><span>lambda </span><span>n:(b:=</span><span>2</span><span>&lt;&lt;n)**n*b//(b*b-b-</span><span>1</span><span>)%b
</span></code></pre>
<p>It really does:</p>
<pre data-lang="python"><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; [f(n) </span><span>for </span><span>n </span><span>in </span><span>range(</span><span>10</span><span>)]
</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>, </span><span>5</span><span>, </span><span>8</span><span>, </span><span>13</span><span>, </span><span>21</span><span>, </span><span>34</span><span>]
</span></code></pre>
<p>How does it work? As a teaser, look at the decimal expansions of $100 / 9899$
and $1000 / 998999$ and see if you notice anything:</p>
<p>$$\frac{100}{9899} = 0.0101020305081321345590463…$$
$$\frac{1000}{998999} = 0.001001002003005008013021034055089144233377610988…$$</p>
<h2 id="generating-functions"><a href="#generating-functions" aria-label="Anchor link for: generating-functions">Generating functions</a></h2>
<p>We define the Fibonacci sequence as 
\begin{align*}
f(0) &amp;= 0,\\
f(1) &amp;= 1,\\
f(n) &amp;= f(n - 1) + f(n - 2).
\end{align*}
However, we will also define a rather strange object known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function">generating
function</a>. It is an
‘infinite polynomial’ (also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series">power series</a>)
in variable $x$ whose <em>coefficients</em> correspond to our series of interest. This
gives us
$$F(x) = 0 + 1x + 1x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^4 + 5x^5 + 8x^6 + \cdots,$$
$$F(x) = f(0)x^0 + f(1)x^1 + f(2)x^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^n.$$</p>
<p>Does this function converge? Is this really allowed? All interesting questions
we are going to ignore here. Instead, let’s just start doing interesting things
with our new object, like taking out the first two terms from the sum:</p>

<p>$$F(x) = f(0)x^0 + f(1)x^1 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty f(n)x^n = x + \sum_{n=2}^\infty f(n)x^n.$$</p>
<p>We can also substitute $f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)$ now, because our iteration
variable starts at $2$:</p>
<p>\begin{align*}
F(x) &amp;= x + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \Big(f(n-1) + f(n-2) \Big)x^n\\
&amp;= x + \sum_{n=2}^\infty f(n-1)x^n + \sum_{n=2}^\infty f(n-2)x^n.
\end{align*}
Now we can substitute the loop variables, re-insert the $f(0)$ term (which is just
zero) into the first sum, and factor out the extra $x$ terms:
\begin{align*}
F(x) &amp;= x + \sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)x^{n+1} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^{n+2}\\
&amp;= x - f(0)x^{1} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^{n+1} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^{n+2}\\
&amp;= x + x\sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^{n} + x^2\sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^{n}.
\end{align*}</p>
<p>And now using the crucial observation that $F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^{n}$:
\begin{align*}
F(x) &amp;= x + xF(x) + x^2F(x),\\
(1 - x - x^2)F(x) &amp;= x,\\
F(x) &amp;= \frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}.
\end{align*}
Wow. Somehow the simple expression $x / (1 - x - x^2)$ ‘contains’ the entire
Fibonacci sequence. If you substitute $x = 10^{-3}$ in $F(x)$ you will retrieve
our earlier value
$$\frac{1000}{998999} = 0.001001002003005008013021034055089144233377610988…$$</p>

<p>Solving $1 - x - x^2 = 0$ with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula">quadratic formula</a> gives us
roots $-(\sqrt{5} \pm 1)/2$, which one might recognize as
the (negative) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a> $\phi$ and its inverse
$\phi^{-1}$:
$$\phi = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}, \quad \phi^{-1} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5} + 1} = \frac{2\left(\sqrt{5} - 1\right)}{\left(\sqrt{5} + 1\right)\left(\sqrt{5} - 1\right)} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}.$$</p>
<p>This allows us to factor and
use  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_fraction_decomposition">partial fraction decomposition</a>
on $F(x)$:
$$\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2} = \frac{x}{(1 - \phi x)(1 + \phi^{-1} x)} = \frac{1}{\phi + \phi^{-1}}\left(\frac{1}{1 - \phi x} - \frac{1}{1 + \phi^{-1} x}\right).$$
This is a rather arduous (but strictly elementary) algebraic process so it is much easier
to verify by expanding that the identity holds than following along.
To verify use the fact that $\phi \cdot \phi^{-1} = \phi - \phi^{-1} = 1$.</p>
<p>If we recall the formula
for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series">geometric series</a>,</p>
<p>$$\frac{1}{1 - r} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n,$$</p>
<p>and apply it to our above expression (once
again completely ignoring convergence) while
noticing that $\phi + \phi^{-1} = \sqrt{5}$ we find</p>
<p>$$F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left( \sum_{n=0}^\infty \phi^n x^n - \sum_{n=0}^\infty {(-\phi})^{-n} x^n \right),$$
$$F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left(  \phi^n - {(-\phi})^{-n} \right) x^n.$$</p>
<p>And now for the true magic, recall that we defined $F(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n)x^n$, and thus we conclude
$$f(n) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\phi^n - {(-\phi})^{-n} \right).$$</p>

<p>We have recovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Binet's_formula">Binet’s formula</a>
for the Fibonacci numbers, a closed form. Unfortunately evaluating it in
Python would eventually fail due to the use of floating-point numbers,
which is why this is only an interlude. But it is nevertheless cool:</p>

<p>Take another look at $F(10^{-3})$:</p>
<p>$$\frac{1000}{998999} = 0.001001002003005008013021034055089144233377610988…$$</p>
<p>Each next integer in the series starts three places shifted back from the previous
one. This makes sense, because $F(10^{-3})$ is the sum of $f(n)10^{-3n}$
for all $n$.</p>
<p>This also means that eventually the method fails, when numbers outgrow
three digits and overflow into the previous one. If we ignore that for now,
we can study $10^{3n} F(10^{-3})$:</p>

<p>If we could extract just the highlighted column we have our Fibonacci numbers.
Luckily, we can. By flooring we can remove the entire fractional part, and with
modulo $10^3$ we can ignore everything after the third digit.</p>
<p>We still have the overflowing issue however. But this is easily fixed by
choosing a number $k$ instead of $3$, large enough such that the next Fibonacci
number doesn’t overflow into our number of interest. For example the choice $k
= n$ works, as the $n$th Fibonacci number certainly won’t overflow $n$ decimal
digits, giving formula</p>
<p>$$f(n) = \lfloor 10^{n^2} \cdot F(10^{-n}) \rfloor \bmod 10^{n}.$$</p>
<p>We can generalize much more however. Our choice of $10^3$ and $10^n$ as bases
was rather arbitrary. You can use any base $b$, as long as $b$ is large enough. This gives:</p>

<p>$$f(n) = \left\lfloor b^n \cdot F(b^{-1}) \right\rfloor \bmod b,$$
$$f(n) = \left\lfloor b^n \cdot \frac{b^{-1}}{1 - b^{-1} - b^{-2}} \right\rfloor \bmod b,$$
$$f(n) = \left\lfloor \frac{b^{n+1}}{b^2 - b - 1} \right\rfloor \bmod b.$$</p>
<p>This is actually a closed form we can evaluate without the use of floating
point arithmetic, as it simply consists of the division of two integers.
I have experimentally found that choosing $b = 3^n$ suffices to not overflow
for computing $f(n)$, giving our magical formula:</p>

<p>We can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">golf</a> this quite a bit by using Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignment-expressions">“walrus operator”</a>
(also called <em>assignment expression</em> by boring people) introduced in Python 3.8. If you write <code>(foo := bar)</code>
in an expression the parentheses take on value <code>bar</code> as well as storing <code>bar</code>
in a new variable <code>foo</code> available in the rest of the expression. Finally as a

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With the addition of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">native AOT</a> in .NET 7, it became possible to compile C# into native code that doesn’t need a virtual machine to run. Instead of a “runtime” to manage the execution of the program, all that’s needed is a “runtime library”, like in C++.</p><p>Ability to compile to fully native code allows doing fun experiments, like replacing the runtime library that comes with the .NET SDK with something that is stripped to the bare minimum to run a very small subset of C#. You can build tiny programs where you can oversee every little aspect of its execution. I’ve been experimenting with what’s possible with the shipping .NET SDK in the <a href="https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/zerosharp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zerosharp repo</a>. One of the demos in the zerosharp repo is a bare metal <a href="https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/zerosharp/tree/master/efi-no-runtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boot application to display Hello World</a>.</p><p>While it is possible to hack the official .NET SDK into building a boot application like it’s done in zerosharp, it’s not particularly pleasant (see the number of hacks in the project file, and reimplementation of things like <code>System.Object</code> in the C# source file). I created the <a href="https://flattened.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bflat</a> project to make these kinds of experiments simpler.</p><p>Bflat is an ahead of time compiler for C# built from parts of the official .NET SDK. At its core is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dotnet/runtime</a> repository with a couple opinionated changes. This is built into the bflat CLI that exposes a C# compiler that can target both IL and native code.</p><p>The <a href="https://flattened.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bflat compiler</a> allows you to choose one of three options when it comes to the runtime libraries – you can either use the full runtime library that comes with .NET, or bflat’s own minimal implementation called zerolib, or no standard library at all.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>DotNet</th><th>Zero</th><th>None</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primitive types</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td></tr><tr><td>Rich standard library</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td><td>✗</td></tr><tr><td>Marshalling-less p/invoke</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Full p/invoke</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td><td>✗</td></tr><tr><td>Garbage collector</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td><td>✗</td></tr><tr><td>Exception handling</td><td>✓</td><td>✗</td><td>✗</td></tr><tr><td>Building apps and libraries</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Target Linux, Windows, Android</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Target UEFI</td><td>✗</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Starting app size</td><td>600 kB</td><td>4 kB</td><td>~4 kB</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Everything that I’m going to describe below is also possible to achieve with the official .NET SDK. It’s just a lot more work (and hacks) to get there, because as expected, the .NET SDK was not designed for this.</p><p>We’re going to build a small bootable maze “game” in C# that kind of looks like Wolfenstein 3D.</p><h2 id="the-boot-process-of-modern-computers">The boot process of modern computers</h2><p>In modern times, the firmware of a computer can provide a lot more services than it used to in the 1980s BIOS-based systems. The boot process of most of today’s computers follows the UEFI standard. UEFI is an extensible standard that defines an interface for interaction of hardware with the operating system and its boot loader.</p><p>The UEFI firmware knows how to access storage devices, read files from their file system, or load executables from it. In a way, the firmware looks like a very simple operating system. The bflat compiler can target it by specifying the <code>--os:uefi</code> argument to <code>bflat build</code>. A simple hello world looks exactly the way you’d expect it.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="csharp"><span><span><span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World"</span><span>);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Build with:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ bflat build --stdlib:zero --os:uefi --arch:x64 -o:bootx64.efi hello.cs
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The generated bootx64.efi file can now be placed on a FAT32-formatted USB flash drive (must be placed under <code>efi/boot</code> directory) and a UEFI-compatible computer should be able to boot from it. If the computer is configured to boot from the USB device, the UEFI boot environment will look for a file named <code>efi/boot/bootx64.efi</code> (or <code>efi/boot/bootaa64.efi</code> for ARM64) and execute it.</p><p>Bflat’s zerolib contains an implementation of <code>System.Console</code> that uses UEFI APIs to talk to the firmware. We’ll talk about those later. If you look at the samples that come with bflat, you’ll find a small <a href="https://github.com/bflattened/bflat/tree/master/samples/Snake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snake game</a> that uses Console APIs for I/O. The game is written in a platform agnostic way and can be built for any of the OSes supported by bflat with either the standard runtime library, or zerolib. The runtime library papers over any platform differences.</p><h2 id="doing-graphics-in-uefi">Doing graphics in UEFI</h2><p>Doing graphics is harder. The bflat project doesn’t want to be in the business of adding extensions to APIs in .NET that are not built into it in the first place. Any bflat project should also be a valid .NET project (although the set of supported platforms, or characteristics like size might be different). I often wish .NET had a built-in crossplat API to push pixels to the screen and samples to the speakers like libSDL. Unfortunately, there isn’t one, so it follows that bflat doesn’t have one either.</p><p>But since C# makes it easy to interoperate with unmanaged code through p/invoke (platform invoke), we can easily make one. On most platforms, interoperating with external APIs is done though dynamic loading. The executable file specifies the name of the API (optionally also name of the dynamic library implementing the API) and the operating system loader fixes things up at startup so that the API is callable when the program starts executing. The p/invoke mechanism used is called <code>DllImport</code>.</p><p>On UEFI, most communication is done through interfaces. At program start, the program entrypoint receives a pointer to the “EFI system table” from the UEFI firmware. This table contains a set of function pointers to access various services. This matches what .NET exposes under a different p/invoke mechanism - this one is called unmanaged function pointers.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="csharp"><span><span><span>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]</span>

The zerolib in bflat abstracts all of this behind the standard APIs it implements, like <code>Console.WriteLine</code>. Unfortunately this also means that we don’t have access to this from user code – the C# <code>Main</code> starts with a method that takes an array of <code>string</code> (command line arguments), not a pointer to the system table.</p><p>Peeking into zerolib implementation, we can see that zerolib internally stores this in the <code>object. s_efiSystemTable</code> field.

The pair of interlocking logs joined by an intentionally cut notch was unearthed beneath a bank of Zambia’s Kalambo River by a team led by University of Liverpool archaeologist Larry Barham. Researchers believe the logs may have formed part of a walkway or the foundation of a platform built over wetlands. Prior to this discovery, the oldest known surviving wooden structures were built by people living in northern England around 11,000 years ago.</p>

<p>The 476,000-year-old log structure predates the appearance of the first modern humans by some 150,000 years and was likely the handiwork of the archaic human species <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em>. Paleoanthropologists believe <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> was highly mobile. Thus, it is surprising that the hominins would have invested labor in building a semipermanent structure. “We haven’t seen archaic humans manipulating their environment on such a large scale before,” says Barham. “It suggests an attachment to a single point on the landscape.”</p>

<p>At the same site, the team unearthed stone axes as well as four wooden tools dating to between 390,000 and 324,000 years ago. These included a digging stick, a wedge-shaped object, a notched branch, and a flattened log. Marks on the log, notes Barham, resemble nothing so much as tool nicks on a work bench, inviting speculation as to what other structures an imaginative <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> woodworker might have fashioned.</p>	</div></div>]]></description>

We start simple: la plateforme serves three chat endpoints for generating text following textual instructions and an embedding endpoint. Each endpoint has a different performance/price tradeoff.</p><h4 id="generative-endpoints">Generative endpoints</h4><p>The two first endpoints, mistral-tiny and mistral-small, currently use our two released open models; the third, mistral-medium, uses a prototype model with higher performances that we are testing in a deployed setting.</p><p>We serve instructed versions of our models. We have worked on consolidating the most effective alignment techniques (efficient fine-tuning, direct preference optimisation) to create easy-to-control and pleasant-to-use models. We pre-train models on data extracted from the open Web and perform instruction fine-tuning from annotations.</p><p><strong>Mistral-tiny</strong>. Our most cost-effective endpoint currently serves Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, a new minor release of Mistral 7B Instruct.
Mistral-tiny only works in English. It obtains 7.6 on MT-Bench.
The instructed model can be downloaded <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Mistral-small</strong>. This endpoint currently serves our newest model, Mixtral 8x7B, described in more detail in our <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts">blog post</a>.
It masters English/French/Italian/German/Spanish and code and obtains 8.3 on MT-Bench.</p><p><strong>Mistral-medium</strong>. Our highest-quality endpoint currently serves a prototype model,
that is currently among the top serviced models available based on standard benchmarks. It masters English/French/Italian/German/Spanish and code and obtains a score of 8.6 on MT-Bench. The following table compare the performance of the base models of Mistral-medium, Mistral-small and the endpoint of a competitor.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/la-plateforme/mistral-medium.png" alt="mistral-medium" width="50%"></p><h4 id="embedding-endpoint">Embedding endpoint</h4><p>Mistral-embed, our embedding endpoint, serves an embedding model with a 1024 embedding dimension. Our embedding model has been designed with retrieval capabilities in mind. It achieves a retrieval score of <strong>55.26</strong> on MTEB.</p><h4 id="api-specifications">API specifications</h4><p>Our API follows the specifications of the popular chat interface initially proposed by our dearest competitor. We provide a Python and Javascript client library to query our endpoints. Our endpoints allow users to provide a system prompt to set a higher level of moderation on model outputs for applications where this is an important requirement.</p><h4 id="ramping-up-from-beta-access-to-general-availability">Ramping up from beta access to general availability</h4><p>Anyone can <a href="https://console.mistral.ai/">register</a> to use our API as of today as we progressively ramp up our capacity. Our business team can help qualify your needs and accelerate access. Expect rough edges as we stabilise our platform towards fully self-served availability.</p><h4 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h4><p>We are grateful to Nvidia for supporting us in integrating TRT-LLM and Triton and working alongside us to make a sparse mixture of experts compatible with TRT-LLM.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B on most benchmarks with 6x faster inference. It is the strongest open-weight model with a permissive license and the best model overall regarding cost/performance trade-offs. In particular, it matches or outperforms GPT3.5 on most standard benchmarks.</p><p>Mixtral has the following capabilities.</p><ul><li>It gracefully handles a context of 32k tokens.</li><li>It handles English, French, Italian, German and Spanish.</li><li>It shows strong performance in code generation.</li><li>It can be finetuned into an instruction-following model that achieves a score of 8.3 on MT-Bench.</li></ul><h4 id="pushing-the-frontier-of-open-models-with-sparse-architectures">Pushing the frontier of open models with sparse architectures</h4><p>Mixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward block picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the “experts”) to process the token and combine their output additively.</p><p>This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.
Concretely, Mixtral has 45B total parameters but only uses 12B parameters per token. It, therefore, processes input and generates output at the same speed and for the same cost as a 12B model.</p><p>Mixtral is pre-trained on data extracted from the open Web – we train experts and routers simultaneously.</p><h4 id="performance">Performance</h4><p>We compare Mixtral to the Llama 2 family and the GPT3.5 base model.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every now and then, when working on ScummVM’s Director engine, I run across a disc that charms me so much I just have to get it working right away. That happened when I ran into Classical Cats, a digital art gallery focused on the work of Japanese artist and classical musician Mitsuhiro Amada. I <a href="https://cdrom.ca/games/2023/12/06/classical-cats.html">wrote about the disc’s contents</a> in more detail at my <a href="https://cdrom.ca/">CD-ROM blog</a>, but needless to say I was charmed—I wanted to share this with more people.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/images/classicalcats/scummvm-classicalcats-mac-ja-00004.png" alt="Screenshot of a cat playing piano next to a cat playing a violin and a cat playing cello"></p>

<p>I first found out about Classical Cats when fellow ScummVM developer einstein95 pointed me at it because its music wasn’t working. Like a lot of early Director discs, Classical Cats <em>mostly</em> just worked on the first try. At this point in ScummVM’s development, I’m often more surprised if a disc made in Director 3 or 4 fails to boot right away. The one thing that didn’t work was the music.</p>

<p>Classical Cats uses CD audio for its music, and I’d already written code to support this in early releases of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/2059/alice-an-interactive-museum/">Alice: An Interactive Museum</a> for Mac. I’d optimistically hoped that Classical Cats might be as easy, but it turned out to present some extra technical complexity. Regardless, for a disc called “Classical” Cats, I knew that getting music working would be important. I could tell that I wasn’t having the full experience.</p>

<p>While many CD-ROMs streamed their music from files on the disc, some discs used CD audio tracks for music instead. (If you’re already familiar with CD audio and mixed-mode CDs, you can skip to the next paragraph.) CD audio is the same format used in audio CDs; these tracks aren’t files in a directory and don’t have names, but are simply numbered tracks like you’d see in a CD player. Data on a CD is actually contained within a track on the disc, just like audio; data tracks are just skipped over by CD players. A <em>mixed mode</em> CD is one that contains a mixture of one or more data tracks and one or more audio tracks on the same disc. This was often used by games and multimedia discs as a simple and convenient way to store their audio.</p>

<p>Director software is written in its own programming language called Lingo; I’ve written about it <a href="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/blog/2022/01/06/do-you-speak-the-lingo/">a few</a> <a href="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/blog/2023/05/29/untangling-another-lingo-parser-edge-case/">times</a> before. In addition to writing logic in Lingo, developers are able to write modules called XObjects; these can be implemented in another language like C, but expose an interface to Lingo code. It works very similarly to C extensions in languages like Ruby or Python.</p>

<p>While ScummVM is able to run Lingo code directly, it doesn’t emulate the original XObjects. Instead, it contains new clean-room reimplementations embedded into ScummVM that expose the same interfaces as the originals. If a disc tries to call an unimplemented XObject, ScummVM just logs a warning and is able to continue. I’d already implemented one of Director’s builtin audio CD XObjects earlier, which was how I fixed Alice’s music earlier.</p>

<p>ScummVM has builtin support for playing emulated audio CDs by replacing the audio tracks with MP3 or FLAC files. For Alice, I <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/pull/4231">wrote</a> an implementation of Director’s builtin Apple Audio CD XObject. That version was straightforward and easy to implement; it has a minimal API that allows an app to request playback of a CD via track number, which maps perfectly onto ScummVM’s virtual CD backend.</p>

<p>I already knew Classical Cats uses a different XObject, and so I’d have to write a new implementation for it, it turns out the API was very different from Alice’s. Alice, along with many other Director games I’ve looked at, uses a fairly high-level, track-oriented API that was simple to implement. ScummVM’s builtin CD audio infrastructure is great at handling requests like “play track 5”, or “play the first 30 seconds of track 7”. What it’s not at all prepared for is requests like “play from position 12:00:42 on the disc”.</p>

<p>You can probably guess what Classical Cats does! Instead of working with tracks, it starts and stops playback based on absolute positions on a disc. This may sound strange, but it’s how the disc itself is set up. On a real CD, tracks themselves are just indices into where tracks start and stop on a disc, and a regular CD player looks up those indices to decide where to seek to when you ask it to play a particular track. In theory, it’s pretty similar to dropping a record player needle on a specific spot on the disc.</p>

<p>This might not sound too complex to manage, but there’s actually something that makes it a lot harder: translating requests to play an absolute timecode to an audio file on disc. ScummVM isn’t (usually) playing games from a real CD, but emulating a drive using the game data and FLAC or MP3 files replacing the CD audio tracks. ScummVM generally plays games using the data extracted from the CD into a folder on the hard drive, which causes a problem: the data track on a mixed mode CD is usually the first track, which means that the timing of every other track on the disc is offset by the length of the data track. We can’t guess where anything else is stored without knowing exactly how long the data track is. If we’ve extracted the data from the CD, we no longer know how big that track is, and we can’t guess at the layout of the rest of the disc.</p>

<p>“Knowing the disc layout” is a common problem with CD ripping and authoring, and a number of standards exist already. Single-disc data CDs can easily be represented as an ISO file, but anything more complex requires an actual table of contents. When thinking about how to solve this problem for ScummVM, I immediately thought of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sheet_(computing">cuesheets</a>)—one of the most popular table of contents formats for CD ripping, and one that’s probably familiar to gamers who have used BIN/CUE rips of 32-bit era video games. Among all the formats available for documenting a disc’s table of contents, cuesheets were attractive for a few reasons: I’ve worked with it before, so I’m already familiar with it; it’s human-readable, so it’s easy to validate that it’s being used properly; and it provides a simple, high-level interface that abstracts away irrelevant details that I wouldn’t need to implement this feature. A sample cuesheet for a mixed mode CD looks something like this:</p>

<figure><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>7</span>
<span>8</span>
<span>9</span>
<span>10</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>FILE "CLSSCATS.BIN" BINARY
</span><span>  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
</span><span>    INDEX 01 00:00:00
</span><span>  TRACK 02 AUDIO
</span><span>    PREGAP 00:02:00
</span><span>    INDEX 01 17:41:36
</span><span>  TRACK 03 AUDIO
</span><span>    INDEX 01 19:20:46
</span><span>  TRACK 04 AUDIO
</span><span>    INDEX 01 22:09:17</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Once you understand the format, it’s straightforward to read and makes it clear exactly where every track is located on the disc.</p>

<p>The main blocker here was simply that ScummVM didn’t have a cuesheet parser yet, and I wasn’t eager to write one myself. Just when I was on the verge of switching to another solution, however, ScummVM project lead Eugene Sandulenko offered to write a new one integrated into ScummVM itself. As soon as that was ready, I was able to get to work.</p>

<p>The XObject Classical Cats uses has a fairly complicated interface that’s meant to support not just CDs, but also media like video cassettes. To keep things simple, I decided to limit myself to implementing just the API that this disc uses and ignore methods it never calls. It’s hard to make sure my implementation’s compatible if I don’t actually see parts of it in use, after all. By watching to see which method stubs are called, I could see that I mainly had to deal with a limit set of methods. Aside from being able to see which methods are called and the arguments passed to them, I was able to consult the official documentation in the Director 4.0 manual.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Two of the most fundamental methods I began with were <code>mSetInPoint</code> and <code>mSetOutPoint</code>, whose names were pretty self-explanatory. Rather than have a single method to begin playback with start/stop positions, this library uses a cue system. Callers first call <code>mSetInPoint</code> to define the start playback position and <code>mSetOutPoint</code> to set a stop position. These positions are tracked in <em>frames</em>, a unit representing 1/75th of a second.</p>

<p>On a real drive, they can then call <code>mPlayCue</code> to seek to the start of the position so that the drive is ready. Given the slow seek times of early CD-ROM drives, this separation forced developers to consider that the device might not actually be able to start playback as soon as they request it and take that into account with their app’s interactive features. After starting the seek operation, the developer was meant to repeatedly call <code>mService</code> to retrieve a status code and find out whether the drive was still seeking, had finished seeking, or encountered an error. Since ScummVM is usually acting on an emulated drive without actual seek times, I simplified this. <code>mSetInPoint</code> and <code>mSetOutPoint</code> simply assign instance variables with the appropriate values, and <code>mService</code> always immediately returns the “drive ready” code.</p>

<p>At this point, I did what I should have done in the first place and checked the source code. As I mentioned in a <a href="https://www.mistys-internet.website/blog/blog/2022/01/06/do-you-speak-the-lingo/">previous post</a>, early Director software includes the source code as a part of the binary, and luckily that’s true for Classical Cats. As I checked its CD-ROM helper library, I stumbled on the method that made me realize exactly where I’d gone wrong:</p>

<figure><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
<span>5</span>
<span>6</span>
<span>7</span>
<span>8</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>on mGetFirstFrame me, aTrack
</span><span>  put the pXObj of me into myXObj
</span><span>  if myXObj(mRespondsTo, "mGetFirstFrame") = 0 then
</span><span>    return 0
</span><span>  else
</span><span>    return  myXObj(mGetFirstFrame, aTrack)
</span><span>  end if
</span><span>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>This code might be familiar to Rubyists, since Ruby has a very similar construct. This class wraps the AppleCD SC XObject, instantiated in the instance variable <code>myXObj</code>, and calls methods on it. But it’s written defensively: before calling a number of methods, it calls <code>mRespondsTo</code> first to see if <code>myXObj</code> has the requested method. If it doesn’t, it just stubs it out instead of erroring. Since ScummVM implements <code>mRespondsTo</code> correctly, it means this code was doing what the original authors intended: seeing that my implementation of AppleCD SC didn’t have an <code>mGetFirstFrame</code> method, and just returning a stub value. Unfortunately for me, I was being lazy and had chosen which methods to implement based on seeing the disc try to use them—so I let myself be tricked into thinking those methods were never used.</p>

<p>As it turns out, they were actually key to getting the right timing data. Classical Cats was trying to ask the CD drive about timing information for tracks, and storing that to use to actually play the songs. With these methods missing, it was stuck without knowing where the songs were and how to play them.</p>

<p>And here I realized the great irony of what I was doing. Internally, Classical Cats thinks about its audio in terms of tracks, and asks the XObject for absolute timing data for each track. It then passes that data back into the XObject to play the songs, where ScummVM intercepts it and translates it back into track-oriented timing so its CD drive emulation knows how to play them. It’s a lot of engineering work just to take it all full circle.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, what’s important is it <em>does</em> work. Before I finished writing this, it was difficult to play Classical Cats on any modern computer; now, anyone with the latest version of ScummVM can give it a try. Now that it’s more accessible, I hope other people are able to discover it too.</p>

<p>Note: CD audio support for this disc is available in nightly builds of ScummVM, and will be available in a future stable release.</p>
