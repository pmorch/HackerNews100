Development of this dictionary started in 1998 
under the editorship of Paul E. Black. </p>

<p>
This is a dictionary of algorithms, algorithmic techniques, 
data structures, archetypal problems, and related definitions.
Algorithms include common functions, such as
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/ackermann.html">Ackermann's function</a>.
Problems include 
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/travelingSalesman.html">traveling salesman</a> and
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/byzantine.html">Byzantine generals</a>.
Some entries have links to <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/termsImpl.html">implementations</a>
and more information.
Index pages list entries by 
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/termsArea.html">area</a> and by
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/termsType.html">type</a>.
The <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/terms2.html">two-level
index</a> has a total download 1/20 as big as this page.
</p>

<p>
Don't use this site to cheat.  Teachers, contact us if we can help.
</p>

<p>
Currently we do not include algorithms particular to business data processing, communications, operating systems or distributed algorithms,
programming languages, AI, graphics, or numerical analysis: it is
tough enough covering "general" algorithms and data structures.

Some terms with a leading variable, such as <em>n</em>-way,
<em>m</em>-dimensional, or <em>p</em>-branching, are under
<a href="#K"><em>k</em>-</a>.

		<p>Epic Games, the maker of hits such as Fortnite, just <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic">laid off 16% of staff</a>, or 830 people — and it’s <a href="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition">sold Bandcamp to Songtradr</a>, a music licensing company.</p>
<p>Epic is privately-held, so it doesn’t have Wall Street analysts to answer to — but it went on a spending spree through 2021 and 2022, and the numbers evidently weren’t adding up. Bandcamp is still profitable, but that makes it just a particuarly saleable non-core business. Also dumped was SuperAwesome, a “youth marketing solutions” company, in an upper management buyout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bandcampunited.org/">Bandcamp unionised</a> in March 2023. Game development companies are allergic to unions, so that probably made Bandcamp a fair bit less attractive. Epic even <a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/04/10/bandcamp-reportedly-union-busting-by-pressuring-record-labels.html">tried to get record labels to pressure the Bandcamp United union</a> to stop their efforts.</p>
<p>Epic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_v._Apple">lost most of an expensive lawsuit against Apple</a> in 2021, and both sides are appealing to the US Supreme Court at further expense.</p>
<p>Epic only <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/bandcamp-joining-epic-games-to-support-fair-open-platforms-for-artists-and-fans">bought Bandcamp eighteen months ago</a>. Nobody could work out quite what Epic could do with Bandcamp. That seems to include Epic. It didn’t have synergy with game development or distribution.</p>
<p>Bandcamp is good, it’s profitable and sustainable and it basically works. <a href="https://rocknerd.co.uk/2016/08/29/is-bandcamp-the-holy-grail-of-online-record-stores-hell-yes/">Musicians love Bandcamp</a> and depend on it. They worried at the Epic sale and now they wonder what the Songtradr sale means.</p>
<p>Plus point: at least Songtradr is in the same business. Minus point: at least Epic wasn’t in the same business, and didn’t mess with Bandcamp, despite many musicians’ fears when they bought it.</p>
<p>Songtradr is talking up using its licensing prowess to give opportunities to Bandcamp artists — including licensing on Epic games.</p>
<p>Songtradr can’t just grab your Bandcamp uploads. Sync licensing (TV or movies) is very lucrative and hence legally complex. You need to licence both the composition and the desired recording of it.</p>
<p>Games are one of the places composers can get work these days. Game music and classical are the same genre, right? If Songtradr can hook up composers with Epic or other companies, there are <i>plenty</i> of composers who will be extremely interested.</p>
<p>Thinking of <a href="https://rocknerd.co.uk/2021/11/01/arkady-rose-nocturne-2021/">the loved one,</a> with her <a href="https://arkadyrose.bandcamp.com/">six albums of light classical</a>. Buy a CD, we got a box of ’em here! Goes great with your game!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bing-chat-responses-infiltrated-by-ads-pushing-malware/">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bing-chat-responses-infiltrated-by-ads-pushing-malware/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37694524">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Bing Chat" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2023/02/17/bing-chat-header-blue.jpg" width="1561"></p>
<p>Malicious advertisements are now being injected into Microsoft's AI-powered Bing Chat responses, promoting fake download sites that distribute malware.</p>
<p>Bing Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 engine, was introduced by Microsoft in February 2023 to challenge Google's dominance in the search industry.</p>
<p>By offering users an interactive chat-based experience instead of the traditional search query and result format, Bing Chat aimed to make online searches more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
<p>In March, Microsoft began injecting ads into Bing Chat conversations to generate revenue from this new platform.</p>
<p>However, incorporating ads into Bing Chat has opened the door to threat actors, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-access-brokers-use-google-ads-to-breach-your-network/" target="_blank">increasingly take</a>&nbsp;out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abuse-google-ads-to-spread-malware-in-legit-software/" target="_blank">search advertisements to distribute malware</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, conversing with AI-powered chat tools can instill unwarranted trust, potentially convincing users to click on ads, which isn't the case when skimming through impersonal search results.</p>
<p>This conversation-like interaction can imbue AI-provided URLs with a misplaced sense of authority and trustworthiness, so the existing problem of malvertizing in search platforms is amplified by the introduction of AI assistants.</p>
<p>The fact that these ads are labeled as promoted results when the user hovers over a link in Bing Chat conversations is likely too weak of a measure to mitigate the risk.</p>
<h2>Imitating a popular IP scanner</h2>
<p>Malicious ads&nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/09/malicious-ad-served-inside-bing-ai-chatbot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">spotted by Malwarebytes</a>&nbsp;are pretending to be download sites for the popular 'Advanced IP Scanner' utility, which has been previously used by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cuba-ransomware-affiliate-targets-ukrainian-govt-agencies/" target="_blank">RomCom RAT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-says-russian-hacktivists-use-new-somnia-ransomware/" target="_blank">Somnia ransomware</a>&nbsp;operators.</p>
<p>The researchers found that when you asked Bing Chat how to download Advanced IP Scanner, it would display a link to download it in the chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you hover over&nbsp;an underlined&nbsp;link in a chat, Bing Chat may show an advertisement first, followed by the legitimate download link. In this case, the sponsored link was a malvertisements pushing malware.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="The risky URL served in a Bing Chat conversation" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/result.jpg" width="977"><figcaption><strong>The risky URL served in a Bing Chat conversation</strong><br><em>Source:&nbsp;Malwarebytes</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The malvertizing campaign was created by someone who hacked into the ad account of a legitimate Australian business to create two malicious ads targeting system admins (IP scanner) and lawyers (MyCase law manager).</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Malicious ads created by the threat actor" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/microsoft-ad-library.jpg" width="994"><figcaption><strong>Malicious ads created by the threat actor</strong><br><em>Source:&nbsp;Malwarebytes</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Clicking on the malicious ad for the IP scanner takes users to a website ('mynetfoldersip[.]cfd') that separates bots and crawlers from human victims by checking IP address, timezone, and various system indicators for sandbox/virtual machines.</p>
<p>The victims are then redirected to 'advenced-ip-scanner[.]com', a clone of Advanced IP Scanner that uses typosquatting (notice the <strong>e</strong> in adv<strong>e</strong>nced) to trick visitors.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="The redirect chain" height="533" width="1003" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/redirects.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/redirects.jpg"><figcaption><strong>The redirect chain</strong> <em>(Malwarebytes)</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The downloaded MSI installer contains three files, one of which is a heavily obfuscated malicious script that connects to an external resource to retrieve the payload.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Malicious VBS in the downloaded MSI" height="600" width="744" data-src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/script.jpg" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2023/Adware/9/script.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Malicious VBS in the downloaded MSI</strong> <em>(Malwarebytes)</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Unfortunately, Malwarebytes could not find the final payload for this malware campaign, so it is unclear what malware is ultimately being installed.</p>
<p>However, in similar campaigns, threat actors commonly distribute information-stealing malware or remote access trojans that allow them to breach other accounts or corporate networks.</p>
<p>The display of malvertising within Bing Chat conversations highlights the expanding frontier of cyber threats and makes it crucial for users to be wary of chatbot results and always double-check URLs before downloading anything.</p>

<p>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss secretly withdrew more than $280 million held by their crypto company’s bank — mere months before the firm’s collapse left the <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/17/winklevoss-twins-gemini-crypto-exchange-caught-up-in-ftx-meltdown/">twins’ customers unable to&nbsp;access their deposits</a>, The Post has learned.</p>



<p>The Winklevoss twins, best known for their bitter feud with former Harvard classmate Mark Zuckerberg over control of Facebook, have lately been embroiled in another nasty legal battle — this time with billionaire Barry Silbert, whose company Digital Currency Group owns the now-bankrupt crypto bank Genesis<a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/05/winklevoss-twins-owed-900m-by-crypto-broker-as-ftx-contagion-spreads/">. </a></p>



<p>The twins are cofounders of Gemini, a once-rising digital currency exchange that has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/23/winklevoss-twins-slashing-10-of-geminis-workforce-report/">plagued this year by layoffs</a> and plunging trading volume. </p>



<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/05/winklevoss-twins-owed-900m-by-crypto-broker-as-ftx-contagion-spreads/">Some $900 million in Gemini customer deposits</a> were frozen last Nov. 16, after Genesis was exposed to the meltdown of disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire and forced to suspend withdrawals.</p>



<p>The feud between the Winklevoss twins and Silbert is centered around Gemini Earn — an interest-bearing account program that they billed to customers as a way to earn 8% annual interest on their digital currency deposits.</p>



<p>The twins’ company Gemini yanked money from Genesis, the lender for the Earn program, on Aug. 9 of last year, according to a review of the internal emails and documents obtained by The Post and interviews with sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>It is unclear if the withdrawn funds were Gemini corporate assets or from the Winklevoss twins’ personal crypto stash. </p>



<p>Notably, the sum did not include any Gemini customer funds.</p>



<p>One document included a balance sheet showing Gemini deposits on Genesis had declined by roughly $176 million between Aug. 5 and Aug. 10 of last year. </p>



<p>The five-day window included a $282 million withdrawal, which was partially offset by customer deposit inflows and fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices, sources said.</p>



<p>A second document, an email dated Aug. 8, 2022, a day before the withdrawal, detailed the Winklevoss’s request and contained a full breakdown of the $282 million figure. </p>

<p>The sum included 3,120 bitcoins, 18,060 ether and more than 142 million units of Gemini’s “stablecoin,” which is pegged to the US dollar.</p>



<p>The tally also included more than 49.6 million units of Dogecoin, the canine-themed meme currency favored by Tesla boss Elon Musk, and several other digital currencies. </p>



<p>At the time, Doge units were worth about six cents each.</p>





<p>“They pulled out their own money, whether that’s corporate funds or their own personal [funds] — only a few months before Genesis announced they were putting up the gates and customers would not be able to withdraw their assets,” one source said.</p>



<p>“They decided they were comfortable for the Earn customers but not comfortable for themselves,” the source added.</p>



<p>Gemini and the Winklevoss twins did not immediately return requests for comment. </p>



<p>DCG declined to comment.</p>



<p>While it’s not known why they withdrew the funds, the twins’ move to pull their money, months before Genesis suspended customer withdrawals, raises questions about what they knew in August 2022 and could undercut their claims in a pending lawsuit that they were unaware of the extent of the lender’s financial woes.</p>



<p>In July, the Winklevoss twins sued Silbert and Digital Currency Group. </p>



<p>The complaint alleged Silbert provided a “false, misleading, and incomplete representation” of Genesis’s financial health, leaving them in the dark.</p>



<p>The twins claimed DCG assured them it had backstopped Genesis during a liquidity crunch that emerged earlier in 2022, when the lender lost $1.1 billion on a loan to the doomed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.</p>

<p>In reality, the suit claims, Silbert’s firm had merely provided a promissory note — essentially a corporate IOU – rather than a cash infusion. </p>



<p>The brothers added that they tried to pull out of the “Earn” partnership in mid-October of 2022, only for Silbert to convince them not to do so during a face-to-face meeting.</p>



<p>“In direct reliance on Silbert’s misrepresentations, Gemini elected to delay the termination of the Gemini Earn Program — and not to explore the possibility of pursuing more rapid termination or other relief, as Gemini would have done if Silbert had stated the truth,” the suit said.</p>



<p>DCG has described accusations of wrongdoing in Gemini’s lawsuit as “baseless, defamatory, and completely false” and filed a motion last month to dismiss the suit.</p>

<p>Since the debate over whether cryptocurrency products are securities is still being decided in various court cases, the legality of the Winklevoss twins’ withdrawal is open to interpretation, according to John Coffee, an expert on securities law and professor at Columbia Law School.</p>



<p>Regardless, Coffee said the withdrawal is “dubious” for any firm presenting itself as a legitimate operator.</p>





<p>“A minimal respect for customers would require a credible broker or a credible financial entrepreneur to disclose that it’s liquidating its own investments as it’s selling you large quantities,” Coffee said.</p>



<p>Even if existing securities law doesn’t apply, <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/29/winklevoss-twins-sued-by-gemini-investors-over-900m-crypto-crisis/">Gemini and its cofounders could face legal headaches</a> in the form of class-action lawsuits or standard fraud claims, according to James Park, a former assistant attorney general in the New York State AG’s Investor Protection Bureau.</p>



<p>“It doesn’t have to be a security for there to be fraud. For the SEC to get involved, you do need it to be a security, but if I’m filing a private class action, I can base that upon general fraud claims,” Park said, now a law professor at UCLA.</p>



<p>The legal battle between the Winklevoss twins and Silbert has unfolded during a period of major turmoil for Gemini’s business. </p>



<p>The firm’s US market share by trading volume has collapsed to just 1% as of this year – down from 26% in 2017, according to data from research firm Kaiko&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/09/gemini-flounders-as-accusations-fly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited by Axios last month</a>.</p>

<p>Genesis’ financial problems accelerated last fall, when FTX’s downfall in November sparked an industrywide “bank run” within the sector and left the lender unable to meet its obligations.</p>



<p>As the $900 million in Gemini customer funds remained in limbo last January, Cameron Winklevoss publicly accused&nbsp;<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/03/geminis-winklevoss-twins-accuse-barry-silbert-of-bad-faith/">Silbert in January of “bad faith stall tactics”</a>&nbsp;that were preventing a resolution.</p>



<p>Later that same month, Genesis filed for bankruptcy, kicking off creditor process that has yet to be resolved.</p>







<p>Since May, DCG, Genesis and its creditors have been locked in court-mediated negotiations to resolve the claims.</p>



<p>Last month, the parties announced a preliminary agreement that could result in 70% to 90% recoveries for unsecured creditors —&nbsp;but <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/gemini-legal-team-accuses-dcg-gaslighting-genesis-creditors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini and other parties oppose the deal, which has yet to be finalized.</a></p>



<p>Last January, the SEC sued Winklevoss twins’ Gemini crypto exchange and Genesis. </p>



<p>At the time, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the firms had “offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors.”</p>

		<p><span>A</span>t the university press where I work as an acquisitions editor, my email inbox is a reminder of how much authors <em>care</em> about their books—and with good reason. Scholarly books are the culmination of years of intensive research, writing, and revision, often with major personal and professional stakes. They are labors of love and many other feelings, too: excitement, anxiety, frustration. Many are written in hopes of getting a full-time faculty position, tenure and therefore long-term job security, or promotion. But that’s not always the case or the result, especially given the brutal adjunctification of the academic workforce. I wrote my own university press monograph while working full-time outside academia and hoping—for a while at least—to get a tenure-track job. That was before I started working at a university press and gained a far fuller appreciation of just how much publishers care, too.</p>
<p>One of my coworkers in the production department once described her job to me as helping authors’ dreams come true. As publishers, we help authors <a href="https://jacobin.com/2014/01/in-the-name-of-love/">do what they love</a>. But university press publishing is just as vocationalized as the rest of higher education. University presses are not-for-profit and mission-driven, aligned in our commitment to the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/02/05/why-institutions-should-continue-support-their-university-presses-opinion">advancement of knowledge</a>. Yet we vary significantly: in parent institutions and locations within the university; in budgets and business models; in size, staffing, and subject areas; in the types and formats of our publications.</p>
<p>Although more people happen into university press work than some scholars might imagine, we, too, are prone to loving what we do. Like authors, we care about the fields we help to shape, the books we help to create, and the scholarly communities of which we are a part. We also care about doing our jobs well and about having good jobs in a sector where they are increasingly hard to come by, at least for the rank and file.</p>

<p>As fellow workers in and around higher education, university press publishers and scholars occupy the same economy, with the cares, commitments, challenges, and changes on one side mirrored on the other. I use this term <em>economy</em> quite intentionally. More often than not, scholarly publishing gets described as an “ecosystem.” I worry that in “naturalizing” our operations, environmental metaphors conceal more than they reveal about what we do and the conditions in which we do it.</p>
<p>Scholars and publishers have our own unique areas of expertise, responsibilities, and experiences of the manifold crises into which higher education is perpetually forced. But at base, <em>scholars’ working conditions are publishers’ working conditions</em>. If we want to change these conditions, we have to begin by recognizing—and working together to find—our common ground. Manufactured austerity; corporatization; competition over supposedly scarce resources; attrition and downsizing; mass PhD production; adjunctification; shrinking enrollments; escalating expectations to publish or perish; and, of course, the ongoing devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the right’s war against academic freedom: <em>these issues affect us all</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The last few years have seen heartening acts of solidarity with university press publishers. In 2019, Stanford University threatened to cut the Press’s funding; in response, faculty, authors, and publishers rallied to express their outrage and <a href="https://save-sup.org/">save SUP</a>. In 2021, staff at <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/85938-duke-university-press-employees-look-to-unionize.html">Duke University Press</a> and then, a few months later, <a href="https://www.leftvoice.org/workers-at-oup-usa-announce-unionization-effort/">Oxford University Press</a> announced their plans to unionize; in response, authors signed petitions of support and voiced their encouragement on social media.</p>
<p>These campaigns spotlighted challenges faced by individual presses, but also shared struggles across university units. “Constant turnover, extended vacancies, disruptive reorganizations, lack of professional growth opportunities, patterns of discrimination, inconsistent enforcement of policies, and compensation that is not commensurate with our quality of work and years of experience as professionals”: these were some of the issues driving the formation of the DUP Workers Union, according to <a href="https://www.dupworkersunion.org/missionstatement">their website</a>. I expect they resonate with the experiences of a wide swath of readers, at other university presses, in higher education more broadly, and far beyond. The surge in labor organizing and action among culture workers across <a href="https://www.leftvoice.org/the-higher-ed-labor-movement-runs-full-speed-ahead-into-2023/">higher education</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/books/harpercollins-strike-ends.html">publishing</a>, <a href="https://uniontrack.com/blog/organizing-in-the-culture-sector">museums</a>, and <a href="https://www.wgacontract2023.org/">writers’ rooms</a>—a movement of which university presses have been part—is a testament to just how common these issues are.</p>
<p>Still, I’m not sure how many readers would readily imagine them to be issues for workers at university presses. Think, for example, about how university press publishing is often perceived and even touted as a broadly viable “alt-ac” career path for humanities PhDs. Such a path is possible. I’m proof of that. But it’s also the case that I worked in other roles for eight years after getting my PhD before I happened to land in a city with a university press that eventually happened to have an opening for an acquisitions editor. Mine isn’t a readily replicable path.</p>
<p>Since becoming an editor, I have had conversations with tenured faculty members and graduate students who were surprised to learn that my starting salary as an acquisitions editor was $47,500. They just assumed an editor would make more, perhaps especially one with a PhD. Yet, like full-time faculty salaries, university press staff salaries can vary significantly based on the institution, the region, and other factors. And, like faculty, university press workers often need to get competing offers or make big cross-country moves in order to advance professionally.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to assume the proverbial grass is greener on the other side—except presses aren’t really on the other side, if there is one. Scholars and publishers are in this together.</p>

<p>For decades now, it has been clear that university presses are subject to the same institutional disinvestment as both humanities departments and libraries. Some 20 years ago, in May 2002, the president of the Modern Language Association (MLA) sent a “<a href="https://www.mla.org/Resources/Guidelines-and-Data/Reports-and-Professional-Guidelines/Call-for-Action-on-Problems-in-Scholarly-Book-Publishing/A-Special-Letter-from-Stephen-Greenblatt">special letter</a>” to the organization’s members about precisely this issue. The letter was intended to alert them to “a serious problem in the publishing of scholarly books.”</p>
<p>The problem was that universities were cutting back on both their library and their press budgets. For libraries, this loss of funding coincided with increased subscription costs for science journals from for-profit publishers, leaving even less money to purchase books. With both the library market for books and institutional funding in decline, university presses were, according to the letter, “cutting back on the publication of works in some areas of language and literature.” Some presses had even “eliminated editorial positions in our disciplines.”</p>
<p>This second concern is strictly anecdotal: “<em>we are told </em>that certain presses have eliminated editorial positions in our disciplines” (emphasis added). Whether the rumors were true, I’m genuinely not sure.<sup><a href="#fn-53546-1" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">1</a><a id="fnref-53546-1"></a></sup> Either way, the letter is primarily focused on what these cutbacks and changes mean for tenure-track faculty.</p>
<p>Junior faculty, we are told, find themselves in a “maddening double bind.” They are expected to publish a monograph with a “reputable press” to get tenure but may not be able to for reasons beyond their control. “We are concerned,” the letter goes on, “because people who have spent years of professional training—our students, our colleagues—are at risk. Their careers are in jeopardy, and higher education stands to lose, or at least severely to damage, a generation of young scholars.”</p>
<p>Encountering the letter now—as a university press editor, the author of a university press book in literary studies, and a PhD in English who did not get a tenure-track job—I can’t help but see its omissions. I read mention of editorial jobs being eliminated and wonder, were there people in them? Were they laid off? If so, what “severe damage” had been done to their careers? Or, as was already happening in humanities departments and as I’ve seen happen in publishing, were people retiring or leaving, never to be replaced?</p>
<h2>University presses are not in crisis. Arguably, however, we are part of the same crisis of work in which scholars are embroiled.</h2>
<p>And what of scholars who had not ended up in tenure-track jobs? By the time the letter was sent, casualization had already laid siege to the professional ambitions of at least one generation of young scholars. Between 1975 and 1995, the percentage of part-time faculty in the academic workforce increased from 24 percent to 33 percent, while the percentage of tenure-track and tenured faculty dropped from 45 percent to 34 percent.<sup><a href="#fn-53546-2" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">2</a><a id="fnref-53546-2"></a></sup> What of the careers of adjunct faculty and those of their peers driven out of academia altogether?</p>
<p>Such questions simply are not within the purview of the letter. For this reason, it inevitably reads to me now as a missed opportunity to build greater solidarity among scholars, publishers, and librarians.</p>
<p>At the same time, the letter was just part of, and helped to set in motion, a series of earnest efforts and candid conversations across academic units and institutions, especially about so-called tenure books and the sustainability and even desirability of requiring specialized monographs for tenure. Crucially, these conversations included publishers, which, odd though it may sound, is not always the case. Jennifer Crewe, then the editorial director and now associate provost and director of Columbia University Press, published an essay on scholarly publishing in MLA’s <em>Profession</em> making the case for “Why Our Business Is Your Business Too.”<sup><a href="#fn-53546-3" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">3</a><a id="fnref-53546-3"></a></sup> Nearly two decades later, her case still stands.</p>
<p>The business of publishers should be the business of scholars, too. The first step is talking frankly about the fact that, for better or for worse, university press publishing is a business.</p>
<hr>
<p>There can be a tendency to think of scholarship and commerce as strictly opposed—to think of the lofty world of ideas as floating free of material concerns and mercenary interests. I myself lean on this assumption. I will often, for example, insist on distinguishing between not-for-profit university presses and for-profit publishers such as Elsevier. The distinction is crucial, though, as Derek Krissoff, longtime university press worker and publishing consultant, has <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/guest-post-university-presses-are-thriving-not-broken">pointed out</a>, critiques of academic publishers tend to conflate the two. I routinely see academic publishers in general disparaged as an untrustworthy means to an end or, worse, as ruthless exploiters of scholars and their work for our own supposed financial gain.</p>
<p>Be assured, we are not. But imagining that university presses primarily trade in ideas, not money, means fundamentally misunderstanding what scholarly books are and obscuring the breadth of the labor that goes into making them.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, one of the recommendations made by the MLA’s Ad Hoc Committee on the Future of Scholarly Publishing in their final report, issued shortly after the president’s special letter. The committee “urge[s] university presses to resist pressures to commercialize their operations and to ensure that they maintain their mission to publish scholarly work.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, commercializing our operations—turning a profit on books, which are, as we’ll see, a major investment—is easier said than done. On the other hand, the money to make books has to come from somewhere. And the primary source from which the <a href="https://aupresses.org/the-value-of-university-presses/member-presses-quick-facts/">money to make books</a> comes, for university presses, is selling books.</p>

<p>University presses are, by definition, driven by mission, not by money. But we also need our books to make money in order to cover our costs and support our operations. So what does it cost to publish a typical university press monograph?</p>
<p>In her 2006 essay, Crewe estimates that it costs a university press about $25,000 to $30,000. More recently, in 2016, Ithaka S&amp;R published <a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/the-costs-of-publishing-monographs/">a study</a> of the costs of publishing 382 monographs across 20 university presses. The costs varied significantly and were broken down into four categories based on the presses’ annual revenue. The average monograph cost ranged from $30,091 for presses in Group 1 (annual revenue under $1.5 million) to $49,155 for presses in Group 4 (revenue over $6 million). The lowest cost for all four groups was $15,140 (from Group 3, presses with $3–$6 million revenue).<sup><a href="#fn-53546-4" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">4</a><a id="fnref-53546-4"></a></sup> The range itself—among both publishing costs and press budgets—is striking and bears underscoring lest readers assume university presses are a monolith. In reality, we are as varied as higher education itself. Still, for all presses, a monograph is a major investment. Before the book even goes to the printer, the publisher is out many thousands, if not many tens of thousands, of dollars, some of which may never be recovered in sales. Many monographs do not earn back as much as they cost to produce.</p>
<p>The largest cost for all the university presses was staff time, “specifically the time related to activities of acquisitions, the area most closely tied to the character and reputation of the press.” Acquisitions staff are often the public face of a press. We also typically have numeric goals; I have a certain number of books I am supposed to sign, get approved by the editorial board, and transmit to production each year. Sometimes editors’ goals are explicitly tied to revenue and their books are expected to bring in a certain amount.</p>
<p>I can tell you firsthand that one of the primary activities of acquisitions is communication. Acquisitions work can be curatorial, but it’s also profoundly interpersonal and collaborative. Above all, editorial staff communicate with past, present, and potential authors about everything from the details of a contract to how to respond to reader reports to what permissions they need when preparing their project for production and more. We also engage and work with a vast network of scholars to help to bring in, vet, and, most importantly, strengthen manuscripts—including peer reviewers, series editors, and editorial board members. This labor by others generally falls in the amorphous, expansive category of professional service.</p>
<p>Service activities such as peer review have been characterized by John Warner, in <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/humanities-academics-working-conditions-state-of-academic-labor.html"><em>Slate</em></a>, as a kind of gift, though not a “free” or purely generous one. Peer review is a task traditionally performed by faculty with the implicit expectation that it will eventually be remunerated in the form of tenure and promotion. Or, if you have “crossed that threshold” and have a steady salary and job security, “it then becomes natural to do the unremunerated work that keeps the wheels turning for those coming behind you.” Having benefited from others’ professional service, you pay it forward.</p>
<p>But this gift economy has broken down. There are fewer tenure-track faculty to support this kind of “free” or minimally paid work; those who are in tenure-track positions are overburdened by other, ever-mounting institutional responsibilities. Meanwhile, the shortage of tenure-track jobs means that publication expectations for early career scholars have skyrocketed.</p>
<h2>University presses may be grounded in ideas—and ideals—that can never truly be measured, but at the end of the day, we are businesses.</h2>
<p>Warner’s characterization of humanities scholarship as a gift economy, albeit a defunct one, sheds important light on the “social life” of scholarly books. The 1986 volume <em>The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective</em>, edited by the anthropologist Arjun Appadurai, looks at the various social and cultural processes by which things accrue value and the ways things give value to social relations.<sup><a href="#fn-53546-5" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(53546)">5</a><a id="fnref-53546-5"></a></sup> Appadurai reminds us that even noncapitalist societies have “calculative, impersonal and self-aggrandizing features,” while “capitalist societies, too, operate according to cultural designs.” All things, in both types of societies, have “commodity potential,” the potential for exchangeability, which may be realized “at different points in their social lives,” from production to distribution and exchange to consumption.</p>
<p>Even if they are not big moneymakers, scholarly books have always borne this commodity potential. They have always been both economic and intellectual entities, products of multiple people’s labor that are destined for sale as well as contributions to a collective reserve of knowledge<em>.</em></p>
<p>University presses may be grounded in ideas—and ideals—that can never truly be measured, but at the end of the day, we are businesses. Our work has always been part of an economy in which some surplus has helped subsidize our costs. This surplus may be an institutional budget allocation, a drawdown from an endowment, the extra revenue from some bestsellers, another revenue stream such as journal subscriptions, subventions from authors and other grants, undercompensated labor both in and out of house, or some combination of the above. Moreover, we have long sold to multiple markets, of which the university library market is just one. According to <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/about-us/history-and-fact-sheet-folder/what-was-a-university-press-1/i.-history">one calculation</a>, libraries accounted for about 70 percent of university press book sales in the late 1970s. In the years following the 2008–9 financial crisis, that figure was down to 20 or 25 percent. Paradoxically, the boom in library sales—that halcyon past when presses used to sell many hundreds of copies of a given title to university libraries instead of the current <em>maybe </em>one hundred—seems to have enabled the illusion that university presses somehow operate “outside” the flows of commerce. In other words, when making substantial money from universities, we were most able to pretend that university presses, like universities, were not in the business of making money.</p>
<hr>
<p>Arguably, one of the best measures of university presses’ commercialization—or, to use the term more common in critiques of higher education, our neoliberalization—is our working conditions. If, as the Ithaka report states, staff time is the primary cost of publishing a scholarly book, that suggests it’s also an area where presses can and have cut costs. Understaffing and gigification affect university presses, too. As roles have been eliminated and consolidated and job functions outsourced, university presses have helped to create—and come to depend on—ever-growing pools of freelancers, including developmental editors, copyeditors, typesetters, cover designers, and indexers. Some of these workers freelance on top of full-time jobs at other university presses. Some are scholars who also teach at universities. Many have advanced humanities degrees.</p>
<p>We publishers have a hand, I think, in obscuring our working conditions, not least because we are a business that runs on others’—especially authors’—confidence and trust. We need to be professional—but at what and whose cost?</p>
<p>For both scholars and publishers, being professional can mean treating our work as a gift, a calling, with commerce happening elsewhere. In our era of mass deprofessionalization—when the humanities especially must do more and more with less and less, expertise is increasingly severed from secure employment, and prestige is inconvertible to income for all but a fortunate few—we must take the risk of being unprofessional.</p>
<p>For publishers, this means, at the very least, pulling back the curtain on our business as a business. The economy of university presses, like that of higher education more broadly, has always been hybrid. This is why I’ve argued here <em>against </em>seeing commerce as an external threat that we must resist. Not because commercialization is good, but because it has already happened. University press publishing is commercialized insofar as it is part of a much larger history of overwork, wage stagnation, credential creep—in short, of capital.</p>

<p>If publishers don’t publicize the conditions and, yes, at times, the commercial aspirations of our work, we risk further contributing to our own devaluation. University presses are not in crisis. Arguably, however, we are <em>part of the same </em><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/05/the-age-of-the-crisis-of-work-quiet-quitting-great-resignation/"><em>crisis of work</em></a> in which scholars are embroiled. As my fellow editor Jenny Tan has put it, “<a href="https://twitter.com/byjennytan/status/1673401769991217164?s=20">the same system exploits our labor as it does yours</a>.”</p>
<p>This isn’t just a call for more open communication between scholars and publishers to make all our work go more smoothly. It’s a call for more candor and camaraderie across the board, for mutual demystification infused with the militancy of the growing higher education labor movement. Scholars, publishers, and librarians have to build trust and solidarity, working together to determine the scholarly future we want to work toward. If we don’t, then higher education—as a whole—will lose.&nbsp;<img width="12" src="https://www.publicbooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-icon.jpg" alt="icon"></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I spent a recent flight finding out what I could do with a connection to the flight’s wifi, but without access to the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/flight.jpg" alt="The view from my seat on the flight"></p>
<p>I was on my way home from Strange Loop, a direct flight from St. Louis to Oakland.
It’s a long enough flight that I planned to purchase the $8 internet access and get some work done, but Southwest’s wifi portal wouldn’t accept any form of payment.
The web page didn’t give me any helpful error messages, so I opened up my browser’s network dev tools to see if I could figure out what was going wrong.</p>
<p>I found the failing request, but it didn’t provide any useful hints to point me toward a solution.
While I was there, I saw another request that caught my eye: A repeating successful request for <code>current.json</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/current-json-requests.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing requests for current.json in my browser"></p>
<p>Here’s an example response from one of those requests:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"sat_commlink_portal"</span>: {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"status"</span>: <span>"conn_ok"</span>,

</span></span><span><span>  <span>"actime24"</span>: <span>"15:54"</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This appeared to be the data that drives the in-flight wifi portal’s flight status page.
Since this was one of the only things I could access on this network, I decided to make the most of it.</p>
<p>I used my browser’s “Copy as cURL” feature to quickly get a command to hit the endpoint.
As an aside, this feature is present in Firefox and all chromium-based browsers and it’s really handy if you ever need to reply requests made by your browser and want to send all the same headers.</p>
<p><img src="https://jamesbvaughan.com/southwest-wifi/copy-as-curl.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing where the “Copy as cURL” option is"></p>
<p>After some experimenting, I found that none of the cookies or headers that were included in the request were strictly necessary, meaning that I could fetch the data with a simple <code>curl 'https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json'</code>.
I set up a loop to dump the data in a log file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>watch -n <span>30</span> <span>"curl https://getconnected.southwestwifi.com/current.json | jq -c &gt;&gt; flight-logs"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I didn’t know what I’d do with the data at this point, but I started collecting it right away so that I’d have as much as possible to play with later.</p>
<p>With that running, I decided to look more closely at the responses to figure out what exactly I had to work with.
Here’s that same example response, annotated with my best guess at what the fields represent:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Most of that is straightforward, but I’m curious about a few parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the difference between <code>sat_commlink_portal.status</code> and <code>satcomm_status.commlink</code>?</li>
<li>Is <code>pcent_flt_complete</code> in terms of distance or in terms of estimated time?</li>
<li>How much with <code>altVal</code>, <code>etad</code>, and <code>gspdVal</code> fluctuate throughout the flight?</li>
<li>What is the <code>ac</code> in <code>actime24</code>? I would think “aircraft”, but in this case that time is the current time in our destination, not the current time in the aircraft’s location.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent the flight working on some scripts that could visualize some of the data
after I finished collecting it.
Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<h2 id="change-in-altitude-over-time">Change in altitude over time</h2>
<p>Going into this, I was mostly curious to see how noisy the altitude data would be.</p>
<canvas id="altitude-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Flight altitude chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's altitude over time here.
</canvas>

<p>It’s difficult to see the noise with such a large range.
Here’s the same data, but with the plane’s descent removed:</p>
<canvas id="cropped-altitude-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Flight altitude chart (cropped)">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's altitude over time here.
</canvas>

<p>According to this data, the plane’s altitude was only fluctuating by about 20-30 feet.
This is more stable than I expected!
I had assumed that I’d see a lot more change here, but I don’t know what’s normal and I don’t know how accurate this data is.</p>
<h2 id="change-in-eta-over-time">Change in ETA over time</h2>
<p>I predicted that this would be reasonably stable, and it was.
This was a pretty smooth flight, at least after the initial departure.</p>
<canvas id="eta-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="ETA chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's change ETA over time here.
</canvas>

<p>I’m curious what this would have looked like if we had a delayed landing due to weather.
Would the reported ETA slowly creep up as the airline’s confidence in the delay increased, or would it spike up sharply near the end?</p>
<h2 id="change-in-ground-speed-over-time">Change in ground speed over time</h2>
<p>This was also stable, as expected.</p>
<canvas id="ground-speed-chart-canvas" role="img" aria-label="Ground speed chart">
  You should see a chart visualizing the flight's ground speed over time here.
</canvas>

<p><em>edit: I originally labeled these speeds as MPH, but <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37691582">some HN readers helpfully pointed out that these are more likely to be knots</a>.</em></p>
<p>I wish I had started collecting the data earlier in the flight.
I’m curious to see shape of this curve as we approached cruising speed.</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn’t find anything particularly useful or surprising here, but this was a fun way to spend the flight!</p>

        <p>Jim Testin, director of Airliner repair services at the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington, made a prediction in July 2007 based on 27 years of experience. “I can tell you this: Something will always happen on Christmas Eve,” he said with the certainty of a man who has missed many family gatherings.</p>
<p>Five months later, on the night of December 24, a tow tractor pushed a Boeing 767 away from the gate at a busy European airport. And pushed. (Air &amp; Space&nbsp; agreed not to publish the name of the airline or any location.) Passengers heard “a very loud noise” and were invited to disembark via roll-away stairs. An ocean and a continent away, at Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes Operations Center in Seattle, an immense video screen displayed the status of the airliner shoved tail-first into a 14-foot blast-diversion fence. It was officially AOG—Airplane On Ground. For an airline with tickets to sell, that is exactly where you don’t want an airplane that can earn more than $200,000 a day.</p>
<p>From the dents and dings incurred on crowded taxiways to a jumbo jet bobbing in a Tahitian lagoon, Boeing AOG teams have seen and repaired it all. On call 24/7/365, ready to go anywhere around the world, Jim Testin’s quick responders keep over 12,000 extravagantly complex airliners airborne.</p>
<p>“We’re not bashful about promoting our ability to do that,” he says. “When we have a product that’s down and losing revenue, our number-one thing is to get that plane back into service.”</p>
<p>The Boeing team isn’t called in for everything. Airlines have incidents every day, Testin says, and most airport ground crews can handle routine repairs—a window cracked by a bird, a component failing calibration. An AOG intervention is required for the big things: an airplane off the end of a runway, landing gear accidentally retracted, a flaming tail drag, two 150-ton behemoths kissing wingtips on the ramp.</p>
<p>The AOG team is the most expensive roadside service on the planet. One call activates hundreds of people on a single wavelength: urgency. “I’ve been on calls where I could still hear the sirens of the emergency equipment in the background,” Testin says. Another aircraft might be rushed out of routine maintenance or temporarily diverted from another route to fill in for a disabled airliner. But in the house of cards that is today’s airline schedule, yanking even one aircraft from service can cause delays and cancellations.</p>
<p>From an office complex secluded behind tall evergreens on the Duwamish River, the Seattle operations center keeps tabs on Boeing airliners grounded around the world. “In a hospital analogy, this is the emergency room,” says center director Bruce Rund. It looks more like a downsized mission control. Concentric rows of consoles and monitors accommodate 30 controllers, project leaders, and engineers. On a 30-foot-wide video display, the sunrise is tracked across a world map in one screen. In another, blue icons representing AOGs in progress advance along a timeline, turning yellow, then red, as they approach the center’s deadline for action within 24 hours. Controllers conduct telephone triage to establish the severity of each situation and whether the airline wants a permanent repair or a temporary fix that will get the aircraft home. “We need to know quickly: How AOG are you?” Rund says. “Are you sitting in a gate with passengers loaded, or is this problem something you found during an overnight inspection?” The center defines an AOG as any incident requiring a response in less than 24 hours. But when carriers major and minor queue for critical care, everybody knows who goes to the head of the line: “Whoever’s got passengers on board,” Rund says. “It’s understood throughout the industry that we always look at those scenarios first.”</p>
<p>Rund’s staff takes 125 calls a day, and by the time an airline calls, it’s usually tried everything it can to fix a problem itself. The heavy morning departures in Europe and the afternoon rush in the Middle East create problems that show up during Seattle’s witching hours. “It gets really interesting in here when it’s 2 a.m. and we’re the only game in town,” Rund says.</p>
<p>And increasingly they are. As airlines downsize workforces, a busted airplane far from its corporate hub may not be swarmed by a phalanx of mechanics in company jumpsuits. Sometimes, says Rund, “There’s one avionics guy with a screwdriver.”</p>
<p>Owners of damaged airliners occasionally call with a one-item wish list. “They just want to know if they can fly the plane without doing anything,” Rund says. He cites an airline maintenance director pressing for flight approval after sustaining a hammering in a hailstorm. Boeing engineers determined that wing components were damaged beyond limits. Ten minutes of a carefully worded reality check, plus an offer to rush replacement parts to the site, persuaded the impatient carrier to fix instead of fly. “Part of our job is to be the voice of reason,” Rund says.</p>
<p>Incident reports advance to the center’s resident engineers. With broad experience across the aircraft types in Boeing’s fleet, these frontline troubleshooters huddle to prescribe the most immediate relief. In cases of structural damage, which make up 60 percent of the calls, the solution usually involves collaboration with specialized engineers elsewhere in the company—what Rund terms “the brain surgeons.”</p>
<p>“We get the customer on the line, we get the brain surgeons of Boeing on the line, and we sit in a collaboration room and videoconference,” he says. Plasma screens with smart boards facilitate sketches on digitized blueprints and photos. By now, an AOG survey team in Washington State has been alerted and is standing by. After each engineer confirms his understanding of the damage and votes a course of action, the plan is presented to the airline.</p>
<p>Order is supplanting chaos. Just getting the aircraft into Boeing hands has a therapeutic effect on stressed-out airline execs. It’s also a healthy antidote to denial when damage is severe. “By this point, in most cases the airline recognizes that— and will tell us—‘This is beyond our capabilities,’ ” Rund says. “Then it’s time to get Jim’s team involved.”</p>
<p>“This, By Far, is the best job in Boeing,” AOG mechanic Bernie Dalien shouts over rivet guns and rock ’n’ roll. “The boring, the mundane, the everyday thing—that’s not our gig.”</p>
<p>We’re in an enormous halogen-lit hangar in Western Europe, standing between two separated segments of a 767. Earsplitting music thunders from an iPod boom-box. Widebody X is the one recently spindled on the fence.</p>
<p>As the last of its deplaned passengers straggled to their destinations, the AOG survey team was en route. The four-member first wave is often in the air from Seattle on just four hours’ notice. Says Paul Amrine, quality assurance supervisor on this project, “Sometimes we go to work in the morning and end up having to ask our wives to bring us a packed suitcase.” Amrine himself arrived at the hangar after back-to-back surveys of incidents in Shannon, Ireland, and Taipei, Taiwan. The team appraises the aircraft, documenting what Boeing calls “discrepancies” (a torn-off wing, for example). Man-hours, parts and resources, and a time-flow to a rock-hard completion date are calculated. Back in Everett, a contract is drawn up that includes a firm price. “And the customer either says yea or nay,” Amrine says. In the death match of airline competition, the yeas usually have it.</p>
<p>The reckoning takes into account more than just the repair. A critical shortage of “lift”—the pool of aircraft on the market to replace one scrapped—is a big factor. The waiting list for most Boeing models is three years, and used airliners for sale or lease are scarce. “The book value of the plane, plus the fact that you can’t get a new one for another two or three years, is what dictates whether you fix it or not,” AOG engineer Craig Oppedal says. For a 1998 Boeing 767, it’s cheaper to keep it.</p>
<p>Up on a hangar balcony, a smattering of airport office workers watch the drama of deconstruction. “Most people have never seen a large aircraft come apart like this,” says Mike Carpenter, project team leader. But looky-loos glimpse only airplane-incognito-on-ground. Among the first implements of an AOG team is brown paper to mask identifying airline logos on the airplane during repair. Boeing maintains doctor-patient confidentiality with customers not eager to have their brand name associated with an embarrassing incident—much less advertise the fact that passengers will be boarding an airplane that lately has been in two pieces.</p>
<p>Photos of the incident conveyed only skin-deep gashes on the underside of the empennage. I’d seen as much inflicted on cars in mall parking lots. But the survey team recognized that this was no mere panel-bender. “Just by the external location of the damage, we pretty much knew what to expect,” Paul Amrine says. For a ground-handling incident, it could hardly have been worse. A fence stanchion penetrated at the precise spot to puncture one of the largest, most critical components on an airliner: the rear pressure bulkhead. The 16-foot-diameter dome-shaped aluminum barrier is sandwiched between the fourth and fifth fuselage segments and seals in life-supporting cabin pressure. These bulkheads are constructed as integral units, so when they are substantially damaged, they must be replaced, not repaired. The instructions have only three steps. Pull the $120 million airliner completely in two, insert bulkhead, put halves back together again. In three weeks.</p>
<p>Spread across the hangar floor is a half-acre of cranes, jacks, crates, and tool cases. “This is our portable factory,” says Mike Carpenter. The gear, all on casters or pallets, is designed for transit, rapid setup, and tear-down. Once the contract is signed, the AOG operation’s second wave—the mechanics, engineers, and inspectors, plus the portable factory and a cargo hold of parts—descends en masse.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to get 36 people and all logistics on site in a matter of days,” Carpenter says. He picked his team from AOG staffs at the Washington facilities (another small group in Long Beach, California, tends the McDonnell Douglas fleet). Some have expertise specific to the 767, “but most can work on any Boeing plane any time,” he says. “Structure is structure.”</p>
<p>AOG team accommodations range from tents beside dirt runways in underdeveloped countries to a blur of bland airport hotels. Anniversary and birthday no-shows, chronic jet lag, continual room service sandwich platters—all part of the job.</p>
<p>It’s not for everyone. Within Boeing’s rank-and-file, Testin’s group tends to be conspicuous as self-directed overachievers. “The cream of the crop,” Bernie Dalien says bluntly. “There’s a lot of animosity toward us in the factories because AOG is so difficult to get into. A ton of guys back there would love to have this job.”</p>
<p>Dalien would know. On the arc to AOG, he paid a decade of dues on the 737 and 757 production lines, accumulating skills like merit badges. Boeing’s average production employee carries seven job certifications; the average AOG member, 28. A competent electrician in Washington you may be, but in AOG you’ll also need to drive a rivet and drop an engine with the best of them. And play nice with your fellow Type A’s. Candidates for a vacancy are sent on tryout repairs to far-flung locales, not only to test their skills but also to gauge how they relate to others in the tight-knit team. “They’ll bring us a guy who really shines in the factory,” Dalien says. “But take him out of his comfort zone and put him in a situation like this, and you find out his personality’s not cohesive with the rest of us. So he’s weeded out.”</p>
<p>Nor is an AOG career designed for your inner nine-to-fiver. “We work two 12-hour shifts, around the clock, seven days a week, until we’re done,” Jim Testin says. “We don’t take holidays. My first 11 years in AOG, I missed Christmas nine times.” He pauses to tally the number of passports he’s filled—six—then shakes his head. “I told my wife I would only do this for three years.”</p>
<p>Still, for an average of just one opening per year, Testin gets as many as 500 applicants. Part of the draw is the mystique. Some of the feats the Boeing AOG operation has performed are commercial aviation legends. In 1988, a 747 aborting a takeoff bellied into a mud flat adjacent to New Delhi airport. Fully 70 percent of the airplane required AOG repair or replacement, at a total cost of $75 million. Then a mechanic, Testin worked 126 days straight in a circus-size tent dubbed the New Delhi Dome. Boeing returned the resurrected jumbo as pristine as one just off the assembly line. Two decades later, it’s still flying.</p>
<p>As it turns out, pulling a 767 in half is a straightforward procedure. “Everything about these aircraft is designed to be taken apart,” mechanic Fred Chadwick says. Before the tail section could be separated from the rest of the fuselage, the towering vertical stabilizer had to be removed. Overhead clearance in the hangar was three feet short, but resourceful AOG mechanics hyper-extended the airliner’s nose gear to tilt the tail down. A gantry crane hoisted the enormous fin to within inches of the rafters, then shuttled it over the airplane and lowered it to a jig on the floor. The tightness of the quarters made it a hold-your-breath procedure that dragged through an entire shift. But AOG tool engineer Jason Lockwood was over his first hurdle.</p>
<p>“When they told me I was going to be on this job, I didn’t sleep for a month,” he admits. Lockwood designs and directs heavy lifting operations. On this repair, heavy lift included the startling act of removing the 48 section—the unwieldy 12,000-pound final fuselage segment that includes the vertical fin, the horizontal stabilizers, and the damaged pressure bulkhead. A 48 separation was a career first for Lockwood. “I’d seen the videos of all the things that can go wrong,” he says.</p>
<p>Just aft of the rear lavatories, the 48 section meets the 46. At a join ring encircling the fuselage, the two fifths of the airplane are held together by 200 bolts—heat-treated, aircraft-grade fasteners (though they look unsettlingly similar to some you might have in a coffee can in the garage). A cable yoke descended from the ceiling crane and attached at five lift points on the tail section. After the crane applied 12,000 pounds of lift, the bolts were removed in a pre-determined sequence. Since the cable tension matched the section’s weight, “theoretically, we should just be able to take out all the bolts and the section will just sit there,” Lockwood says. In practice, determining the suspended segment’s exact center of gravity required some fine-tuning. A few bolts were left loose but threaded as final tweaks were made to the pitch of the yoke. “Once we’ve convinced ourselves it’s in a neutral attitude,” Lockwood says, “we take out those last bolts. Hopefully, it just hangs there.” If it pitches, binds, or pendulums, it could damage the precisely machined mating surfaces of the sections.</p>
<p>With barely a twitch, the fuselage de-mated. The crane backed off, bearing the 48 section, exposing the ruptured bulkhead, and providing mechanics in the now-gaping 46 with a view you hope you never get on your way to the lavatory.</p>
<p>Lockwood slept better thereafter. “It’s actually easier to put it back together than it is to take it apart,” he says.</p>
<p>The intimacy with the way Boeing airplanes dismantle now influences how they’re built. “We put three AOG team members on the 777 design teams, and we’ve followed that up on the 787 and the next-generation 737,” Jim Testin says. Specific design changes were integrated to minimize damage in common incidents and expedite AOG repairs afterward.</p>
<p>Still, damaged aircraft rarely go back together exactly as they rolled out of the factory. Change—as routine as replacing a stripped bolt with an oversized substitute—happens. “Any time you change the configuration of anything in the structure, you have to document it,” Craig Oppedal says. Every deviation from “drawing config,” the blueprint gospel of an aircraft as originally constructed, is subjected to his scrutiny and triggers a Field Rework Record (FRR). Oppedal’s been on AOG repairs that produced just a few FRRs, and others that resulted in 280. But there’s always something. All FRRs become part of the voluminous documentation that follows an airliner around for life.</p>
<p>The replacement pressure bulkhead has no deviations to document. In 1978, a Boeing AOG team repaired the bulkhead of a Japan Airlines 747 damaged in a tail-drag incident. Seven years later, the repair failed in flight, resulting in an explosive depressurization that tore off the vertical fin and severed all hydraulics systems. Some 30 minutes later, the aircraft slammed into a mountainside; 520 people died in the second worst airline disaster in history. Investigators determined that the AOG repair did not comply with Boeing’s own Structural Repair Manual. Boeing accepted 80 percent of the liability for the crash, while JAL accepted the remainder for neglecting signs that the repaired bulkhead was weakening.</p>
<p>Every night at 7:30, the day crew logs out and the second shift “ties in.” The playlist mellows, and reassembly continues around the clock. Mangled skin is replaced with new aluminum. The new bulkhead is sealed into the 48 section, fuselage segments are reunited, and the&nbsp; vertical fin is dropped back into its slot.</p>
<p>The critical task of reconnecting the control cables and hydraulics that operate the tail’s rudder and elevators belongs to rigger Randy Pratt. He’s required to adjust the 175-foot tungsten steel cables back to Boeing factory specs to produce the flying characteristics the airplane came off the production line with—no matter how far out of whack the airline flew it. “They’ll say ‘Hey, what did you do to my airplane?’ ” Pratt tells me. Adjustments made for the flight preferences of particular pilots, or an accumulation of skin patches that skew the airplane’s aerodynamics, produce differences from manufacturer’s suggested settings. Soon after recouping their airplane, airline mechanics typically set about undoing Pratt’s precision work, adjusting cables and neutral positions to customize control to taste.</p>
<p>On day 18 the airplane is towed out into a squall of rain and snow. “We’ve got a page and a half of functional tests to do,” Mike Carpenter says. Control surfaces aft of the separation point are actuated and electrical components energized. The auxiliary power unit then over-pressurizes the fuselage for the “high-blow” test. Made of expandable, credit-card-thin aluminum, the pressure bulkhead in normal service holds seven pounds per square inch. In addition to testing the join ring seal, the 12-psi high-blow stretches the new bulkhead’s elasticity nearly to its limit. The test also results in instant break-in: Stretching and fatigue during routine lower pressurizations are thus minimized.</p>
<p>It’s day 20, and make-readies continue down to the last minute. At a sit-down with airline officials, every item on the survey list is verbally closed out. Mike Carpenter and Paul Amrine sign their names to a document attesting that the aircraft has been repaired to the standards of the Boeing Company and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA standards are published online; the AOG team references them constantly) and is ready to return to service. Then the whole movable factory packs up.</p>
<p>Like now. “We’ve literally had passengers with tickets in their hands looking out the window of the gate at us as we were boxing up our equipment to leave,” Jim Testin says.</p>
<p>Corporate carriers with three-figure fleets and thousands of flights daily rely on Boeing’s AOG teams to discreetly get airplanes flying again, ASAP. But its real clients show up in ones and twos, clutching boarding passes and tripping over shoelaces untied for security checks. “There’s a tremendous effort that’s put forth on behalf of the traveling public,” Testin told me back in Everett, “to make these planes the safest in the world. If an airline calls, we’ll have somebody there.”</p>
<p>At the operations center, when I suggested that future airliners made of advanced impact-resistant materials might never become tomorrow’s AOGs, Bruce Rund had a prediction of his own. “Somebody will figure out a way.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/snap-shutters-its-enterprise-services-division-after-less-than-a-year/">https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/snap-shutters-its-enterprise-services-division-after-less-than-a-year/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37690867">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Snap is closing down a division of its company designed to offer its AR expertise to enterprise customers. The initiative, called AR Enterprise Service, or ARES, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/23/snap-is-offering-its-ar-tools-to-enterprise-customers/">announced</a> in March of this year, and included a Shopping Suite for brands that allowed them to access AR try-on features, a 3D viewer for looking at a product from multiple angles, fit and sizing recommendation technology and an enterprise manager where brands could host and manage all digital assets.</p>
<p>The closure was first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-27/snap-to-shutter-business-focused-ar-unit-just-launched-this-year?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Bloomberg</a>, based on <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/ar-enterprise-strategic-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an internal memo</a> sent from Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, which Snap confirmed. In the memo, the exec pointed to the emergence of AI tools that impacted Snap’s competitive advantage as well as the need to invest more heavily into web tools, rather than mobile — technology that he described as “technically complex and less engaging for our customers.”</p>
<p>On AI, specifically, Spiegel wrote, “the advent of generative AI has made it easier for companies of all sizes to create try-on experiences for their customers and made it harder for us to differentiate our offering.”</p>
<p>The company made the decision that building up ARES would take “significant” investment and it couldn’t continue to fund those efforts. The memo says the shuttering of the business will cut 170 jobs at Snap, but some employees may be rehired for other roles, including support for&nbsp; CameraKit, Sponsored AR advertising and others. Snap noted in the memo it has 250 million people still engaging with its AR experiences every day.</p>
<p>After the introduction of ARES in March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/snapchats-ar-technology-comes-to-the-real-world-with-ar-mirrors/">Snap demonstrated the offering to brands at its Partner Summit in April,</a> where it also rolled out a new offering called AR Mirrors, designed to bring AR tech to physical screens in the real world. Coca-Cola was using the tech to make an AR-enabled vending machine, and other retailers, including&nbsp; Men’s Wearhouse and Nike, have tested the product, Snap said.</p>
<p>The shopping suite, meanwhile was expanded with features like Live Garment Transfer, a tool that makes AR asset creation easier for retailers by allowing them to upload 3D assets in Lens Studio. Businesses would access Snap’s Shopping Suite solution via a front-end dashboard and back-end infrastructure where they create and manage their AR assets, build AR experiences, manage 3D asset catalogs and implement the Shopping Suite SDK.</p>
<p>Snap also provided an in-house team to help clients with onboarding and using the suite’s features.</p>
<p>The division closure comes at a time when Snap has seen declining revenue. The company saw its first revenue decline as a public company in Q1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/snap-snapchat-q2-2023-earnings/">and reported $1.07 billion during Q2,</a> another year-over-year drop. However, the company did grow its daily active users, which were up 14% year-over-year to 397 million in the second quarter, and recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/snapchat-now-has-over-5-million-paying-users-for-snapchat/">it has topped 5 million paid subscribers for Snapchat+.</a></p>
<p>“I am deeply grateful for the hard work of our AR Enterprise team,” wrote Spiegel. “It is very difficult to create a new business, and incredibly painful to wind it down, but it is the willingness to take risks and try new things that moves the world forward through innovation and experimentation. The courage and strength of our AR Enterprise team members embodies so much of what I love about Snap and I am so sorry that this venture did not work out as we had hoped. Leading in augmented reality means that sometimes we will fail, and I am proud that our team dared to build this business even if we did not succeed,” he said.</p>

<p>
<strong>According to a media report, a striking number of work accidents occur in the factory of the US electric car manufacturer Tesla in Grünheide. IG Metall has called on Tesla to make improvements to occupational safety.</strong>
</p>
<p>A year and a half ago, the US car company Tesla opened its factory in Grünheide near Berlin. Accidents at work have not been uncommon since then – this is what the magazine “Stern” reports, citing previously unknown documents from authorities and emergency services.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-taeglich-Unfaelle-bei-Tesla-in-Gruenheide">“Accidents almost every day” at Tesla in Grünheide</h2>
<p>According to a file note from the State Office for Occupational Safety, “accidents occurred almost daily on the factory premises over a long period of time.” According to research, Tesla is said to have reported at least 190 reportable accidents between June and November 2022 alone. In Germany, all work accidents must be reported. </p>
<p>According to “Stern”, documents from the rescue centers also documented that Tesla boss Elon Musk’s factory requested an ambulance or helicopter 247 times in the first year after opening alone. For comparison: Converted to the number of employees, this is three times as many emergencies – in a similar period of time – as occurred, for example, at the Audi factory in Ingolstadt. </p>
<h2 id="Verbrennungen-und-amputierte-Gliedmassen">Burns and amputated limbs</h2>
<p>The rescue reports showed, among other things, that a wooden box weighing 50 kilograms fell on an employee’s head from a height of several meters. Another employee broke into a dosing oven with red-hot aluminum with his foot. The injuries listed by the rescuers also included amputated limbs and injuries caused by burns or hydrochloric acid. </p>
<h2 id="IG-Metall-fordert-Tesla-zu-Nachbesserungen-auf">IG Metall calls on Tesla <span>Improvements </span>on</h2>
<p>IG Metall has now called on Tesla to improve occupational safety for employees in the plant. “Health comes before profit – that also applies to Tesla in Grünheide,” said Dirk Schulze, IG Metall district manager for Berlin-Brandenburg-Saxony, today. IG Metall has long been concerned about occupational safety at the plant. </p>
<p>Numerous employees reported accidents and health problems, in some areas this led to sickness rates of up to 40 percent. Instead of addressing the causes, management reacts by putting pressure on the sick. Fewer staff should produce the same quantities. “The management clearly does not give the issue of occupational health and safety a priority.” </p>
<h2 id="Bisher-26-Umwelt-Vorfaelle-in-Gruenheide">So far 26 environmental incidents in Grünheide</h2>
<p>There have also been several environmental incidents since the factory opened a year and a half ago. Tesla has since reported 26 environmental accidents. This emerges from information from the Brandenburg State Office for the Environment, which “Stern” reports on and which is also available to the dpa news agency. These include spilled substances such as paint, diesel and fires. Part of the site lies in the water protection area. </p>
<p>Specifically, the accidents included leaks of 15,000 liters of paint, 13 tons of aluminum and 50 and 150 liters of diesel. The paint incident in April 2022 was already known. According to information from the State Environment Agency, paint and aluminum were disposed of professionally or properly. </p>
<h2 id="Gefahr-fuer-das-Trinkwasser">Danger to drinking water?</h2>
<p>The “Stern” also reported that after a fire in September 2020, up to 300 liters of extinguishing water seeped into the ground; 250 liters of diesel leaked in a gas station on site in May 2023. The State Environment Agency did not provide any information on this. </p>
<p>The head of ecosystems at the Leibniz Institute for Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Martin Pusch, spoke of a fundamentally high risk with regard to drinking water. “There is a high risk of impairment of the drinking water supply due to the low retention capacity of the subsoil,” Pusch told dpa. Tesla has dismissed concerns. </p>

Here at Cloudflare, we believe everyone should be able to browse the Internet free of persistent tracking and prying eyes.</p><p>That’s why we’re excited to announce that we’ve partnered with Microsoft Edge to provide a fast and secure VPN, right in the browser. Users don’t have to install anything new or understand complex concepts to get the latest in network-level privacy: Edge Secure Network VPN is available on the latest consumer version of Microsoft Edge in most markets, and automatically comes with 5 GB of data. Just enable the feature by going to <em>[Microsoft Edge Settings &amp; more (…) &gt; Browser essentials, </em>and click <em>Get VPN for free]</em>.

There are many important pieces that make this possible, but among them is the VPN<em> </em>protocol, which defines the way in which the tunnel is established and how traffic flows through it. You may have heard of some of these protocols: Wireguard, IPsec, and OpenVPN, for example. And while we’re no stranger to these, (Cloudflare’s WireGuard implementation is currently in use by millions of devices that use <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>) – we see our Privacy Proxy Platform as a way to push forward the next frontier of Internet privacy and embrace one of Cloudflare’s core values: open Internet standards.</p><p>The Privacy Proxy Platform implements HTTP CONNECT, a method defined in the <a href="http://placeholder/">HTTP standard</a> that proxies traffic by establishing a tunnel and then sending reliable and ordered byte streams through that tunnel. You can read more about this proxying method (and its history!) in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-primer-on-proxies/">Primer on Proxies</a>.</p><p>We also leverage other parts of Cloudflare’s privacy-oriented infrastructure that are already deployed at scale: requests first utilize <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">1.1.1.1</a> for DNS, a token proxy based on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/privacypass/about/">Privacy Pass</a> for client authentication, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">Geo-egress</a> to choose an accurate egress IP address without exposing users’ precise location.</p><h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3><p>Let’s dive into the details of these components. For the purposes of this blog, we’ll call the devices people are using to browse the Internet (your phone, tablet or computer) <em>clients, </em>and the websites they’re trying to visit <em>origin sites.</em></p><p>The Privacy Proxy Platform includes three main parts:</p><ol><li><strong>Token Proxy</strong>: this is the service that checks if you’re an Edge Secure Network user with a legitimate Microsoft account.</li><li><strong>Privacy API</strong>: based on the above, Cloudflare’s Privacy API issues authentication tokens that clients use for authenticating to the proxy itself.</li><li><strong>Privacy Proxy</strong>: this is the HTTP CONNECT-based proxy service running on Cloudflare’s network. This service checks that the client presents a valid authentication token, and if so, proxies the encrypted HTTP request to the origin site. It is also responsible for selecting a valid egress IP address to be used.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/09/image2-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="897"></figure><p>When Edge Secure Network protections are on – say, when a user connects to an open Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop – our proxy will automatically prompt that client for a token to authenticate. If the client has a token, it will present one. If it doesn’t, it will utilize the token proxy to mint a new pool using the help of an attester and issuer: the attester checks the validity of the client and Microsoft account, and the issuer issues tokens for that client in return. This dance is based on the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/supporting-the-latest-version-of-the-privacy-pass-protocol/">Privacy Pass protocol</a>. Importantly, it allows Cloudflare to validate that clients are who they say they are without collecting or storing personal information from Microsoft users.</p><p>Once the client has presented the proxy server with a valid token, the Privacy Proxy then chooses a valid egress IP address based on a hash of the client’s geolocation. It then uses the DNS record (provided by Cloudflare’s DNS resolver, <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a>) to open up an encrypted session to the origin website. From there, it’s pretty straightforward: if the user continues to browse on that site, further requests will be sent through that connection, if they stop or close the browser, that connection will close as well.</p><p>Because Cloudflare proxies millions of requests per second, many of the operational aspects of the proxy are managed by <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/">Oxy</a>, our proxying framework that handles everything from telemetry, graceful restarts, to stream multiplexing and IP fallbacks, and authentication <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oxy-extensibility/">hooks</a>.</p><h3 id="low-last-mile-latency-and-geolocation-parity-thanks-to-cloudflare%E2%80%99s-network">Low last-mile latency and geolocation parity thanks to Cloudflare’s Network</h3><p>Cloudflare’s privacy proxy implementation maximizes user experience without sacrificing privacy. When Edge Secure Network is enabled, users will have search and browsing results relevant to where they’re geographically located. At Cloudflare, we call this the pizza test: people should be able to use any of our privacy proxy products and still be able to get results for “<em>pizza places near me</em>”. We accomplish this by always egressing through a Cloudflare data center that has an IP address that corresponds to the user’s location – we’ve written more about how we did this for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">1.1.1.1+WARP</a>.</p><p>Unlike your typical VPN operator that has dozens – sometimes hundreds – of servers, Cloudflare has a much larger footprint: data centers in <a href="https://cloudflare.com/network">over 300 cities</a>. Because our network is an anycast “every service, everywhere” approach, each of our data centers can accept traffic from an Edge Secure network client. This means that Edge users will automatically detect and connect with a Cloudflare data center geographically very close to them, minimizing last-mile latency. Finally, because Cloudflare also operates a CDN, websites that are already on Cloudflare will be given a “hot-path,” and will load faster.</p><p>We at Cloudflare are always striving to bring more privacy options to the open Internet, and we are excited to provide more private and secure browsing to Edge users.

Out of the literally dozen or so places I've worked and the half of those that went heavy on low code, it has never worked.  The complexity becomes too great after a few months of "wins" and the system falls over on itself because the people using low code need increasingly complex things.

Yes excel is used for all sorts of messy things its not ideal for, and would be better built by a programmer. But the excel file teaches the developer what their co workers actually need the product to do. It's not wasted time, it's invaluable.

It works pretty well. There are some advantage to the chosen hooks approach rather than a git attributes-based approach especially that it is more "portable": GitHub doesn't need to have musdex installed to view "musdexed" repositories and you get the nicer merge/diff behaviors from standard diff/merge in PRs and commit views and everywhere. Also, while it is much less of a performance boost compared to darcs, git still benefits in some cases of pack file delta compression/optimization due to smaller differences in "musdexed" text/XML files rather than binary containers.<p>I have one public example of this on my GitHub that comes to mind, but it's a particularly weird one because it uses a musdex plugin to extract/combine an already non-binary format. (In this case it was an Inform 7 story.ni file that I just preferred to source control as lots of smaller, column-wrapped "chapter" files rather than one long "book" file of run-on paragraphs. GitHub's cool modern code browser hasn't been taught how to do jump to section for Inform 7 story.ni files, so it is nice being able to browse it as a file tree instead. Similar it's nice to see commit diffs broken down by chapter. I can't install my own Inform 7 plugin to GitHub's website, but I can certainly reshape my repo with a tool like musdex.)

This behavioral data, also known as sensor data, includes the device characteristics, device orientation, accelerometer data, touch events, etc. Akamai BMP SDK provides a simple API to detect bot activities and defend against malicious bot and account takeover.</blockquote><p>It includes this graphic, which just seems to reinforce the above description, that their bot detection service(s) uses sensor data like accelerometer capabilities to determine whether a requestor is a bot or not.</p><figure><img src="https://grantwinney.com/content/images/2020/07/infographic_overview_human-request_redo.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption>source: <a href="https://developer.akamai.com/tools/sdk/bot-manager?ref=grantwinney.com">Bot Manager Premier SDK</a></figcaption></figure><p>I feel fairly confident that's the answer, but it leaves at least one more question...</p><h3 id="but-why-do-they-expect-desktops-to-have-an-accelerometer">But why do they expect desktops to have an accelerometer?</h3><p>I think maybe it's an oversight, but I can't really prove it.

  ONE of the most iconic trees in the UK has come down overnight, with authorities believing it's been deliberately felled.
</p><div id="po-inline-articlegate-partialarticle">
<p>
  The Sycamore Gap tree&nbsp;which stood tall&nbsp;next to Hadrian's Wall near Crag Lough in Northumberland,&nbsp;is standing no more, pictures from the scene show.
</p>
<p>
  In a statement, Northumberland National Park Authority said: "Northumberland National Park Authority can confirm that sadly, the famous tree at Sycamore Gap has come down overnight. We have reason to believe it has been deliberately felled.
</p>

<p>
  "We are working with the relevant agencies and partners with an interest in this iconic North East landmark and will issue more details once they are known.
</p>
<p>
  "Sycamore Gap was voted English Tree of the Year in 2016 in the Woodland Trust’s awards and is much-loved by people from across the world.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/23819533.live-updates-shock-iconic-sycamore-gap-taken/">Follow live updates here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  "Northumberland National Park Authority would like to ask the public not to visit the site at this time whilst we work with our partners to identify what has happened and to make the site safe."
</p>

<p>
  The location was once a popular photographic subject, and it was described as one of the most photographed trees in the country.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It featured in the 1991 film&nbsp;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and won the&nbsp;2016 England Tree of the Year&nbsp;award.
</p>
<p>
  A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: “We can confirm an investigation has been launched following damage to the Sycamore Gap Tree in Northumberland.
</p>
<p>
  “Enquiries are ongoing to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed."

I'm a big believer in "decision support systems". Find out <i>what</i> decisions your customers need to make, repeatedly, to their job.  Quantify the heuristics and visualize that information (and that information only) in an easy to consume manner.  More often than not <i>that's an email or PDF</i>. Another advantage is that by <i>supporting</i> the business users they feel less threatened by the changes or technology.<p>I think "self-serve" analytics is silly, the idea that you put all of the data in front of people and they'll derive "insights". That's not how normal people or data work. We just had a discussion on HN the other day about Facebook's Prophet, and its pitfalls.  Meanwhile we expect Joe in sales to be able to identify useful trends on a chart he made.  <i>Every</i> company needs to forecast, regardless of their sophistication.  That stuff needs to be defined by the right people and given to the users.

It mixes 'strategic insights' with 'operational needs'. And I think self-service needs to be about operationalizing data. Sales managers are not necessarily looking to 'analyze' data or 'get an insight'. They need answers from data to manage their team. They need to track well-defined KPIs. See how their salespeople are doing and be able to have a productive meeting to tell them what they are neglecting. Customer success people need to "pull some data real quick" on the usage of the product by a certain client before a meeting.<p>These things happen all the time. And yet most companies out there think that the solution is to just build a bunch of dashboards, foreseeing what everyone will ask in the future. And then nobody checks the dashboards. Or finds the right one. And then they have a team of SQL translators pulling data for ad-hoc questions. That's silly IMO.</p><p>I'm obviously biased as a founder of a self-service analytics company based on AI (<a href="https://www.veezoo.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.veezoo.com</a>). But this is just my 2 cents on a topic I really care about.

I remember back during a previous section of my career when I was running BI for a manufacturing company.  We were asked to web-ify some legacy reports that either ran on desktops using Access &amp; Excel or were on older BI products (Cognos).  It was shocking -- at the time (I was naive) -- how many business requirements were essentially "replicate Excel in a browser", and completely divorced from the actual business processes and decisions that needed to be made.<p>Also, it might surprise a lot of less experienced developers just how many reporting tools are actually pieces of a workflow, not just reports.  If you sniff this out during the requirements phase, do your best to convert these reports into features of an actual workflow app/system rather than allow them to persist as standalone reports.

By increasing the number of users or increasing the revenue per user.  Are we measuring those things?  And on and on.

Most of the time the initial question is very loosely defined, but actually having these conversations with the people who "want data", and helping them structure their thinking is also a hugely rewarding part of working in data and analytics, and will help you advance in your career.<p>It can be easy to have a cynical view of what people are asking for, but in my experience there is often real value you can uncover.</p><p>One thing which helped me a lot is having a decent understanding of accounting and finance. A fun, and fairly quick, way to develop that is by taking a course on financial modelling (in excel). Modelling a business in a spreadsheet is a lot of fun, and it helps you build good intuition on the underlying "physics" of how a business makes money.

Some thoughts from my experience:<p>- Everyone asks to translate simpler spreadsheets and Excel charts/graphs into dashboards in your BI tool of choice. As soon as it's there, they'll ask you why they can't export to manage the data themselves. This vicious cycle can sometimes be stopped but is a slow-motion drag on productivity in lots of orgs.</p><p>- Build in validations, and/or work on ways to check the dashboard. Dashboards sometimes put their builders and consumers on auto-pilot. The dashboard "must be right" but could easily have a bug or inaccuracy for weeks/months/etc. that isn't obvious without some external validation.</p><p>- The dashboard never has the "right" metrics - users will continue asking for changes. Be your best advocate and say no as a way of understanding the importance of the ask</p><p>- Related: always ask why about everything you're building into or modifying in dashboards. Business users often ask for things without an ounce of rationale.</p><p>- Related: taking away is harder than not doing at all!</p><p>Finally, I think most dashboards miss one fundamental point. Imagine you're the CEO/COO and you've got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you're seeing? What's the succinct summary?</p><p>I like building in spots to write 2-3 sentence executive summaries.

The concept I like to explain to the BI teams is that the dashboard is always just a snapshot of “what” is happening. But the underlying base level data is always needed to understand “why” it’s happening. And without the why, there’s no actual intelligence gain.<p>Take a metric like Average Order Value (AOV). It may be ; total sales / order quantity. But as that metric is used it’s often being compared to something like last year, last month, or a plan and anyone interested in that number is really interested in understanding the “why” it has changed from some other point in time/scenario.</p><p>For that, you actually need to bring in line item details behind orders as each order has multiple products/skus and they likely sold at different prices from a year ago or what was expected in a plan. An analysis of this has a name, price-volume-mix analysis or PVM.</p><p>I always seem to have to explain this to BI teams when I join a new company and am seeking data. I’m currently going through it with a BI team, that apparently the BI tool wouldn’t store this information. It’s like it only stores aggregate values so it’s not even possible to get base level data for analysis (without major architectural changes). I don’t know if that’s normal in BI or was an implementation decision at some point but I’ve come across this same thing on a handful of companies and as I said I really have to drive this concept for those teams. When I ask of it I’m usually met with a “why would you need that info / give us a use case”. Which means, the don’t even understand how un-intelligent their BI tool is or why the execs likely aren’t feeling like investing in BI has been worthwhile (eg. Ever build a dashboard that then goes unused? I probably wasn’t perceived as useful for some reason like this).</p><p>This could be more concise put as, understanding your end users needs. Understand the difference of what people ask for is often different than what they need. If they ask for AOV metrics, they’re really saying “I need to understand AOV” and that’s done via PVM analysis.

The visual aspects of dashboards can easily drift over time even if the data is correct. You’re often theming charting libraries for example and the compliance of the theme can drift slightly if you update the library without really checking every detail of the visual appearance/layout every time. Or you may not even notice the “visual drift”…

Imagine you're the CEO/COO and you've got this beautiful 3 or 4-chart dashboard in front of you. What should you know about what you're seeing? What's the succinct summary?<p>Having been on both sides of this, I think the challenge is that the CEO/COO's job is to figure out "what should we do about this?," which is the right approach to coming up with that summary (it's not just "here's a text version of the chart"). And the corollary challenge is that, in most cases, non-technical people with domain knowledge are the ones who need to produce the analysis: so any feature incomplete dashboard is going to stymie them and any general framework that requires a technical person to step in for code or configuration is going to slow the process to a crawl.</p><p>It's the rule (not the exception) that (especially if things are going poorly) the next step is asking more questions, which involves investigating something else in more detail. A dashboard, however pretty, is as useless as a doorknob if it doesn't have the needed information.</p><p>I have found that dashboards per say are always great as the high-level KPI trackers, like the things you would consider hanging on a wall in an office (e.g. "revenue growth this month" or "new customers acquired"). You'll always want to know that information, and many people of unrelated departments need to have that information shared to them.</p><p>The other helpful area is a deep-dive domain-specific analytics programs, like for example Google Analytics, where it has a very full featureset for non-technical marketing people to go in and drill down to answer questions. The UI/UX designers of that product have spent years honing and A/B testing which types of graphs to show where, and mapping out how to have people click around to find what they're looking for, to the point it is pretty easy for non-technical people. They even have courses and certifications on how to use the system.</p><p>Organizations that try to internally build a feature-complete system like google analytics for a specific domain need to consider it like building an entire software product (even if there's a general low/no-code BI SaaS to assist) because you'll need collaboration between general technical experts and non-technical stakeholders with changing and vague requirements. It can be done, but likely only with years of investment and UI/UX research, just like any other software product that solves a domain problem well. In practice: millions of dollars.</p><p>Technologists often forget that Excel *is* a turing complete programming language (and it's a functional programming paradigm too!). If an org is not committed to spend years and millions of dollars on deep dive analytics for a specific domain, the right choice is almost always using a commercial analytics system for that domain that costs less than the internal build, or embracing the trusty spreadsheet.

It’s often less clear what those insights will be or what is needed to produce them, we somehow hope they will materialize by just displaying some data. Often the focus is on making pretty-looking charts (which only ever look good when you demo with picturesque fake data), because you want the product to feel colorful, welcoming and visual.</p><p>A better approach is to either make a focused tool for solving a specific problem you know users have - you won’t think of what you end up with as a “dashboard” but it might occasionally end up looking a little like one - or to make general tools that allow users to dig through data interactively to find the things they care about.

Grafana is AGPL, be very careful with anything AGPL in your tech stack because it may force you to open source your code. Apache Superset is pretty cool. I've seen big startup valuations with off-the-shelf BI tools. If its an MVP, definitely consider using this as opposed to rolling your own.</p><p>- Making assumptions for your users is bad because users will always ask for more. So building a flexible framework where users can add/remove visuals and build their own analytics may be necessary. The flipside is this adds complexity and can confuse the user. Its a delicate balance to cater to all types of users: the basic user vs the power user.</p><p>- How do users send you feedback? Bad data point? How do you find out? Can the user address it themselves?

"I have all the data in a spreadsheet but I want it in a dashboard" he said. I was a specialized systems dev, only occasionally doing a bit of webdev if necessary and really didn't have time for those kind of errands.<p>I showed him this tutorial I had recently seen. Just a few minutes and the thumbnail,  about how to build a "dashboard" in excel.

He asked for the link, never did anything with it of course but was totally satisfied. I am pretty sure he just wanted a shiny toy and also felt inadequate about "just using excel" to do his important founder work.  Showing him that excel can look beautiful and is a powerful tool was enough. No more feeling inadequate, no need for an actual (or even excel) dashboard.

This pre-empts a lot of questions about the report, but more importantly builds trust in what the data is showing (vs having a user self-serve, nervous that they’re making a decision with bad data - ultimately they’ll reach out to an analyst to get them to do the analysis for them).</p><p>The second most important factor was loading speed - we noticed that after around 8 seconds of waiting, business users would disengage with a report, or lose trust in the system presenting the information (“I think it’s broken”). Most often this resulted in people not logging in to look at reports - they were busy with tons of other things, so once they expected reports to take a while to load, they stopped coming back.</p><p>The third big finding was giving people data where they already are, in a format they understand. A complicated filter interface would drive our users nuts and turned into many hours of training and technical support. For this reason, we always wanted a simple UI with great mobile support for reports - our users were on the go and could already do most other things on their phones.</p><p>We couldn’t achieve these things in BI tools, so for important decisions, we had to move the work to tools that could offer text support, instant report loading, and a familiar and accessible format: PowerPoint, PDF, and email. Of course this is a difficult workflow to automate and maintain, but for us it was crucial to get engagement on the work we were producing, and it worked.</p><p>This experience inspired my colleague and I to start an open source BI tool which could achieve these things with a more maintainable, version controlled workflow. The tool is called Evidence (<a href="https://evidence.dev/">https://evidence.dev</a>) if anyone is interested.

It can be tough to figure out what the end user needs in the first place, let alone the details of how to define individual metrics or slice the data. This is a huge pain point for both externally and internally facing deliverables, but it's especially tough for external clients because you're likely a lot more limited in your ability to communicate ad-hoc to clarify things down the line. And once you've delivered something that's either irrelevant or inaccurate, then it can end up being game over for the engagement (if you're working externally) or your counterpart's trust in your output (if you're working internally).<p>So it's super important to get on the same page RE: goals and expectations and keep that alignment going to the end - so that there aren't any unpleasant surprises at the delivery stage.

So large amounts of work go into building dashboards that are used for a very short amount of time and then discarded. Probably we should do a better job on one-off analyses and only dashboard after the fact.</p><p>Many users don't actually want a dashboard, what they actually want is a live data dump into excel where they can pivot table it. Maybe, <i>maybe</i> a bar or line chart.</p><p>In general, I find people always ask for more filters, more slicers, just endless options to reconfigure the data as they please. But they quickly become trapped in a swamp of their own making, now nobody knows how this should be sorted or sliced, does it even make sense to do it this way? People think what they want is a 'data democracy' with hundreds of dashboards with hundreds of options with hundreds of users and so they ask for and usually receive it. But they usually just end up coming back to the data team and asking - 'so what's the answer?' What many orgs need is actually a data dictator.</p><p>On the other hand, dashboards do allow you to establish really good feedback loops within the business so when you can identify an ongoing constraint, figure out how to track it and then force people to receive it on a regular cadence and be accountable to it, you can make a lot of headway. But that's a more niche use-case than how they're frequently used and the skills involved are different - less visualization skills, more business analysis - and you need to be positioned to make sure someone is held accountable.

At risk of repeating others, here's what I've learned working on business intelligence tools for an engineering group:<p>- What users ask for and what users really want are often extremely different.</p><p>- Engineering executives like to place their "thumbprint" on every business analytics dashboard. They want evidence that the "intelligence" being reported has been customized by them. It's their way of imparting branding on the organization.</p><p>- UI/UX is far more important to users than how you handle the technical details. When discussing implementation with them, start with the UI so that they have a mental model to build from.</p><p>- Leave space to create cool things that you/your team want to make. The developers of BI dashboards often have excellent ideas for visualizing data that an end-user would not immediately think of. Leave room to "delight".</p><p>- Never assume the data is clean or accurate (even when there are regulatory reasons for it to be either of those things)</p><p>- Not everyone's opinion is equally valuable.</p><p>- Beware of corporate politics. I once had an analytics project completely shut down because it would expose certain weaknesses in the business that were not acceptable to discuss publicly.</p><p>Bonus: Read "Envisioning Information" by Edward Tufte.

<p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/author/noam-chomsky-4748/">Noam Chomsky</a> made his name as a linguist, which is easy to forget amid the wide range of subjects he has addressed, and continues to address, in his long career as a public intellectual. But on a deeper level, his commentary on politics, society, media, and a host of other broad fields sounds not unlike a natural outgrowth of his specialized linguistic theories. Throughout the past five or six decades, he’s occasionally made the connection explicit, or nearly so, by drawing analogies between language and other domains of human activity. Take the panel-discussion clip above, in which Chomsky faces the question of why he doesn’t accept the notion of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63_kAw3WmE">cultural relativism</a>, which holds moral norms as not absolute but created wholly within particular cultural contexts.</p>
<p>“There are no skeptics,” Chomsky says. “You can discuss it in a philosophy seminar, but no human being can, in fact, be a skeptic. They wouldn’t survive for two minutes if they were. I think pretty much the same is true of moral relativism. There are no moral relativists: there are people who profess it, you can discuss it abstractly, but it doesn’t exist in ordinary life.” He identifies “a tendency to move from the uncontroversial concept of moral relativism” — that, say, certain cultures at certain times hold certain moral values, and other cultures at other times hold other ones — “to a concept that is, in fact, incoherent, and that is to say that moral values can range indefinitely,” tethered to no objective basis.</p>


<p>If morality is transmitted through culture, “how does a person acquire his or her culture? You don’t get it by taking a pill. You acquire your culture by observing a rather limited number of behaviors and actions, and from those, constructing, somehow, in your mind, the set of attitudes and beliefs that constitutes culture.” He draws a natural comparison between this process and that of language acquisition, which also depends on “having a rich built-in array of constraints that allow the leap from scattered data to whatever it is that you acquire. That’s virtually logic.” And so, “even if you’re the most extreme cultural relativist, you are presupposing universal moral values. Those can be discovered.” When he spoke of “the most extreme cultural relativist,” he was thinking of Michel Foucault?</p>
<p>Back in 1971, Chomsky engaged the French philosopher of power in <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/michel-foucault-and-noam-chomsky-debate-human-nature-power-on-dutch-tv-1971.html#google_vignette">a debate, broadcast on Dutch television</a>, about human nature and the origin of morality. There he practically lead with linguistics: a child learning to talk starts “with the knowledge that he’s hearing a human language of a very narrow and explicit type that permits a very small range of variation.” This “highly organized and very restrictive schematism” allows him to “make the huge leap from scattered and degenerate data to highly organized knowledge.” This mechanism “is one fundamental constituent of human nature,” in not just language but “other domains of human intelligence and other domains of human cognition and even behavior” as well. Perhaps we do have the freedom to speak, think, and act however we wish — but that very freedom, if Chomsky is correct, emerges only within strict, absolute, wholly un-relative natural boundaries.</p>

# 🤔 Why YAML is the right devops technology for you 🤔
#
# - 100% test coverage, always compiles just fine with no errors or warnings, always shippable
# - no enforced error handling during development because runtime "panic at the disco" in production is dope
# - "something broke" is way better than stack traces with line numbers
# - you need to burn hours as part of setting up a new CI pipeline
# - safe choice with unquestionable industry adoption, "used by kubernetes"
# - is marginally better than windows.ini
# - unlike json [1], YAML supports comments
# - no official documentation (other than a specification for implementers) is totally fine
# - you need a super safe way to "execute this code"

# 🍿 wait a sec, did you say "executable yaml"?? 🍿

# 🚨 Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway 🚨
# `NO` is parsed as a boolean type, which with the YAML 1.1 spec, there are 22 options to write "true" or "false."
# You have to wrap "NO" in quotes to get the expected result.
NI: Nicaragua
NL: Netherlands
NO: Norway # 💣!

# YAML knows that, when you have something that looks like the time of day,
# what you _really_ wanted is the time of seconds since midnight
timeOfDay:
  whatYouWrote: 04:30 # And when you parse this file and serialize it again, you get ...
  whatYouSurelyMeant: 16200 # Have fun debugging this one!
  whatYouShouldHaveWritten: !!str 04:30

# YAML is the super best way to encode Octal (tm) and learning the hard way that Kubernetes uses YAML 1.1
# is a DevOps rite of passage. Below YAML 1.2 a large integer is automatically converted to octal.
- YAML 1.1 uses `0666` notation.
- YAML 1.2 uses `0o666` notation

# and finally, here's some ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ feedback from reddit.com:
- I need to burn the very motherboard this site runs from. It’s that awful.
- This is the worst website I've ever seen
- I agree with the author in principle but that website is inexcusable. I'm going to add YAML config to my projects on Monday just to spite that horrific "website".
- Wtf is this website and why does it repeatedly pop up my phone's keyboard
	- This Website is a giant editable textfield
		- Why?!?
			- Because it’s a good idea to demonstrate good standards while standing on one’s soapbox
				- The author of THAT website wants to tell the rest of us how to program.
- While I agree with the spirit of the website (fuck yaml), the design decisions of the author are questionable to say the least.
- The good news (I realised) was that you can select all the text of the site, and then delete it. Problem solved.
- Fuck this website. Maybe if this person stopped bitching about yaml their website wouldn't blow.
- Yeah, I’m not going to take advice on best practices from a guy whose website is a giant editable text field with unclickable hyperlinks.

# ps. By design, this website is as usable as YAML. 💕

The percentage of medium-sized CMs (100–300 μm<sup>2</sup>) decreased, whereas the number of larger CMs (&gt;300 μm<sup>2</sup>) increased significantly, reflecting the overall increase of CM surface area (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig1">1h</a>). The relatively modest increase of CM surface area, in contrast to the massive increase in CM numbers in <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> hearts, suggests that the increased heart size is mainly caused by hyperplastic growth.

To determine the contribution of CM proliferation to heart regeneration after I–R damage and to exclude enhanced protection as the main cause of the absence of scar formation, we initiated <i>Cpt1b</i> deletion 1 day after applying the I–R injury. Initiation of <i>Cpt1b</i> deletion by injection of TAM did not reduce CPT1B protein levels at 3 and 6 days after I–R injury, corresponding to 2 and 5 days after the first TAM injection. CPT1B protein levels were significantly reduced only 11 days after I–R injury (corresponding to 10 days after the first TAM injection) excluding the possibility that cardioprotection can occur owing to the absence CPT1B (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig10">5h</a>).

Furthermore, targeted metabolome analysis revealed that levels of acyl-carnitines derived from medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids are strongly reduced in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, whereas intracellular levels of free carnitine were markedly elevated (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3b</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6b,c</a>). Unexpectedly, intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA and most metabolites of the Krebs cycle, such as citrate, succinate and malate, were not significantly altered, suggesting that CMs use different forms of energy production in the absence of FAO (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6d</a>). We assume that increased glucose oxidation compensates to some extent for the loss of FAO in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs to generate acetyl-CoA, as the expression level of PDH1A but not that of its inhibitor PDK4 increases.

We detected a major enrichment of metabolites involved in amino acid turnover, including ammonia recycling and urea cycle (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6f</a>). The levels of several amino acids whose intermediates (for example, acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA and fumarate) replenish the Krebs cycle were increased as well (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6g,h</a>). Likewise, we found a marked elevation of the levels of metabolites from branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient hearts, including α-ketoisovalerate and α-keto-β-methylvalerate. The levels of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA, which serve as precursors for succinyl-CoA, were also increased (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3d,e</a>). Thus, we reason that enhanced glucose oxidation and BCAA catabolism in <i>Cpt1b-</i>deficient CMs efficiently compensate for impaired metabolic flux of fatty acid-derived acetyl-CoA into the Krebs cycle in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs. This conclusion is also supported by the increased metabolic flux rate of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled glucose and isoleucine to metabolites of the Krebs cycle or BCAA catabolism, respectively. Additional evidence comes from Seahorse analysis of <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, indicating more efficient utilization of pyruvate, BCAAs and glucose compared to control CMs (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3f,g</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6i,j</a>).</p><p>Notably, we detected a marked, nearly 20-fold, increase of αKG in CMs after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a>). A direct conversion of glutamine and glutamate to αKG seems unlikely to account for the accumulation of αKG, as neither the concentration of glutamine nor that of glutamate declined (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c</a>). Instead, we observed significantly reduced isocitrate levels, along with an increase of the levels of IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3A, which catalyse conversion of isocitrate to αKG (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3c,h</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6k</a>). In addition, the enzymatic activity of OGDH, the key component of the αKG dehydrogenase complex converting αKG to succinyl-CoA was reduced in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs, despite an increase in protein concentrations of OGDH complex components (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig3">3h,i</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig11">6l</a>). The reduction of the enzymatic activity of OGDH is most likely caused by the well-known inhibitory effects of intermediate metabolites from BCAA catabolism, the levels of which are increased in the <i>Cpt1b</i> mutants<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Patel, M.

By contrast, the levels of heterochromatin markers such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me2 were markedly increased after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i>, probably owing to secondary effects associated with the shift of CMs to a more immature state (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4a</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8a</a>). Consistently, H3K4me3 levels are decreased in <i>Ogdh</i>-deficient CMs, which also exhibited increased αKG levels (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8b</a>). Expression levels of enzymes determining H3K4me3 levels, including methyltransferases (that is, <i>Kmt2</i> family, <i>Ash1l</i>, <i>Prdm9</i> and <i>Smyd</i> family) and αKG-dependent H3K4me3 demethylases (that is, <i>Kdm5a-d</i>, <i>Kdm2b</i> and <i>Riox1</i>), did not change after inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i>. Neither did we detect a change in the intracellular levels of <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine, the methyl-group donor for histone methylation. Therefore, we conclude that αKG boosts the activity of a H3K4me3-specific demethylase, eventually leading to reduction of H3K4me3 levels (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8c,d</a>).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-4" data-title="Increased αKG levels induce H3K4me3 demethylation and decrease expression of CM maturity genes."><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig4" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 4: Increased αKG levels induce H3K4me3 demethylation and decrease expression of CM maturity genes.</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5/figures/4" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig4" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-023-06585-5/MediaObjects/41586_2023_6585_Fig4_HTML.png" alt="figure 4" loading="lazy" width="685" height="594"></picture></a></div><div data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-4-desc"><p><b>a</b>, Western blot analysis of histone methylation&nbsp;modifications using FACS-isolated CM nuclei from <i>Ctrl</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> and <i>Cpt1b</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> mice (<i>n</i> = 3 mice&nbsp;each).

Genes showing the 25% broadest peaks exhibited the highest transcriptional activity and were preferentially associated with CM maturation and function (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4b,c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8g</a>). Integrated analysis of RNA-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP–seq datasets indicated that 31.6% (151) of genes with reduced H3K4me3 peaks were transcriptionally repressed. A total of 95 genes (62.91%) in this group contained broad H3K4me3 peaks and 44 genes (29.14%) contained medium H3K4me3 peaks. By contrast, only a few genes with narrow H3K4me3 peaks (7.95%) showed reduced expression in <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4d</a>). Reduction of H3K4me3 deposition in genes with both reduced expression and reduced H3K4me3 peaks was found to be more pronounced inside gene bodies compared to transcription start site regions (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8h</a>). Strikingly, such genes were mostly associated with cardiac muscle contraction, CM differentiation and maturation, including <i>Mylk3</i>, <i>Cacna1g</i> and <i>Myocd</i> (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig4">4e,f</a>). We validated these findings by ChIP–qPCR, demonstrating that H3K4me3 enrichment was broadly diminished in both promoters and gene bodies of genes associated with CM maturation, whereas H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 levels at promoters remained unchanged (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig13">8i–k</a>). Taking these findings together, we conclude that accumulation of αKG activates a H3K4me3-specific demethylase, which subsequently erases H3K4me3 within genes required for cardiac differentiation and maturation, thereby converting <i>Cpt1b</i>-deficient CMs into a more immature, proliferation-competent state.</p></div></div><div id="Sec7-section" data-title="Activated KDM5 stimulates proliferation"><h2 id="Sec7">Activated KDM5 stimulates proliferation</h2><div id="Sec7-content"><p>To confirm that accumulation of αKG is a critical signal to prevent CM maturation and enable proliferation, we treated P0–1 neonatal CMs for 4 days with cell-permeable αKG.

Furthermore, the level of expression of <i>Nppa</i>, <i>Nppb</i>, <i>Acta1</i> and <i>Myh7</i>, genes that are predominantly expressed during fetal and neonatal stages, was strongly elevated, whereas the level of expression of genes associated with CM maturation and differentiation, including <i>Tnni3</i>, <i>Mylk3</i> and <i>Myocd</i>,&nbsp;was reduced (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig5">5c</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig14">9a</a>).

In line with this finding, overexpression of enzymes in CMs that increase αKG levels, such as those encoded by <i>Idh3b</i> and <i>Idh3g</i>, stimulated CM proliferation, markedly reduced H3K4me3 deposition and lowered mRNA levels of cardiac maturation-related genes (Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig14">9c–h</a>).

To validate potential targets of KDM5B, we carried out ChIP–qPCR experiments. We found that KDM5B preferentially binds to genes with broad H3K4me3 domains involved in maintaining the mature phenotype of CMs, such as <i>Tnni3</i>, <i>Mylk3</i> and <i>Myocd</i>. By contrast, no enrichment of KDM5B was found on housekeeping genes characterized by narrow peaks, such as <i>Dus1l</i>, <i>Snx19</i> and <i>Lsm6</i>. Notably, mRNA levels of these housekeeping genes were not altered in response to αKG, <i>Kdm5b</i> knockdown or combined treatment (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig5">5j</a> and Extended Data Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06585-5#Fig15">10h</a>).

Chest hair was removed, and skin was disinfected and opened with a small incision of several millimetres in length from the left armpit to the sternal border. Pectoralis major and minor muscles were separated, the chest was opened in the third intercostal space, and retractors were inserted. Next, the pericardium was opened to access the heart. The left coronary artery was ligated for 30 min and reopened for reperfusion in a proximal position using a prolene suture (7-0). The retractors were removed, and the chest wall was closed by bringing together the second and third rib using a vicryl suture (5-0). The muscles were placed into their original position, and the skin incision was closed with vicryl (5-0). Mice were ventilated with oxygen until awakening, followed by extubation, and placement into their cages. At 24 h after I–R surgery, the animals were euthanized for AAR and infarct area out of AAR measurement, for which hearts were removed and the aorta quickly cannulated for an injection of 500 µl 1% Evan’s blue solution into the ventricle. Hearts were kept on ice-cold saline for further investigations. Afterwards, the heart was frozen and sliced at 0.5 mm.

Quantification of H3K4me3 levels is shown in the lower panel (Ctrl n = 4, <i>Kdm5b-myc</i> n = 5). H3 was used as loading control and pan-actin as sample processing control. <b>c</b>, Western blot analysis of H3K4me3 in P0-1 CMs transduced with a <i>Kdm5b</i> lentivirus with and without αKG treatment (n = 3, each). H3 was used as sample processing control. Quantification of H3K4me3 levels is shown in the right panel. <b>d</b>, Immunofluorescence analysis of Ki67 in sarc-actinin<sup>+</sup> neonatal CMs (P0-1), 4-days after lentiviral transduction of <i>Kdm5b</i> with and without αKG treatment. Scale bar: 50 μm. <b>e</b>, Western blot analysis of H3K4me3 in P0-1 CMs after 4 days in presence of <i>Kdm5b</i> siRNA, αKG, and a combination of αKG and <i>Kdm5b</i> siRNA (n = 4, each). H3 was used as loading control. Quantification of western blots is in the right panel. <b>f</b>, Immunofluorescence analysis of Ki67 in sarc-actinin<sup>+</sup> P0-1 CMs, 4 days after treatment with <i>Kdm5b</i> siRNA with and without αKG. Scale bar: 50 μm. <b>g</b>-<b>h</b>, RT-qPCR analysis of genes related to cardiac maturation (g) and selected house-keeping genes (h) in P0-1 CMs after treatment with <i>Kdm5b</i> siRNA with and without αKG (DMSO n = 6; αKG, <i>Kdm5b KD</i> and αKG+<i>Kdm5b KD</i>, n = 4). <i>36b4</i> expression served as reference gene. <b>i</b>, Proposed model: inactivation of <i>Cpt1b</i> in CMs increases αKG levels due to increased expression of IDH and reduced enzymatic activity of OGDH, which stimulates KDM5 activity, leading to reduction of H3K4me3 deposition in cardiac maturation genes, enabling proliferation of CMs. The mechanisms underlying the transport of αKG and citrate (dashed lines) into the nucleus are not fully understood.

In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge.</span></p></section></header><section data-event-module="article body"><p icap="on">This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership. Now, for many, this appears to be approaching an end. What are the scientists to do next?</p><p>For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there can be little indecision, for their war has hardly required them to leave the old paths. Many indeed have been able to carry on their war research in their familiar peacetime laboratories. Their objectives remain much the same.</p><p>It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride, who have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive gadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated assignments. They have done their part on the devices that made it possible to turn back the enemy, have worked in combined effort with the physicists of our allies. They have felt within themselves the stir of achievement. They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.</p><p><h3>1</h3></p><p>Of what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought into existence? First, they have increased his control of his material environment. They have improved his food, his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his security and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence. They have given him increased knowledge of his own biological processes so that he has had a progressive freedom from disease and an increased span of life. They are illuminating the interactions of his physiological and psychological functions, giving the promise of an improved mental health.</p><p>Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.</p><p>There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.</p><p>Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose. If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works and in reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these amounts of time might well be startling. Those who conscientiously attempt to keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated to show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on call. Mendel's concept of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/genes-are-overrated/480729/">laws of genetics</a> was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.</p><p>The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.</p><p>But there are signs of a change as new and powerful instrumentalities come into use. Photocells capable of seeing things in a physical sense, advanced photography which can record what is seen or even what is not, thermionic tubes capable of controlling potent forces under the guidance of less power than a mosquito uses to vibrate his wings, cathode ray tubes rendering visible an occurrence so brief that by comparison a microsecond is a long time, relay combinations which will carry out involved sequences of movements more reliably than any human operator and thousands of times as fast—there are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records.</p><p>Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper. Moreover, it would have been subject to frequent breakdown, so that it could not have been depended upon; for at that time and long after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.</p><p>Babbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. Had a Pharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, and that car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza.</p><p>Machines with interchangeable parts can now be constructed with great economy of effort. In spite of much complexity, they perform reliably. Witness the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/the-hidden-world-of-the-typewriter/279523/">humble typewriter</a>, or the movie camera, or the automobile. Electrical contacts have ceased to stick when thoroughly understood. Note the automatic telephone exchange, which has hundreds of thousands of such contacts, and yet is reliable. A spider web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant glow, in short, the thermionic tube of radio sets, is made by the hundred million, tossed about in packages, plugged into sockets—and it works! Its gossamer parts, the precise location and alignment involved in its construction, would have occupied a master craftsman of the guild for months; now it is built for thirty cents. The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it.</p><p><h3>2</h3></p><p>A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. Today we make the record conventionally by writing and photography, followed by printing; but we also record on film, on wax disks, and on magnetic wires. Even if utterly new recording procedures do not appear, these present ones are certainly in the process of modification and extension.</p><p>Certainly progress in photography is not going to stop. Faster material and lenses, more automatic cameras, finer-grained sensitive compounds to allow an extension of the minicamera idea, are all imminent. Let us project this trend ahead to a logical, if not inevitable, outcome. The camera hound of the future wears on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut. It takes pictures 3 millimeters square, later to be projected or enlarged, which after all involves only a factor of 10 beyond present practice. The lens is of universal focus, down to any distance accommodated by the unaided eye, simply because it is of short focal length. There is a built-in photocell on the walnut such as we now have on at least one camera, which automatically adjusts exposure for a wide range of illumination. There is film in the walnut for a hundred exposures, and the spring for operating its shutter and shifting its film is wound once for all when the film clip is inserted. It produces its result in full color. It may well be stereoscopic, and record with two spaced glass eyes, for striking improvements in stereoscopic technique are just around the corner.</p><p>The cord which trips its shutter may reach down a man's sleeve within easy reach of his fingers. A quick squeeze, and the picture is taken. On a pair of ordinary glasses is a square of fine lines near the top of one lens, where it is out of the way of ordinary vision. When an object appears in that square, it is lined up for its picture. As the scientist of the future moves about the laboratory or the field, every time he looks at something worthy of the record, he trips the shutter and in it goes, without even an audible click. Is this all fantastic? The only fantastic thing about it is the idea of making as many pictures as would result from its use.</p><p>Will there be dry photography? It is already here in two forms. When Brady made his Civil War pictures, the plate had to be wet at the time of exposure. Now it has to be wet during development instead. In the future perhaps it need not be wetted at all. There have long been films impregnated with diazo dyes which form a picture without development, so that it is already there as soon as the camera has been operated. An exposure to ammonia gas destroys the unexposed dye, and the picture can then be taken out into the light and examined. The process is now slow, but someone may speed it up, and it has no grain difficulties such as now keep photographic researchers busy. Often it would be advantageous to be able to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately.</p><p>Another process now in use is also slow, and more or less clumsy. For fifty years impregnated papers have been used which turn dark at every point where an electrical contact touches them, by reason of the chemical change thus produced in an iodine compound included in the paper. They have been used to make records, for a pointer moving across them can leave a trail behind. If the electrical potential on the pointer is varied as it moves, the line becomes light or dark in accordance with the potential.</p><p>This scheme is now used in facsimile transmission. The pointer draws a set of closely spaced lines across the paper one after another. As it moves, its potential is varied in accordance with a varying current received over wires from a distant station, where these variations are produced by a photocell which is similarly scanning a picture. At every instant the darkness of the line being drawn is made equal to the darkness of the point on the picture being observed by the photocell. Thus, when the whole picture has been covered, a replica appears at the receiving end.</p><p>A scene itself can be just as well looked over line by line by the photocell in this way as can a photograph of the scene. This whole apparatus constitutes a camera, with the added feature, which can be dispensed with if desired, of making its picture at a distance. It is slow, and the picture is poor in detail. Still, it does give another process of dry photography, in which the picture is finished as soon as it is taken.</p><p>It would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail. Television equipment today transmits sixteen reasonably good pictures a second, and it involves only two essential differences from the process described above. For one, the record is made by a moving beam of electrons rather than a moving pointer, for the reason that an electron beam can sweep across the picture very rapidly indeed. The other difference involves merely the use of a screen which glows momentarily when the electrons hit, rather than a chemically treated paper or film which is permanently altered. This speed is necessary in television, for motion pictures rather than stills are the object.</p><p>Use chemically treated film in place of the glowing screen, allow the apparatus to transmit one picture only rather than a succession, and a rapid camera for dry photography results. The treated film needs to be far faster in action than present examples, but it probably could be. More serious is the objection that this scheme would involve putting the film inside a vacuum chamber, for electron beams behave normally only in such a rarefied environment. This difficulty could be avoided by allowing the electron beam to play on one side of a partition, and by pressing the film against the other side, if this partition were such as to allow the electrons to go through perpendicular to its surface, and to prevent them from spreading out sideways. Such partitions, in crude form, could certainly be constructed, and they will hardly hold up the general development.</p><p>Like dry photography, microphotography still has a long way to go. The basic scheme of reducing the size of the record, and examining it by projection rather than directly, has possibilities too great to be ignored. The combination of optical projection and photographic reduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly purposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive. Today, with microfilm, reductions by a linear factor of 20 can be employed and still produce full clarity when the material is re-enlarged for examination. The limits are set by the graininess of the film, the excellence of the optical system, and the efficiency of the light sources employed. All of these are rapidly improving.</p><p>Assume a linear ratio of 100 for future use. Consider film of the same thickness as paper, although thinner film will certainly be usable. Even under these conditions there would be a total factor of 10,000 between the bulk of the ordinary record on books, and its microfilm replica. The <i>Encyclop</i><em>æ</em><i>dia Britannica</i> could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk. If the human race has produced since the invention of movable type a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books, tracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume corresponding to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and compressed, could be lugged off in a moving van. Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.</p><p>Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs. The material for the microfilm <i>Britannica</i> would cost a nickel, and it could be mailed anywhere for a cent. What would it cost to print a million copies? To print a sheet of newspaper, in a large edition, costs a small fraction of a cent. The entire material of the <i>Britannica</i> in reduced microfilm form would go on a sheet eight and one-half by eleven inches. Once it is available, with the photographic reproduction methods of the future, duplicates in large quantities could probably be turned out for a cent apiece beyond the cost of materials. The preparation of the original copy? That introduces the next aspect of the subject.</p><p><h3>3</h3></p><p>To make the record, we now push a pencil or tap a typewriter. Then comes the process of digestion and correction, followed by an intricate process of typesetting, printing, and distribution. To consider the first stage of the procedure, will the author of the future cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record? He does so indirectly, by talking to a stenographer or a wax cylinder; but the elements are all present if he wishes to have his talk directly produce a typed record. All he needs to do is to take advantage of existing mechanisms and to alter his language.</p><p>At a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown. A girl stroked its keys and it emitted recognizable speech. No human vocal chords entered into the procedure at any point; the keys simply combined some electrically produced vibrations and passed these on to a loud-speaker. In the Bell Laboratories there is the converse of this machine, called a Vocoder. The loudspeaker is replaced by a microphone, which picks up sound. Speak to it, and the corresponding keys move. This may be one element of the postulated system.</p><p>The other element is found in the stenotype, that somewhat disconcerting device encountered usually at public meetings. A girl strokes its keys languidly and looks about the room and sometimes at the speaker with a disquieting gaze. From it emerges a typed strip which records in a phonetically simplified language a record of what the speaker is supposed to have said. Later this strip is retyped into ordinary language, for in its nascent form it is intelligible only to the initiated. Combine these two elements, let the Vocoder run the stenotype, and the result is a machine which types when talked to.</p><p>Our present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of mechanization, it is true. It is strange that the inventors of universal languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one which better fitted the technique for transmitting and recording speech. Mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the scientific field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less intelligible to the layman.</p><p>One can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory. His hands are free, and he is not anchored. As he moves about and observes, he photographs and comments. Time is automatically recorded to tie the two records together. If he goes into the field, he may be connected by radio to his recorder. As he ponders over his notes in the evening, he again talks his comments into the record. His typed record, as well as his photographs, may both be in miniature, so that he projects them for examination.</p><p>Much needs to occur, however, between the collection of data and observations, the extraction of parallel material from the existing record, and the final insertion of new material into the general body of the common record. For mature thought there is no mechanical substitute. But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very different things. For the latter there are, and may be, powerful mechanical aids.</p><p>Adding a column of figures is a repetitive thought process, and it was long ago properly relegated to the machine. True, the machine is sometimes controlled by a keyboard, and thought of a sort enters in reading the figures and poking the corresponding keys, but even this is avoidable. Machines have been made which will read typed figures by photocells and then depress the corresponding keys; these are combinations of photocells for scanning the type, electric circuits for sorting the consequent variations, and relay circuits for interpreting the result into the action of solenoids to pull the keys down.</p><p>All this complication is needed because of the clumsy way in which we have learned to write figures. If we recorded them positionally, simply by the configuration of a set of dots on a card, the automatic reading mechanism would become comparatively simple. In fact if the dots are holes, we have the punched-card machine long ago produced by Hollorith for the purposes of the census, and now used throughout business. Some types of complex businesses could hardly operate without these machines.</p><p>Adding is only one operation. To perform arithmetical computation involves also subtraction, multiplication, and division, and in addition some method for temporary storage of results, removal from storage for further manipulation, and recording of final results by printing. Machines for these purposes are now of two types: keyboard machines for accounting and the like, manually controlled for the insertion of data, and usually automatically controlled as far as the sequence of operations is concerned; and punched-card machines in which separate operations are usually delegated to a series of machines, and the cards then transferred bodily from one to another. Both forms are very useful; but as far as complex computations are concerned, both are still in embryo.</p><p>Rapid electrical counting appeared soon after the physicists found it desirable to count cosmic rays. For their own purposes the physicists promptly constructed thermionic-tube equipment capable of counting electrical impulses at the rate of 100,000 a second. The advanced arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and they will perform at 100 times present speeds, or more.</p><p>Moreover, they will be far more versatile than present commercial machines, so that they may readily be adapted for a wide variety of operations. They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results in such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later further manipulation. Such machines will have enormous appetites. One of them will take instructions and data from a whole roomful of girls armed with simple key board punches, and will deliver sheets of computed results every few minutes. There will always be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things.</p><p><h3>4</h3></p><p>The repetitive processes of thought are not confined however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine. Not so much has been done along these lines, beyond the bounds of arithmetic, as might be done, primarily because of the economics of the situation. The needs of business and the extensive market obviously waiting, assured the advent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just as soon as production methods were sufficiently advanced.</p><p>With machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for there was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of manipulating data are a very small part of the population. There are, however, machines for solving differential equations—and functional and integral equations, for that matter. There are many special machines, such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides. There will be many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the scientist and in small numbers.</p><p>If scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of arithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical world. One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability. The abacus, with its beads strung on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration and the concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world; and it was a useful tool—so useful that it still exists.</p><p>It is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting machine. It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the future. But even this new machine will not take the scientist where he needs to go. Relief must be secured from laborious detailed manipulation of higher mathematics as well, if the users of it are to free their brains for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules. A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot. He is not even a man who can readily perform the transformations of equations by the use of calculus. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs.</p><p>All else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism, just as confidently as he turns over the propelling of his car to the intricate mechanism under the hood. Only then will mathematics be practically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistics to the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry, metallurgy, and biology. For this reason there still come more machines to handle advanced mathematics for the scientist. Some of them will be sufficiently bizarre to suit the most fastidious connoisseur of the present artifacts of civilization.</p><p><h3>5</h3></p><p>The scientist, however, is not the only person who manipulates data and examines the world about him by the use of logical processes, although he sometimes preserves this appearance by adopting into the fold anyone who becomes logical, much in the manner in which a British labor leader is elevated to knighthood. Whenever logical processes of thought are employed—that is, whenever thought for a time runs along an accepted groove—there is an opportunity for the machine. Formal logic used to be a keen instrument in the hands of the teacher in his trying of students' souls. It is readily possible to construct a machine which will manipulate premises in accordance with formal logic, simply by the clever use of relay circuits. Put a set of premises into such a device and turn the crank, and it will readily pass out conclusion after conclusion, all in accordance with logical law, and with no more slips than would be expected of a keyboard adding machine.</p><p>Logic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well to produce more assurance in its use. The machines for higher analysis have usually been equation solvers. Ideas are beginning to appear for equation transformers, which will rearrange the relationship expressed by an equation in accordance with strict and rather advanced logic. Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships. They employ a symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a strange fact in that most logical field.</p><p>A new symbolism, probably positional, must apparently precede the reduction of mathematical transformations to machine processes. Then, on beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application of logic in everyday affairs. We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register. But the machine of logic will not look like a cash register, even of the streamlined model.</p><p>So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before—for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene.</p><p>Selection, in this broad sense, is a stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker. Yet, in a narrow sense and in other areas, something has already been done mechanically on selection. The personnel officer of a factory drops a stack of a few thousand employee cards into a selecting machine, sets a code in accordance with an established convention, and produces in a short time a list of all employees who live in Trenton and know Spanish. Even such devices are much too slow when it comes, for example, to matching a set of fingerprints with one of five million on file. Selection devices of this sort will soon be speeded up from their present rate of reviewing data at a few hundred a minute. By the use of photocells and microfilm they will survey items at the rate of a thousand a second, and will print out duplicates of those selected.</p><p>This process, however, is simple selection: it proceeds by examining in turn every one of a large set of items, and by picking out those which have certain specified characteristics. There is another form of selection best illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange. You dial a number and the machine selects and connects just one of a million possible stations. It does not run over them all. It pays attention only to a class given by a first digit, then only to a subclass of this given by the second digit, and so on; and thus proceeds rapidly and almost unerringly to the selected station. It requires a few seconds to make the selection, although the process could be speeded up if increased speed were economically warranted. If necessary, it could be made extremely fast by substituting thermionic-tube switching for mechanical switching, so that the full selection could be made in one one-hundredth of a second. No one would wish to spend the money necessary to make this change in the telephone system, but the general idea is applicable elsewhere.</p><p>Take the prosaic problem of the great department store. Every time a charge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done. The inventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit for the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and, most important, the customer needs to be charged. A central records device has been developed in which much of this work is done conveniently. The salesman places on a stand the customer's identification card, his own card, and the card taken from the article sold—all punched cards. When he pulls a lever, contacts are made through the holes, machinery at a central point makes the necessary computations and entries, and the proper receipt is printed for the salesman to pass to the customer.</p><p>But there may be ten thousand charge customers doing business with the store, and before the full operation can be completed someone has to select the right card and insert it at the central office. Now rapid selection can slide just the proper card into position in an instant or two, and return it afterward. Another difficulty occurs, however. Someone must read a total on the card, so that the machine can add its computed item to it. Conceivably the cards might be of the dry photography type I have described. Existing totals could then be read by photocell, and the new total entered by an electron beam.</p><p>The cards may be in miniature, so that they occupy little space. They must move quickly. They need not be transferred far, but merely into position so that the photocell and recorder can operate on them. Positional dots can enter the data. At the end of the month a machine can readily be made to read these and to print an ordinary bill. With tube selection, in which no mechanical parts are involved in the switches, little time need be occupied in bringing the correct card into use—a second should suffice for the entire operation. The whole record on the card may be made by magnetic dots on a steel sheet if desired, instead of dots to be observed optically, following the scheme by which Poulsen long ago put speech on a magnetic wire. This method has the advantage of simplicity and ease of erasure. By using photography, however one can arrange to project the record in enlarged form and at a distance by using the process common in television equipment.</p><p>One can consider rapid selection of this form, and distant projection for other purposes. To be able to key one sheet of a million before an operator in a second or two, with the possibility of then adding notes thereto, is suggestive in many ways. It might even be of use in libraries, but that is another story. At any rate, there are now some interesting combinations possible. One might, for example, speak to a microphone, in the manner described in connection with the speech controlled typewriter, and thus make his selections. It would certainly beat the usual file clerk.</p><p><h3>6</h3></p><p>The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path.</p><p>The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.</p><p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.</p><p>Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.</p><p>It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.</p><p>In one end is the stored material. The matter of bulk is well taken care of by improved microfilm. Only a small part of the interior of the memex is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism. Yet if the user inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds of years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter material freely.</p><p>Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business correspondence takes the same path. And there is provision for direct entry. On the top of the memex is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sorts of things. When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being employed.</p><p>There is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions. Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom consults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects it for his use. Moreover, he has supplemental levers. On deflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at 100 pages at a time. Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.</p><p>A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the index. Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he calls up another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography, and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.</p><p><h3>7</h3></p><p>All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. It affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.</p><p>When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code word. Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.</p><p>Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.</p><p>The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.</p><p>And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outraged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.</p><p><h3>8</h3></p><p>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.</p><p>The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.</p><p>Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race. It might be striking to outline the instrumentalities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to stick closely to methods and elements now known and undergoing rapid development, as has been done here. Technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube. In order that the picture may not be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to present-day patterns, it may be well to mention one such possibility, not to prophesy but merely to suggest, for prophecy based on extension of the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is only a doubly involved guess.</p><p>All our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed through one of the senses—the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak or listen, the visual when we read. Is it not possible that some day the path may be established more directly?</p><p>We know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is transmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the channel of the optic nerve. This is an exact analogy with the electrical vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set: they convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio transmitter from which it is broadcast. We know further that if we can approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to touch it; we can pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and thus discover and reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just as a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.</p><p>The impulses which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her fingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in order that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys. Might not these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in which information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously metamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?</p><p>By bone conduction we already introduce sounds: into the nerve channels of the deaf in order that they may hear. Is it not possible that we may learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of first transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the human mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form? With a couple of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces pen-and-ink traces which bear some relation to the electrical phenomena going on in the brain itself. True, the record is unintelligible, except as it points out certain gross misfunctioning of the cerebral mechanism; but who would now place bounds on where such a thing may lead?</p><p>In the outside world, all forms of intelligence whether of sound or sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame exactly the same sort of process occurs. Must we always transform to mechanical movements in order to proceed from one electrical phenomenon to another? It is a suggestive thought, but it hardly warrants prediction without losing touch with reality and immediateness.</p><p>Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important.</p><p>The applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the wisdom of race experience. He may perish in conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

</p></div><p><span>But it’s not just boxes. As demonstrated by the Twitter (X) hashtag #CatSquares, cats often rush over to claim a square marked off on the floor with pieces of tape. And as many a cat person has noticed, a piece of paper on your desk, table or floor is also a powerful cat attractor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is peculiar. How safe and cozy can a cat feel sitting right out in the open on top of the water bill? Dodman describes it as something like the placebo effect. “This virtual box may provide some misplaced sense of security and psychosomatic comfort,” he writes.</span></p><p><span>Cats like boxes so much that they even fall for fake boxes. A team of researchers from Hunter College, CUNY, found that cats will happily sit in&nbsp;</span><span>illusory</span><span>&nbsp;squares.</span></p><hr><p><span>Read More: </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/yes-cats-really-do-have-facial-expressions"><span>Yes, Cats Really Do Have Facial Expressions</span></a><span></span></p><hr><h2><span>The Challenges of Cat Studies</span></h2><div><p>(Credit: Krakenimages.com/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>But before we get into the details of that study, let’s step aside for a moment and talk about scientific studies on cats. There aren’t as many of them as you’d think based on cats’ social media popularity. The reason? Cats make extremely lousy research subjects. When researchers bring cats into the lab to test their intelligence, the cats tend to wander around, hide or just laze about, completely uninterested in what the researchers are trying to get them to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>David Grimm is the author of&nbsp;</span><span>Citizen Canine: Our Evolving Relationship with Cats and Dogs</span><span>. In an</span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/04/cat-intelligence-and-cognition-are-cats-smarter-than-dogs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;article</span></a><span>&nbsp;for Slate magazine, he wrote that when he was researching the book’s chapter on animal intelligence, he asked Ádám Miklósi, one of the world’s top experts on the subject, about research on cat intelligence. Miklósi’s answer, according to Grimm, was, “We did one study on cats—and that was enough!”</span></p><p><span>So, the Hunter College researchers wisely decided to let the cats stay home. Instead of inviting cats to the lab, they recruited citizen scientists to test their cats at home. (It helped that this was during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, so plenty of people were at home with their cats, apparently getting bored with tossing catnip toys and looking for new ways to pass the time.)</span></p><hr><p><span>Read More: </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/5-cats-who-owned-famous-scientists"><span>5 Cats Who Owned Famous Scientists</span></a><span></span></p><hr><h2><span>If I Fits I Sits</span></h2><div><p>(Credit:Master1305/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>In the charmingly named and very clever</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159121001258?via=ihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;study</span></a><span>, “If I Fits I Sits: A Citizen Science Investigation into Illusory Contour Susceptibility in Domestic Cats (Felis silvestris catus),” the researchers tested cats to see if these notorious square sitters would be fooled by an optical illusion known as a Kanisza square.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A</span><a href="https://puzzlewocky.com/optical-illusions/kanizsa-square-and-triangle-illusions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>&nbsp;Kanisza square</span></a><span>&nbsp;is a visual puzzle in which Pac-Man-like circles are arranged so as to create the illusion of a square.

And sure enough, the cats were just as likely to sit in a Kanisza square as a real one.</span></p><div><p>(Credit: SwampTurtle/Shutterstock)</p></div><p><span>The study, the researchers say, confirmed previous research showing that cats are susceptible to visual illusions, which adds to the growing but still relatively meager body of research on cat cognition.

<p>The <b>prophetic perfect tense</b> is a literary technique used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> that describes future events that are so certain to happen that they are referred to in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_tense" title="Past tense">past tense</a> as if they had already happened.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

The category of "prophetic perfect" was already suggested by medieval Hebrew grammarians,<sup id="cite_ref-rogland_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-rogland-2">[2]</a></sup> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi" title="David Kimhi">David Kimhi</a>: "The matter is as clear as though it had already passed,"<sup id="cite_ref-waltke1_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-waltke1-3">[3]</a></sup> or Isaac ben Yedaiah:</p><blockquote><p>
"[The rabbis] of blessed memory followed, in these words of theirs, in the paths of the prophets who speak of something which will happen in the future in the language of the past. Since they saw in prophetic vision that which was to occur in the future, they spoke about it in the past tense and testified firmly that it had happened, to teach the certainty of his [God's] words -- may he be blessed -- and his positive promise that can never change and his beneficent message that will not be altered." (Isaac ben Yedaiah):<sup id="cite_ref-chazan_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-chazan-4">[4]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Gesenius describes it as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The perfect serves to express actions, events, or states, which the speaker wishes to represent from the point of view of completion, whether they belong to a determinate past time, or extend into the present, <b>or while still future</b>, are pictured as in their completed state." (GKC §106a)<sup id="cite_ref-gesenius_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-gesenius-5">[5]</a></sup> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"[The perfect can be used to] express facts which are undoubtedly imminent, and, therefore, in the imagination of the speaker, already accomplished (perfectum confidentiae), e.g. Nu 17:27... Gn 30:13, 1 S 6:5 ..., Pr 4:2. Even in interrogative sentences, Gn 18:12, Nu 17:28, 23:10, Ju 9:9, 11, Zc 4:10 (?), Pr 22:20.8 This use of the perfect occurs most frequently in prophetic language (perfectum propheticum). The prophet so transports himself in imagination into the future that he describes the future event as if it had been already seen or heard by him, e.g. Is 5:13 ...; 19:7, Jb 5:20, 2 Ch 20:37. Not infrequently the imperfect interchanges with such perfects either in the parallel member or further on in the narrative." (GKC §106n)<sup id="cite_ref-gesenius_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-gesenius-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote><p>
According to Waltke &amp; O'Connor:</p><blockquote><p>
"Referring to absolute future time, a perfective form may be <i>persistent</i> or <i>accidental</i>. A <i>persistent (future) perfective</i> represents a single situation extending from the present into the future.... With an <i>accidental perfective</i> a speaker vividly and dramatically represents a future situation both as complete and as independent…. This use is especially frequent in prophetic address (hence it is also called the “prophetic perfect” or “perfective of confidence”)."<sup id="cite_ref-waltke2_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-waltke2-6">[6]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Klein has attempted to identify all established instances of the prophetic perfect.<sup id="cite_ref-klein_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-klein-7">[7]</a></sup> Notarius, siding with Rogland,<sup id="cite_ref-rogland_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-rogland-2">[2]</a></sup> argues that the "prophetic perfect" is "a metaphorical use of the past tense in the retrospective future-oriented report."<sup id="cite_ref-notarius_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-notarius-8">[8]</a></sup>

<h2>Short explation</h2>
<p>The Windows NT 3.1 kernel is incompatible with enhanced 486 processors. Specifically, it is incompatible with 486 processors providing the <code>CPUID</code> instructions. Kernel debugging works fine with the 486DX-33 that was originally installed in the machine, and with the older non-enhanced core in a write-through Am486DX4-NV8T without SMM.</p>
<p>If your goal is just toying around with NT 3.1 kernel debugging, you might want to use a processor that is compatible with Windows NT 3.1 out-of-the-box. If you are as curious as me, you might want to fix Windows NT. Keep reading in this case.</p>
<h2>The underlying issue</h2>
<p>The incompatibility is due to a bug in <code>KiSaveProcessorControlState</code> (and a similar bug in the counterpart <code>KiRestoreProcessorControlState</code>), which is called from three locations inside NTOSKRNL.EXE:</p>
<ol>
<li>When an exception is reflected to the kernel debugger using <code>KdpTrap</code> (If I use Ctrl-C to break into the kernel debugger, a breakpoint exception is raised from the break-in polling functionality in the timer tick interrupt)</li>
<li>When <code>KeBugCheckEx</code> is called (i.e. the "blue screen")</li>
<li>When <code>KiSaveProcessorState</code> is invoked. This appears to never happen, as this function is neither exported nor called from inside NTOSKRNL if the control flow analysis by IDA in NTOSKRNL.EXE is exhaustive.</li>
</ol>
<p>This function is supposed to save the processor control registers into an extended <code>CONTEXT</code> structure. Its disassembly looks like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This function is supposed to save all control register (CR0, CR2, CR3, and CR4 on pentium and later processors), all debug registers (DR0-DR3, DR6, DR7) and various global protected mode settings (the address of the GDT, the address of the IDT, the selector of the active TSS and the selector of the LDT). To detect the processor type, it uses a value from the KPRCB (Kernel Processor Control Block). The KPRCB is part of the KPCR (Kernel Processor Control Region). The KPRCB for the boot processor (or the only processor on uniprocessor systems) is located at virtual address <code>FFDFF120</code>, which is hard-coded into this method. <a href="https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/inc/ntos/i386_x/kprcb/index.htm" rel="noreferrer">Geoff Chappell</a> writes this about the relevant part of the KPRCB in NT 3.1:</p>
<pre><code>+018   CHAR CpuType;
+019   CHAR CpuID;
+01A   UShort CpuStep;
</code></pre>
<p>These members of the KPCRB are initialized by <code>KiSetProcessorType</code>, which identifies the relevant processors correctly (but be aware that it mistrusts processors that report a CPUID feature level above 3 and considers them as "generic non-CPUID capable 586 compatible processors". The byte at offset 18 is set to 4 for 486 processors, 5 for Pentium processors and 6 for Pentium Pro and Pentium II/III processors. The byte at offset 19 is a boolean flag that indicates whether the processor support CPUID and it behaves "reasonable".</p>
<p>A very attentive reader might already have noticed the bug: The CMP instruction uses the <em>word</em> at address <code>FFDFF138</code> (which is 18h bytes into the KPRCB), instead of the <em>byte</em> at that address. This means the byte at offset 19h in the KPRCB is considered part of the model number. If a processor supports CPUID, its model number is considered to be 256 bigger than it actually is. This means Windows NT 3.1 treats a CPUID capable 80-4-86 processor as 80-260-86 processor. And as 260 is way larger than 5 (Pentium), that processor better had CR4.</p>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p>The fix is obvious once the bug is identified. The instruction <code>cmp     ds:word_FFDFF138, 5</code> only appears twice in NTOSKRNL.EXE, specifically in <code>KiSaveProcessorControlState</code> and <code>KiRestoreProcessorControlState</code>, and it needs to be patched to be a byte compare instead of a word compare. Use your favorite hex editor to patch <code>66 83 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05</code> to <code>90 80 3D 38 F1 DF FF 05</code>, two times. This fix applies both the NTOSKRNL.EXE from the original NT 3.1 Advanced Server distribution as well as NT 3.1 SP3.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>On a warm June day in 1978, William J. LeMessurier, one of the nation’s leading structural engineers, received a phone call at his headquarters, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from an engineering student in New Jersey. The young man, whose name has been lost in the swirl of subsequent events, said that his professor had assigned him to write a paper on the Citicorp tower, the slash-topped silver skyscraper that had become, on its completion in Manhattan the year before, the seventh-tallest building in the world.</p><p>LeMessurier found the subject hard to resist, even though the call caught him in the middle of a meeting. As a structural consultant to the architect Hugh Stubbins, Jr., he had designed the twenty-five-thousand-ton steel skeleton beneath the tower’s sleek aluminum skin. And, in a field where architects usually get all the credit, the engineer, then fifty-two, had won his own share of praise for the tower’s technical elegance and singular grace; indeed, earlier that year he had been elected to the National Academy of Engineering, the highest honor his profession bestows. Excusing himself from the meeting, LeMessurier asked his caller how he could help.</p><p>The student wondered about the columns—there are four—that held the building up. According to his professor, LeMessurier had put them in the wrong place.</p><p>“I was very nice to this young man,” LeMessurier recalls. “But I said, ‘Listen, I want you to tell your teacher that he doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about, because he doesn’t know the problem that had to be solved.’ I promised to call back after my meeting and explain the whole thing.”</p><p>The problem had been posed by a church. When planning for Citicorp Center began, in the early nineteen-seventies, the site of choice was on the east side of Lexington Avenue between Fifty-third and Fifty-fourth Streets, directly across the street from Citicorp’s headquarters. But the northwest corner of that block was occupied by St. Peter’s Church, a decaying Gothic structure built in 1905. Since St. Peter’s owned the corner, and one of the world’s biggest banking corporations wanted the whole block, the church was able to strike a deal that seemed heaven-sent: its old building would be demolished and a new one built as a freestanding part of Citicorp Center.</p><p>To clear space for the new church, Hugh Stubbins and Bill LeMessurier (he pronounces his name “LeMeasure”) set their fifty-nine-story tower on four massive, nine-story-high stilts, and positioned them at the center of each side, rather than at each corner. This daring scheme allowed the designers to cantilever the building’s corners seventy-two feet out over the church, on the northwest, and over a plaza on the southwest. The columns also produced high visual drama: a nine-hundred-and-fourteen-foot monolith that seemed all but weightless as it hovered above the street.</p><p>When LeMessurier called the student back, he related this with the pride of a master builder and the elaborate patience of a pedagogue; he, too, taught a structural-engineering class, to architecture students at Harvard. Then he explained how the peculiar geometry of the building, far from constituting a mistake, put the columns in the strongest position to resist what sailors call quartering winds—those which come from a diagonal and, by flowing across two sides of a building at once, increase the forces on both. For further enlightenment on the matter, he referred the student to a technical article written by LeMessurier’s partner in New York, an engineer named Stanley Goldstein. LeMessurier recalls, “I gave him a lot of information, and I said, ‘Now you really have something on your professor, because you can explain all of this to him yourself.’ ”</p><p>Later that day, LeMessurier decided that the information would interest his own students; like sailors, designers of tall buildings must know the wind and respect its power. And the columns were only part of the tower’s defense against swaying in severe winds. A classroom lecture would also look at the tower’s unusual system of wind braces, which LeMessurier had first sketched out, in a burst of almost ecstatic invention, on a napkin in a Greek restaurant in Cambridge: forty-eight braces, in six tiers of eight, arrayed like giant chevrons behind the building’s curtain of aluminum and glass. (“I’m very vain,” LeMessurier says. “I would have liked my stuff to be expressed on the outside of the building, but Stubbins wouldn’t have it. In the end, I told myself I didn’t give a damn—the structure was there, it’d be seen by God.”)</p><p>LeMessurier had long since established the strength of those braces in perpendicular winds—the only calculation required by New York City’s building code. Now, in the spirit of intellectual play, he wanted to see if they were just as strong in winds hitting from forty-five degrees. His new calculations surprised him. In four of the eight chevrons in each tier, a quartering wind increased the strain by forty per cent. Under normal circumstances, the wind braces would have absorbed the extra load without so much as a tremor. But the circumstances were not normal. A few weeks before, during a meeting in his office, LeMessurier had learned of a crucial change in the way the braces were joined.</p><p>The meeting had been called, during the month of May, to review plans for two new skyscrapers in Pittsburgh. Those towers, too, were designed by Hugh Stubbins with LeMessurier as structural consultant, and the plans called for wind braces similar to those used in Citicorp Center, with the same specifications for welded joints. This was top-of-the-line engineering; two structural members joined by a skilled welder become as strong as one. But welded joints, which are labor-intensive and therefore expensive, can be needlessly strong; in most cases, bolted joints are more practical and equally safe. That was the position taken at the May meeting by a man from U.S. Steel, a potential bidder on the contract to erect the Pittsburgh towers. If welded joints were a condition, the project might be too expensive and his firm might not want to take it on.</p><p>To reassure him, LeMessurier put in a call to his office in New York. “I spoke to Stanley Goldstein and said, ‘Tell me about your success with those welded joints in Citicorp.’ And Stanley said, ‘Oh, didn’t you know? They were changed—they were never welded at all, because Bethlehem Steel came to us and said they didn’t think we needed to do it.’ ” Bethlehem, which built the Citicorp tower, had made the same objection—welds were stronger than necessary, bolts were the right way to do the job. On August 1, 1974, LeMessurier’s New York office—actually a venture in conjunction with an old-line Manhattan firm called the Office of James Ruderman—had accepted Bethlehem’s proposal.</p><p>This news gave LeMessurier no cause for concern in the days immediately following the meeting. The choice of bolted joints was technically sound and professionally correct. Even the failure of his associates to flag him on the design change was justifiable; had every decision on the site in Manhattan waited for approval from Cambridge, the building would never have been finished. Most important, modern skyscrapers are so strong that catastrophic collapse is not considered a realistic prospect; when engineers seek to limit a building’s sway, they do so for the tenants’ comfort.</p><p>Yet now, a month after the May meeting, the substitution of bolted joints raised a troubling question. If the bracing system was unusually sensitive to quartering winds, as LeMessurier had just discovered, so were the joints that held it together. The question was whether the Manhattan team had considered such winds when it designed the bolts. “I didn’t go into a panic over it,” LeMessurier says. “But I was haunted by a hunch that it was something I’d better look into.”</p><p>On July 24th, he flew to New York, where his hunch was soon confirmed: his people had taken only perpendicular winds into account. And he discovered another “subtle conceptual error,” as he calls it now—one that threatened to make the situation much worse.</p><p>To understand why, one must look at the interplay of opposing forces in a windblown building. The wind causes tension in the structural members—that is, it tries to blow the building down. At the same time, some of that tension, measured in thousands, or even millions, of pounds, is offset by the force of gravity, which, by pressing the members together, tends to hold the building in place. The joints must be strong enough to resist the differential between these forces—the amount of wind tension minus the amount of compression.</p><p>Within this seemingly simple computation, however, lurks a powerful multiplier. At any given level of the building, the compression figure remains constant; the wind may blow harder, but the structure doesn’t get any heavier. Thus, immense leverage can result from higher wind forces. In the Citicorp tower, the forty-per-cent increase in tension produced by a quartering wind became a hundred-and-sixty-per-cent increase on the building’s bolts.</p><p>Precisely because of that leverage, a margin of safety is built into the standard formulas for calculating how strong a joint must be; these formulas are contained in an American Institute of Steel Construction specification that deals with joints in structural columns. What LeMessurier found in New York, however, was that the people on his team had disregarded the standard. They had chosen to define the diagonal wind braces not as columns but as trusses, which are exempt from the safety factor. As a result, the bolts holding the joints together were perilously few. “By then,” LeMessurier says, “I was getting pretty shaky.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>He later detailed these mistakes in a thirty-page document called “Project <em>serene</em>”; the acronym, both rueful and apt, stands for “Special Engineering Review of Events Nobody Envisioned.” What emerges from this document, which has been confidential until now, and from interviews with LeMessurier and other principals in the events, is not malfeasance, or even negligence, but a series of miscalculations that flowed from a specific mind-set. In the case of the Citicorp tower, the first event that nobody envisioned had taken place when LeMessurier sketched, on a restaurant napkin, a bracing system with an inherent sensitivity to quartering winds. None of his associates identified this as a problem, let alone understood that they were compounding it with their fuzzy semantics. In the stiff, angular language of “Project <em>serene</em>,” “consideration of wind from non-perpendicular directions on ordinary rectangular buildings is generally not discussed in the literature or in the classroom.”</p><p>LeMessurier tried to take comfort from another element of Citicorp’s advanced design: the building’s tuned mass damper. This machine, built at his behest and perched where the bells would have been if the Citicorp tower had been a cathedral, was essentially a four-hundred-and-ten-ton block of concrete, attached to huge springs and floating on a film of oil. When the building swayed, the block’s inertia worked to damp the movement and calm tenants’ queasy stomachs. Reducing sway was of special importance, because the Citicorp tower was an unusually lightweight building; the twenty-five thousand tons of steel in its skeleton contrasted with the Empire State Building’s sixty-thousand-ton superstructure. Yet the damper, the first of its kind in a large building, was never meant to be a safety device. At best, the machine might reduce the danger, not dispel it.</p><p>Before making a final judgment on how dangerous the bolted joints were, LeMessurier turned to a Canadian engineer named Alan Davenport, the director of the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory, at the University of Western Ontario, and a world authority on the behavior of buildings in high winds. During the Citicorp tower’s design, Davenport had run extensive tests on scale models of the structure. Now LeMessurier asked him and his deputy to retrieve the relevant files and magnetic tapes. “If we were going to think about such things as the possibility of failure,” LeMessurier says—the word “failure” being a euphemism for the Citicorp tower’s falling down—“we would think about it in terms of the best knowledge that the state of the art can produce, which is what these guys could provide for me.”</p><p>On July 26th, he flew to London, Ontario, and met with Davenport. Presenting his new calculations, LeMessurier asked the Canadians to evaluate them in the light of the original data. “And you have to tell me the truth,” he added. “Don’t go easy if it doesn’t come out the right way.”</p><p>It didn’t, and they didn’t. The tale told by the wind-tunnel experts was more alarming than LeMessurier had expected. His assumption of a forty-per-cent increase in stress from diagonal winds was theoretically correct, but it could go higher in the real world, when storms lashed at the building and set it vibrating like a tuning fork. “Oh, my God,” he thought, “now we’ve got that on top of an error from the bolts being underdesigned.” Refining their data further, the Canadians teased out wind-tunnel forces for each structural member in the building, with and without the tuned mass damper in operation; it remained for LeMessurier to interpret the numbers’ meaning.</p><p>First, he went to Cambridge, where he talked to a trusted associate, and then he called his wife at their summerhouse in Maine. “Dorothy knew what I was up to,” he says. “I told her, ‘I think we’ve got a problem here, and I’m going to sit down and try to think about it.’ ” On July 28th, he drove to the northern shore of Sebago Lake, took an outboard motorboat a quarter of a mile across the water to his house on a twelve-acre private island, and worked through the wind-tunnel numbers, joint by joint and floor by floor.</p><p>The weakest joint, he discovered, was at the building’s thirtieth floor; if that one gave way, catastrophic failure of the whole structure would follow. Next, he took New York City weather records provided by Alan Davenport and calculated the probability of a storm severe enough to tear that joint apart. His figures told him that such an event had a statistical probability of occurring as often as once every sixteen years—what meteorologists call a sixteen-year storm.</p><p>“That was very low, awesomely low,” LeMessurier said, his voice hushed as if the horror of discovery were still fresh. “To put it another way, there was one chance in sixteen in any year, including that one.” When the steadying influence of the tuned mass damper was factored in, the probability dwindled to one in fifty-five—a fifty-five-year storm. But the machine required electric current, which might fail as soon as a major storm hit.</p><p>As an experienced engineer, LeMessurier liked to think he could solve most structural problems, and the Citicorp tower was no exception. The bolted joints were readily accessible, thanks to Hugh Stubbins’ insistence on putting the chevrons inside the building’s skin rather than displaying them outside. With money and materials, the joints could be reinforced by welding heavy steel plates over them, like giant Band-Aids. But time was short; this was the end of July, and the height of the hurricane season was approaching. To avert disaster, LeMessurier would have to blow the whistle quickly—on himself. That meant facing the pain of possible protracted litigation, probable bankruptcy, and professional disgrace. It also meant shock and dismay for Citicorp’s officers and shareholders when they learned that the bank’s proud new corporate symbol, built at a cost of a hundred and seventy-five million dollars, was threatened with collapse.</p><p>On the island, LeMessurier considered his options. Silence was one of them; only Davenport knew the full implications of what he had found, and he would not disclose them on his own. Suicide was another; if LeMessurier drove along the Maine Turnpike at a hundred miles an hour and steered into a bridge abutment, that would be that. But keeping silent required betting other people’s lives against the odds, while suicide struck him as a coward’s way out and—although he was passionate about nineteenth-century classical music—unconvincingly melodramatic. What seized him an instant later was entirely convincing, because it was so unexpected—an almost giddy sense of power. “I had information that nobody else in the world had,” LeMessurier recalls. “I had power in my hands to effect extraordinary events that only I could initiate. I mean, sixteen years to failure—that was very simple, very clear-cut. I almost said, ‘Thank you, dear Lord, for making this problem so sharply defined that there’s no choice to make.’ ”</p><p>At his office in Cambridge on the morning of Monday, July 31st, LeMessurier tried to reach Hugh Stubbins, whose firm was upstairs in the same building, but Stubbins was in California and unavailable by phone. Then he called Stubbins’ lawyer, Carl Sapers, and outlined the emergency over lunch. Sapers advised him against telling Citicorp until he had consulted with his own company’s liability insurers, the Northbrook Insurance Company, in Northbrook, Illinois. When LeMessurier called Northbrook, which represented the Office of James Ruderman as well, someone there referred him to the company’s attorneys in New York and warned him not to discuss the matter with anyone else.</p><p>At 9 <em>a</em>.<em>m</em>. on Tuesday, in New York, LeMessurier faced a battery of lawyers who, he says, “wanted to meet me to find out if I was nutty.” Being lawyers, not engineers, they were hard put to reconcile his dispassionate tone with the apocalyptic thrust of his prophecy. They also bridled at his carefully qualified answers to seemingly simple questions. When they asked how big a storm it would take to blow the building down, LeMessurier confined himself to statistical probabilities—a storm that might occur once in sixteen years.</p><p>When they pressed him for specific wind velocities—would the wind have to be at eighty miles per hour, or ninety, or ninety-five?—he insisted that such figures were not significant in themselves, since every structure was uniquely sensitive to certain winds; an eighty-five-mile-per-hour wind that blew for sixteen minutes from the northwest might pose less of a threat to a particular building than an eighty-mile-per-hour wind that blew for fourteen minutes from the southwest.</p><p>But the lawyers certainly understood that they had a crisis on their hands, so they sent for an expert adviser they trusted: Leslie Robertson, an engineer who had been a structural consultant for the World Trade Center. “I got a phone call out of the blue from some lawyer summoning me to a meeting,” Robertson says. “ ‘What’s it about?’ ‘You’ll find out when you get there.’ ‘Sorry, I have other things to do—I don’t attend meetings on that basis.’ A few minutes later, I got another call, from another lawyer, who said there’d been a problem with Citicorp Center. I went to the meeting that morning, and I didn’t know anybody there but Bill. He stood up and explained what he perceived were the difficulties with the building, and everyone, of course, was very concerned. Then they turned to me and said, ‘Well?’ I said, ‘Look, if this is in fact the case, you have a very serious problem.’ ”</p><p>The two structural engineers were peers, but not friends. LeMessurier was a visionary with a fondness for heroic designs, though he was also an energetic manager. Robertson was a stickler for technical detail, a man fascinated by how things fit together. LeMessurier, older by two years, was voluble and intense, with a courtly rhetorical style. Robertson was tall, trim, brisk, and edgily funny, but made no effort to hide his impatience with things that didn’t interest him.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In addition to his engineering expertise, Robertson brought to the table a background in disaster management. He had worked with such groups as the National Science Foundation and the National Research Council on teams that studied the aftermaths of earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. (In 1993, he worked with the F.B.I. on the World Trade Center bombing.) For the liability lawyers, this special perspective enhanced his stature as a consultant, but it unsettled LeMessurier from the start. As he remembers it, “Robertson predicted to everybody present that within hours of the time Citicorp heard about this the whole building would be evacuated. I almost fainted. I didn’t want that to happen.” (For his part, Robertson recalls making no such dire prediction.)</p><p>LeMessurier didn’t think an evacuation would be necessary. He believed that the building was safe for occupancy in all but the most violent weather, thanks to the tuned mass damper, and he insisted that the damper’s reliability in a storm could be assured by installing emergency generators. Robertson conceded the importance of keeping the damper running—it had performed flawlessly since it became operational earlier that year—but, because, in his view, its value as a safety device was unproved, he flatly refused to consider it as a mitigating factor. (In a conversation shortly after the World Trade Center bombing, Robertson noted dryly that the twin towers’ emergency generators “lasted for fifteen minutes.”)</p><p>One point on which everyone agreed was that LeMessurier, together with Stubbins, needed to inform Citicorp as soon as possible. Only Stubbins had ever dealt directly with Citicorp’s chairman, Walter B. Wriston, and he was flying home that same day from California and still didn’t know his building was flawed. That evening, LeMessurier took the shuttle to Boston, went to Stubbins’ house in Cambridge, and broke the news. “He winced, I must admit—here was his masterpiece,” LeMessurier says. “But he’s a man of enormous resilience, a very grown man, and fortunately we had a lifelong relationship of trust.”</p><p>The next morning, August 2nd, Stubbins and LeMessurier flew to New York, went to LeMessurier’s office at 515 Madison Avenue, put in a call to Wriston, but failed to penetrate the layers of secretaries and assistants that insulated Citicorp’s chairman from the outside world. They were no more successful in reaching the bank’s president, William I. Spencer, but Stubbins finally managed to get an appointment with Citicorp’s executive vice-president, John S. Reed, the man who has now succeeded Wriston as chairman. LeMessurier and Stubbins went to see Reed at the bank’s ornate executive offices, in an older building on Lexington Avenue, across the street from Citicorp Center. LeMessurier began by saying, “I have a real problem for you, sir.”</p><p>Reed was well equipped to understand the problem. He had an engineering background, and he had been involved in the design and construction of Citicorp Center; the company had called him in when it was considering the tuned mass damper. Reed listened impassively as LeMessurier detailed the structural defect and how he thought it could be fixed. LeMessurier says, “I’d already conceived that you could build a little plywood house around each of the connections that were critical, and a welder could work inside it without damaging the tenants’ space. You might have to take up the carpet, take down the Sheetrock, and work at night, but all this could be done. But the real message I conveyed to him was ‘I need your help—at once.’ ”</p><p>When Reed asked how much the repairs would cost, LeMessurier offered an estimate of a million dollars. At the end of the meeting, which lasted half an hour, Reed thanked the two men courteously, though noncommittally, and told them to go back to their office and await further instructions. They did so, but after waiting for more than an hour they decided to go out to lunch. As they were finishing their meal, a secretary from LeMessurier’s office called to say that John Reed would be in the office in ten minutes with Walter Wriston.</p><p>In the late nineteen-seventies, when Citicorp began its expansion into global banking, Wriston was one of the most influential bankers in the country. A tall man of piercing intelligence, he was not known for effusiveness in the best of circumstances, and LeMessurier expected none now, what with Citicorp Center—and his own career—literally hanging in the balance. But the bank’s chairman was genuinely proud of the building, and he offered his full support in getting it fixed.</p><p>“Wriston was fantastic,” LeMessurier says. “He said, ‘I guess my job is to handle the public relations of this, so I’ll have to start drafting a press release.’ ” But he didn’t have anything to write on, so someone handed him a yellow pad. That made him laugh. According to LeMessurier, “ ‘All wars,’ Wriston said, ‘are won by generals writing on yellow pads.’ ” In fact, Wriston simply took notes; the press release would not go out for six days. But his laughter put the others at ease. Citicorp’s general was on their side.</p><p>Within hours of Wriston’s visit, LeMessurier’s office arranged for emergency generators for the tower’s tuned mass damper. The bank issued beepers to LeMessurier and his key engineers, assuring them that Reed and other top managers could be reached by phone at any hour of the day or night. Citicorp also assigned two vice-presidents, Henry DeFord III and Robert Dexter, to manage the repairs; both had overseen the building’s construction and knew it well.</p><p>The next morning, Thursday, August 3rd, LeMessurier, Robertson, and four of LeMessurier’s associates met with DeFord and Dexter in a conference room on the thirtieth floor of Citicorp Center. (The decision to hold the initial meeting near the structure’s weakest point was purely coincidental.) LeMessurier outlined his plan to fix the wind braces by welding two-inch-thick steel plates over each of more than two hundred bolted joints. The plan was tentatively approved, pending actual examination of a typical joint, but putting it into effect depended on the availability of a contractor and on an adequate supply of steel plate. Since Bethlehem Steel had dropped out of the business of fabricating and erecting skyscraper structures, Robertson suggested Karl Koch Erecting, a New Jersey-based firm that had put up the World Trade Center.</p><p>“I called them,” Robertson says, “and got, ‘Well, we’re a little busy right now,’ and I said, ‘Hey, you don’t understand what we’re talking about here.’ ” A few hours later, two Koch engineers joined the meeting. LeMessurier and Robertson took them to an unoccupied floor of the building, and there workmen tore apart enough Sheetrock to expose a diagonal connection. Comparing the original drawings of the joints with the nuts-and-bolts reality before their eyes, the engineers concluded that LeMessurier’s plan was indeed feasible. Koch also happened to have all the necessary steel plate on hand, so Citicorp negotiated a contract for welding to begin as soon as LeMessurier’s office could issue new drawings.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Two more contracts were drawn up before the end of the following day. One of them went out to MTS Systems Corporation, the Minneapolis firm that had manufactured the tuned mass damper. MTS was asked to provide full-time technical support—in effect, around-the-clock nurses—to keep its machine in perfect health. The company flew one of its technicians to New York that night. Four days later, in a letter of agreement, MTS asked Citicorp to provide a long list of materials and spare parts, which included three buckets, a grease gun, rags, cleaning solvent, and “1 Radio with weather band.”</p><p>The other contract engaged a California firm, also recommended by Robertson, to fit the building with a number of instruments called strain gauges—pieces of tape with zigzag wires running through them. The gauges would be affixed to individual structural members, and electrical impulses from them would be funnelled to an improvised communications center in Robertson’s office, eight blocks away, at 230 Park Avenue; like a patient in intensive care, the tower would have every shiver and twitch monitored. But this required new telephone lines, and the phone company refused to budge on its leisurely installation schedule. When Robertson voiced his frustration about this during a late-night meeting in Walter Wriston’s office, Wriston picked up the phone on his desk and called his friend Charles Brown, the president and chief operating officer of A.T. &amp; T. The new lines went in the next morning.</p><p>A different problem-solving approach was taken by Robertson during another nighttime meeting in Citicorp’s executive suite. Wriston wanted copies of some documents that Robertson had shown him, but all the secretaries had gone home—the only people on the floor were Wriston, Robertson, and John Reed—and every copying machine was locked. “I’m an engineer,” Robertson says, “so I kneeled down, ripped the door off one of the machines, and we made our copies. I looked up at them a little apologetically, but, what the hell—fixing the door was a few hundred bucks, and these guys had a hundred-and-seventy-five-million-dollar building in trouble across the street.”</p><p>Robertson also assembled an advisory group of weather experts from academia and the government’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, on Long Island, and hired two independent weather forecasters to provide wind predictions four times a day. “What worried us more than hurricanes, which give you hours and days to anticipate, were unpredictable events,” Robertson says. “From time to time, we’ve had small tornadoes in this area, and there was a worry that a much bigger one would come down and take hold.” Then Robertson raised an issue that LeMessurier had dreaded discussing. In a meeting on Friday that included LeMessurier, Robertson told Citicorp’s representatives, DeFord and Dexter, that they needed to plan for evacuating Citicorp Center and a large area around it in the event of a high-wind alert.</p><p>During the first week of August, discussions had involved only a small circle of company officials and engineers. But the circle widened on Monday, August 7th, when final drawings for the steel plates went out to Arthur Nusbaum, the veteran project manager of HRH Construction, which was the original contractor for Citicorp Center, and Nusbaum, in turn, provided them to Koch Erecting. And it would widen again, because work could not go forward, as Robertson reminded the officials, without consulting the city’s Department of Buildings. Citicorp faced a public-relations debacle unless it came up with a plausible explanation of why its brand-new skyscraper needed fixing.</p><p>That night, DeFord and Dexter, following Robertson’s advice, met with Mike Reilly, the American Red Cross’s director of disaster services for the New York metropolitan area. “They laid out the dilemma, and it was clearly an ominous event,” Reilly recalls. From that first meeting, which was attended by Robertson but not by LeMessurier, and from half a dozen subsequent working sessions with other disaster agencies, came plans for joint action by the police and the mayor’s Office of Emergency Management, along with the Red Cross. In the event of a wind alert, the police and the mayor’s emergency forces would evacuate the building and the surrounding neighborhood, and the Red Cross would mobilize between twelve hundred and two thousand workers to provide food and temporary shelter. “Hal DeFord was the bank’s point man for all this,” Reilly says. “The anxiety was so heavy on him that we wondered if he was going to make it.”</p><p>On Tuesday morning, August 8th, the public-affairs department of Citibank, Citicorp’s chief subsidiary, put out the long-delayed press release. In language as bland as a loan officer’s wardrobe, the three-paragraph document said unnamed “engineers who designed the building” had recommended that “certain of the connections in Citicorp Center’s wind bracing system be strengthened through additional welding.” The engineers, the press release added, “have assured us that there is no danger.” When DeFord expanded on the handout in interviews, he portrayed the bank as a corporate citizen of exemplary caution—“We wear both belts and suspenders here,” he told a reporter for the <em>News</em>—that had decided on the welds as soon as it learned of new data based on dynamic-wind tests conducted at the University of Western Ontario.</p><p>There was some truth in all this. During LeMessurier’s recent trip to Canada, one of Alan Davenport’s assistants had mentioned to him that probable wind velocities might be slightly higher, on a statistical basis, than predicted in 1973, during the original tests for Citicorp Center. At the time, LeMessurier viewed this piece of information as one more nail in the coffin of his career, but later, recognizing it as a blessing in disguise, he passed it on to Citicorp as the possible basis of a cover story for the press and for tenants in the building.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, at a meeting in Robertson’s office, LeMessurier told the whole truth to New York City’s Acting Building Commissioner and nine other senior city officials. For more than an hour, he spoke about the effect of diagonal winds on the Citicorp tower, about the failure of his own office to perceive and communicate the danger, and about the intended repairs.</p><p>In the discussion that followed, the city officials asked a few technical questions, and Arthur Nusbaum expressed concern over a shortage of certified welders who had passed the city’s structural-welding test. That would not be a problem, the representatives from the Department of Buildings replied; one of the area’s most trusted steel inspectors, Neil Moreton, would have the power to test and immediately certify any welder that Citicorp’s repair project required. Nusbaum recalls, “Once they said that, I knew we were O.K., because there were steamfitter welders all over the place who could do a fantastic job.”</p><p>Before the city officials left, they commended LeMessurier for his courage and candor, and expressed a desire to be kept informed as the repair work progressed. Given the urgency of the situation, that was all they could reasonably do. “It wasn’t a case of ‘We caught you, you skunk,’ ” Nusbaum says. “It started with a guy who stood up and said, ‘I got a problem, I made the problem, let’s fix the problem.’ If you’re gonna kill a guy like LeMessurier, why should anybody ever talk?”</p><p>Meanwhile, Robertson’s switchboard was besieged by calls. “Every reporter in town wanted to know how come all these people were in our office,” Robertson says. Once the meeting ended, the Building Commissioner returned the reporters’ calls and, hewing to Citicorp’s line, reassured them that the structural work was only a prudent response to new meteorological data.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>As a result, press coverage in New York City the next day was as uninformative as the handout: a short piece in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, which raised no questions about the nature of the new data, and one in the <em>News</em>, which dutifully quoted DeFord’s remark about belts and suspenders. But when LeMessurier went back to his hotel room, at about 5 <em>p</em>.<em>m.</em> on Wednesday, he learned from his wife, who had come down from Cambridge to join him, that a reporter from the <em>Times</em> had been trying to reach him all afternoon. That worried him greatly; being candid with city officials was one thing, but being interrogated by the <em>Times</em> was another. Before returning the call, LeMessurier phoned his friend Carl Sapers, the Boston attorney who represented Hugh Stubbins, and mixed himself a Martini. Sapers understood the need for secrecy, but he saw no real choice; talk to them, he said, and do the best you can. Two minutes after six o’clock, LeMessurier called the <em>Times</em> switchboard. As he braced himself for an unpleasant conversation, he heard a recording. The <em>Times</em>, along with all the other major papers in the city, had just been shut down by a strike.</p><p>Welders started work almost immediately, their torches a dazzlement in the night sky. The weather was sticky, as it had been since the beginning of the month—New Jersey’s tomato crop was rotting from too much rain—and forecasts called for temperatures in the mid-eighties the next day, with no wind; in other words, a perfect day for Citicorp Center.</p><p>Yet tropical storms were already churning the Caribbean. Citicorp pushed for repair work around the clock, but Nusbaum refused to allow welding during office hours, for fear that clouds of acrid smoke would cause panic among the tenants and set off every smoke detector in the building. Instead, he brought in drywall crews and carpenters to work from 5 <em>p</em>.<em>m</em>. to 8 <em>p</em>.<em>m</em>., putting up plywood enclosures around the chevrons and tearing down Sheetrock; welders to weld from 8 <em>p</em>.<em>m</em>. until 4 <em>a</em>.<em>m</em>., with the building’s fire-alarm system shut off; and then laborers to clean up the epic mess before the first secretaries arrived.</p><p>The welders worked seven days a week. Sometimes they worked on unoccupied floors; sometimes they invaded lavish offices. But décor, or the lack of it, had no bearing on their priorities, which were set by LeMessurier. “It was a tense time for the whole month,” he says. “I was constantly calculating which joint to fix next, which level of the building was more critical, and I developed charts and graphs of all the consequences: if you fix this, then the rarity of the storm that will cause any trouble lengthens to that.”</p><p>At Robertson’s office, a steady stream of data poured in from the weather forecasters and from the building itself. Occasionally, the strain-gauge readings jumped, like spikes on an electrocardiogram, when the technicians from MTS Systems exercised their tuned mass damper to make sure it was working properly. One time, the readings went off the chart, then stopped. This provoked more bafflement than fear, since it seemed unlikely that a hurricane raging on Lexington and Fifty-third Street would go otherwise unnoticed at Forty-sixth and Park. The cause proved to be straightforward enough: When the instrumentation experts from California installed their strain gauges, they had neglected to hire union electricians. “Someone heard about it,” LeMessurier says, “went up there in the middle of the night, and snipped all the wires.”</p><p>For most of August, the weather smiled on Citicorp, or at least held its breath, and the welders made steady progress. LeMessurier felt confident enough to fly off with his wife for a weekend in Maine. As their return flight was coming in for a landing at LaGuardia Airport Sunday night, they looked out across the East River and saw a pillar of fire on the Manhattan skyline. “The welders were working up and down the building, fixing the joints,” LeMessurier recalls. “It was an absolutely marvellous thing to see. I said to Dorothy, ‘Isn’t this wonderful? Nobody knows what’s going on, but we know and we can see it right there in the sky.’ ”</p><p>A great deal of work remained. Robertson was insisting on a complete reëvaluation of the Citicorp tower: not just the sensitivity of the chevrons to quartering winds but the strength of other skeletal members, the adequacy of braces that kept the supporting columns in plumb, and the rigidity of the building’s corrugated metal-and-concrete floors, which Robertson feared might be compromised by trenches carrying electrical connections.</p><p>His insistence was proper—settling for less would have compromised Robertson’s own position. It amounted to a post-construction autopsy by teams of forensic engineers. For LeMessurier, the reëvaluation was harrowing in the extreme; every new doubt about his design for Citicorp Center reflected on him.</p><p>In one instance, Robertson’s fears were unwarranted: tests showed that the tower floors were entirely sound—the trenches were not a source of weakness. In another, Robertson, assuming the worst about construction tolerances, decided that the columns might be slightly, even though undetectably, out of plumb, and therefore he ordered the installation of supplemental bracing above the fourteenth floor.</p><p>Shortly before dawn on Friday, September 1st, weather services carried the news that everyone had been dreading—a major storm, Hurricane Ella, was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. At 6:30 <em>a</em>.<em>m</em>., an emergency-planning group convened at the command center in Robertson’s office. “Nobody said, ‘We’re probably going to press the panic button,’ ” LeMessurier recalls. “Nobody dared say that. But everybody was sweating blood.”</p><p>As the storm bore down on the city, the bank’s representatives, DeFord and Dexter, asked LeMessurier for a report on the status of repairs. He told them that the most critical joints had already been fixed and that the building, with its tuned mass damper operating, could now withstand a two-hundred-year storm. It didn’t have to, however. A few hours later, Hurricane Ella veered from its northwesterly course and began moving out to sea.</p><p>LeMessurier spent the following night in Manhattan, having cancelled plans to spend the Labor Day weekend with his family in Maine. But the hurricane kept moving eastward, and daybreak dispelled any lingering thoughts of evacuation. “Saturday was the most beautiful day that the world’s ever seen,” LeMessurier says, “with all the humidity drawn away and the skies sunny and crystal clear.” Alone in the city, he gave himself a treat he’d been thinking about for years—his first visit to the Cloisters, where he basked in an ineffable calm.</p><p>The weather watch ended on September 13th. That same day, Robertson recommended terminating the evacuation plans, too. Welding was completed in October, several weeks before most of the city’s newspapers resumed publication. No further stories on the subject appeared in the wake of the strike. The building, in fact, was now strong enough to withstand a seven-hundred-year storm even without the damper, which made it one of the safest structures ever built—and rebuilt—by the hand of man.</p><p>Throughout the summer, Citicorp’s top management team had concentrated on facilitating repairs, while keeping the lawyers on the sidelines. That changed on September 13th, when Citicorp served notice on LeMessurier and Hugh Stubbins, whose firm held the primary contract, of its intention to seek indemnification for all costs. Their estimate of the costs, according to LeMessurier, amounted to $4.3 million, including management fees. A much higher total was suggested by Arthur Nusbaum, who recalled that his firm, HRH Construction, spent eight million dollars on structural repairs alone. Citicorp has declined to provide its own figure.</p><p>Whatever the actual cost, Citicorp’s effort to recoup it was remarkably free of the punitive impulse that often poisons such negotiations. When the terms of a settlement were first discussed—without lawyers—by LeMessurier, on one side, and DeFord and Dexter, on the other, LeMessurier spoke of two million dollars, which was the amount that his liability insurer, the Northbrook Insurance Company, had agreed to pay. “DeFord and Dexter said, ‘Well, we’ve been deeply wounded here,’ and they tried to play hardball,” LeMessurier says. “But they didn’t do it with much conviction.” After a second meeting, which included a Northbrook lawyer, the bank agreed to hold Stubbins’ firm harmless and to accept the two-million-dollar payment from LeMessurier and his joint-venture partners; no litigation ever ensued. Eight years ago, Citicorp turned the building into a condominium, retaining the land and the shops but selling all the office space, to Japanese buyers, at a handsome profit.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The crisis at Citicorp Center was noteworthy in another respect. It produced heroes, but no villains; everyone connected with the repairs behaved in exemplary fashion, from Walter Wriston and his Citicorp management team to the officials at the city’s Department of Buildings. The most striking example, of course, was set by LeMessurier, who emerged with his reputation not merely unscathed but enhanced. When Robertson speaks of him, he says, “I have a lot of admiration for Bill, because he was very forthcoming. While we say that all engineers would behave as he did, I carry in my mind some skepticism about that.”</p><p>In the last few years, LeMessurier has been talking about the summer of 1978 to his classes at Harvard. The tale, as he tells it, is by turns painful, self-deprecating, and self-dramatizing—an engineer who did the right thing. But it also speaks to the larger question of how professional people should behave. “You have a social obligation,” LeMessurier reminds his students. “In return for getting a license and being regarded with respect, you’re supposed to be self-sacrificing and look beyond the interests of yourself and your client to society as a whole. And the most wonderful part of my story is that when I did it nothing bad happened.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
