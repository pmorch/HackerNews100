I’ve been asked to interview her plenty of times, and finally decided to do so.</p><p>Some notes</p><p>The banking programming world is a completely different world than what most of us are used to, and for the next couple of hours after posting this I’ll accept whatever questions you may have for her, but keep in mind that some questions may not be answered due to security concerns. I’ll be posting this to HN &amp; Reddit and will answer questions over there as well.</p><p>I won’t write this as a Q&amp;A, but more like I’m telling you her story.</p><p>UPDATE: I’ve added Q&amp;A of some FAQ to the bottom of the post!</p><p>1991</p><p>The year she started internal training at Nordea, which back then was known as Nordbanken (The North Bank) but changed name to Nordea in 2001. During the training she had to take various tests, most notably an IQ-test to see if she had the intelligence to work within this field. Other tests includes a psychological checkup to make sure she had the psyche to handle that line of work and a multitasking test which she failed horribly where she got the score 22/100. She did very good on the other tests and among the 16 available positions, she managed to get one.</p><p>The position in question was an IBM Mainframe COBOL programmer, which to this day, 25 years later still work as for the same bank.</p><p>This position is the most important one in the bank, at least from a technical standpoint. If, let’s say, my mother and everyone on her team would quit their job, the bank would go under within a matter of weeks if they’re lucky. They have a rotation of people on her team being available 24/7. I remember when I was younger and she had to take a taxi to work in the middle of the night on a Sunday to fix a dead-lock problem.</p><p><strong>COBOL…</strong></p><p>…is not a fancy programming language like your functional Haskell or concurrent Golang— it’s an imperative, procedural language and since 2002, object-oriented. There’s nothing wrong with the language itself, the problem is that barely anyone knows it — at least not in the context of mainframe programming. My mother is the next youngest person on her team, and she’s born 1964, and the youngest person being 2 years younger. Since almost all of the largest banks in the world runs on IBM Mainframe with COBOL as the primary programming language, this is a global issue. The smaller banks however are better off which usually runs something like Java without mainframes.</p><p>My mother used to ask me if I wanted to learn, but since working with the more fancier stuff like Postgres, Redis, Node, Crystal, PHP, among others, I’ve always answered “Never, ever!”. I am still very interested in what she do, but these types of systems gives off the probably worst enterprisy-feeling that you can imagine, which I’d like to avoid.</p><p>I can only imagine the fat paycheck a 20-year old mainframe programmer would get though, because your age in this case would be invaluable.</p><p><strong>Databases</strong></p><p>Their primary database is called IMS, which is an hierarchical database built by IBM for the Apollo program. Internally they call it DL/1 which is short for Database Language One. They are trying to migrate to DB2 which is a relational database that speaks normal SQL, but considering the sheer volume of data that Nordea is storing, this is a task that is going to take years. It’s not as simple as just moving the data from IMS into DB2, they also have to update their modules to load &amp; save data from DB2 instead of IMS and they have thousands of modules, many of which were developed by programmers that have either passed away or have retired.</p><p>Each transaction is stored in DB2. They’re avoiding writing to IMS as much as possible, only reading data from it until their newly purchased system is fully integrated and they can start storing data there.</p><p>IMS is extremely old and very slow (for some tasks).</p><p>Searching for data can take hours. Hah, and here we are, arguing that MySQL delivers 2ms better query speed than Postgres. That’s a bit ironic.</p><p>They also use a flat-file structure for a lot of tasks, which themselves has different flavors that IMS supports. One such example is GSAM which has forced my mother to take a taxi into work many times due to modules working on the same GSAM-file at the same time, producing deadlocks.</p><p>Let’s talk about the size of their databases for a moment. DB2 is only storing data about transactions, and each transaction is different in size depending on what type of account the transaction goes to/from. Private accounts like my personal bank account is orders of magnitude more simple than bank accounts used by business. Each transaction is somewhere between 2KB to 500 bytes, so let’s say the average is 1KB.</p><p>At the moment, their DB2 database holds 11 billion transactions, and the law requires them to save each transaction for 10 years, having settled for 11 years. At the moment, transactions are only 7 years old and the amount of transactions is estimated to grow roughly 5–8% each year, until they hit the 11 year mark where they can nuke transactions that are older than 11 years.</p><p>So at the moment, the DB2 database holds about 10TB of data, and that data is only transactions. In 4 years, it’ll be somewhere around 13–14TB of data.</p><p>IMS holds most other information. That kind of data differs a lot in size, so it’s hard to estimate how large it is, but I guess it’s much larger than their DB2 database.</p><p>They also store some data on tapes, where their programs tell a machine to load/save data from a specific tape, which is pretty cool!</p><p>IDE</p><p>Everyone has some form of IDE or text editor, right? Well, yes they do. The IDE is called ISPF which is like an entire OS. ISPF can be extended, and the part we would call an IDE is an extension to ISPF which is called Endevor.</p><p>ISPF is directly connected to the mainframe, and there’s no such thing as a local development environment here.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif" width="636" height="343" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:343,&quot;width&quot;:636,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50306661-9869-4d8a-8105-f199c256eb56_636x343.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Roughly 80% of their systems are batch jobs. These are jobs that runs at a certain time or interval, doing some processing on their data or sends data to other banks/agencies/etc. For example when I buy a can of Coke, the money is withdrawn from my account balance, however the money is not actually transferred anywhere until one of their batch jobs does so. These jobs are usually executed during the night, which is usually why it takes a day before transactions between banks are completed. Transactions to the same bank are usually instant because it executes immediately.</p><p>Batch jobs are working with datasets on a gigabyte-, sometimes terrabyte-level and can in some cases take hours to complete. I’d love to see how IBMs mainframes all of a sudden starts working at full capacity the second the clock turns 00:00 in their datacenters, would be pretty cool!</p><p><strong>The problems banks are facing</strong></p><p>Banks that run on mainframes have quite a lot of issues that they need to take care of, but unfortunately time is scarce.</p><p>Programmers are getting older, not many wants to learn and the time before a new employee can stand on their own feet is 2–3 years, and even then there are a lot of gray areas for them.</p><p>There are programs that are decades old that nobody even knows what they do and the person who wrote it is long gone.</p><p>Many banks are trying to purchase shiny new systems to replace what they currently have, while almost all of their programmers are saying “this is not going to work, you cannot replace this monster that we have here”.</p><p>The reason their systems has become so huge is partially because they made the mistake early on to tailor their own system towards other systems. A great example here is how we build RESTful services, where programs that wants to get data from us have to tailor their system to match ours. This is not the case with some banks, instead they’re sending data to other systems (such as the tax agency) which may at any point update their systems which in turn breaks the current system the bank are using to send the data.</p><p>Banking systems are also extremely advanced. A personal bank account differs a lot from a business bank account, and there are at least 50 different types of bank accounts for each of them. And in Nordeas case, they also have the Swedish government accounts, which are different from both personal and business accounts. I think they have the Finnish government accounts and maybe a portion of Denmarks as well, which differs too.</p><p><span>It’s going to be very interesting to hear what Nordea and other banks will do these upcoming years, and what new tech they’ll be implemented on.</span><br><span>I may have forgot to ask something, so if you have any questions go ahead and ask, I’ll be forwarding them to her and write down her response for the next couple of hours.</span></p><p><strong><span>Why did you choose to work with IBM Mainframe COBOL programming?</span><br></strong><span>- I’ve always wanted to “work with computers”, but I wasn’t aiming for this specific job. I saw an ad in the papers and applied and got the job. I had a bit of computer background before I applied though.</span></p><p><strong>What is the worst thing that you’ve seen on a day?</strong><br><span>- My co-worker forgot to add a dot to the end of a statement for a module in the most critical part of our system which we call “The Cash Register”. It is the part that handles all the money. The result was that the entire bank was down for 16 hours straight due to the module continiuing executing statements when it actually should’ve stopped after that statement. It basically overloaded our systems, a self-DOS of sorts.</span></p><p><strong>What do you think will happen in the future for banks that run on the same infrastructure as Nordea?</strong><br><span>- Most banks has acknowledged that we need to replace the older mainframes with something more modern. Nordea has bought a new system which it has promised to replace the current one within 4 years, but Nordea takes care of multiple countries and a more reasonable number is 4 years per country, so 16 years in total.</span><br><span>Banks and finance that haven’t acknowledged this is going to have a very rough time ahead of them. I still think we’ll live on IBM infrastructure though.</span></p><p><strong>What were the challenges you’ve faced as a female programmer that started in the 90's?</strong><br><span>- No problem at all. I’ve got a couple of female co-workers, but most are men. It doesn’t bother me that much.</span></p><p><strong>You’ve been working for the same entity and possibly the same code base for more than 20 years. Does it ever gets old?</strong><br><span>- Yeah it definitely gets tiring after a while, like most other lines of work becomes. But during my time here I’ve build many completely new systems for various things in finance, and that has always been fun. Unfortunately from now on we will never build anything new, only maintain what we currently have and wait for the new system we’ve purchased to replace the current one.</span></p><p><strong>How scary is it to write code for a bank?</strong><br><span>- It is very scary, especially when we push changes to production which happens on Sundays. Whenever we push new changes to production, huge parts of the system has to be taken offline. One of those parts is the entire IMS. During that period anything can happen, but we have a very robust test environment so it usually goes through smoothly.</span></p><p><strong>Have you caused any huge mistakes for the bank?</strong><br><span>- Definitely have, quite a large mistake I did back in 1997, when my youngest son (that’s me, the writer) just started pre-school and my parental leave was over. We have a system for saving money for retirement. Those type of bank accounts wasn’t locked back then, and the law says you cannot withdraw money from that account before you’re 55 years old. Since the accounts wasn’t locked, it was possible to withdraw money if you had the bank account number, so the solution was simple; not give the customer their bank account number.</span><br><span>I managed to screw up by modifying a module that added their bank account number to the mail that was sent out to customers. So what happened was that customers started withdrawing money (which was not taxed yet!) from their retirement savings account before they were allowed to.</span><br><span>This triggered a huge inspection, the Swedish government stepped in, the financial inspection and the media were all over it. That was me.</span></p><p><strong>What’s your working environment like?</strong><br><span>- We’ve recently moved to a more “hip” location. We used to have personal desks, but now we have this “pick whatever spot is avaiable” open area. I dislike it a lot.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

		<div id="post-19923">
				<p><span>After years of battles over Bills C-11 and C-18, few Canadians will have the appetite for yet another troubling Internet bill. But given a bill that envisions government-backed censorship, mandates age verification to use search engines or social media sites, and creates a framework for court-ordered website blocking, there is a need to pay attention. <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/S-210/third-reading">Bill S-210</a>, or the </span><em><span>Protecting Young Persons from Exposure to Pornography Act</span></em><span>, was passed by the Senate in April after Senators were reluctant to reject a bill framed as protecting children from online harm. The same scenario appears to be playing out in the House of Commons, where yesterday a majority of the House <a href="https://x.com/HoCChamber/status/1735038570753102106?s=20">voted for the bill at second reading</a>, sending it to the Public Safety committee for review. The bill, which is the brainchild of <a href="https://x.com/mivillej/status/1735041108764188967?s=20">Senator Julie Miville-Duchêne</a>, is not a government bill. In fact, government ministers voted against it. Instead, the bill is backed by the Conservatives, Bloc and NDP with a smattering of votes from backbench Liberal MPs. Canadians can be forgiven for being confused that after&nbsp;months of championing Internet freedoms, raising fears of censorship, and expressing concern about CRTC overregulation of the Internet, Conservative MPs were quick to <a href="https://x.com/GarnettGenuis/status/1735043817965764793?s=20">call out</a> those who <a href="https://x.com/annarobertsmp/status/1735080924012818833?s=20">opposed the bill </a>(the House sponsor is Conservative MP Karen Vecchio).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appeared before the <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2022/02/age-verification-requirements-for-twitter-or-website-blocking-for-reddit-my-appearance-on-bill-s-210-at-the-senate-standing-committee-on-legal-and-constitutional-affairs/"><span>Senate committee that studied the bill in February 2022</span></a>, where I argued that “</span><span>by bringing together website blocking, face recognition technologies, and stunning overbreadth that would capture numerous mainstream services, the bill isn’t just a slippery slope, it is an avalanche.” As I did then, I should preface criticism of the bill by making it clear that underage access to inappropriate content is indeed a legitimate concern. I think the best way to deal with the issue includes education, digital skills, and parental oversight of Internet use including the use of personal filters or blocking tools if desired. Moreover, if there are Canadian-based sites that are violating the law in terms of the content they host, they should absolutely face investigation and potential charges. </span></p>
<p><span>However, Bill S-210 goes well beyond personal choices to limit underage access to sexually explicit material on Canadian sites. Instead, it envisions government-enforced global website liability for failure to block underage access, backed by website blocking and mandated age verification systems that are likely to include face recognition technologies. The government establishes this regulatory framework and is likely to task the CRTC with providing the necessary administration. While there are surely good intentions with the bill, the risks and potential harms it poses are significant.</span></p>
<p><span>The basic framework of Bill S-210 is that it creates an offence for any organization making available sexually explicit material to anyone under the age of 18 for commercial purposes. The penalty for doing so is $250,000 for the first offence and up to $500,000 for any subsequent offences. Organizations (broadly defined under the Criminal Code) can rely on three potential defences:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The organization instituted a “</span><span>prescribed age-verification method” to limit access. It would be up to the government to determine what methods qualify with due regard for reliability and privacy. There is a major global business of vendors that sell these technologies and who are vocal proponents of this kind of legislation.</span></li>
<li><span>The organization can make the case that there is “legitimate purpose related to science, medicine, education or the arts.” </span></li>
<li><span>The organization took steps required to limit access after having received a notification from the enforcement agency (likely the CRTC).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The enforcement of the bill is left to the designated regulatory agency, which can issue notifications of violations to websites and services. Those notices can include the steps the agency wants followed to bring the site into compliance. This literally means the government via its regulatory agency will dictate to sites how they must interact with users to ensure no underage access. If the site fails to act as instructed within 20 days, the regulator can apply for a court order mandating that Canadian ISPs block the site from their subscribers. The regulator would be required to identify which ISPs are subject to the blocking order. </span></p>
<p><span>The website blocking provisions are focused on limiting user access and can therefore be applied to websites anywhere in the world with Canadian ISPs required to ensure that the sites are rendered inaccessible. And what about the risk of overblocking? The bill not only envisions the possibility of blocking lawful content or limiting access to those over 18, it expressly permits it. Section 9(5) states that if the court determines that an order is needed, it may have the effect of preventing access to “material other than sexually explicit material made available by the organization” or limiting access to anyone, not just young people. This raises the prospect of full censorship of lawful content under court order based on notices from a government agency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that isn’t bad enough, there are two additional serious concerns. First, the bill is not limited to pornography sites. Rather, it applies to any site or service that makes sexually explicit materials available. This would presumably include search engines, social media sites such as Twitter, or chat forums such as Reddit, where access to explicit material is not hard to find. If the bill was limited solely to sites whose primary purpose is the commercial distribution of sexually explicit material, it might be more defensible. As it stands now, the overbroad approach leaves this bill vulnerable to constitutional challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>Second, consider the way sites are supposed to comply with the law, by establishing age verification systems. This effectively means that sites will require their users to register with commercial age verification systems in order to run a search or access some tweets. And the age verification systems raise real privacy concerns, including mandated face recognition as part of the verification process.</span></p>
<p>Senate private members bills rarely become law, but this bill is suddenly on the radar screen in a big way. The bill should not have come this far and should not be supported. Creating safeguards for underage access to inappropriate content is a laudable goal, but not at the cost of government-backed censorship, mandated face recognition, and age-approval requirements to use some of the most popular sites and services in the world.</p>

  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">By searching for “functions” written in computer code, FunSearch made the first discoveries in open problems in mathematical sciences using LLMs</p><p data-block-key="7k21c">Large Language Models (LLMs) are useful assistants - they excel at combining concepts and can read, write and code to help people solve problems. But could they discover entirely new knowledge?</p><p data-block-key="c3ioi">As LLMs have been shown to “hallucinate” factually incorrect information, using them to make verifiably correct discoveries is a challenge. But what if we could harness the creativity of LLMs by identifying and building upon only their very best ideas?</p><p data-block-key="c9jsm">Today, in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper published in Nature</a>, we introduce FunSearch, a method to search for new solutions in mathematics and computer science. FunSearch works by pairing a pre-trained LLM, whose goal is to provide creative solutions in the form of computer code, with an automated “evaluator”, which guards against hallucinations and incorrect ideas. By iterating back-and-forth between these two components, initial solutions “evolve” into new knowledge. The system searches for “functions” written in computer code; hence the name FunSearch.</p><p data-block-key="79msm">This work represents the first time a new discovery has been made for challenging open problems in science or mathematics using LLMs. FunSearch discovered new solutions for the cap set problem, a longstanding open problem in mathematics. In addition, to demonstrate the practical usefulness of FunSearch, we used it to discover more effective algorithms for the “bin-packing” problem, which has ubiquitous applications such as making data centers more efficient.</p><p data-block-key="6hrod">Scientific progress has always relied on the ability to share new understanding. What makes FunSearch a particularly powerful scientific tool is that it outputs programs that reveal <i>how</i> its solutions are constructed, rather than just what the solutions are. We hope this can inspire further insights in the scientists who use FunSearch, driving a virtuous cycle of improvement and discovery.</p><h2 data-block-key="cqrj5">Driving discovery through evolution with language models</h2><p data-block-key="3lfpb">FunSearch uses an evolutionary method powered by LLMs, which promotes and develops the highest scoring ideas. These ideas are expressed as computer programs, so that they can be run and evaluated automatically. First, the user writes a description of the problem in the form of code. This description comprises a procedure to evaluate programs, and a seed program used to initialize a pool of programs.</p><p data-block-key="33p7f">FunSearch is an iterative procedure; at each iteration, the system selects some programs from the current pool of programs, which are fed to an LLM. The LLM creatively builds upon these, and generates new programs, which are automatically evaluated. The best ones are added back to the pool of existing programs, creating a self-improving loop. FunSearch uses <a href="https://ai.google/discover/palm2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google’s PaLM 2</a>, but it is compatible with other LLMs trained on code.</p>

    <figcaption>
      <p data-block-key="8b2b2">The FunSearch process. The LLM is shown a selection of the best programs it has generated so far (retrieved from the programs database), and asked to generate an even better one. The programs proposed by the LLM are automatically executed, and evaluated. The best programs are added to the database, for selection in subsequent cycles. The user can at any point retrieve the highest-scoring programs discovered so far.</p>

              <div>
  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">Discovering new mathematical knowledge and algorithms in different domains is a notoriously difficult task, and largely beyond the power of the most advanced AI systems. To tackle such challenging problems with FunSearch, we introduced multiple key components. Instead of starting from scratch, we start the evolutionary process with common knowledge about the problem, and let FunSearch focus on finding the most critical ideas to achieve new discoveries. In addition, our evolutionary process uses a strategy to improve the diversity of ideas in order to avoid stagnation. Finally, we run the evolutionary process in parallel to improve the system efficiency.</p><h2 data-block-key="293lm">Breaking new ground in mathematics</h2><p data-block-key="c10fe">We first address the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_set" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cap set problem</a>, an open challenge, which has vexed mathematicians in multiple research areas for decades. Renowned mathematician Terence Tao once described it as his <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/02/23/open-question-best-bounds-for-cap-sets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">favorite open question</a>. We collaborated with Jordan Ellenberg, a professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and author of an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09223" rel="noopener" target="_blank">important breakthrough on the cap set problem</a>.</p><p data-block-key="6gov3">The problem consists of finding the largest set of points (called a <i>cap set</i>) in a high-dimensional grid, where no three points lie on a line. This problem is important because it serves as a model for other problems in extremal combinatorics - the study of how large or small a collection of numbers, graphs or other objects could be. Brute-force computing approaches to this problem don’t work – the number of possibilities to consider quickly becomes greater than the number of atoms in the universe.</p><p data-block-key="2vb6l">FunSearch generated solutions - in the form of programs - that in some settings discovered the largest cap sets ever found. This represents the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1027365901231" rel="noopener" target="_blank">largest increase</a> in the size of cap sets in the past 20 years. Moreover, FunSearch outperformed state-of-the-art computational solvers, as this problem scales well beyond their current capabilities.</p>

      <p data-block-key="ewhw0">Interactive figure showing the evolution from the seed program (top) to a new higher-scoring function (bottom). Each circle is a program, with its size proportional to the score assigned to it. Only ancestors of the program at the bottom are shown. The corresponding function produced by FunSearch for each node is shown on the right (see full program using this function in the paper).</p>

              <div>
  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">These results demonstrate that the FunSearch technique can take us beyond established results on hard combinatorial problems, where intuition can be difficult to build. We expect this approach to play a role in new discoveries for similar theoretical problems in combinatorics, and in the future it may open up new possibilities in fields such as communication theory.</p><h2 data-block-key="cc0t2">FunSearch favors concise and human-interpretable programs</h2><p data-block-key="ektms">While discovering new mathematical knowledge is significant in itself, the FunSearch approach offers an additional benefit over traditional computer search techniques. That’s because FunSearch isn’t a black box that merely generates solutions to problems. Instead, it generates programs that describe <i>how</i> those solutions were arrived at. This show-your-working approach is how scientists generally operate, with new discoveries or phenomena explained through the process used to produce them.</p><p data-block-key="6f8qq">FunSearch favors finding solutions represented by highly compact programs - solutions with a low Kolmogorov complexity†. Short programs can describe very large objects, allowing FunSearch to scale to large needle-in-a-haystack problems. Moreover, this makes FunSearch’s program outputs easier for researchers to comprehend. Ellenberg said: “FunSearch offers a completely new mechanism for developing strategies of attack. The solutions generated by FunSearch are far conceptually richer than a mere list of numbers. When I study them, I learn something”.</p><p data-block-key="jp5n">What’s more, this interpretability of FunSearch’s programs can provide actionable insights to researchers. As we used FunSearch we noticed, for example, intriguing symmetries in the code of some of its high-scoring outputs. This gave us a new insight into the problem, and we used this insight to refine the problem introduced to FunSearch, resulting in even better solutions. We see this as an exemplar for a collaborative procedure between humans and FunSearch across many problems in mathematics.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="4lvaj">Addressing a notoriously hard challenge in computing</h2><p data-block-key="a8qqv">Encouraged by our success with the theoretical cap set problem, we decided to explore the flexibility of FunSearch by applying it to an important practical challenge in computer science. The “bin packing” problem looks at how to pack items of different sizes into the smallest number of bins. It sits at the core of many real-world problems, from loading containers with items to allocating compute jobs in data centers to minimize costs.</p><p data-block-key="1n4qj">The online bin-packing problem is typically addressed using algorithmic rules-of-thumb (heuristics) based on human experience. But finding a set of rules for each specific situation - with differing sizes, timing, or capacity – can be challenging. Despite being very different from the cap set problem, setting up FunSearch for this problem was easy. FunSearch delivered an automatically tailored program (adapting to the specifics of the data) that outperformed established heuristics – using fewer bins to pack the same number of items.</p>

              <div>
  <p data-block-key="4lvaj">Hard combinatorial problems like online bin packing can be tackled using other AI approaches, <a href="https://deepmind.google/impact/optimizing-computer-systems-with-more-generalized-ai-tools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">such as neural networks</a> and reinforcement learning. Such approaches have proven to be effective too, but may also require significant resources to deploy. FunSearch, on the other hand, outputs code that can be easily inspected and deployed, meaning its solutions could potentially be slotted into a variety of real-world industrial systems to bring swift benefits.</p><h2 data-block-key="1htm1">LLM-driven discovery for science and beyond</h2><p data-block-key="drmg1">FunSearch demonstrates that if we safeguard against LLMs’ hallucinations, the power of these models can be harnessed not only to produce new mathematical discoveries, but also to reveal potentially impactful solutions to important real-world problems.</p><p data-block-key="bd36s">We envision that for many problems in science and industry - longstanding or new - generating effective and tailored algorithms using LLM-driven approaches will become common practice.</p><p data-block-key="8uv2j">Indeed, this is just the beginning. FunSearch will improve as a natural consequence of the wider progress of LLMs, and we will also be working to broaden its capabilities to address a variety of society’s pressing scientific and engineering challenges.</p>

<p>The key issue here is that people are worried that their private files on Dropbox are being passed to OpenAI to use as training data for their models—a claim that is strenuously denied by Dropbox.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Dropbox built some sensible features—summarize on demand, “chat with your data” via Retrieval Augmented Generation—and did a moderately OK job of communicating how they work... but when it comes to data privacy and AI, a “moderately OK job” is a failing grade. Especially if you hold as much of people’s private data as Dropbox does!</p>
<p>Two details in particular seem really important. Dropbox have an <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/ai-principles">AI principles document</a> which includes this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Customer trust and the privacy of their data are our foundation. We will not use customer data to train AI models without consent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also have a checkbox hidden <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/account/ai">deep in their settings</a> that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2023/dropbox-third-party.png" alt="Third-party AI: Use artificial intelligence (Al) from third-party partners so you can work faster in Dropbox. We only use technology partners we have vetted. Your data is never used to train their internal models, and is deleted from third-party servers within 30 days. Learn more. There is a toggle set to On."></p>
<p>I took that screenshot on my own account. It’s toggled “on”—but I never turned it on myself.</p>
<p>Does that mean I’m marked as “consenting” to having my data used to train AI models?</p>
<p>I don’t think so: I think this is a combination of confusing wording and the eternal vagueness of what the term “consent” means in a world where everyone agrees to the terms and conditions of everything without reading them.</p>
<p>But a LOT of people have come to the conclusion that this means their private data—which they pay Dropbox to protect—is now being funneled into the OpenAI training abyss.</p>
<h4 id="people-dont-believe-openai">People don’t believe OpenAI</h4>
<p>Here’s copy from that Dropbox preference box, talking about their “third-party partners”—in this case OpenAI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your data is never used to train their internal models, and is deleted from third-party servers within 30 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s increasing clear to me like people simply <strong>don’t believe OpenAI</strong> when they’re told that data won’t be used for training.</p>
<p>What’s really going on here is something deeper then: AI is facing a crisis of trust.</p>
<p>I quipped <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1735086765814542802">on Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“OpenAI are training on every piece of data they see, even when they say they aren’t” is the new “Facebook are showing you ads based on overhearing everything you say through your phone’s microphone”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I meant by that.</p>
<h4 id="facebook-dont-spy-microphone">Facebook don’t spy on you through your microphone</h4>
<p>Have you heard the one about Facebook spying on you through your phone’s microphone and showing you ads based on what you’re talking about?</p>
<p>This theory has been floating around for years. From a technical perspective it should be easy to disprove:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile phone operating systems don’t allow apps to invisibly access the microphone.</li>
<li>Privacy researchers can audit communications between devices and Facebook to confirm if this is happening.</li>
<li>Running high quality voice recognition like this at scale is extremely expensive—I had a conversation with a friend who works on server-based machine learning at Apple a few years ago who found the entire idea laughable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-technical reasons are even stronger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook say they aren’t doing this. The risk to their reputation if they are caught in a lie is astronomical.</li>
<li>As with many conspiracy theories, too many people would have to be “in the loop” and not blow the whistle.</li>
<li>Facebook don’t need to do this: there are much, much cheaper and more effective ways to target ads at you than spying through your microphone. These methods have been working incredibly well for years.</li>
<li>Facebook gets to show us thousands of ads a year. 99% of those don’t correlate in the slightest to anything we have said out loud. If you keep rolling the dice long enough, eventually a coincidence will strike.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the thing though: <em>none of these arguments matter</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever experienced Facebook showing you an ad for something that you were talking about out-loud about moments earlier, you’ve already dismissed everything I just said. You have personally experienced anecdotal evidence which overrides all of my arguments here.</p>
<p>Here’s a Reply All podcast episode from Novemember 2017 that explores this issue: <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/z3hlwr">109 Is Facebook Spying on You?</a>. Their conclusion: Facebook are not spying through your microphone. But if someone already believes that there is no argument that can possibly convince them otherwise.</p>
<p>I’ve experienced this effect myself—over the past few years I’ve tried talking people out of this, as part of my own personal fascination with how sticky this conspiracy theory is.</p>
<p>The key issue here is the same as the OpenAI training issue: people <strong>don’t believe</strong> these companies when they say that they aren’t doing something.</p>
<p>One interesting difference here is that in the Facebook example people have personal evidence that makes them believe they understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>With AI we have almost the complete opposite: AI models are weird black boxes, built in secret and with no way of understanding what the training data was or how it influences the model.</p>
<p>As with so much in AI, people are left with nothing more than “vibes” to go on. And the vibes are bad.</p>
<h4 id="this-really-matters">This really matters</h4>
<p>Trust is really important. Companies lying about what they do with your privacy is a very serious allegation.</p>
<p>A society where big companies tell blatant lies about how they are handling our data—and get away with it without consequences—is a very unhealthy society.</p>
<p>A key role of government is to prevent this from happening. If OpenAI are training on data that they said they wouldn’t train on, or if Facebook are spying on us through our phone’s microphones, they should be hauled in front of regulators and/or sued into the ground.</p>
<p>If we believe that they are doing this without consequence, and have been getting away with it for years, our intolerance for corporate misbehavior becomes a victim as well. We risk letting companies get away with real misconduct because we incorrectly believed in conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Privacy is important, and very easily misunderstood. People both overestimate and underestimate what companies are doing, and what’s possible. This isn’t helped by the fact that AI technology means the scope of what’s possible is changing at a rate that’s hard to appreciate even if you’re deeply aware of the space.</p>
<p>If we want to protect our privacy, we need to understand what’s going on. More importantly, we need to be able to trust companies to honestly and clearly explain what they are doing with our data.</p>
<p>On a personal level we risk losing out on useful tools. How many people cancelled their Dropbox accounts in the last 48 hours? How many more turned off that AI toggle, ruling out ever evaluating if those features were useful for them or not?</p>
<h4 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do about it?</h4>
<p>There is something that the big AI labs could be doing to help here: tell us how you are training!</p>
<p>The fundamental question here is about training data: what are OpenAI using to train their models?</p>
<p>And the answer is: we have no idea! The entire process could not be more opaque.</p>
<p>Given that, is it any wonder that when OpenAI say “we don’t train on data submitted via our API” people have trouble believing them?</p>
<p>The situation with ChatGPT itself is even more messy. OpenAI say that they DO use ChatGPT interactions to improve their models—even those from paying customers, with the exception of the “call us” priced <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise">ChatGPT Enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>If I paste a private document into ChatGPT to ask for a summary, will snippets of that document be leaked to future users after the next model update? Without more details on HOW they are using ChatGPT to improve their models I can’t come close to answering that question.</p>
<p>Clear explanations of how this stuff works could go a long way to improving the trust relationship OpenAI have with their users, and the world at large.</p>
<p>Maybe take a leaf from large scale platform companies. They publish public post-mortem incident reports on outages, to regain trust with their customers through transparency about exactly what happened and the steps they are taking to prevent it from happening again. Dan Luu has collected a <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems">great list of examples</a>.</p>
<h4 id="opportunity-local-models">An opportunity for local models</h4>
<p>One consistent theme I’ve seen in conversations about this issue is that people are much more comfortable trusting their data to local models that run on their own devices than models hosted in the cloud.</p>
<p>The good news is that local models are consistently both increasing in quality and shrinking in size.</p>
<p>I figured out how to run Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/111577242044966329">on my laptop</a> last night—the first local model I’ve tried which really does seem to be equivalent in quality to ChatGPT 3.5.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/">Phi-2</a> is a fascinating new model in that it’s only 2.7 billion parameters (most useful local models start at 7 billion) but claims state-of-the-art performance against some of those larger models. And they trained it for around $35,000.</p>
<p>While I’m excited about the potential of local models, I’d hate to see us lose out on the power and convenience of the larger hosted models over privacy concerns which turn out to be incorrect.</p>
<p>The intersection of AI and privacy is a critical issue. We need to be able to have the highest quality conversations about it, with maximum transparency and understanding of what’s actually going on.</p>
<p>This is hard already, and it’s made even harder if we straight up disbelieve anything that companies tell us. Those companies need to earn our trust. How can we help them do that?</p>

			<h2>Cruise, the GM self-driving car subsidiary, is laying off 900 workers to slash costs and revamp the company, TechCrunch exclusively learned.</h2>

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>Cruise, the embattled</span> GM self-driving car subsidiary, is laying off 900 employees, or about 24% of its workforce, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The layoffs are part of a plan to slash costs and attempt to revamp the company following an October 2 incident that left a pedestrian stuck under and then dragged by one of its robotaxis.</p>
<p>An email, penned by newly minted president and CTO Mo Elshenawy, was sent this morning to the entire 3,800-person workforce. The email, which TechCrunch has viewed, began with a resigned tone: “We knew this day was coming, but that does not make it any less difficult—especially for those whose jobs are affected,” Elshenawy wrote. Workers were expected to be informed within the hour or receiving the company wide email, as to whether they would be losing their job.</p>
<p>GM, which acquired Cruise in 2016, was rewarded by shareholders for the cutbacks. GM shares rose 4.8% to $35.64 following the news.</p>
<p>Cruise is targeting non-engineering jobs in the layoffs, particularly those people who worked in the field, commercial operations and corporate staffing, according to the email. The company has also ended additional assignments of contingent workers who supported its driverless operations. Engineering, a category that makes up the bulk of the Cruise workforce, is largely being preserved, according to the content of the email and discussions with internal sources.</p>
<p>The email continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Today, we are making staff reductions that will affect 24% of full-time Cruisers, through no fault of their own.&nbsp; We are simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale. As a result, we are reducing our employee counts in operations and other areas. These impacts are largely outside of engineering, although some Tech positions are impacted also.</span></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Workers will remain on the payroll through February 12 and will be eligible for an additional 8 weeks of pay, with long-term employees offered an additional 2 weeks’ pay per every year at Cruise over 3 years, according to the email to staff. Anyone laid off will also receive their 2023 bonus (eligible target payout) on Jan. 5, 2024. Other parts of the severance package includes health benefits through the end of May, two months contribution into their 401(k) plan and continued time on payroll through March 24 for immigrants in lieu of a lump-sum severance payment to allow visa holders additional time to help transition and manage their immigration status.</p>
<p>The company also said that all employees, regardless of whether they were laid off, will receive&nbsp; their January 15th vesting through its employee share-selling program.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Cruise issued a statement confirming the layoffs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">“We shared the difficult news that we are reducing our workforce, primarily in commercial operations and related corporate functions,” the emailed statement reads. “These changes reflect our decision to focus on more deliberate commercialization plans with safety as our north star. We are supporting impacted Cruisers with strong severance and benefits packages and are grateful to the departing employees who played important roles in building Cruise and supporting our mission.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The layoffs come just a day after nine senior leaders (SLT) at Cruise, who worked in its commercial operations, legal and policy departments, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/cruise-leaders-booted-following-initial-safety-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were dismissed</a> by the company’s board. COO Gil West and David Estrada, who was head of government affairs, were among that group.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elshenawy reiterated the company would be narrowing and refocusing its efforts, information shared last month following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/19/cruise-co-founder-and-ceo-kyle-vogt-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> resignation of co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt</a> and some executive shuffling that included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/gm-inserts-exec-at-cruise-as-safety-review-expands-manual-self-driving-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointing Craig Glidden</a>, GM’s EVP of legal and policy and a Cruise board member, as chief administrative officer at Cruise. Jon McNeill, a member of GM’s board, was also named vice chairman of the Cruise board. McNeill, who joined the Cruise board recently and was previously chief operating officer at Lyft and president of Tesla, now serves alongside GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise executives said at the time they wanted to take a measured business approach that preserves cash and improves safety culture in an attempt to put GM’s troubled autonomous vehicle subsidiary on the right path. The first steps in that rebuilding plan, which included pausing production on its Origin robotaxi, were laid out in an internal email sent to employees in late November by Elshenawy, who was executive vice president of engineering at Cruise and ascended into the president role after co-founder and Vogt resigned.</p>
<p>Elshenawy repeated that intent in the Thursday morning email stating that the company was “simplifying and focusing our efforts to return with an exceptional service in one city to start with and focusing on the Bolt platform for this first step before we scale.”</p>
<p>Cruise used all-electric Chevy Bolt vehicles, which have been specifically manufactured to support its self-driving system, in its robotaxi fleet. The company intended to shift towards a custom-built autonomous vehicle called the Origin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The layoffs have been largely expected at Cruise for weeks now. Last month. Barra reiterated plans for Cruise to be more “deliberate” when operations eventually resume at the troubled self-driving vehicle subsidiary. For GM, that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/gm-to-slash-spending-at-cruise-by-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slashing spending</a> at Cruise “by hundreds of millions of dollars” in 2024, an action that most expected would result in widespread layoffs.</p>
<p>GM and the Cruise board have been scrambling ever since the October 2 incident put the company in the crosshairs of state, local and federal agencies. However’s Cruise’s robotaxi operations in San Francisco have been criticized by the public and city officials almost immediately after the California Public Utilities Commission issued the company in August the final permit required to operate commercially. Videos of Cruise robotaxis blocking traffic and driving into a construction site were shared on social media. But it was a crash with an emergency response vehicle that began to chip away at the company’s seemingly impenetrable exterior.</p>

<p>Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University have&nbsp;<a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2023/04/12/fathers-alcohol-consumption-before-conception-linked-to-brain-and-facial-defects-in-offspring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already shown</a>&nbsp;that paternal drinking habits prior to conception can have a negative effect on fetal development — with&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI167624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semen from men who regularly consume alcohol</a>&nbsp;impacting placenta development, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)-associated brain and facial defects, and even IVF outcomes.</p>
<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.13566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article published</a>&nbsp;this month in <em>Andrology</em>, the lab of Dr. Michael Golding has now demonstrated that it takes much longer than previously believed, longer than a month, for the effects of alcohol consumption to leave the father’s sperm.</p>
<p>“When someone is consuming alcohol on a regular basis and then stops, their body goes through withdrawal, where it has to learn how to operate without the chemical present,” said Golding, a professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences’ Department of Veterinary Physiology &amp; Pharmacology. “What we discovered is that a father’s sperm are still negatively impacted by drinking even during the withdrawal process, meaning it takes much longer than we previously thought for the sperm to return to normal.”</p>

<h2 id="h-the-dangers-of-paternal-drinking">The Dangers Of Paternal Drinking</h2>
<p>One of the major risks associated with alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy is FAS, which causes abnormal facial features, low birth weight and/or height, attention and hyperactivity issues, and poor coordination.</p>
<p>Currently, doctors are required to confirm only that the mother has consumed alcohol — not the father — to diagnose a child with FAS.</p>
<p>“For years, there’s really been no consideration of male alcohol use whatsoever,” Golding said. “Within the last five to eight years, we’ve started to notice that there are certain conditions where there’s a very strong paternal influence when it comes to alcohol exposure and fetal development.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>“With this project, we wanted to see how long it would take for the effects of alcohol on sperm to wear off,” he said. “We thought it would be a relatively quick change back to normal, but it wasn’t. The withdrawal process took over a month.”</p>
<p>When drinking alcohol, an individual’s liver experiences oxidative stress, leading the body to overproduce certain chemicals, which then interrupts normal cellular activity. Golding’s team discovered that withdrawal causes the same kind of oxidative stress, effectively lengthening the duration of alcohol’s effects on the body beyond what was previously thought.</p>
<p>“During withdrawal, the liver experiences perpetual oxidative stress and sends a signal throughout the male body,” Golding said. “The reproductive system interprets that signal and says, ‘Oh, we are living in an environment that has a really strong oxidative stressor in it. I need to program the offspring to be able to adapt to that kind of environment.’ But Golding suspects that the adaptations to the sperm aren’t beneficial — they lead to problems like FAS.”</p>
<p>He also noted that it doesn’t take excessive alcohol use for a person to experience withdrawal.</p>
<p>“In the models we’re using, even drinking three to four beers after work several days a week can induce withdrawal when the behavior ceases,” Golding said. “You may not feel inebriated, but your body is going through chemical changes.”</p>
<h2 id="h-changing-the-narrative">Changing The Narrative</h2>
<p>Golding’s work is vital to improving pregnancy outcomes by changing&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/for-decades-mothers-have-borne-the-brunt-of-scrutiny-for-alcohol-use-during-pregnancy-new-research-points-to-dads-drinking-as-a-significant-factor-in-fetal-alcohol-syndrome-216601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the conversation about who is responsible</a>&nbsp;for alcohol-related birth defects, since society has historically placed all blame on mothers, even when they do not consume alcohol during their pregnancy.</p>
<p>“There’s psychological trauma associated with the question, ‘Did you drink while you were pregnant?’ It’s also difficult for physicians to have that conversation,” he said. “But if they don’t, then FAS doesn’t get diagnosed right away and the child may not get the support that they need until later in life.”</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s crucial that couples planning on getting pregnant know how far in advance to stop drinking in order to prevent birth defects.</p>
<p>While Golding and his lab will continue to research the effects of paternal drinking to help doctors advise couples, he suggests that fathers abstain from alcohol at least three months prior to conceiving, given this groundbreaking discovery.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of work to be done to get a hard answer, but we know that sperm are made over the course of 60 days, and the withdrawal process takes at least one month,” he said. “So, my estimate would be to wait at least three months.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">When Barbara and Belvett Richards learned that the police had killed their son, they couldn’t understand it. How, on that September day in 2017, did their youngest child come to be shot in his own apartment by officers from the New York Police Department?</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Miguel Richards, who was 31, grew up in Jamaica and had moved to New York about a year earlier after coming to the United States through a work-study program. His father’s friend gave him a job doing office work, and he rented a room in the Bronx. But he started to struggle, becoming reclusive and skipping days of work. His mother, with whom he was particularly close, pleaded with him to return to Jamaica. “It’s as if I sensed something was going to happen,” she says. “I was calling him, calling him, calling him: ‘Miguel, come home. Come home.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">His parents knew he had never been violent, had never been arrested and had never had any issues with the police. What details they managed to gather came from the Bronx district attorney: Richards’ landlord, who hadn’t seen him for weeks, asked the police to check on him. The officers who responded found Richards standing still in his own bedroom, holding a small folding knife. And 15 minutes later, they shot him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Richards’ death marked a historic turning point. It was the first time a killing by officers was recorded by a body camera in New York. The new program was announced just months before as heralding a new era of accountability. Now, a week after the shooting, the department posted on its website a compilation of footage from four of the responding officers. The video, the department said in an introduction to the presentation, was produced “for clear viewing of the event as a totality.” And as far as the department was concerned, the narrative was clear. Sometimes “the use of deadly force is unavoidable,” the police commissioner at the time, James O’Neill, wrote in an internal message. The level of restraint shown by all officers, he said, is “nothing short of exceptional.” And, he added, “releasing footage from critical incidents like this will help firmly establish your restraint in the use of force.”</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">Richards’ parents were not convinced. Belvett watched footage at the district attorney’s office. What he saw, and what was released, did not, in fact, show that the use of deadly force was unavoidable. He later learned that the department had not released all the footage. What else didn’t they know about their son’s death?</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">When body-worn cameras were introduced a decade ago, they seemed to hold the promise of a revolution. Once police officers knew they were being filmed, surely they would think twice about engaging in misconduct. And if they crossed the line, they would be held accountable: The public, no longer having to rely on official accounts, would know about wrongdoing. Police and civilian oversight agencies would be able to use footage to punish officers and improve training. In an outlay that would ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the technology represented the largest new investment in policing in a generation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Yet without deeper changes, it was a fix bound to fall far short of those hopes. In every city, the police ostensibly report to mayors and other elected officials. But in practice, they have been given <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3364&amp;context=vlr">wide latitude</a> to run their departments as they wish and to police — and protect — themselves. And so as policymakers rushed to equip the police with cameras, they often failed to grapple with a fundamental question: Who would control the footage? Instead, they defaulted to leaving police departments, including New York’s, with the power to decide what is recorded, who can see it and when. In turn, departments across the country have routinely delayed releasing footage, released only partial or redacted video or refused to release it at all. They have frequently failed to discipline or fire officers when body cameras document abuse and have kept footage from the agencies charged with investigating police misconduct.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Even when departments have stated policies of transparency, they don’t always follow them. Three years ago, after George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers and amid a wave of protests against police violence, the New York Police Department <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/438-20/mayor-de-blasio-new-body-camera-footage-policy">said</a> it would publish footage of so-called critical incidents “within 30 days.” There have been 380 such incidents since then. The department has released footage within a month just twice.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">And the department often does not release video at all. There have been 28 shootings of civilians this year by New York officers (through the first week of December). The department has released footage in just seven of these cases (also through the first week of December) and has not done so in any of the last 16.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Asked about the department’s limited release of footage, a spokesperson pointed to a caveat, contained in an <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/public_information/bwc-release-oo-54-20.pdf">internal order</a>, that footage can be withheld because of laws or department policy. “The NYPD remains wholly committed to its policy of releasing such recordings as quickly and responsibly as circumstances and the law dictate,” the spokesperson wrote. “Though transparency is of the utmost importance, so too is the Police Department’s commitment to preserving privacy rights.” The department did not say which policies require the withholding of footage and did not address other questions about its record on the cameras. (Mayor Eric Adams’ spokesperson did not make him available for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">For a snapshot of disclosure practices across the country, we conducted a review of civilians killed by police officers in June 2022, roughly a decade after the first body cameras were rolled out. We counted 79 killings in which there was body-worn-camera footage. A year and a half later, the police have released footage in just 33 cases — or about 42%.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">This article is the product of more than six months spent investigating how the police have undermined the promise of transparency and accountability that accompanied the body-camera movement. We interviewed dozens of department insiders, government lawyers, policing experts and advocates and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal reports, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and dozens of hours of surveillance-camera and body-camera footage, including some that the New York Police Department fought against disclosing. The reporting reveals that without further intervention from city, state and federal officials and lawmakers, body cameras may do more to serve police interests than those of the public they are sworn to protect.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">To Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who is now a professor at the Joseph F. Rice School of Law at the University of South Carolina, body cameras represent the latest chapter in America’s quest for a technological fix to the deeply rooted problem of unchecked state power. “Dash cams were supposed to solve racial profiling,” he says. “Tasers and pepper spray were supposed to solve undue force. We have this real, almost pathological draw to ‘silver bullet’ syndrome. And I say that as a supporter of body-worn cameras.” He later added, “We just said to police departments: ‘Here’s this tool. Figure out how you would like to use it.’ It shouldn’t be a surprise that they’re going to use it in a way that most benefits them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Jeff Schlanger, a former New York deputy commissioner who had an oversight role during the implementation of body-worn cameras and left the department in 2021, believes that the police have often failed to use the cameras for accountability and that political leaders need to do more. “Mayors, City Council members, all locally elected officials,” he says, “should be losing sleep over the lack of meaningful independent oversight of the police.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">When full footage has been released, often by prosecutors or after public pressure, it often contradicts initial police accounts. In 2015, a white officer in Cincinnati killed a Black man during a traffic stop. The officer said his life was in danger. But his body-camera video showed that was a lie, and he was prosecuted for murder. (Charges were dropped after two mistrials.) And in Philadelphia this August, an officer shot and killed a man after, the police said, he lunged at officers with “a weapon.” In fact, footage released by the district attorney — who charged the officer with murder — shows that the man was sitting in his own car.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">In New York, Miguel Richards’ parents weren’t the only ones who had doubts about the department’s claims that the shooting was unavoidable. The footage the department released stopped right when the officers fired at Richards. It didn’t include the minutes after the shooting, and it didn’t include footage from other police units that responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Ruth Lowenkron, a disability rights lawyer who specializes in mental health issues, wanted to see it all. Working for New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, a legal-advocacy nonprofit, she and her colleagues, along with activists, had begun pushing the city to find an alternative to using the police as first responders to people in crisis. On her second day on the job, a sergeant shot and killed a 66-year-old woman who had schizophrenia and was holding a baseball bat in her Bronx apartment. The department’s own investigators concluded that the sergeant escalated the situation and caused the shooting.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">Now, watching the video the department released of Richards’ shooting, Lowenkron feared that the same thing happened to him. The department’s edited footage showed the officers making a few attempts to connect with Richards early in the encounter. “What’s your name, man?” one officer asked. But they were also barking increasingly terse commands. “You are seconds away from getting shot,” one officer said. “Do you want to die?” A few minutes later, as one of them warned that Richards might have a gun, the officers fired.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Lowenkron filed a records request, certain that there was more to the story. In releasing the partial footage, the police commissioner had vowed that the “NYPD is committed to being as transparent as possible.” But nearly three weeks after her request, Lowenkron received a different message from one of the department’s records officers: “I must deny access to these records.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"><strong>Body-worn cameras</strong> were adopted by police departments across the country in the wake of widespread Black Lives Matter protests in 2014, sparked when Michael Brown was killed by the police in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer who shot Brown was not equipped with a camera, and there was a dispute about what happened in the last moments of Brown’s life. Amid deep schisms over race, justice and policing, there was at least agreement that police interactions should be recorded. Brown’s mother pressed for the technology to become standard equipment. “Please,” she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WTc1DOlMrc&amp;t=242s">begged</a> Missouri legislators, “let police-worn body cameras be a voice of truth and transparency.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">President Barack Obama put the cameras at the center of his <a href="http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/12/01/building-trust-between-communities-and-local-police">plans</a> to restore trust in policing. Cities quickly began spending millions on the devices, expenditures that continue today for storage and software. Los Angeles has spent nearly $60 million since getting cameras in 2016. In Philadelphia, where footage is rarely released, the cameras have cost taxpayers about $20 million. New York City has spent more than $50 million. But whether citizens benefit from the cameras they’re paying for is often up to the police, who have often been able to keep footage hidden from the public in even the most extreme cases. In 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama, an officer unleashed his police dog on a burglary suspect without warning, severing the Black man’s femoral artery and killing him. The police and the city have <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2023/02/unlike-in-memphis-montgomery-police-fight-release-of-brutal-bodycam-footage.html">refused</a> to release footage for five years, arguing that it could cause “civil unrest” and that the officers could face “embarrassment.” But a lawyer for the man’s family, which is suing the city, got a copy of the transcript in the discovery process and entered it into the court record. “Did you get a bite?” an officer asked the one who had the dog, according to the document. “Sure did, heh, heh,” the K-9 officer responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">The secrecy undercuts the deterrent effect on officer behavior that many had presumed body cameras would produce. Three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd by kneeling on his neck, body-camera video caught him kneeling on the necks of others. In 2017, Chauvin dragged a handcuffed Black woman out of her house, slammed her to the ground and then pressed his knee into her neck for nearly five minutes. Three months later, Chauvin hit a 14-year-old Black boy at least twice in the head with a heavy flashlight, choked him and pushed him against a wall. The boy cried out in pain and passed out. Chauvin pushed a knee into his neck for 15 minutes as the boy’s mother, reaching to help him, begged, “Please, please do not kill my son!”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">The footage was left in the control of a department where impunity reigned. Supervisors had access to the recordings yet cleared Chauvin’s conduct in both cases. Minneapolis fought against releasing the videos, even after Chauvin pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal civil rights violations in one of the cases. A judge finally ordered the city and the police to release the tapes this April, six years after Chauvin abused the boy. “Chauvin should have been fired in 2017,” says Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented both of the victims. If the police had done that, “the city never burns. We’d have a downtown still. It’s a parade of horribles. All to keep something secret.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">A Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1587661/download">report</a> from this summer found that the secrecy and impunity was all part of a larger pattern in the Minneapolis Police Department. Shootings, beatings and other abuse had routinely been captured on video. But the department didn’t make the footage public or mete out punishment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">There was a similar dynamic in Memphis, Tennessee, where officers in a street-crimes unit regularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/us/memphis-police-scorpion.html">abused</a> residents. They wore body cameras but faced no consequences until the case of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death this January by officers in the unit, attracted national attention. The footage showed that some of the officers took their cameras off. Others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/07/us/memphis-officers-tyre-nichols.html">knew</a> they were being recorded and pummeled Nichols anyway. It was only after public outcry that the department took the rare step of releasing footage, which contradicted initial police accounts and led to state and federal charges for five officers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Some politicians have often quietly enabled obstacles to this kind of accountability. When South Carolina became the first state in the nation to require the use of cameras in 2015, Nikki Haley, the governor at the time, made the <a href="https://www.wistv.com/story/29289442/south-carolinas-body-camera-bill-is-now-law/">announcement</a> with the family of Walter Scott standing behind her. Scott was a Black man who, two months earlier, was stopped by the police for a broken taillight and was shot in the back and killed when he tried to run away. A witness filmed the shooting, and that video contradicted official police accounts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">“This is going to make sure Walter Scott did not die without us realizing that we have a problem,” Haley said as she signed the legislation. What the governor didn’t say was that the same law stipulated that footage from cameras is “not a public record subject to disclosure,” thus relieving police departments from any obligation to release it. And indeed, little footage has ever become public in South Carolina.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">In 2021, York County sheriff’s deputies responding to a call for a wellness check found a young man sitting in his pickup truck with his mother standing next to him. They fired at him nearly 50 times. The sheriff, who refused to release body-camera footage, said the man pointed a shotgun at deputies. When the man, who survived, obtained the footage after suing, it showed no such thing. So far this year, the police in South Carolina have killed at least 19 people. The police have released footage in only three of those cases. When we asked one department, the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office, why it had not, a spokesperson pointed to the law, writing, “We never release that footage.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">The pattern has become so common across the country — public talk of transparency followed by a deliberate undermining of the stated goal — that the policing-oversight expert Hans Menos, who led Philadelphia’s civilian police-oversight board until 2020, coined a term for it: the “body-cam head fake.” And there is no place that illustrates this as well as New York City, the home of the world’s largest municipal police force, some 36,000 officers strong.</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"><strong>New York’s adoption</strong> of body-worn cameras started with a moment of unintentional inspiration. In 2013, Judge Shira Scheindlin was hearing testimony in a federal lawsuit in which multiple advocacy groups claimed that the Police Department’s aggressive “stop and frisk” policy was racially biased and unconstitutional. One day during the trial, an expert witness for the city mentioned a new tool for accountability — body-worn cameras — in passing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">“My head snapped when I heard the words,” Scheindlin recalled this year. “I thought, ‘That could be a useful remedy!’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Two months later, Scheindlin issued a historic <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/assets/Floyd-Remedy-Opinion-8-12-13.pdf">ruling</a> that New York’s stop-and-frisk practices were unconstitutional. She ordered the Police Department to begin piloting body-worn cameras, writing that they were “uniquely suited to addressing the constitutional harms at issue in this case.” Scheindlin laid out three ways the cameras would help: “First, they will provide a contemporaneous, objective record of stops and frisks.” She continued, “Second, the knowledge that an exchange is being recorded will encourage lawful and respectful interactions on the part of both parties. Third, the recordings will diminish the sense on the part of those who file complaints that it is their word against the police.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">But in a preview of obstacles that would follow, the department was slow to roll out the devices, even as they were becoming common in other cities. More than two years after Scheindlin’s ruling, the department hired researchers at New York University to conduct a survey about what residents wanted from a body-camera project. The community’s answers were overwhelming and clear: transparency and disclosure.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Officers, however, wanted the opposite. They were concerned that the recordings would “show a different side of the story than what would otherwise be told,” according to a separate NYU survey. To Scheindlin and the plaintiffs in the stop-and-frisk case, that was exactly the point.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">When the department released its policy in April 2017, it was clear whose opinions held more sway. No video would automatically become public. Anyone that requested it would have to go through an opaque, often slow-moving Freedom of Information process — in which the department itself would be the arbiter of what would be released (though the courts could review that decision).</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">The policy blunted the technology’s potential for accountability in other ways. Officers could decide when to start filming, instead of at the beginning of all interactions as the public wanted. And while the public had little access to footage, the police had privileged access: Officers who were the subjects of complaints would be allowed to watch the footage before having to give any statements — something that could allow them to tailor their accounts to the video.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">The policy was “so flawed that the pilot program may do little to protect New Yorkers’ civil rights,” Ian Head and Darius Charney of the Center for Constitutional Rights <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/dont-let-the-nypd-co-opt-body-cameras.html">wrote</a> in a guest essay in The New York Times. “Instead, it might shield police officers from accountability when they engage in misconduct.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Still, on April 27, 2017, Commissioner James O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio held a news conference at a precinct in Washington Heights to celebrate the rollout of body-worn cameras. Stepping up to the lectern, O’Neill said he was initially skeptical of the cameras but had become a believer. “I’m totally convinced now that this is the way forward,” he said. “These cameras have a great potential to de-escalate.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Then the mayor went to the lectern. Officers had long felt that de Blasio, a self-proclaimed progressive, was too supportive of Black Lives Matter protests and not sufficiently supportive of the police. That sentiment turned into rage when a man espousing hatred of the police murdered two officers in late 2014. Hundreds of police officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funerals. Ever since, de Blasio had been working to repair the relationship.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">“This is an historic day for New York City,” de Blasio said, with O’Neill by his side. “This is the first day of the era of body-worn cameras, and that means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability that will benefit everyone.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Five months later, officers killed Miguel Richards, making his case the first in which the potential of body-camera video would be tested. But Ruth Lowenkron, the public-interest attorney who filed a request for the footage, was getting little from the Police Department. After it rejected her initial request, she appealed the decision. The department sent her some redacted footage but again rejected her request for all of it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">Disclosing the full footage would be an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” the department wrote. Whose privacy — the dead man’s or the officers’ — was not explained. Releasing the full footage, the department insisted, could “endanger the life or safety of any person.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">The letter came from the department’s legal unit, led by its deputy commissioner, Larry Byrne, who was known for his fierce advocacy for the department. From the outset of the body-worn-camera program, Byrne made it clear that he was resistant to widespread release of footage. “They are not public records in the sense that, because the officer turns the camera on, they are now in the public domain,” Byrne <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/27/nypd-ready-to-hit-record-on-body-camera-pilot?ref=bklyner.com">told</a> NY1 in 2015. In fact, he insisted, “most of this footage” would never be made public.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Lowenkron kept requesting the Richards footage and kept getting rejected or sent redacted video. In July 2018, she and her colleagues decided to file a lawsuit in state court demanding the full footage. They even got a former Police Department lawyer, Stuart Parker, to help litigate the suit pro bono. The department’s various explanations for its denials “pissed me off,” Parker recalls. He retired from the department as an assistant commissioner in 2016, the year before cameras were widely rolled out. But he had been excited by their potential and was frustrated by the department’s kneejerk secrecy. “There’s a good side to the department,” he says, “but there’s always been a self-serving dark side to it too.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">In response to the suit, the department argued in legal filings that it had blurred the footage “in order to protect the privacy of both Richards and his family.” But Lowenkron and her team had obtained affidavits from Richards’ parents saying that the department never asked them whether they wanted the footage released or redacted. And what the Richardses wanted, they said, was for the full footage to be released to the public.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"><strong>Public disclosure</strong> of footage isn’t the only path to hold officers in New York accountable for misconduct. For 70 years, the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board had been vested with the responsibility to investigate New Yorkers’ allegations against the police. From the start, though, its powers were weak. The agency was actually part of the Police Department, and its board consisted of three deputy police commissioners. The department fought efforts over the years to make the agency independent. In the face of a plan in the mid-1960s to include civilians on the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the head of the largest police union, then called the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said, “I’m sick and tired of giving in to minority groups with their whims and their gripes and shouting.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">The agency eventually became independent in 1993 after stiff opposition months before from off-duty officers. Thousands of them — along with Rudy Giuliani, then a mayoral aspirant after losing the previous election — staged a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/10/the-forgotten-city-hall-riot.html">huge protest</a> outside City Hall, with many of them going on to block the Brooklyn Bridge. After the changes, the review board still relied on an often noncooperative Police Department for records, and its investigations frequently petered out amid competing accounts. And like many civilian oversight boards across the country, in the rare cases when it substantiated misconduct, it could only recommend discipline to the police commissioner, who could and often did ignore it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Many civilians, whom the board relied on to initiate complaints, had long grown skeptical of the agency’s ability to ensure that officer misconduct had consequences. But the advent of body-camera video promised to fundamentally change how the agency worked. For the first time, staff members would have an objective record of the incidents they investigated. That was Nicole Napolitano’s hope when she joined the review board as its new director of policy and advocacy in September 2017 — the same year body cameras were rolled out in New York and one week after officers killed Richards. “We talked about it in detail” at the agency, she says of the initial footage of the Richards shooting. “We thought, ‘Look at what body-worn cameras can show us.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Napolitano, who is married to a retired detective, knew it would be a challenge. As a senior policy manager in the Office of the Inspector General for the New York Police Department, she had seen how the department could simply ignore the recommendations in her reports. Napolitano hoped she would have more direct impact in her new, more senior position at the review board. But what she hadn’t appreciated was how much the police controlled the literal tools of their own oversight.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">As with most civilian boards across the country, the agency did not have its own access to footage. Like the public, it, too, had to rely on the cooperation of the department. To try to obtain footage, the board had to navigate a baroque multistep process. Written requests were submitted to a department “liaison” unit, which in turn forwarded them to the legal unit for review. Then the department had to locate the footage, which was a significant undertaking because it wasn’t cataloging the footage in any systematic way. Unlike in many other cities, the department’s cameras had no GPS location data. If a civilian making a complaint didn’t know an officer’s name or badge number, investigators and even the department could have a hard time finding footage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">Perhaps most problematic for Napolitano, though, was the fact that the review board’s investigators had to agree to a strict set of conditions before watching videos of incidents. If they spotted other, unrelated misconduct, they were not allowed to investigate it. “If you were setting up a system to be shitty,” one agency insider says, “this is the system you’d create.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">At times, the department’s animosity toward the board was palpable. Napolitano remembers one meeting in 2017 between board officials and Kerry Sweet, then a top official at the department’s legal bureau who helped oversee the body-camera rollout. As other police brass shuffled in, Sweet said they had missed a chance to “bomb the room” when only board officials were there, which would have “solved everything.” (Sweet, who has since retired, says he doesn’t recall saying that, but added, “On reflection, it should have been an airstrike.”)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">Napolitano and her colleagues noticed an even more troubling trend: The department would often tell the review board that the footage it requested didn’t exist — only for the civilian agency to later discover that wasn’t true. According to an analysis the agency put out in early 2020, this happened in nearly 1 of every 5 cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">Napolitano thought there was a straightforward solution to the department’s stonewalling: The review board should be able to directly log in to the department’s system where footage is stored. That’s how it worked with civilian oversight boards in a few other major American cities, including Chicago, which revamped civilian oversight after Laquan McDonald was killed in 2014 and the city tried to withhold footage that contradicted officers’ accounts. Chicago’s oversight board now not only has direct access to videos but also regularly releases footage publicly, and its investigators have used it to successfully push for officers to be fired for misconduct. Napolitano didn’t see a reason for it to be otherwise in New York. So in her first semiannual report, at the end of 2017, she noted the challenges of getting footage — and called on the city to give the review board direct access. Both the department and City Hall, Napolitano says, “freaked” out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">“It was a rough time for de Blasio when it came to public safety,” Napolitano added, referring to the mayor’s tenuous relationship with the police. “In a dispute between CCRB and NYPD, City Hall always chose the NYPD. Always.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">“I don’t agree,” de Blasio says. “The tension between the CCRB and the NYPD is natural and built-in. I decided each issue on the merits and according to my values.” He went on, “The blunter truth is when a progressive challenges the police culture and the police unions and the status quo of American policing, the left is not going to have their back. You’re not getting that thank-you card. And the right will viciously attack.”</p>
        
    
                    
<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0"><strong>While the department</strong> fought Lowenkron and Napolitano on the release of body-camera footage, there was one group that had access to all of it and could use it to check for misconduct: the department’s own investigators. After every police shooting, detectives with the Force Investigation Division review the incident to see whether officers complied with department policy. The Richards case was the first time body-worn-camera footage could let them see what actually happened in a killing by officers. As investigators dug through the video and interviewed officers in the weeks and months after the shooting, they saw a far more complicated picture than the one the police commissioner painted.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">As the tape began, one officer, Mark Fleming, beamed his flashlight into the far side of Richards’ nearly bare, unlit bedroom. Richards was standing perfectly still in the dark, seemingly catatonic, wearing a blue polo shirt and sunglasses and holding a knife in his left hand.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">Department guidelines for dealing with people in crisis who do not pose an immediate threat say officers should try to “isolate and contain” the person. “The primary duty of all members of the service is to preserve human life,” department policy states. Officers are also instructed to wait for a supervisor’s permission before trying to subdue someone in crisis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">At first, it appeared that the officers who encountered Richards were following their training. “Look, we could shut the door,” Officer Redmond Murphy suggested to his partner. But Fleming, who had served more years in the department, quickly rejected the idea. He kept telling Richards to drop the knife, and he radioed for an officer with a Taser.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">Two officers from the specially trained Emergency Services Unit, which deals with people experiencing mental health crises, arrived. Then Murphy said he thought he saw something, perhaps a gun, in Richards’ right hand, which was obscured behind a backpack on the bed. “Hold up,” one of the ESU officers told Fleming and Murphy before heading back downstairs to grab protective gear. “I don’t know if it’s a toy or a gun,” Murphy quickly added.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">As the specialists went downstairs, the officer with the Taser, Jesus Ramos, went upstairs and joined Fleming and Murphy outside Richards’ room. “Do you want to take him down now?” Ramos asked them. “Yeah,” they both answered.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">At nearly the same moment, a radio command came from headquarters, emphasizing department guidelines. “Isolate and contain,” the dispatcher told the officers. “Use nonlethal force whenever possible.” As Ramos lifted his Taser and stepped into the room, Fleming — who later said Richards was raising his arm — fired his gun. Murphy fired, too. It’s impossible to see that moment in the grainy, shaky footage. The clearest angle would most likely have been Fleming’s camera, but it was covered by his arm as he held his flashlight.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">Fleming and Murphy fired 16 times, hitting Richards seven times, including twice in the chest, rupturing his aorta. As gunshots rang out, the supervisor they were supposed to wait for arrived. (None of the officers responded to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">The internal investigators asked the officers to explain. “We kind of handle everything on our own,” Murphy offered. An internal investigator pressed Fleming about what had “situationally changed” and prompted the decision to “take him at that point.” Fleming said everything changed once his partner said Richards might have a gun. “I perceived that his intentions were lethal,” Fleming said. But his answers suggested that he hadn’t fully grasped Richards’ mental state. “Why would any sane person hide a fake gun?” Fleming asked.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">When the investigators asked why the two officers did not broadcast that Richards was an “EDP” — or an emotionally disturbed person — with a knife, as protocol dictates, Murphy told them he and Fleming had handled people in crisis before. Asked why they made the decision to use force, Murphy simply said, “We wanted to, like, end it.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">While the Force Investigation Division ultimately concluded that the officers had been “justified” in shooting — because they were facing an “individual armed with a knife and an imitation firearm” — the investigators also said that Fleming and Murphy should still be punished. Richards, their September 2018 internal report <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24216933-final-internal-investigation-report">noted</a>, “was contained and posed no immediate threat of danger.” And the officers violated policy by not asking permission from their supervisor before they acted. The department’s full investigative record was first reported by the independent journalist Michael Hayes in his 2023 book, “The Secret Files.” The review recommended that the officers face disciplinary charges that could ultimately result in their firing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">But in New York, as in almost all cities in the United States, the police commissioner has <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-unchecked-power/">absolute power</a> over punishment. In March 2019, O’Neill, who had extolled the promise of body cameras just two years earlier, overruled his own investigators. He decided that neither Fleming nor Murphy would be punished for killing Richards. Instead, the commissioner docked them three vacation days for something else they did: stopping for pizza before responding to the call for the wellness check. (O’Neill did not respond to questions or requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">It would be another three months before anyone outside the department would see the full footage. That June, a New York judge ruled that the “public is vested with an inherent right to know” and ordered the department to turn over the recordings to Lowenkron’s organization.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">She received a package with a DVD a month later from the department. Bracing herself, she sat down to view it on her computer. The footage that the department publicly released cut off when the officers fired. Lowenkron now saw the aftermath: Richards collapsed to the floor, crumpled and bleeding in the same spot where he had been standing rigidly seconds before.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">“He’s still alive,” Fleming said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.1">“Holy shit,” Murphy replied. “Just fucking cuff him.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.2">The officers then flipped over Richards, severely injured, so roughly that his head could be heard bouncing off the floor.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">They searched around the room for the firearm they thought Richards had. Eventually, Fleming found a palm-size, silver-colored plastic toy gun. “It’s some fucking little thing,” he said. (The video does not show Richards holding the toy gun.) More than three minutes passed before anyone administered any type of aid to the dying man. It was an Emergency Services Unit specialist who retrieved medical equipment after hearing the shots.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">Outside the apartment building, more video recorded other officers milling about. One told a colleague, “They were just hurling fucking shots.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">Lowenkron was shocked. Officers had shot a young man and roughly handled him as he bled to death. “The utter disrespect,” Lowenkron says. “It was a horror movie.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">New York Lawyers for the Public Interest would go on to share the footage with journalists. It would also use the footage in a webinar for mental health advocates in November 2020. “The point,” Lowenkron told me, “was to get more people engaged on this issue: transforming New York and this country’s response to people in crisis.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">But by then, for another man in distress, it was too late.</p>

<hr>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.1"><strong>In April 2019,</strong> one month after O’Neill decided against punishing the officers for the Richards shooting, another officer shot and killed a man named Kawaski Trawick.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.0">The circumstances were remarkably similar to those in the Richards case. Trawick was also a young Black man who lived in the Bronx and was experiencing a mental health crisis in his own apartment. He was also holding a knife when the police arrived. And he was also shot soon afterward. At the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Napolitano was immediately struck by the parallels: “I remember reading the headline on Trawick and thinking, ‘Didn’t I read this already?’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">This time, though, the victim’s family filed a complaint with the review board, providing an opening for civilian investigators to use body-worn-camera footage to make a case that the department and others couldn’t ignore.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">But despite repeated requests over many months, the department wouldn’t share the footage — or any other records — with the review board, leaving the oversight agency effectively unable to begin its own investigation of the case. The refusal was in line with the department’s longstanding practice to withhold footage from the board until the department’s internal investigation was over, a process that often takes more than a year. Such delays can effectively torpedo the review board’s investigations: Under New York civil-service law, any disciplinary cases against police officers must be brought within 18 months of the incident.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">In the Trawick case, the review board obtained the full body-camera video in January 2021 — more than a year and a half after the killing — and only after a state judge ordered the department to hand it over to Lowenkron’s organization, New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, which had sued for it. The judge determined that the department had been withholding the footage <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/judge-says-nypd-illegally-withheld-footage-in-police-shootings">“in bad faith.”</a></p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">What it <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/it-wasnt-the-first-time-the-nypd-killed-someone-in-crisis-for-kawaski-trawick-it-only-took-112-seconds">showed</a> was even more damning than what was captured in the Richards shooting. As the police entered his apartment, Trawick demanded to know, “Why are you in my home?” One officer, Herbert Davis, who was Black and more experienced, then tried to stop his white junior counterpart, Brendan Thompson, from using force. “We ain’t gonna tase him,” Davis said in the video.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Thompson didn’t listen. Instead, he fired his Taser at Trawick, sending roughly 50,000 volts pulsing through him. As Trawick started rushing toward the officers, Thompson lifted his gun and prepared to fire. “No, no — don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t,” Davis said, pushing his partner’s arm down. But Thompson fired four shots, hitting Trawick twice and killing him almost instantly, 112 seconds after they arrived at the apartment. (Davis and Thompson did not reply to requests for comment.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">There was also troubling footage of the aftermath of the shooting. Officers swarmed outside Trawick’s apartment. “Who’s injured?” a sergeant asked. Two officers replied in near unison: “Nobody. Just a perp.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">With all that in hand, the review board completed its investigation in June 2021. The agency, through one of the few powers it had gained over the years, can file and prosecute disciplinary cases against officers — which triggers a Police Department trial, after which a departmental judge sends a provisional decision to the police commissioner, who makes the final call.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">This September, the police judge overseeing the Trawick case recommended that there should be no discipline. Her reason had nothing to do with the shooting itself; in fact, the judge <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/09/25/no-discipline-recommended-cops-killing-kawaski-trawick/">wrote</a> that she had “serious doubts” about the decisions of the officer who killed Trawick. But the review board, she said, had failed to file charges within the 18-month statute of limitations, as outlined under state law. In the end, the department’s refusal to give the footage to the review board had effectively run out the clock on any chance the officers would be punished.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">“That should not be tolerated,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “Both CCRB and NYPD are city agencies. This is something the mayor needs to resolve.”</p>

<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="107.0"><strong>In the wake of</strong> George Floyd’s murder in 2020, huge demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality rolled across the country and the world. It was a global reckoning brought on by footage — the video, recorded by a teenager on her smartphone for more than eight minutes, showing Derek Chauvin ending Floyd’s life.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">Napolitano and her team at the review board had collected data showing how footage could make a difference in New York too. Access to body-camera footage roughly doubled the likelihood that agency investigators would be able to decide a case on its merits rather than dismiss it as inconclusive. But the backlog was growing. That May, the board filed 212 requests with the Police Department for body-worn-camera footage — and the department sent only 33 responses. (While the pandemic slowed the work of all city agencies, the backlog predated it.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">“The withholding of footage stops investigations and prevents the CCRB from providing adequate and meaningful oversight of the NYPD,” an internal agency memo <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6980787-CCRB-Memo-on-Body-Cam-Footage.html">warned</a>. “The situation for New York City oversight of the police has steadily grown worse during the duration of a BWC program intended primarily to aid oversight.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">Napolitano campaigned internally for a law that would take away the department’s absolute control over footage and give the review board its own access. That November, she was let go, along with three other staff members who had sent pointed emails and memos about the department’s withholding of footage. The four filed a lawsuit claiming that their firing violated their First Amendment rights and received an undisclosed settlement. A review-board spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency has “publicly and repeatedly called on legislators to support the fight for direct access. No employee has ever been fired for supporting direct access to BWC footage.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">This spring, the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, and the New York City public advocate, Jumaane Williams, sponsored a bill that would give the review board direct access to footage so that it wouldn’t be beholden to the department for cooperation during investigations. “There are difficult split-second decisions that have to happen” in policing, Williams told me. “But if we’re not able to look at the same thing, if we have to take the word of the NYPD, that doesn’t make this conversation any easier.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">The Police Department has opposed the bill. A department official insisted at a City Council hearing in March that the department “does not fear transparency.” But the official argued that it would be an “insurmountable obstacle” to give the review board direct access while following state confidentiality laws. The bill has been stalled for months.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">The city, meanwhile, paid out at least $121 million in settlements last year for lawsuits alleging misconduct by police officers — the highest total in five years.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">With footage remaining in the control of the Police Department, body-worn cameras have made little difference to the public. This year, a federal court monitor wrote a scathing <a href="https://www.nypdmonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NST-Report.pdf">report</a> about persistent problems with stop-and-frisk, the unconstitutional policing tactic that prompted Scheindlin to order the department to adopt body cameras a decade ago. The monitor found that contrary to Scheindlin’s expectations, police supervisors weren’t using footage to flag misconduct. In a sample of cases the monitor looked at, supervisors reviewing footage of stop-and-frisk encounters concluded that 100% of the cases they looked at were proper stops. The court monitor reviewed the same footage and found that 37% of the stops were unconstitutional.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">“It was an experiment,” Scheindlin says, one that didn’t anticipate issues like control over footage. Scheindlin, who stepped down from the bench in 2016, says she now believes that the Police Department should no longer be the sole custodian of its own video. “That troubles me,” she says. “It should always be somebody independent.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">In interviews with a half-dozen former commanders and high-level officials, most of whom were involved in the body-camera program itself, they said that despite its public pronouncements, the department hasn’t committed to using footage for accountability. “Body cams are essential, if done right,” says a high-ranking commander who just retired and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still works in law enforcement. “They are a game changer.” He added, “If there’s a problem, you flag — and potentially there’s discipline. But that’s not happening in most cases.” Instead, he says, body cameras have become “an exercise in just work they have to do. It’s a culture thing.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">Rudy Hall has a particularly useful vantage point. He was part of the team that rolled out the body cameras, visiting police departments around the country to see how they were using the technology, and has gone on to work for the federal monitor overseeing the department’s compliance with Scheindlin’s now-decade-old order on stop-and-frisk. “I watch a lot of body-cam videos,” Hall told me. “I have absolutely seen supervisors approve problematic conduct.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">“Body-worn cameras have not been exploited the way they should be,” says Jeff Schlanger, the former deputy commissioner. “The way to true reform is through using body cams as an early-warning system, as a way to correct small mistakes before they become big mistakes. But there weren’t a lot of discussions about it. The NYPD needs to do a lot better.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">One of the most comprehensive studies of the use of body cameras, a 2019 meta-analysis led by researchers at George Mason University, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331981847_Research_on_body-worn_cameras">recommended</a> that police departments consider using footage the way sports teams use game tape, to regularly review and improve performance. That’s essentially what the New Orleans Police Department did after the U.S. Department of Justice put it under federal oversight about a decade ago in response to the police killings of several Black men and persistent police violence. Body cameras were a “critical engine for us to continuously evaluate performance,” says Danny Murphy, who ran a unit at the department overseeing compliance with the federal mandate.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">Four auditors were hired to join the police force and comb through footage. They looked to make sure that officers were using their cameras and that supervisors were flagging any problematic behavior. “If officers know they’re being viewed, if supervisors know they’re being reviewed, it creates a pressure for accountability,” says Murphy, who left the department four years ago. A 2020 report from the city’s civilian oversight agency — which has direct access to footage — noted a reduction in both the use of force and citizen complaints, which the department attributed to “the use of the body-worn cameras and the increased scrutiny and oversight these cameras provide leadership.” The police in New Orleans also regularly and quickly release video from shootings and other major incidents. But in the end, it’s the police chief who has the final say on discipline.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">During his tenure at the New York Police Department, Schlanger had, in fact, started a kind of internal oversight system similar to the one in New Orleans. Schlanger and other senior officials would meet with each of the department’s 77 precincts every six months and look at body-camera footage to identify problematic trends and officers. “It was CompStat for constitutional policing,” Schlanger says, referring to the department’s data-heavy program for tracking crime. “If we saw a precinct doing poorly, we’d work to help them. It made a difference.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">The department quietly ended the review program last year.</p>

<hr>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="124.0"><strong>A civil suit on behalf</strong> of Miguel Richards’ estate was filed against the city in 2018. New York is seeking the dismissal of the case. A judge has been considering the request for two and a half years. “I want answers,” his mother told me, “and haven’t been able to get them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">The three officers involved in the Richards shooting were honored in 2018 by the largest New York police union, the Police Benevolent Association, which gave them its Finest of the Finest award for “extremely brave and tactically sound action” in the Richards shooting, noting that “the officers had no choice but to open fire.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">The officers were later deposed in the lawsuit. One of them, Mark Fleming, said in his testimony in September 2020 that he had learned a lesson: that the Emergency Services Unit — whose help he told department investigators he didn’t need — is in fact better equipped and trained to deal with situations that involve people having a mental health crisis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">It’s not clear what, if any, lessons the department itself has taken in. Since Richards’ death in 2017, when cameras were widely rolled out, officers have killed at least 11 people in crisis. There is no evidence that officers have been punished in any of the cases.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">On a Sunday morning in the Bronx this spring, there was another shooting. Santo de la Cruz called a city emergency line. His son, 42-year-old Raul de la Cruz, was in the middle of a schizophrenic episode and had posted a disturbing video on Facebook that morning. Wearing camouflage clothing and a hat with a patch of an Israeli flag, Raul complained about racist police officers. His father called 311, avoiding 911 because he was afraid of what would happen if the police showed up. “I thought they would send someone capable of dealing with a situation like that,” he says in Spanish. “Because I was calling for a sick person, not to send the police to shoot him up.” But it was the police who arrived, with body cameras rolling. And Raul was holding a knife.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">The officers shot him <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-cops-shoot-critically-injure-man-having-medical-episode-in-bronx">28 seconds</a> after arriving. He was hospitalized for more than a month before being released, having lost a kidney and part of his liver. A department commander cited the body-camera footage when he gave a brief news conference the day of the shooting to describe what happened. “This situation was fast, volatile and dangerous,” he said. The officers’ “quick response saved at least one civilian and protected themselves.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="131.0">But the department has not released the footage or commented in the eight months since.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">Lowenkron’s colleagues at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest have once again requested the video, so far to no avail.

          <p>This project aimed to create a visual aid that helped players learn how to think about the game, not just how to play it. By breaking down the game mechanics into smaller components, I designed cards that acted as a small multiple, allowing players to make comparisons between fighting moves to better understand them. I engaged with the Tekken subreddit community for feedback. This was the first time in my process where I designed something so openly and with the public.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Tekken is a Japanese fighting game that has been around since the late 80’s. It continues to boast a strong community of players and remains competitive with other leading titles on the market. If you’ve never heard of Tekken before, the video below will give you an idea of what it’s like:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w66Kzs7UIHk" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p><strong>Problem being solved:</strong> Many players learning the game have a hard time understanding how to build tactics and develop a gameplan. Many existing guides online teach players the technical aspects of the game, but fail to provide enough context of how certain moves work in gameplay. Fighting moves are usually taught in isolation and not relative to each other. This project aims to help players compare different moves to better understand them.</p>
<p><strong>Target audience:</strong> Beginners who have some familiarity of Tekken and have already chosen a character to specialize in.</p>
<p><strong>Key objective:</strong> To design a physical visual aid for players to use while learning Tekken. Players are equipped to learn one character and develop a better understanding on how to think about fighting games.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded">
<blockquote><p><strong>Based on RISC-V open hardware technology, the new processor is an important advance to achieve European technological sovereignty and reducing dependence on large multinational corporations</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BSC, Europe's leading developer of open source computing technologies, is committed to turning Barcelona into an innovation hub specialising in semiconductor design</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS) presented on Wednesday the new Sargantana chip, the third generation of open source processors designed entirely at the BSC. The development of Sargantana is a crucial step forward in reinforcing BSC's leading position in RISC-V open source computing technology research in Europe.</p>
<p>Sargantana (the name of the lizard in Aragonese and Catalan) is the third generation of the Lagarto processors, the first open source chips developed in Spain, in the framework of the DRAC project (Designing RISC-V-based Accelerators for next generation Computers), and is one of the most advanced open source chips in Europe at the academic level. The new Sargantana features better performance than its two predecessors - Lagarto Hun (2019) and DVINO (2021) - and is the first processor in the Lagarto family to break the gigahertz barrier in operating frequency.</p>
<p>The fact that the instruction set architecture (ISA) of these new processors is open source, and therefore non-proprietary and accessible to all, reduces technological dependence on large multinational corporations by enabling innovation through the collaboration of companies and institutions without the limitations of proprietary architectures. The RISC-V free hardware architecture, on which these new chips are based, could bring about a technological revolution in the hardware world like Linux did in the software world.</p>
<p>"The launch of Sargantana is a further step forward in the development of European RISC-V based technology, an embryo of the future European high-performance processor. This open hardware will be vital to ensure technological sovereignty and maintain European industrial competitiveness, and consolidates the BSC's role as a pioneer in Europe in the introduction of open source for chip design," said BSC director Mateo Valero.</p>
<p>In 2017, the European Union identified the lack of own hardware as one of the main vulnerabilities, due to the risk of industrial espionage posed by an over-reliance on chips designed and produced outside Europe, especially in the United States, Taiwan, China, Japan and South Korea. The BSC was then tasked by the EU to lead the scientific development of future European chips to provide the market with an open and local alternative, suitable for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, the automotive sector and the internet of things.</p>
<h2>Joint work coordinated by the BSC</h2>
<p>Researchers from other universities and research centres such as the Centro de Investigación en Computación del Instituto Politécnico Nacional de México (CIC-IPN), the Centro Nacional de Microelectrónica (CNM-CSIC), the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), the Universitat de Barcelona (UB) and the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) have participated in the development of Sargantana.</p>
<p>The project was coordinated by BSC researcher Miquel Moretó, who highlighted the advantages of open-source semiconductor design to enable collaboration between companies and academic institutions around the world. "The new Sargantana chip is freely available to all, enabling a new era of processor innovation through open collaboration in which anyone, anywhere can benefit from RISC-V technology," he said.</p>
<p>Moretó pointed out that Sargantana is an experimental chip, a research prototype that will allow us to test applications with RISC-V technology and deepen our knowledge, but it is not yet designed to be used in computers or other devices. "We are developing a technology that will allow Spain and Europe to design their own increasingly competitive processors in the future, in addition to training future professionals in a sector that will undoubtedly add great value to the production chain," added Moretó, who highlighted the joint efforts of Catalonia, Spain and Europe to have European technology made in Barcelona and to train engineers in this field.</p>
<h2>European leadership in RISC-V</h2>
<p>This objective is in line with the idea pointed out by Mateo Valero of making Barcelona an international benchmark in processor design. "We have the talent, the technological knowledge and the scientific environment necessary for Barcelona and its surroundings to be able to compete with any institution or region in the world and become a <i>Design Valley</i> that drives the creation of companies and new jobs", said Valero.</p>
<p>The Sargantana project has received funding from the Strategic Transformation Project for the semiconductor sector, known as PERTE Chip, the largest investment of all industrial transformation projects approved by the Spanish Government, as well as European funds from the ERDF Operational Programme of Catalonia 2014-2020, with the support of the Catalan Government.</p>
<p>The Sargantana presentation ceremony was held at the BSC facilities in Barcelona as part of the first day of the Spanish Open Hardware Alliance (SOHA), an association that brings together Spanish universities and research centres with the aim of promoting research in the area of Open Computer Technology and Architecture, thus contributing to the training of talent that allows the creation of high quality jobs.</p>

<h2 id="webgpu-is-back">WebGPU is back</h2><p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebGPU API</a>
gives developers a low level, high performance, cross architecture way to
program GPU hardware from JavaScript. It is the effective successor to WebGL on
the Web. The spec has been finalized and Chrome has already shipped the API.
Support is underway in Firefox and Safari.</p>
<p>Deno
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.8#experimental-support-for-the-webgpu-api" rel="noopener noreferrer">first introduced WebGPU back in early 2021</a>
but it was removed earlier this year due to performance problems. With this
release, we are happy to re-introduce it with all the performance issues worked
out.</p>
<p>GPUs have the ability to compute certain numerical operations with extreme
parallelism as compared to CPUs. This is useful for a variety of applications,
beyond just rendering and games. For example, machine learning algorithms can
often be expressed as a series of matrix operations, which can be computed
extremely efficiently on a GPU.</p>
<p>Our WebGPU implementation is based on the same underlying system as the upcoming
WebGPU implementation in Firefox, so we’re confident that it’s a solid
foundation for developers to build on.</p>
<p>A basic example of getting information about the GPU via WebGPU:</p>
<div><pre>
<span>const</span> adapter <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>gpu</span><span>.</span><span>requestAdapter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>"No adapter found"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>Further examples can be viewed over at our
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/webgpu-examples" rel="noopener noreferrer">webgpu-examples repository</a>.</p>
<p>Although the specification is stable, WebGPU is still considered unstable in
Deno. To access it in Deno use the <code>--unstable-webgpu</code> flag. We’re planning to
stabilize it soon, after we’ve had a chance to get more feedback from the
community and more time to verify the implementation against the
<a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/cts" rel="noopener noreferrer">specification test suite</a>.</p>
<p>For more webgpu functionalities, we’ve also added <a href="#stdwebgpu"><code>std/webgpu</code></a>
(more info below).</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu" rel="noopener noreferrer">wgpu</a> team for the help provided
to achieve this.</p>
<h2 id="new-deno-coverage-reporters">New <code>deno coverage</code> reporters</h2><p>In this release, <code>deno coverage</code> received two new reporters: <code>summary</code> and
<code>html</code>. You can now also omit the directory value for the <code>--coverage</code> flag in
<code>deno test</code>, as we now default to using <code>./coverage/</code> directory.</p>
<p>The <code>summary</code> reporter is the new default reporter. It outputs the coverage
summary in a concise table giving you information about coverage in particular
files and overall summary:</p>
<div><pre>$ deno coverage
----------------------------------
File         <span>|</span> Branch % <span>|</span> Line % <span>|</span>
----------------------------------
 bar.ts      <span>|</span>      <span>0.0</span> <span>|</span>   <span>57.1</span> <span>|</span>
 baz/quux.ts <span>|</span>      <span>0.0</span> <span>|</span>   <span>28.6</span> <span>|</span>
 baz/qux.ts  <span>|</span>    <span>100.0</span> <span>|</span>  <span>100.0</span> <span>|</span>

----------------------------------
 All files   <span>|</span>     <span>40.0</span> <span>|</span>   <span>61.0</span> <span>|</span>
----------------------------------</pre></div><p>The previously default reporter that prints uncovered lines in all files to the
terminal is still available using the <code>--detailed</code> flag.</p>
<p>You can also specify <code>--html</code> flag to get the detailed coverage report in HTML
format.</p>
<pre><code>$ deno test --coverage
$ deno coverage --html
HTML coverage report has been generated at file:///path/to/project/coverage/html/index.html</code></pre><p>The examples of the coverage report look like the below:</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/v1.39/html-coverage-index.png" alt="HTML Coverage Report Index" title=""></p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/v1.39/html-coverage-source.png" alt="HTML Coverage Report Source" title=""></p>
<p>The output of <code>deno coverage --html</code> is completely static and can be hosted on
any static file server, such as GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>We still support the <code>--lcov</code> flag, which outputs the coverage report in the
<a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">LCOV</a> format, which is useful for
integrating with other tools such as <a href="https://codecov.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecov</a> or
<a href="https://coveralls.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coveralls</a>.</p>
<p>We have further plans to improve <code>deno coverage</code> and make it more useful. If you
have feedback you’d like to share, please comment on
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/21325" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="updates-to-deno-compile">Updates to <code>deno compile</code></h2><p>Deno 1.39 introduces significant advancements in the <code>deno compile</code> feature:</p>
<p><strong>Better <code>node_modules</code> support</strong>: With the <code>--unstable-byonm</code> flag,
<code>deno compile</code> now supports “bring your own node_modules”, enhancing Node.js
compatibility. This feature allows you to use npm packages directly in your Deno
projects, bridging the gap between Deno and the extensive npm ecosystem. Learn
more about this feature in
<a href="https://deno.com/blog/v1.38#nodejs-compatibility-improvements" rel="noopener noreferrer">our previous blog post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Naming for Executables</strong>: Deno has removed restrictions on executable
naming. You can now name your compiled programs with leading digits, such as
<code>3d_modeler</code>, offering more flexibility in naming conventions.</p>
<p><strong>More Dynamic Import Support</strong>: More dynamic import patterns are now supported
in <code>deno compile</code>. This is interesting because Deno needs to statically include
all modules that may be imported at runtime in the binary produced by
<code>deno compile</code>. Because of this, dynamic imports can be problematic. Now, Deno
can handle more dynamic import patterns, such as:</p>
<div><pre><span>await</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>./dir/</span><span><span>${</span>expr<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>In this example, Deno will include all modules from <code>./dir/</code> and its
subdirectories into the compiled binary. This allows you to import any of these
files at runtime. This update simplifies dependency management by ensuring that
all modules referenced dynamically are available at runtime.</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-language-server">Enhanced Language Server</h2><p>In our ongoing commitment to improving the Deno Language Server (LSP), this
release introduces significant performance enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>Responsive Typing Experience</strong>: We’ve optimized the handling of rapid request
bursts during fast typing, ensuring a smoother and more responsive editing
experience in your IDE.</p>
<p><strong>Shutdown Timeout</strong>: To tackle the issue of lingering ‘zombie’ LSP instances,
we’ve implemented a shutdown-timeout mechanism. This feature forcefully
terminates LSP processes when you close your editor after a set timeout,
promoting efficient resource utilization.</p>
<p><strong>Update Notifications</strong>: The language server now actively informs you of the
latest Deno updates. This feature aims to simplify the process of keeping your
Deno installation current, ensuring you always have access to the latest
features and fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Diagnostics</strong>: We’ve introduced a new <code>deno.logFile</code> setting in
VSCode. When used alongside <code>deno.internalDebug</code>, this feature allows for the
capture of detailed diagnostic data, aiding in performance analysis and
troubleshooting.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to continuously enhancing the Deno LSP. Should you encounter
any performance issues with the LSP or within VSCode Deno, your feedback is
invaluable. Please let us know about your experience

<h2 id="nodejs-compatibility-improvements">Node.js compatibility improvements</h2><h3 id="sloppy-imports">Sloppy imports</h3><p>Migrating existing TypeScript codebases to Deno can be a daunting task. One of
the biggest hurdles is the fact that Deno requires you to explicitly specify
file extensions in the import statements.</p>
<p>Imagine a TypeScript project that had a file <code>foo.ts</code> that imported <code>bar.ts</code>:</p>
<div><pre>
<span>import</span> <span><span>{</span> <span>Example</span> <span>}</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>"./bar"</span><span>;</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>Example</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>Example</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Example"</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>In previous versions of Deno, this would error out with an unhelpful message:</p>
<div><pre>
$ deno run foo.ts
error: Module not found <span>"file:///dev/bar"</span>
  at file:///dev/foo.ts:1:25</pre></div><p>Now in Deno 1.39 this error message is improved and an escape hatch made
available:</p>
<div><pre>
$ deno run foo.ts
error: Module not found <span>"file:///dev/bar"</span><span>.</span> Maybe <span>add</span> a <span>'.ts'</span> extension or run with --unstable-sloppy-imports
    at file:///dev/foo.ts:1:25</pre></div><p>Running with the <code>--unstable-sloppy-imports</code> flag will execute the code without
any changes:</p>
<div><pre>
$ deno run --unstable-sloppy-imports foo.ts

<h3 id="support-running-node_modulesbin-executables-in-deno-task">Support running <code>node_modules/.bin/</code> executables in <code>deno task</code></h3><p><code>deno task</code> can run tasks defined in <code>deno.json</code>, as well as <code>scripts</code> defined
in <code>package.json</code>. This release adds support for running executables in
<code>node_modules/.bin/</code> directory in <code>deno task</code>.</p>
<p>If you have <code>package.json</code> that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span>{</span>
  <span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"dev"</span><span>:</span> <span>"vite dev"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre></div><p>You can run <code>vite dev</code> with <code>deno task</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ deno task dev</code></pre><p>Deno will look for <code>vite</code> executable in <code>node_modules/.bin/</code> directory and run
it using Deno - even if the <code>node_modules/.bin/vite</code> uses shebang defining
Node.js as an interpreter.</p>
<h3 id="commonjs-entrypoints-in-node_modules">CommonJS entrypoints in <code>node_modules</code></h3><p>Deno will now correctly handle CommonJS entrypoints in <code>node_modules</code>,
respecting the <code>type</code> setting from <code>package.json</code> for the relevant package. This
should greatly improve compatibility with packages that still haven’t migrated
to ESM.</p>
<h3 id="support-for-objectprototype__proto__">Support for <code>Object.prototype.__proto__</code></h3><p>Deno made a conscious decision to not support <code>Object.prototype.__proto__</code> for
security reasons. However there are still many packages on <code>npm</code> that rely on
this property to work correctly.</p>
<p>In this release we introduced a new <code>--unstable-unsafe-proto</code> flag that allows
you to enable this property. It is not recommended to use this flag, but if you
really need to use a package that relies on it, the escape hatch is now
available to you.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs-apis-updates">Node.js APIs updates</h3><p>Following Node.js APIs are now available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crypto.createPrivateKey</code></li>
<li><code>http.ClientRequest.setTimeout</code></li>

<li><code>perf_hooks.performance</code></li>
<li><code>process.geteuid</code></li>
<li><code>process.report</code></li>
<li><code>util.parseArgs</code></li>
<li><code>vm.runInNewContext</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally we fixed several bugs in already supported Node.js APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>child_process.spawnSync</code> handling of <code>status</code> was incorrect</li>
<li><code>child_process.spawnSync</code> properly normalizes <code>stdio</code></li>
<li><code>child_process</code> can handle IPC pipes on Unix systems (Windows support coming
soon)</li>
<li><code>crypto.sign</code> now works with PEM private keys</li>
<li><code>fs.existsSync</code> is now faster when file does not exist</li>
<li><code>process.exitCode</code> should change exit code of process</li>
<li>allow <code>null</code> value for <code>http.OutgoingMessage.setHeader</code></li>
<li>fix <code>Buffer.copy</code> when <code>sourceStart</code> &gt; <code>source.length</code></li>
<li>fix <code>os.freemem</code></li>
<li>fix <code>stream.Writable</code></li>
<li>handle closing <code>process.stdin</code> more than once</li>

            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 09:56:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thisisimportant.net/posts/screenshots-in-documentation/">https://thisisimportant.net/posts/screenshots-in-documentation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38639629">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>Screenshots in documentation can be a contentious topic — some people really like them and think they add a lot of value, while others dislike them due to the maintenance burden and accessibility issues.</p>
<p>As a technical writer, I avoid adding screenshots to documentation as often as possible. In my mind, an outdated screenshot is one of the fastest ways to lose customer trust, so if I’m not confident I can maintain the image, I don’t add it.</p>
<p>But that approach might be too rigid and avoidant. What are the advantages and disadvantages to adding screenshots to documentation?</p>
<h2 id="why-screenshots-are-bad">Why screenshots are bad</h2>
<p>Screenshots in documentation can have a lot of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outdated screenshots can cause customers to <strong>lose trust in documentation</strong> accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Pages load more slowly</strong> when they have a lot of screenshots compared to pages that only have text.</li>
<li>Screenshots can <strong>replace step-by-step instructions</strong>, losing an explanation of why you might perform a task and replacing it with an image of how or where.</li>
<li>Screenshots often have no or poor alt text, making them <strong>inaccessible to those with low or no vision</strong>.</li>
<li>Relying on screenshots can lead you to write <strong>documentation that only describes the UI</strong>, instead of what you can do with it or what the data visible in a dashboard means and where it comes from.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these are mostly implementation problems. It’s possible to have screenshots in documentation without these problems.</p>
<h2 id="why-screenshots-are-good">Why screenshots are good</h2>
<p>Screenshots and images in your documentation can serve some helpful functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it <strong>easier for readers to scan</strong> to a relevant part of the content.</li>
<li>Provide a <strong>visual frame of reference</strong> for people reading the documentation without using the product at the same time.</li>
<li>When used correctly, they can <strong>supplement confusing task steps</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, the Baymard Institute performed user research about SaaS products and found that <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/highlight-saas-ui">35% of SaaS Sites Fail to Make the Service’s UI Sufficiently Prominent to Prospects</a>, making it harder for potential customers to learn more about the product. The findings apply to a product’s entire website presence (beyond the product documentation), but it’s important to keep  in mind when deciding whether to add screenshots.</p>
<p>In light of those findings, it’s unfortunate that SaaS products typically update the UI constantly, making it especially hard to maintain accurate screenshots.</p>
<p>But these are some real advantages to providing screenshots in your documentation. So how do you add them while still avoiding the problems?</p>
<h2 id="identify-the-purpose-of-a-screenshot">Identify the purpose of a screenshot</h2>
<p>If you focus on the purpose of a screenshot in product documentation, you can identify a few situations where screenshots make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a confusing page clearer by adding context to it.</li>
<li>Give someone a sense of how a page might look when it has data in it.</li>
<li>Walk users through a task that traverses multiple different pages in the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other cases, a screenshot might function as filler and not provide much of a function while still being difficult to maintain. Don’t add screenshots in these cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every step in a task.</li>
<li>To provide visual interest without a reference in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also don’t want to provide screenshots to support text that describes every element on a specific page, because you don’t want to write documentation that only describes the user interface <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="make-screenshots-accessible">Make screenshots accessible</h2>
<p>Whenever you add a screenshot, make it accessible. Accessibility of images is relevant for lots of different people:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data analyst with low vision that keeps the documentation site zoomed in at 400%.</li>
<li>A sales engineer using a mobile hotspot to work at the airport.</li>
<li>A sysadmin visiting family in a rural area that just got woken up by an urgent page in the middle of the night.</li>
<li>An engineer using a localized version of your product in their own language.</li>
</ul>
<p>If critical content is only available by looking at an image, it isn’t accessible to any of those people. Therefore, make sure that a screenshot isn’t the only way to gather important information.</p>
<p>You can start improving image accessibility by writing useful alt text. Refer to Microsoft’s excellent guide, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/everything-you-need-to-know-to-write-effective-alt-text-df98f884-ca3d-456c-807b-1a1fa82f5dc2">Everything you need to know to write effective alt text</a>.</p>
<p>You also need to consider the file size of any image that you add to your documentation, because image size can affect page load. Compress your images using a tool like <a href="https://compressor.io/">compressor.io</a> (or <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/07/powerful-image-optimization-tools/">others compiled by Smashing Magazine</a>) before adding them to your documentation.</p>
<p>If you want, you can work with a translation service to localize images in your translated content as well, but you can also use other approaches to help make them accessible to folks who are reading your documentation other than the language your content is written in, such as by simplifying your screenshots.</p>
<h2 id="use-simplified-screenshots">Use simplified screenshots</h2>
<p>Being intentional about adding screenshots to your documentation helps reduce the maintenance burden because you have fewer screenshots to maintain. But if you use simplified screenshots, you can reduce the maintenance burden further.</p>
<p>A simplified screenshot is a screenshot modified to obscure or remove content irrelevant to the purpose of the screenshot. Anton Bollen introduces the idea in his excellent article, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simplified-graphics-meet-new-design-style-technical-anton-bollen/">Simplified graphics: Meet the new design style for technical communication</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, you might provide a screenshot with some content blurred out, to help readers focus only on the relevant portion of the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://thisisimportant.net/images/2023/12/modified-google-docs.png" alt="Simplified graphic of the Google Docs navigation menu, where I drafted this blog post, with the title and some menu items obscured with gray rectangles. The visible menu options are File, Edit, View, and Insert."></p>
<p>While they might take a bit longer to make, simplified screenshots don’t need to be updated as frequently because you can obscure parts of the UI that are irrelevant for your task, unavailable to users with specific roles or permissions, or that might otherwise be confusing.</p>
<p>With a simplified screenshot, it becomes outdated at the same time as your text content, so you can update them both at the same time—rather than your image becoming outdated sooner because some other part of the interface changed.</p>
<h2 id="automate-screenshots">Automate screenshots</h2>
<p>If you’re committed to providing screenshots and have a robust docs-as-code pipeline, you can also consider automating screenshot creation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Simon Willison wrote and released a tool called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper">shot-scraper</a> which you can use to automate taking screenshots of webpages (and by extension, web applications). I haven’t used it, but I can envision designing a screenshot pipeline that works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attach a hook to a UI component that you use in a screenshot.</li>
<li>If the code changes, prompt the tool to automatically take a screenshot in a demo environment.</li>
<li>Compress the resulting image.</li>
<li>Create a PR to add the new image to the documentation, replacing the old image.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, componentized UI code means that this could be pretty difficult to instrument on a large scale (the only scale at which this would be necessary), but depending on your code base and technical skills, this might be feasible for your documentation.</p>
<h2 id="intentionally-add-images-to-your-documentation">Intentionally add images to your documentation</h2>
<p>If you have a strategy and a process for adding and updating images in your documentation, you can avoid the pitfalls of screenshots in your docs and bask in the advantages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add screenshots to the documentation only when they’re relevant and useful.</li>
<li>Make screenshots accessible, so even if they aren’t there, the content is still useful.</li>
<li>Use simplified screenshots to ease the maintenance burden and increase the relevance.</li>
<li>Consider automating screenshots if you have the resources.</li>
</ul>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>In rare cases, you might be writing UI reference content, such as when documenting critical workflows for a process where the UI has just had a major update and buttons have moved around, or if you’re documenting software for users that have never used software before. But otherwise, if you find yourself writing content that describes the available buttons on the UI, you might want to consider your audience more fully.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>An unusual right-to-repair drama is disrupting railroad travel in Poland despite efforts by hackers who helped repair trains that allegedly were designed to stop functioning when serviced by anyone but Newag, the train manufacturer.</p>
<p>Members of an ethical hacking group called Dragon Sector, including Sergiusz Bazański and Michał Kowalczyk, were called upon by a train repair shop, Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych (SPS), to analyze train software in June 2022. SPS was desperate to figure out what was causing "mysterious failures" that shut down several vehicles owned by Polish train operator the Lower Silesian Railway, Polish infrastructure trade publication Rynek Kolejowy <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html">reported</a>. At that point, the shortage of trains had already become "a serious problem" for carriers and passengers, as fewer available cars meant shorter trains and reduced rider capacity, Rynek Kolejowy reported.</p>
<p>Dragon Sector spent two months analyzing the software, finding that "the manufacturer's interference" led to "forced failures and to the fact that the trains did not start," and concluding that bricking the trains "was a deliberate action on Newag's part."</p>
<p>According to Dragon Sector, Newag entered code into the control systems of Impuls trains to stop them from operating if a GPS tracker indicated that the train was parked for several days at an independent repair shop.</p>
<p>The trains "were given the logic that they would not move if they were parked in a specific location in Poland, and these locations were the service hall of SPS and the halls of other similar companies in the industry," Dragon Sector's team <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html">alleged</a>. "Even one of the SPS halls, which was still under construction, was included."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The code also allegedly bricked the train if "certain components had been replaced without a manufacturer-approved serial number," 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/polish-hackers-repaired-trains-the-manufacturer-artificially-bricked-now-the-train-company-is-threatening-them/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/newag-odpowiada-hakerom-i-sps-chce-wycofania-pojazdow-z-ruchu-116422.html">statement</a>, Newag denied developing any so-called "workshop-detection" software that caused "intentional failures" and threatened to sue Dragon Sector for slander and for violating hacking laws.</p>
<p>“Hacking IT systems is a violation of many legal provisions and a threat to railway traffic safety,” Newag said, insisting that the hacked trains be removed from use because they now pose alleged safety risks. Newag's safety claims are still unsubstantiated, 404 Media reported.</p>
<p>"We categorically deny and negate Newag's uploading of any functionality in vehicle control systems that limits or prevents the proper operation of vehicles, as well as limiting the group of entities that can provide maintenance or repair services," Newag's statement said. According to Newag, Dragon Sector's report shouldn't be trusted because it was commissioned by one of Newag's biggest competitors.</p>
<p>Dragon Sector maintains that the evidence supports its conclusions. Bazański <a href="https://social.hackerspace.pl/@q3k/111528162462505087?ref=404media.co">posted</a> on Mastodon that “these trains were locking up for arbitrary reasons after being serviced at third-party workshops. The manufacturer argued that this was because of malpractice by these workshops, and that they should be serviced by them instead of third parties." In some cases, Bazański wrote, Newag "appeared to be able to lock the train remotely.”</p>
<p>Newag has said that "any remote intervention" is "virtually impossible."</p>
<h2>Lawsuit threats fails to silence hackers</h2>
<p>Dragon Sector got the trains running after discovering "an undocumented ‘unlock code’ which you could enter from the train driver’s panel which magically fixed the issue," Dragon Sector's team told 404 Media.</p>
<p>Newag has maintained that it has never and will never "introduce into the software of our trains any solutions that lead to intentional failures."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"We do not know who interfered with the train control software, using what methods and what qualifications," Newag said. "We also notified the Office of Rail Transport about this so that it could decide to withdraw from service the sets subjected to the activities of unknown hackers."</p>
<p>Dragon Sector and SPS have denied interfering with the train's control systems.</p>
<p>While Newag has contacted authorities to investigate the hacking, Janusz Cieszyński, Poland’s former minister of digital affairs, <a href="https://twitter.com/jciesz/status/1732411016221524070?s=20">posted on X</a> that the evidence appears to weigh against Newag.</p>
<p>"The president of Newag contacted me," Cieszyński wrote. "He claims that Newag fell victim to cybercriminals and it was not an intentional action by the company. The analysis I saw indicated something else, but for the sake of clarity, I will write about everything.</p>
<p>Newag president Zbigniew Konieczek <a href="https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/afera-hakerska--mamy-stanowiska-sps-i-newag--116410.html">said</a> that "no evidence was provided that our company intentionally installed the faulty software. In our opinion, the truth may be completely different—that, for example, the competition interfered with the software."</p>
<p>Konieczek also accused Cieszyński of disseminating "false and highly harmful information about Newag."</p>
<p>404 Media noted that Newag appeared to be following a common playbook in the right-to-repair world where manufacturers intimidate competitor repair shops with threatened lawsuits and unsubstantiated claims about safety risks of third-party repairs. So far, Dragon Sector does not appear intimidated, posting its success <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6vjhkLQpM">on YouTube</a> and discussing its findings at Poland’s Oh My H@ck conference in Warsaw. The group is also planning "a more detailed presentation" for the 37th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany, at the end of December, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/polish_trains_geofenced_allegation/">The Register reported</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the evidence gathered during their analysis, the Dragon Sector team has doubts about whether Newag will actually follow through with the lawsuit.</p>
<p>"Their defense line is really poor, and they would have no chance defending it," Kowalczk told 404 Media. "They probably just want to sound scary in the media.”</p>

<p>Our third film is from 1995, directed by Iain Softley.</p>



<p><em>Hackers</em> is about a group of teenage computer hackers, of the ethical / playful type who are driven by curiosity and cause no harm — well, not to anyone who doesn’t deserve it. One of these hackers breaks into the “Gibson” computer system of a high profile company and partially downloads what he thinks is an unimportant file as proof of his success. However this file is actually a disguised worm program, created by the company’s own chief of computer security to defraud the company of millions of dollars. The security chief tries to frame the hackers for various computer crimes to cover his tracks, so the hackers must break back into the system to download the full worm program and reveal the true culprit.</p>



<p>The film was made in the time before Facebook when it was common to have an online identity, or at least an online handle (nick), distinct from the real world. Our teenage hacker protagonists are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Crash Override, real name Dade.</li>



<li>Acid Burn, real name Kate.</li>



<li>Cereal Killer, Lord Nikon, and Phantom Phreak, real names not given.</li>



<li>Joey, the most junior, who doesn’t have a handle yet.</li>
</ul>



<p>As hackers they don’t have a corporate budget, so use a variety of personal computers rather than the expensive SGI workstations we saw in the previous films. And since it’s the 1990s, their network connections are made with modems over the analog phone system and important files will fit on 1.44 megabyte floppy disks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Gibson, though, is described as “big iron”, a corporate supercomputer. Again this was the 1990s when a supercomputer would be a single very big and very expensive computer, not thousands of PC CPUs and GPUs jammed into racks as in the early 21st C. A befitting such an advanced piece of technology it has a three dimensional file browsing interface which is on display both times the Gibson is hacked.</p>



<h2>First run</h2>



<p>The first hack starts at about 24 minutes. Junior hacker Joey&nbsp; has been challenged by his friends to break into something important such as a Gibson. The scene starts with Joey sitting in front of his Macintosh personal computer and reviewing a list of what appear to be logon or network names and phone numbers. The camera flies through a stylised cyberspace representation of the computer network, the city streets, then the physical rooms of the target company (which we will learn is Ellingson Minerals), and finally past a computer operator sitting at a desk in the server room and into the 3D file system. This single “shot” actually switches a few times between the digital and real worlds, a stylistic choice repeated throughout the film. Although never named in the film this file system is the “City of Text” according to the closing credits.</p>

<p>The file system is represented as a virtual cityscape of skyscraper-like blocks. The ground plane looks like a printed circuit board with purple traces (lines). The towers are simple box shapes, all the same size, as if constructed from blue tinted glass or acrylic plastic. Each of the four sides and the top shows a column of text in white lettering, apparently the names of directories or files. Because the tower sides are transparent the reverse facing text on the far sides is also visible, cluttering the display.</p>



<p>This 3D file system is the most dynamic of those in this review. Joey flies among the towers rather than walking, with exaggerated banking and tilting as he turns and dives. At ground level we can see some simple line graphics at the left as well as text.</p>

<p>The city of text is even busier due to animation effects. Highlight bars move up and down the text lists on some panes. Occasionally a list is cleared and redrawn top to bottom, while others cycle between two sets of text. White pulses flow along the purple ground lanes and fly between the towers. These animations do not seem to be interface elements. They could be an indicator of overall activity with more pulses per second meaning more data being accessed, like the blinking LED on your Ethernet port or disk drive. Or they could be a screensaver, as it was important on the CRT displays of the 1990s to not display a static image for long periods as it would “burn in” and become permanent.</p>



<p>Next there is a very important camera move, at least for analysing the user interface. So far the presentation has been fullscreen and obviously artificial. Now the camera pulls back slightly to show that this City of Text is what Joey is seeing on the screen of his Macintosh computer. Other shots later in the film will make it clear that this is truly interactive, he is the one controlling the viewpoint.</p>

<p>I’ll discuss how this might work later in the analysis section. For now it’s enough to remember that this is a true file browser, the 3D equivalent of the Macintosh Finder or Windows File Explorer.</p>



<p>While Joey is exploring, we cut to the company server room. This unusual activity has triggered an alarm so the computer operator telephones the company security chief at home. At this stage we don’t know that he’s evil, but he does demand to be addressed by his hacker handle “The Plague” which doesn’t inspire confidence. (The alarm itself shows that a superuser / root / administrator account is in use by displaying the <em>password</em> for everyone to see on a giant screen. But we’re not going to talk about that.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joey wants to prove he has hacked the Gibson by downloading a file, but by the ethics of the group it shouldn’t be something valuable. He selects what he thinks will be harmless, the garbage or trash directory on a particular tower. It’s not very clear but there is another column of text to the right which is dimmed out.</p>

<p>There’s a triangle to the right of the GARBAGE label indicating that it is a directory, and when selected a second column of text shows the files within it. When Joey selects one of these the system displays what today would be called a Live Tile in Windows, or File Preview in the Mac Finder. But in this advanced system it’s an elaborate animation of graphics and mathematical notation.</p>



<p>Joey decides this is the file he wants and starts a download. Since he’s dialled in through an old analog phone modem, this is a slow process and will eventually be interrupted when Joey’s mother switches his Macintosh off to force him to get some sleep.</p>

<h2>Physical View</h2>



<p>Back in the server room of Ellingson Minerals and while Joey is still searching, the security chief AKA “The Plague” arrives. And here we clearly see that there is also a <strong>physical 3D representation</strong> of the file system.</p>

<p>Just like the virtual display it is made up of rectangular towers made of blue tinted glass or plastic, arranged on a grid pattern like city skyscrapers. Each is about 3 metres high and about 50cm wide and deep. Again matching the virtual display, there is white text on all the visible sides, being updated and highlighted. However there is one noticeable difference, the bottom of each tower is solid black.</p>



<p>What are the towers for? Hackers is from 1995, when hard drives and networked file servers were shoebox- to pizza-box-sized, so one or two would fit into the base of each tower. The physical displays could be just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights"><strong>blinkenlights</strong></a>, an impressive but not particularly useful visual display, but in a later shot there’s a technician in the background looking at one of the towers and making notes on a pad, so they are intended to show something useful. My assumption is that each tower displays information about the actual files being stored inside, mirroring the virtual city of text shown online.</p>



<p>When he reaches the operator’s desk, The Plague switches the big wall display to the same 3D virtual file system.</p>

<p>He uses an “echo terminal” command to see exactly what Joey is doing, so sees the same garbage directory and that the file is being copied. We’ll later learn that this seemingly harmless file is actually the worm program created by The Plague, and that discovering it had been copied was a severe shock. Here he arranges for the phone connection to be traced and Joey questioned by his government friends in the US Secret Service (which at the time was responsible for investigating some computer security incidents and crimes), setting in motion the main plot elements.</p>

<h2>Second run</h2>



<p>After various twists and turns our teenage hackers are resolved to hack into the Gibson again to obtain a full copy of the worm program which will prove their innocence. But they also know that The Plague knows they know about the worm, Ellingson Minerals is alerted, and the US Secret Service are watching them. This second hacking run starts at about 1 hour 20 minutes.</p>



<p>The first step is to evade the secret service agents by a combination of rollerblading and hacking the traffic lights. (Scenes like this are why I enjoy the film so much.) Four of our laptop-wielding hackers dial in through public phone booths. The plan is that Crash will look for the file while Acid, Nikon, and Joey will distract the security systems, and they are expecting additional hacker help from around the world.</p>



<p>We see a repeat of the earlier shot flying through the streets and building into the City of Text, although this time on Crash’s Macintosh Powerbook.</p>

<p>It seems busier with many more pulses travelling back and forth between towers, presumably because this is during a workday.</p>



<p>The other three start launching malware attacks on the Gibson. Since the hacking attempt has been anticipated, The Plague is in the building and arrives almost immediately.</p>

<p>The physical tower display now shows a couple of blocks with red sides. This could indicate the presence of malware, or just that those sections of the file system are imposing a heavy CPU or IO load due to the malware attacks.</p>



<p>This time The Plague is assisted by a full team of technicians. He primarily uses a “System Command Shell” within a larger display that presumably shows processor and memory usage. It’s not the file system, but has a similar design style and is too cool not to show:</p>

<p>What’s happening here? Most likely Crash has typed in a search wildcard string and the file browser is showing the matching files and folders.</p>



<p>Why are there multiple garbage directories? Our desktop GUIs always show a single trashcan, but under the hood there is more than one. A multiuser system needs at least one per user, because otherwise files deleted by Very Important People working with Very Sensitive Information would be visible, or at least the file names visible, to everyone else. Portable storage devices, floppy disks in Hackers and USB drives today, need their own trashcan because the user might still expect to be able to undelete files even if it has been moved to another computer. For the same reason a networked drive needs its own trashcan that isn’t stored on the connecting computer. So Crash really does have to search for the right garbage directory in this giant system.</p>



<p>As hackers from around the world join in, the malware effects intensify. More tower faces, both physical and digital, are red. The entire color palette of the City of Text becomes darker.</p>

<p>This could be an automatic effect when the Gibson system performance drops below some threshold, or activated by the security team as the digital equivalent of traffic cones around a door. Anyone familiar with the normal appearance of the City of Text can see at a glance that something is wrong and, presumably, that they should log out or at least not try to do anything important.</p>



<p>Crash finds the right file and starts downloading, but The Plague hasn’t been fully distracted and uses his System Command Shell to disconnect Crash’s laptop entirely. Rather than log back in, Crash tells Joey to download the worm and gives him the full path to the correct garbage directory, which for the curious is root/.workspace/.garbage (the periods are significant, meaning these names should not normally be displayed to non-technical users).</p>



<p>We don’t see how Joey enters this into the file browser but there is no reason it should be difficult. Macintosh Finder windows have a clickable text search box, and both the Ubuntu Desktop Shell and Microsoft Windows start screen will automatically start searching for files and folders that match any typed text.</p>



<p>Joey downloads the worm, this time all of it. The combined malware attacks crash The Gibson. Unfortunately the secret service agents arrive just in time to arrest them, but all ends well with The Plague being exposed and arrested and our hacker protagonists released.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>



<h3>How believable is the interface?</h3>



<p>The City of Text has two key differences from the other 3D file browsers we’ve seen so far.</p>



<ol>
<li>&nbsp;It must operate over a network connection, specifically over a phone modem connection, which in the 1990s would be much slower than any Ethernet LAN.</li>



<li>This 3D view is being rendered on personal computers, not specialised 3D workstations.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>Despite these constraints, the City of Text remains reasonably plausible.</p>



<p>Would the City of Text require more bandwidth than was available? What effect would we expect from a slow network connection? It’s a problem when <em>copying</em> files, upload or download, but much less so for <em>browsing</em> a file system. The information being passed from the Gibson to the 3D file browser is just a list of names in each directory and a minimal set of attributes for each, not the file contents. In 1995 2D file browsers on personal computers were already showing icons, small raster images, for each file which took up more memory than the file names. The City of Text doesn’t, so the file data would certainly fit in the bandwidth available.</p>



<p>The flying viewpoint doesn’t require much bandwidth either. There is no avatar or other representation of the user, just an abstract viewpoint. Only 9 numbers are needed to describe where you are and what you’re looking at in 3D space, and predictive techniques developed for games and simulations can reduce the network bandwidth required even more.</p>



<p>Networked file systems and file browsers already existed in 1995, for example FTP and Gopher, although with pure text interfaces rather than 3D or even 2D graphics. The only missing component would be the 3D viewpoint coordinates.</p>



<p>PCs in the 1990s, especially laptops, rarely had any kind of 3D graphics acceleration and would not have been able to run the Jurassic Park or Disclosure 3D file browsers. The City of Text, though, is much less technically demanding even though it displays many more file and folder names.</p>



<p>Notice that there is no hidden surface removal, where the front sides of a 3D object hide those that are further away. There’s no lighting, with everything rendered in flat colors that don’t depend on the direction of the sun or other light sources, and no shadows. There are no images or textures, just straight lines and plain text. And finally everything is laid out on an axis-aligned grid; meaning all the graphics are straight up/down, left/right, or forwards/back; and all the towers and text are the same size. Similar shortcuts were used in 1990s PC games and demo scene animations, such as the original Doom in which players could look from side to side but not up or down.</p>



<p>I’m not saying that the City of Text on a 1990s PC or laptop would be <em>easy</em>, especially on Joey’s Macintosh LC, but it is plausible.</p>



<p>Alas the worm animation shown when that particular file is selected is <em>not</em> possible. We see fractal graphics and mathematical notation in 3D, and it’s a full screen image rather than a simple file icon. Whether it’s a pre-rendered animation or being generated on the fly there’s way too much to push through a modem connection, even though at the time “full screen” meant a lot less pixels than now in the 21st C.</p>



<p>The physical towers were also not possible. Three metre high flat screen displays didn’t exist in 1995, and I don’t see how that many projectors could be installed in the ceiling without interfering with each other.</p>



<h3>How well does the interface inform the narrative of the story?</h3>



<p><em>Hackers</em> is a film all about computers and the people who work with them, and therefore must solve the problem (which still exists today) of making what is happening visible and understandable to a non-technical audience. Director Iain Softley said he wanted a metaphorical representation of how the characters perceived the digital world, not a realistic one. Some scenes use stylised 2D graphics and compositing to create a psychedelic look, while the 3D file browser is meant to be a virtual equivalent to the physical city of New York where Hackers is set. At least for some viewers, myself included, it works.</p>



<p>The worm animation also works well. Joey is looking for an interesting file, a trophy, and the animation makes it clear that this is indeed an extraordinary file without needing to show the code.</p>



<p>The physical towers, though, are rather silly. The City of Text is meant to be metaphorical, a mental landscape created by hackers, so we don’t need a physical version.</p>



<h3>How well does the interface equip the character to achieve their goals?</h3>



<p>The City of Text is very well suited to the character goals, because they are exploring the digital world. Looking cool and having fun are what’s important, not being efficient.</p>



<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a rollerblading lesson before the next review…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows AI Studio Preview</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://aka.ms/WindowsAI-Studio" rel="nofollow">Windows AI Studio</a> simplifies generative AI app development by bringing together cutting-edge AI development tools and models from Azure AI Studio Catalog and other catalogs like Hugging Face. You will be able browse the AI models catalog powered by Azure ML and Hugging Face, download them locally, fine-tune, test and use them in your Windows application.
As all of the computation happens locally, please make sure your device can handle the load.
In the future, we plan to integrate ORT/DML into the Windows AI Studio workflow so developers can run AI models on any Windows Hardware.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick Start</h2>
<p dir="auto">In this section you will learn how to quickly start with Windows AI Studio.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h3>
<p dir="auto">Windows AI Studio will run only on NVIDIA GPUs for the preview, so please make sure to check your device spec prior to installing it.
WSL Ubuntu distro 18.4 or greater should be installed and is set to default prior to using Windows AI Studio. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" rel="nofollow">Learn more how to install Windows subsystem for Linux</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed" rel="nofollow">changing default distribution</a>.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Model Fine-tuning</h3>
<p dir="auto">To initiate the local fine-tuning session using QLoRA, select a model you want to fine-tune from our catalog powered by AzureML.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Note</strong></em> You do not need an Azure Account to download the models</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Start by selecting a project name and location.
Next, select a model from the model catalog. You will be prompted to download the project template. You can then click "Configure Project" to adjust various settings.
We use <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/Olive/overview/olive.html" rel="nofollow">Olive</a> to run QLoRA fine-tuning on a PyTorch model from our catalog. All of the settings are preset with the default values to optimize to run the fine-tuning process locally with optimized use of memory, but it can be adjusted for your scenario.</p>

<p>A former Facebook diversity program manager pleaded guilty to scamming the social media giant out of more than $4 million through a scheme in which she faked business deals in exchange for kickbacks, the Justice Department said.</p>



<p>Barbara Furlow-Smiles, who served as lead strategist and global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at Facebook, used the stolen funds to live an extravagant lifestyle that spanned from California to Georgia, prosecutors said.</p>



<p>From approximately January 2017 to September 2021, Furlow-Smiles led Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs at Facebook and was responsible for developing and executing DEI initiatives, operations, and engagement programs,” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/former-global-diversity-executive-facebook-pleads-guilty-defrauding-company-out-more-4?te=1&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;emc=edit_dk_20231213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the DOJ</a>.</p>



<p>The feds said Furlow-Smiles, who had access to company credit cards and the ability to approve invoices as part of her role at the company, “caused Facebook to pay numerous individuals,” including her friends and relatives, “for goods and services never provided to the company.” </p>



<p>Those individuals would later funnel kickbacks to Furlow-Smiles. </p>

<p>Those allegedly recruited to participate in the kickback&nbsp;scheme included some of Furlow-Smiles’ former interns, her “university tutor,” a hair stylist, babysitters and nannies, the feds said. </p>



<p>It’s unclear if any of Furlow-Smiles’ associates are being charged in connection to the case. </p>



<p>The Post has reached out to the DOJ for further comment.</p>



<p>She also misled Facebook into sending money to entities that did not provide kickbacks, including nearly $10,000 to an artist who created specialty portraits and more than $18,000 to a unnamed preschool.</p>

<p>To avoid scrutiny, Furlow-Smiles would submit fake expense reports claiming that the individuals were vendors at Facebook events who had helped with marketing or provided merchandise.</p>



<p>Furlow-Smiles “abused a position of a trust as a global diversity executive for Facebook to defraud the company of millions of dollars, ignoring the insidious consequences of undermining the importance of her DEI mission,” US Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan said in a statement after she pleaded guilty in a Georgia court Tuesday.</p>



<p>“Motivated by greed, she used her time to orchestrate an elaborate criminal scheme in which fraudulent vendors paid her kickbacks in cash,” Buchanan added. “She even involved relatives, friends, and other associates in her crimes, all to fund a lavish lifestyle through fraud rather than hard and honest work.”</p>



<p>FBI Special Agent Keri Farley said, “Furlow-Smiles used lies and deceit to defraud both vendors and Facebook employees.”</p>

<p>The DOJ noted that Meta had “provided valuable assistance and cooperation during the investigation.”</p>



<p>“We are cooperating with law enforcement on the case regarding this former program manager, and we will continue to do so,” Meta said in a statement.</p>



<p>The DOJ said Furlow-Smiles ran a two-pronged scheme to defraud Facebook. She would pay associates using apps like Venmo and PayPal that were linked to her company credit cards and submit fake expense reports related to those transactions.</p>

<p>The associates – most of whom were reportedly unaware that the funds was coming from Facebook – would return the money to Furlow-Smiles in cash or via account transfer. The feds’ release noted that the cash was sometimes delivered to Furlow-Smiles wrapped up in T-shirts or other items.</p>



<p>For the second part of her scheme, Furlow-Smiles steered Facebook toward using businesses owned by her friends. </p>







<p>Once Facebook had signed off on the deals, she would purportedly approve “fraudulent and inflated invoices” on behalf of the vendors in exchange for kickbacks.</p>



<p>Furlow-Smiles is slated to be sentenced on March 19, 2024.</p>

In this context, they may be involved in near-death experiences reported by people who have survived cardiorespiratory arrest.”</p><p>After that, the activity of the neurons gradually diminishes until a state of perfect electrical silence— corresponding to a flat electroencephalogram—is reached. However, this silence is quickly interrupted by the depolarization of neurons, which takes the form of a high-amplitude wave known as the “wave of death”, which alters the function and structure of the brain.</p><p>“This critical event, called anoxic depolarization, induces neuronal death throughout the cortex. Like a swan song, it is the true marker of transition towards the cessation of all brain activity”,&nbsp;Antoine Carton-Leclercq, PhD student and first author of the study, adds.</p><p>Until now, researchers did not know where the wave of death is initiated in the cortex or whether it propagates homogeneously across all cortical layers.</p><p>“We already knew that it is possible to reverse the effects of anoxic depolarization if we manage to resuscitate the subject within a specific time window,” the researcher adds.</p><p> “We still had to understand in which areas of the brain the death wave is likely to do the most damage to preserve brain function as much as possible.”</p><p><strong>Following the path of the wave of death</strong></p><p>To answer these questions, the researchers used, in rats, measurements of local field potentials and recordings of the electrical activity of individual neurons in different layers of the primary somatosensory cortex—an area that plays a crucial role in body representation and processing of sensory information.</p><p>They then compared the electrical activity of these different layers before and during anoxic depolarization.</p><p>“We noticed that neuronal activity was relatively homogeneous at the onset of brain anoxia. Then, the wave of death appeared in the pyramidal neurons located in layer 5 of the neocortex and propagated in two directions: upwards, i.e. the surface of the brain, and downwards, i.e. the white matter,” Séverine Mahon explains.</p><p>“We have observed this same dynamic under different experimental conditions and believe it could exist in humans.”</p><p>These findings also suggest that the deeper layers of the cortex are the most vulnerable to oxygen deprivation—probably because the pyramidal neurons in layer 5 have exceptionally high energy needs. However, when the researchers reoxygenated the rats’ brains, the cells replenished their ATP reserves, leading to the repolarization of neurons and the restoration of synaptic activity.</p><p>“This new study advances our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying changes in brain activity as death approaches. It is now established that, from a physiological point of view, death is a process that takes its time… and that it is currently impossible to dissociate it rigorously from life.</p><p>“We also know that a flat EEG does not necessarily mean the definitive cessation of brain functions,”&nbsp;Prof. Stéphane Charpier, head of the research team, concludes.</p><p> “We now need to establish the exact conditions under which these functions can be restored and develop neuroprotective drugs to support resuscitation in the event of heart and lung failure.”</p><h2>About this neuroscience and death research news</h2><p><strong>Author: </strong><a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5a8a4b7aca0ebb6aca8aaab85aca6a8e8acabb6b1acb1b0b1a0ebaab7a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marie Simon</a><br><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://icm-institute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paris Brain Institute</a><br><strong>Contact: </strong>Marie Simon – Paris Brain Institute<br><strong>Image: </strong>The image is credited to Neuroscience News</p><p><strong>Original Research: </strong>Open access.<br>“<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0969996123003613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laminar organization of neocortical activities during systemic anoxia</a>” by Séverine Mahon et al. <em>Neurobiology of Disease</em></p><hr><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><strong>Laminar organization of neocortical activities during systemic anoxia</strong></p><p>The neocortex is highly susceptible to metabolic dysfunction. When exposed to global&nbsp;ischemia&nbsp;or anoxia, it suffers a slowly propagating wave of collective&nbsp;neuronal depolarization&nbsp;that ultimately impairs its structure and function. While the molecular signature of anoxic depolarization (AD) is well documented, little is known about the brain states that precede and follow AD onset.</p><p>Here, by means of multisite extracellular&nbsp;local field potentials&nbsp;and intracellular recordings from identified&nbsp;pyramidal cells, we investigated the laminar expression of cortical activities induced by transient anoxia in rat primary&nbsp;somatosensory cortex.</p><p>Soon after the interruption of brain oxygenation, we observed a well-organized sequence of stereotyped activity patterns across all&nbsp;cortical layers. This sequence included an initial period of beta-gamma activity, rapidly replaced by delta-theta oscillations followed by a decline in all spontaneous activites, marking the entry into a sustained period of electrical silence.</p><p>Intracellular recordings revealed that cortical pyramidal neurons were depolarized and highly active during high-frequency activity, became inactive and devoid of&nbsp;synaptic potentials&nbsp;during the isoelectric state, and showed subthreshold composite synaptic depolarizations during the low-frequency period.</p><p>Contrasting with the strong temporal coherence of pre-AD activities along the vertical axis of the&nbsp;cortical column, the onset of AD was not uniform across layers. AD initially occurred in layer 5 or 6 and then propagated bidirectionally in the upward and downward direction. Conversely, the post-anoxic waves that indicated the&nbsp;repolarization&nbsp;of cortical neurons upon brain reoxygenation did not exhibit a specific spatio-temporal profile.</p><p>Pyramidal neurons from AD initiation site had a more depolarized&nbsp;resting potential&nbsp;and higher spontaneous firing rate compared to superficial cortical cells. We also found that the propagation pattern of AD was reliably reproduced by focal injection of an inhibitor of sodium‑potassium ATPases, suggesting that cortical AD dynamics could reflect layer-dependent variations in cellular&nbsp;metabolic regulations.</p> <!-- Form created by Optin Forms plugin by WPKube: create beautiful optin forms with ease! --> <!-- https://wpkube.com/ --><!--optinforms-form5-container--> <!-- / Optin Forms --> </div><!-- .entry-content --><!-- .entry-footer --></article><!-- #post-x --></main><!-- .site-main --></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4 translated="">Discover more from Everything Is An Emergency</h4><p>I'm Bess Stillman: an ER doctor, writer, and wife to Jake Seliger, who is currently dying of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Here you'll find essays about life, death, cancer, love, health and healthcare. </p><p>Over 1,000 subscribers</p> </div><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Jake shows me a photograph from 2015</strong><span>: we’re smiling in the dim light of Back 40, an East Village restaurant. The weather is humid and my hair is explosively curly, a wild tendril dipping into the glass of green chartreuse Jake is raising towards the camera, while his other arm extends to take the selfie. We look like two happy people who aren’t good at holding their liquor (we’re not: it was only our second drink and we were tipsy); people who’re blissfully ignorant that their lives </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/22/i-am-dying-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-and-the-treatments-that-might-save-me-are-just-out-of-reach/" rel="">will be destroyed in 2022</a><span>.</span></p><p>Jake’s the documentarian of our lives: he has hard drives with gigabytes of photographs spanning our 15 years together. I have a terrible memory yet rarely compensate by shooting the picture or pressing record or keeping a journal. Memory is my limitation, so I forget to adapt. Swaths of my own past are lit, if at all, by a perpetual twilight. Then Jake sends me a photo and reminds me of its origin—“this was the dinner when you refused to sit facing the stuffed boar’s head on the wall because it watched you while you ate his friend”—and the past is suddenly illuminated; I am suddenly illuminated, and the reminder feels like physical relief, like finding a word I’ve struggled to recall then it appears fully formed in my mind.</p><p><span>When </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/24/what-its-like-to-be-married-to-a-dying-man/" rel="">Jake’s cancer recurred</a><span> two months after </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/09/09/life-swallowing-tasting-and-speaking-after-a-total-glossectomy-meaning-i-have-no-tongue/" rel="">the May 25 salvage surgery</a><span> that was supposed to save his life, I became obsessed with making videos of us, which I’d be able to watch after he’s gone. Most days in early August, Jake sat on the left side of the living room couch, recovering from chemo, with “Liquid Hope™”</span><a href="#_ftn1" rel="">[1]</a><span> infusing into his PEG tube, while friends, family and I gathered around him. I’d lean my cell phone against the bookshelf opposite his seat and pressed record, letting it run for hours, hoping to document meaningful looks between us, comforting words, “I love yous” exchanged. I was anxious to achieve the impossible task of capturing the essence of our life together. The videos would be an insurance policy against future loneliness and grief, and an insurance policy against forgetting.</span></p><p><span>I’ve talked to friends who’ve lost a spouse, sometimes to death and sometimes to savage divorce, and they universally say that one of the unexpectedly hardest things is not being able to ask: Remember that one place? Or that time? Remember when I…? </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/23/seeing-as-a-doctor-seeing-as-a-wife/" rel="">I’ve written that</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>When Jake looks at me, he sees me at 25, showing up to our first date in a grey mini-dress, black boots and red lipstick. He sees me at 29 in a striped bra and panty set in our 35th story Seattle hotel room, pressing me against the cold glass. And he also sees me as I am now. I’m all these ages at once, as he is to me. Love isn’t just blind to ugliness, but to decay. Look at two 80-year-olds gazing at each other like teenagers and you’ll know what I mean. </p><p><span>When I lose Jake, I’ll lose someone ever seeing me throughout all my ages again. I’ve said that&nbsp;</span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/24/what-its-like-to-be-married-to-a-dying-man/" rel="">parts of me will die with him</a><span>, and I don’t just mean parts of my heart and the parts of my personality that act in relation to his. I mean entire eras of my life, all the views he was privy to, and therefore, much of my youth, goes as well. No one—even if I find love again one day, as Jake has urged me to do—will ever look at me at see me at 32, skinny dipping on a trip to Gunnison nude beach in New Jersey with a group of friends, laughing at how cold the water is under the sun of a hot summer day.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>&nbsp;I forget so easily, and we’ve spent so long existing in relation to each one another that, just as we made the memories together, we need to remember them together to recall them fully. At least, I do. Jake’s memories of me are also proof of my continuity, like Bitcoin is proof of work. I’m reminded of the concept of “continuers” or “dividers,” which </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/are-you-the-same-person-you-used-to-be-life-is-hard-the-origins-of-you" rel="">Joshua Rothman wrote about</a><span> in the </span><em>New Yorker</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Does the self you remember feel like you, or like a stranger? Do you seem to be remembering yesterday, or reading a novel about a fictional character? If you have the former feelings, you’re probably a continuer; if the latter, you’re probably a divider.</p></blockquote><p>Since Jake’s May 25 surgery and diagnosis of recurrence and metastases on July 21, there has been a distinct sense of division between the person I was before I had a dying husband and the person I am now. Before, I had a more fluid, tenuous sense of chronoception: I’d think something that happened 5 years ago happened 3 months ago, or that 20 minutes had passed when three hours had. Today, the life we lived before Jake’s terminal diagnoses feels distant and surreal, like it belongs to another time—like it was lived by other people.</p><p><span>I try to be gentle when I think about that past me who left all those years unrecorded, but it’s hard not to get upset with the losses, like the hundreds of hours Jake spent reading to me from </span><em>Lord of the Rings</em><span> and Elmore Leonard before bed, the way his hands look when he chops vegetables, the excited way he’d point out electric bicycles, the gentle lift to his old voice when he’s teasing me, that smirk. Rationally, I know it’s unreasonable to have expected that I’d document our entire lives in preparation for later review, in the event of Jake’s premature death. That kind of behavior earns you a visit to a mental healthcare professional and some high dose prescription anxiolytics, not a gold star for foresight. Still, that’s tens of thousands of hours of my life left to memory. Which, for me, means much of it has been left behind.</span></p><p><span>Knowing that I’ll at least get Jake’s digital photographic archive, I’ve tried to focus on remembering things that can’t be captured on video, things that might one day flood my sense of recall. When he wraps his arm around me at night, I’ll press my body against his and deeply inhale his scent, feeling the gentle kick of his heart beneath my ear, the way the curve of my body feels warmer along the edge where we touch. It reminds me of so many similar nights, and I try to impress the sensations into my brain. During the few times we’ve had to spend nights apart recently, like when </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/12/07/tentative-fluttering-optimism-the-surprising-hot-r-d-ferment-in-head-and-neck-cancer-treatment/" rel="">he went to MD Anderson in Houston</a><span> to establish care, I’ve tried curling up on Jake’s side of the bed and recalling the exact feeling of being beside him. I sleep where he sleeps. I slip on one of his nightshirts. The individual pieces meant to trigger a sense memory are there, but the actual feeling is out of reach, since Jake is out of reach; like any intoxicant or peak experience, you can’t fully inhabit it unless you’re actually under its direct influence, not the memory of the influence.</span></p><p><span>The only person who’ll</span><strong> </strong><span>be able to make me feel better, and tell me what I need to hear after Jake is gone, is Jake, which is a serious temporal problem. So I’ve asked him to make me a video library consisting of short, topical clips I can play in response to specific future feelings or situations. Like if I’m anxious before bed—I’m a terrible sleeper—Jake’s made a video titled &nbsp;“for when you’re feeling anxious before bed and need me to help you relax” video. There’s another for when I’m stressed at work, and another for when I’m feeling bad about my writing. There’s a video for when I feel alone, or when I need to hear he loves me, or just be told that he believes I can make it through the day. We brainstormed a list, heavy on reassurance and comfort. We often make them together.</span></p><p>I’ve guessed at other future scenarios, too. I’ve requested a video for when I get really sick or injured, and others, like one where he &nbsp;talks &nbsp;me down when our future child or children are assaulting my last nerve. Now that Jake has completed the initial, more general list, figuring out &nbsp;topics I want addressed in new videos is getting harder. I keep getting stuck, paralyzed by choice, because I’m trying to bring Jake—or at least videos of Jake—into a future that doesn’t exist yet, and to do that successfully means anticipating every conceivable future. Impossible, I know. “Do you want one in case aliens land in Phoenix and you’re trying to decide if you should or shouldn’t accept the probe?” Jake asks, only half joking. And I say “yes,” because no matter the future, I’ll want him to make me laugh. Also, I’m curious which way he thinks I should go.</p><p><strong>The paralysis I feel isn’t unearned.</strong><span> Misprediction is common (</span><a href="https://www.sintetia.com/robin-hanson-full-interview-about-prediction-markets" rel="">that’s why prediction markets are useful</a><span>). Most humans are terrible at prediction. I’m a perfect example.&nbsp;I know I’m going to get my future self wrong, because I’ve been getting her wrong my entire life. Consider: </span></p><ul><li><p>When I was 8, I wanted to be on Broadway. Broadway was my destiny. This was pre-internet, otherwise known as “the Dark Ages,” so I didn’t have a YouTube channel or an Instagram Reel to facilitate discovery and audience building. No, I did it the old-fashioned “weird kid” way: I stood on the fake boulders that decorated the inside of the “mall” housing the post office and thrift store in my rural Arizona town and belted my little heart out, anticipating that a New York City director would come by and pluck me out of obscurity and dash me off to the theater. I thought I’d sing forever. Instead, I quit choir my second year of high school.</p></li><li><p><span>When I was 12, I spent hours a day practicing classical piano, certain that adult-me would want to be a concert pianist (I didn’t realize the </span><a href="file:///Users/bess/Dropbox/Share%20With%20Jake/Bess%20and%20Jake%20Writing/VIdoes%20for%20future%20self/Gini%20coefficient" rel="">Gini coefficient</a><span> of the music world, or how few pianists can pay the rent). I was so enamored with sultry Rachmaninoff, with the way I was transformed while playing, that I never questioned if adult-me would want to teach lessons and struggle to find venues to perform, or, if I succeeded, what “success” would even look like. I hadn’t read Blair Tindall’s memoir </span><em>Mozart in the Jungle</em><span>, which didn’t yet exist. I couldn’t have anticipated that an injury to my arm would take me away from the keyboard, and that an interest in science meant that I’d only play for fun—and even then, less and less, as years pass. &nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><span>At 22 I </span><a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/on-writing-or-not" rel="">started an MFA program in fiction</a><span> writing because I was going to pen the great American novel, then maybe get a PhD in creative writing, which would inevitably win me a tenured professorship (it was 2008 when you </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2021/09/30/the-death-of-literary-culture/" rel="">could almost plausibly still believe</a><span> things like this). I’d wind up in a cute college town with four seasons and crunching fall leaves under my boots and live a cozy, creative life. A year later it dawned on me that academia was a crumbling tower, the people in my MFA program were curiously incurious about reading and writing, and how I imagined things might work was not how any of this was going to work. I fled.</span></p></li><li><p><span>At 23, I started med school, </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2012/10/20/why-you-should-become-a-nurse-or-physicians-assistant-instead-of-a-doctor-the-underrated-perils-of-medical-school/" rel="">an almost ridiculous act of hubris</a><span> in anticipating the needs of my 30-something self, who’d be responsible for the debt and bear the brunt of the time lost to working 80 hour weeks in a hospital. I wish I’d been able to travel to the future ask myself, at 39, if the choices were worth it. I wish I could ask my 50-year-old self the same question now.</span></p></li><li><p>Until 2020, I thought Jake and I would live in New York forever. New York is so fun! But, realistically, we stayed too long, our goals and priorities changed, and the cost and struggle of the city stopped outweighing the desire for a kid and to be close to family.</p></li></ul><p>Now I’m a 39-year-old ER doctor living in Arizona who likes playing guitar and writing nonfiction about medicine. There’s some continuity in my personality from childhood or adolescence to now, in that I’ve always enjoyed reading and a good story. I’m sensitive and quick to cry. I like a lot of physical affection. I’m prone to neuroticism but high in openness. I’m conscientious and don’t like authoritarian personalities. But I’ve changed a lot of what I once thought were “core” desires and loves. The details of what I’d do, who I’d be with, where I’d live and what my life would look like are nothing like I anticipated, even though past-me laid the groundwork of that future stranger’s life, which I’m currently living.</p><p><span>So when Jake asks me to provide him with a list of more topics for videos, Jake isn’t really asking: “What future situation do you want me to address on camera?” Instead, he’s asking: “Who will you be at 42, 50, 60, 80? What will you want? What will you want to hear from me?” And I have no idea, except that I’ll want </span><em>him</em><span> and he’ll be dead.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/remembering-things-that-havent-happened?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/remembering-things-that-havent-happened?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><strong>Researchers Gilbert, Quiodbach and Wilson </strong><span>coined a term called the “end of history illusion,”</span><strong> </strong><span>which describes people’s tendency to look back on the last ten or twenty years of their life and concede that they’ve changed a great deal.

I’m currently experiencing whatever the opposite of the “end of history illusion” is. Let’s call it: “The beginning of potentially infinite unknowable and yet inevitable futures reality.” Okay, that’s kind of a mouthful. I’m not good at pithy marketing slogans. Knowledge of Jake’s impending death brings with it the certainty that my life is about to undergo tremendous, nonconsensual upheaval, inevitably changing&nbsp; my preferences and values, though I don’t know any details </span><em>except</em><span> that I’ll change in likely vast and unexpected  ways. Without the comforting illusion of stasis, what can I do to assuage the anxiety caused by reality? That’s what the videos are for.</span></p><p><span>Put a person into an fMRI machine and ask them to think about their future selves, and their brains light up as if they' thinking about a stranger. The further out you ask someone to imagine, the more pronounced the effect becomes. Author </span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/why-people-are-so-bad-at-thinking-about-the-future.html" rel="">Jane McGonal</a><span> summarizes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Typically, when you think about yourself, a region of the brain known as </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RpQgBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=cortical+midline+self&amp;ots=il_ihlUghk&amp;sig=4d68_gag74AYNa5JgEKQVis4lHM#v=onepage&amp;q=cortical%20midline%20self&amp;f=false" rel="">the medial prefrontal cortex</a><span>, or MPFC, powers up. When you think about other people, it powers down. And if you feel like you don’t have anything in common with the people you’re thinking about? The MPFC activates even less…The further out in time you try to imagine your own life, the less activation you show in the MPFC. In other words, your brain acts as if your future self is someone you don’t know very well and, frankly, someone you don’t care about.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>There are supposed to be ways to improve your connection to your future self. One is to imagine as many details as possible, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3764505/" rel="">as a way of improving future-self “recognition”</a><span> There’s a part of the brain called the </span><em>dorsolateral</em><span> prefrontal cortex, which is thought to be the area where we do our most detailed simulations of long-range future. Unfortunately for me, Neuroscientist Daniel Schacter thinks </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2213" rel="">the same neural machinery that’s used for remembering the past may also be crucial for predicting the future</a><span>. For someone with my poor memory, that bodes ill.</span></p><p><span>If we employ the same neural machinery for remembering the past as we do for projecting into the future, then foresight is trying to remember something that hasn’t happened yet. Future projections rely on mental constructs&nbsp;based on past events, but what if the future is so outside our experience that we have no past experience on which to model it? What if the mothership lands and the being within demand that I take them to my leader? Or—more plausibly—what if Jake dies, and I’ve never before experienced the death of someone I’m close to? Training my brain to think of my future self as less of a stranger might succeed at improving my sense of empathy and kinship towards her, as well as feeling motivated to make choices to care for her, like, say, asking Jake to make her videos,but it doesn’t tell me what videos she’ll need to see. It doesn’t get me any closer to </span><em>knowing </em><span>her. All I do know is that there’ll come a moment when future me needs to hear Jake say the one thing that present me didn’t think to ask for. I’m sorry for that. But not as sorry as she’ll be.</span></p><p><strong>I’m hoping Jake will know me better than I know myself</strong><span>. It maybe be that I lack adequate foresight and insight because I’m too close to thestory, like editing this essay: I’ve read it too many times,I need outside input. Jake remembers the past me more clearlyand is more objective about my current self, so I assume he’ll do a better job at anticipating the me I’ll become. </span><a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/forever-is-short-long-time" rel="">I’ve said that</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Although there are some consistencies with my personality, I’m not the same person I was 15 years-ago, and neither is Jake. Love changes all the time because we change. We’ve chosen—we have practiced—loving each other through all the people we have been: I’ve loved Jake at 25, when he was uncomfortable with intimacy (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkId=8f775a4af22edaf30d4ead9210aab520&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="">a childhood hangover</a><span>), and at 30, when his thirst for novelty blossomed, and at 39, when he is mature…. Jake and I have been together almost forty percent of our lives, and most of our adult lives. We’ve practiced the loss and rediscovery of each other so many times.</span></p></blockquote><p>And since he both loves me and is a novelist,&nbsp; I trust that he can make some good plot guesses; if anyone can anticipate what I’ll need to hear when I’m 70, it’s Jake. He’s started making &nbsp;new videos whenever something comes &nbsp;to mind, no matter how big or small: it might be him telling me his secret to seasoning beans from Rancho Gordo in the Instant Pot, or a memory of the first time we danced together, or just him saying hello. Some videos are set in futures he imagines for me, and maybe those will help me navigate my way forward into those futures. </p><p><span>Maybe, like all love letters (or love videos) we revisit years after receiving them, they momentarily bring us back to the self we were when they were created. They form a bridge between who we are now and who we were, and connect those pieces; seeing Jake on video will one day, finally, connect who I’ll become to who I am now. That’s the moment when those two selves will finally see each other clearly. That might be the thing future me will need most when things feel bleak: to remember that I was loved before, and I’m still loved, and Jake would tell me if only he were there. That he </span><em>is </em><span>telling me, because he recorded it. Maybe I’ll watch a video and think back on how lucky I was. How lucky we are right now. Perhaps I can worry less about asking Jake to record the right thing, because there is no right thing, no matter the future. Perhaps it doesn’t matter if he gets it “right,” because there is no way to get it wrong. Because it really won’t matter what I hear, as long as I hear it from him.</span></p><p><em><span>If you’ve gotten this far, </span><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s" rel="">consider the Go Fund Me</a><span> that’s funding my husband Jake’s </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/22/i-am-dying-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-and-the-treatments-that-might-save-me-are-just-out-of-reach/" rel="">ongoing cancer treatment</a><span>. </span></em></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Support Jake's Cancer Treatments&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fight-against-cancer-with-jake-s" rel=""><span>Support Jake's Cancer Treatments</span></a></p><p><a href="#_ftnref1" rel="">[1]</a><span> The Liquid Hope website says it is “the world’s first shelf-stable, organic, whole foods feeding tube formula and oral meal replacement.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg" width="1086" height="724" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:724,&quot;width&quot;:1086,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:133657,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb536fd6d-5443-49c1-96f4-a4c7b506b1ad_1086x724.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformers are a class of autoregressive deep learning architectures which have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in various vision, language, and robotics tasks. We revisit the problem of Kalman Filtering in linear dynamical systems and show that Transformers can approximate the Kalman Filter in a strong sense. Specifically, for any observable LTI system we construct an explicit causally-masked Transformer which implements the Kalman Filter, up to a small additive error which is bounded uniformly in time; we call our construction the Transformer Filter. Our construction is based on a two-step reduction. We first show that a softmax self-attention block can exactly represent a certain Gaussian kernel smoothing estimator. We then show that this estimator closely approximates the Kalman Filter. We also investigate how the Transformer Filter can be used for measurement-feedback control and prove that the resulting nonlinear controllers closely approximate the performance of standard optimal control policies such as the LQG controller.

on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>The ban will start on July 1, 2024 in most states and territories.</p><p>The world-first decision comes after hundreds of workers developed silicosis from working on engineered stone, a popular material mostly used for kitchen benches and bathroom vanities.</p><p>Ministers also agreed to a "transition period" for engineered stone contracts entered into before the ban was announced, with arrangements to be finalised at a later meeting.</p><p>The federal government will also impose a ban on imported engineered stone to provide an "additional layer of enforcement and deterrence at the border", however the date has not been finalised yet.</p><p>Trade unions, health organisations and personal injury law firms have all welcomed the ban, saying it will save lives.</p><p>"Engineered stone is a fashion product that is killing the workers who make it," Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary Liam O'Brien said.</p><p>"With alternatives readily available, why are we risking the lives of tradies for a fashionable finish in our kitchens?"</p><p>Caesarstone, a large engineered stone manufacturer, said it was "deeply disappointed" by the decision.</p><p>A spokesperson said the reasoning behind the decision was "flawed" and that singling out engineered stone would not eliminate the risk of silicosis in the workplace.</p><p>"Most importantly, it [the decision] fails to address the real cause of rising silicosis rates – poor compliance with and enforcement of safety standards," they said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Popular material sparked a rise in lung disease</h2><p>Engineered stone, a durable and affordable alternative to natural materials like granite and marble, exploded in popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s.</p><p>However doctors began sounding the alarm after noticing a surge in stonemasons developing silicosis, a long-term and sometimes fatal lung disease caused by inhaling unsafe levels of silica dust.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224334" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224334"><img alt="A shiny white and grey kitchen

activities," he said.</p><p>Since the first Australian silicosis case linked to working on engineered stone was reported in 2015, hundreds more cases have emerged.</p><p>Unions joined doctors to campaign for a ban, arguing it could become the "asbestos of the 2020s" due to the risks it posed to workers' health.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">An 'important win for thousands of workers'</h2><p>Earlier this year workplace ministers tasked Safe Work Australia, a government WHS agency, with investigating how a ban could work and whether low-silica engineered stone could remain on the market safely.</p><p>The report found there was no safe level of silica, concluding: "The use of all engineered stone should be prohibited."</p><p>The CMFEU's Zach Smith said the nationwide ban would "stop the deadly scourge of silicosis in its tracks".</p><p>"This is an important win for the thousands of workers that have been forced to use this product, which has caused them to contract life-ending silicosis," he said.</p><p>"Let's be clear about this — the decision that's been made by the various levels of government today will save lives."</p><h2 data-component="Heading">'From the breadwinner to nothing'</h2><p>Safe Work found that while silicosis cases could emerge in several industries, the numbers were "disproportionate" among engineered stone workers.</p><p>Engineered stone workers also suffered a faster disease progression and were more likely to die from it, the report said.</p><p>The majority of engineered stone workers diagnosed with silicosis were under 35.</p><figure role="group" data-component="VerticalArticleFigure" aria-labelledby="103224134" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/103224134"><img alt="A man with brown hair lies in a hospital bed with

stonemason Ben Harrison, 34, was diagnosed with silicosis four years ago and told the ABC he supported a ban.</p><p>"I've gone from being the breadwinner of the house … to being nothing," he said.</p><h2 data-component="Heading">More details to be worked out</h2><p>Workplace ministers are due to hold another meeting in March 2024 to work out details for the transition period for engineered stone contracts that have already been implemented.</p><p>Caesarstone said a transition period of six months would not be enough time to avoid "significant disruption" to the construction and homebuilding industry.</p><p>"A longer period [is] needed to ensure industry can meet the anticipated demand for substitute products and that fabricators with the necessary financial resources can retool and retrain employees to work on other products," a spokesperson said.</p><p>The Housing Industry Association said the ban had caused uncertainty and concern to the small businesses that supply engineered stone, adding that new machinery and alternative products would be needed.</p><p>"It is critical following today's decision that governments now prepare a detailed industry transition plan that addresses these and other key matters," association managing director Jocelyn Martin said.</p><p>Dr Hoy said broader change was needed to make sure a similar crisis did not happen again.</p><p>"We can't be waiting until people develop disease and they die from conditions related to work before we start acting," he said.</p><p>"We really need to change the ways to identify
