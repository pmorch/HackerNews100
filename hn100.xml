                        The "thorium transition", which physicists have been looking for for decades, has now been excited for the first time with lasers. This paves the way for revolutionary high precision technologies, including nuclear clocks.
                    </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Physicists have been hoping for this moment for a long time: for many years, scientists all around the world have been searching for a very specific state of thorium atomic nuclei that promises revolutionary technological applications. It could be used, for example, to build an nuclear clock that could measure time more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today. It could also be used to answer completely new fundamental questions in physics - for example, the question of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or whether they change in space and time.</p><p>Now this hope has come true: the long-sought thorium transition has been found, its energy is now known exactly. For the first time, it has been possible to use a laser to transfer an atomic nucleus into a state of higher energy and then precisely track its return to its original state. This makes it possible to combine two areas of physics that previously had little to do with each other: classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. A crucial prerequisite for this success was the development of special thorium-containing crystals. A research team led by Prof. Thorsten Schumm from TU Wien (Vienna) has now published this success together with a team from the National Metrology Institute Braunschweig (PTB) in the journal "Physical Review Letters".</p><h3>Switching quantum states</h3><p>Manipulating atoms or molecules with lasers is commonplace today: if the wavelength of the laser is chosen exactly right, atoms or molecules can be switched from one state to another. In this way, the energies of atoms or molecules can be measured very precisely. Many precision measurement techniques are based on this, such as today's atomic clocks, but also chemical analysis methods. Lasers are also often used in quantum computers to store information in atoms or molecules.</p><p>For a long time, however, it seemed impossible to apply these techniques to atomic nuclei. "Atomic nuclei can also switch between different quantum states. However, it usually takes much more energy to change an atomic nucleus from one state to another – at least a thousand times the energy of electrons in an atom or a molecule," says Thorsten Schumm. "This is why normally atomic nuclei cannot be manipulated with lasers. The energy of the photons is simply not enough."</p><p>This is unfortunate, because atomic nuclei are actually the perfect quantum objects for precision measurements: They are much smaller than atoms and molecules and are therefore much less susceptible to external disturbances, such as electromagnetic fields. In principle, they would therefore allow measurements with unprecedented accuracy.</p><h3>The needle in the haystack</h3><p>Since the 1970s, there has been speculation that there might be a special atomic nucleus which, unlike other nuclei, could perhaps be manipulated with a laser, namely thorium-229. This nucleus has two very closely adjacent energy states – so closely adjacent that a laser should in principle be sufficient to change the state of the atomic nucleus.</p><p>For a long time, however, there was only indirect evidence of the existence of this transition. "The problem is that you have to know the energy of the transition extremely precisely in order to be able to induce the transition with a laser beam," says Thorsten Schumm. "Knowing the energy of this transition to within one electron volt is of little use, if you have to hit the right energy with a precision of one millionth of an electron volt in order to detect the transition.” It is like looking for a needle in a haystack – or trying to find a small treasure chest buried on a kilometer-long island.</p><h3>The thorium crystal trick</h3><p>Some research groups have tried to study thorium nuclei by holding them individually in place in electromagnetic traps. However, Thorsten Schumm and his team chose a completely different technique. "We developed crystals in which large numbers of thorium atoms are incorporated," explains Fabian Schaden, who developed the crystals in Vienna and measured them together with the PTB team. "Although this is technically quite complex, it has the advantage that we can not only study individual thorium nuclei in this way but can hit approximately ten to the power of seventeen thorium nuclei simultaneously with the laser – about a million times more than there are stars in our galaxy." The large number of thorium nuclei amplifies the effect, shortens the required measurement time and increases the probability of actually finding the energy transition.</p><p>On November 21, 2023, the team was finally successful: the correct energy of the thorium transition was hit exactly, the thorium nuclei delivered a clear signal for the first time. The laser beam had actually switched their state. After careful examination and evaluation of the data, the result has now been published.</p><p>"For us, this is a dream coming true," says Thorsten Schumm. Since 2009, Schumm had focused his research entirely on the search for the thorium transition. His group as well as competing teams from all over the world have repeatedly achieved important partial successes in recent years. "Of course we are delighted that we are now the ones who can present the crucial breakthrough: The first targeted laser excitation of an atomic nucleus," says Schumm.</p><h3>The dream of the atomic nucleus clock</h3><p>This marks the start of a new exciting era of research: now that the team knows how to excite the thorium state, this technology can be used for precision measurements. "From the very beginning, building an atomic clock was an important long-term goal," says Thorsten Schumm. "Similar to how a pendulum clock uses the swinging of the pendulum as a timer, the oscillation of the light that excites the thorium transition could be used as a timer for a new type of clock that would be significantly more accurate than the best atomic clocks available today."</p><p>But it is not just time that could be measured much more precisely in this way than before. For example, the Earth's gravitational field could be analyzed so precisely that it could provide indications of mineral resources or earthquakes. The measurement method could also be used to get to the bottom of fundamental mysteries of physics: Are the constants of nature really constant? Or can tiny changes perhaps be measured over time? "Our measuring method is just the beginning," says Thorsten Schumm. "We cannot yet predict what results we will achieve with it. It will certainly be very exciting."</p><h3>Original publication</h3><p>Laser excitation of the Th-229 nucleus, Physical Review Letters:<br><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/2c07aYbeC981d47c171619f5604116053962ac79a<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><p>Full paper (preprint): <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Preprint.pdf<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Picture download</h3><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/tu-wien/aktuelles/news/news/bilderdownload" target="_blank">Download pictures provided by TU Wien and PTB<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Further reading</h3><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/die-lange-suche-nach-dem-thorium-uebergang" target="_blank">Historical Background: The Long Search for the Thorium Transition<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/von-atomkern-uhren-und-den-grundkonstanten-der-natur" target="_blank">Applications: Nuclear Clocks and the Fundamental Constants of Nature<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/high-tech-edelsteine-fuer-die-forschung" target="_blank">The Crystal Trick:&nbsp;High-tech Gemstones for Nuclear Science<span>, opens an external URL in a new window</span></a></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.tuwien.at/fileadmin/Assets/tu-wien/News/2024/Thorium_Info_Package.pdf" title="thorium" target="_blank">Download full info package (PDF)<span>, opens a file in a new window</span></a></p><h3>Contact</h3><p>Prof. Thorsten Schumm<br> Institute of Atomic and Subatomic Physics<br> TU Wien<br> +43 1 58801 141896<br><span>thorsten.schumm<span>@</span>tuwien.ac.at</span></p><p>Text: Florian Aigner</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p><a href="https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-54/">&lt; Previous Issue</a></p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>Sometimes, a moment happens not instantaneously, but over many seasons. Looked back on with the blessing of hindsight, there exists a discrete before and after the moment, but for those who lived it, the moment may have had a very long "during" period. Those who live in the "during" find themselves impatient, looking to be on the other side of the event, anxiously waiting for "now" to be "history". They want to live to see the thing complete. They want it to be done.</p><p>For when "now" becomes history, there is a sense of peace of mind, a complete loop, a chord that resolves into something.</p><blockquote>
<p>History cannot be told while it is happening, therefore, not only because the people involved are too busy or too confused to puzzle it out, but because what is happening can’t be made sense of until its implications have been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>

I can not know how the story of Personal Library Science will be told by those who have the convenience of history to aid them. I can only discuss the landscape as I see it, the work completed by those who came <em>before me</em>, and the work being done now <em>by me</em>.  </p><blockquote>Someday, libraries will be fully mechanized. Then, without leaving one’s office, it will be possible to pick up the phone, dial in a code, and have the actual paper one is looking for almost instantly at hand. Something of the sort has got to happen, or our libraries will become buried in the mass of books and articles now being printed, and searching in the old way will become hopeless.</blockquote><p><em>-- Pieces of the Action (1970)</em></p><p>The "during" is hard work, and very lonely work. There are no promises of success, and indeed, the path is one where you can't see more than three feet ahead of you and you exist on the cliff's edge of extinction by any silly mishap. The work  of "during" is exhausting, and it constantly holds you taut and alert, afraid of the shadows that lurk beyond the campfire's edge.</p><figure><img src="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="818" srcset="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg 600w, https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg 1000w, https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Horace-Vernet-Cliff-of-Fecamp.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Fortunately, the work of the edge isn't without some form of solace. The work becomes manageable, perhaps even virtuous, if we allow ourselves to commiserate with those who struggled and strived in the past to make their dreams a reality. To understand their history is to write our story.</p><p>In this issue, we'll discuss a topic that is firmly in our past. This history is not only a guide for Personal Library Science, but a key player in it's very fiber of being.

Even when they were doing timesharing, they talked in terms of virtual card readers and virtual card punches. Everything was still 80-column records.

This claim began to come true years later with the release of the GPT Store (<a href="https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-42/"><em>discussed in issue #42</em></a>). Suddenly, individual people – not at the organization level – found themselves being able to create their own solutions to their unique, idiosyncratic problems.</p><blockquote>Idiosyncratic technology creates a natural world.</blockquote><p>By writing detailed instruction sets and using tactics like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/semantic-search?ref=bramadams.dev">semantic search</a> and <a href="https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/function-calling?ref=bramadams.dev#:~:text=Function%20calling%20is%20a%20powerful,with%20external%20APIs%20and%20services.">function calling</a>, LLMs <strong>leverage</strong> the effort of the individual into emergent and complex processes. </p><p>This <strong>leverage</strong> is the same leverage that made personal computing so ubiquitous, so quickly. The leverage created a new asset class, data. It gave us (you and me) superpowers of communication, and those of us who could communicate with the programs themselves (programmers) found themselves solving problems that gave them access to near limitless wealth.</p><blockquote>It’s cheaper to reuse existing software components than to write code from scratch, which also makes it possible for entrepreneurs to start software companies with fewer up-front costs. The entire software industry owes its financial success to leveraging this arbitrage.</blockquote><p><em>-- Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</em></p><h3 id="personal-library-science-is-leverage-for-ones-library">Personal Library Science Is Leverage For One's Library</h3><p>Personal Library Science is the <strong>leverage of LLM technology, applied to a personal library.</strong> </p><p>A <em>personal</em> <em>library</em> differs from a <em>impersonal</em> <em>library</em> in the fact that a personal library is an <strong>interpretation</strong> of a source material. These interpretations include: photographs from different photographers at the same event, or favorite scenes from a movie, or favorite passages from books, parts of songs that bring you to tears, etc. Importantly, these interpretations create unique sets that go on to create unique problems which require unique, idiosyncratic solutions. Sound familiar?</p><blockquote>While a painting or a prose description can never be other than a narrowly selective interpretation, a photograph can be treated as a narrowly selective transparency. But despite the presumption of veracity that gives all photographs authority, interest, seductiveness, the work that photographers do is no generic exception to the usually shady commerce between art and truth. Even when photographers are most concerned with mirroring reality, they are still haunted by tacit imperatives of taste and conscience. The immensely gifted members of the Farm Security Administration photographic project of the late 1930s (among them Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Ben Shahn, Russell Lee) would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right look on film—the precise expression on the subject’s face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry. In deciding how a picture should look, in preferring one exposure to another, photographers are always imposing standards on their subjects. Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are. Those occasions when the taking of photographs is relatively undiscriminating, promiscuous, or self-effacing do not lessen the didacticism of the whole enterprise. This very passivity—and ubiquity—of the photographic record is photography’s “message,” its aggression.</blockquote><p><em>-- On Photography</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="848" height="1200" srcset="https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg 600w, https://www.bramadams.dev/content/images/2024/04/Poor-Jo-by-Earl-of-Carlisle.jpeg 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In <a href="https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-54/">issue #54</a>, I wrote: </p><blockquote>...personal library science is focused on&nbsp;<strong>your relationship with your information</strong>.

The existence of software has had a foundational impact on the types of solutions we can create to solve these large, incalculable problems. By solving them over and over in slightly different ways that make sense to an individual the problem eventually dissolves. </p><p>In fact, I'd argue that the history of personal computing teaches us that <strong><em>all top down solutions are less complete – and therefore less useful – than bottom up emergent solutions</em></strong>.</p><p>The issue is that we are now deluged with data, our interpreter antenna is going haywire trying to calculate, to store, to relate, to understand.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>California legislators, under the influence of Effective Altruism activists, are trying to sneak through a disastrous bill for open-source AI and the technology industry generally.</p>
<p>SB 1047 creates an unaccountable Frontier Model Division that will be staffed by EAs with police powers, and which can throw model developers in jail for the thoughtcrime of doing AI research. It’s being fast-tracked through the state Senate. Since many cloud and AI companies are headquartered in California, this will have worldwide impact.</p>
<p>We need your help to stop this now. It only takes a few minutes, and three steps, but you need to do them soon, ideally this week. Non-California residents are very welcome to comment, and indeed many of the supporters are not from California.</p>
<p>1. Submit a position letter to the bill author, which ensures that your position shows up on all future bill analyses that state Senators read. Go to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047</a>, click on “Comments to the Author”, register an account and submit an opposition letter.</p>
<p>Use your own words for the letter, and feel free to borrow liberally from or cite friend of AFTF Context Fund’s analysis of the bill (<a href="https://www.context.fund/policy/sb_1047_analysis.html">https://www.context.fund/policy/sb_1047_analysis.html</a>). One of key arguments being advanced is that this is “pro-little guy”, so if you’re involved in the open source movement, are a startup founder, or an investor, heavily cite your experience and how the bill affects you personally.</p>
<p>If it’s still before May 5th, also submit comments to the Senate Appropriations Committee: <a href="https://sapro.senate.ca.gov/position-letters">https://sapro.senate.ca.gov/position-letters</a>. Unfortunately, you have to submit to both the committee and the author to make sure the position letter is fully considered at the hearing.</p>
<p>2. Also add your public comment to the Context Fund analysis document (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk8uRTs0tiQ8O4k6ZVkwnOQX5n2PSdFhh0sXeXoDNM4/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk8uRTs0tiQ8O4k6ZVkwnOQX5n2PSdFhh0sXeXoDNM4/edit</a>).</p>
<p>3. Tell your friends about this and introduce it to the media, publications you are connected to, and your own social media followings, especially those serving the ML, tech and startup audiences.</p>
<p>Most builders and investors who would be affected by this bill are not aware of it, but the special interests are. We need to change that quickly.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Until recently, the dominance of ultra-processed food and alcohol companies has seemed unassailable. With corporate food engineers cranking out more and more hyper-palatable products, the negative health impacts seemed to only be moving in one direction.&nbsp; The tide might be about to turn.</p><p><span>Morgan Stanley recently did a survey of people taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Mounjaro.&nbsp; CNBC and Quartz got private looks at the survey results.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://qz.com/ozempic-drugs-alcohol-tobacco-use-1851430022" rel="">Quartz wrote</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The investment bank also surveyed about 300 GLP-1 users about their consumption habits while taking the medication. Analysts at the bank have previously cautioned that the growing use of GLP-1s will put some longterm pressure on fast food sales, as users have reported spending less money at restaurants…</p><p>While 40% of survey respondents said they smoked cigarettes at least weekly before starting a GLP-1 treatment, that number fell to 24% after they started the treatment. Meanwhile, weekly e-cigarette usage dropped from 30% of respondents to 16% after they started taking a GLP-1.</p><p>Morgan Stanley found similar results when it asked respondents about their use of alcohol. About 56-62% of alcohol consumers on GLP-1s reported drinking less alcohol since starting the medications, with about 14-18% cutting their alcohol consumption entirely.</p></blockquote><p><span>And here’s how </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/20/weight-loss-drug-patients-spend-less-on-restaurants-takeout-survey.html" rel="">CNBC reported it</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The findings add to the mounting concerns that soaring demand for GLP-1s could take a bite out of the bottom lines of some of the biggest restaurant companies and makers of packaged snacks like Doritos, Oreos and Hershey’s Kisses. GLP-1s include Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, along with Eli Lilly’s popular weight loss treatment Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro.&nbsp;</p><p>The rising demand for these four drugs isn’t expected to ease anytime soon. In the new survey, Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth $105 billion by 2030. They also estimate that 31.5 million people, or around 9% of the U.S. population, will take GLP-1s by 2035.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is growing evidence that the drugs have a meaningful impact on consumer behavior and spending on groceries and restaurants,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in the survey. “All of these dynamics suggest GLP-1 drugs’ impact across consumer sectors is set to increase as drug uptake grows and the drugs reshape behavior among a demographic group that represents a disproportionate share of calorie consumption.”</p></blockquote><p><span>It’s pretty amazing that a reporter can write with a straight face that people eating less Doritos and Oreos is a ‘mounting concern’!&nbsp; Will CNBC soon report ‘mounting concerns’ that Purdue Pharma’s sales of OxyContin could decline?  This survey is not exactly ‘science’ but it aligns with </span><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/27-reddit-users-describe-how-ozempic" rel="">patient reports</a><span> and </span><a href="https://curingaddiction.substack.com/p/news-roundup-will-glp-1-drugs-revolutionize" rel="">recent studies</a><span> showing a broad reduction in cravings for food and substances among patients taking GLP-1s.</span></p><p>If GLP-1s prove effective for addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and anxiety–areas being studied and showing promise– the percentage of the population taking using them could far exceed 9%.&nbsp;&nbsp;While replacing a dependence on corporate processed food brands with a dependence on big pharma might sound like a mixed blessing, the broad health, longevity, and mortality benefits for those eligible appear to overwhelmingly justify the trade-off.

  <p id="DZi9yh">Cars, you might have noticed, have <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2023/7/25/23807518/cars-suvs-americans-big-automobiles-travel">grown enormous</a>.</p>
<p id="Ogo4DO">Low-slung station wagons are <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/1000830/bring-back-station-wagons">all but extinct</a> on American roads, and even sedans have become an endangered species. (Ford, producer of the iconic Model T a century ago, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/448349/ford-explains-killing-off-sedan/">no longer sells any sedans</a> in its home market.) Bulky SUVs and pickup trucks — which have themselves steadily<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/27/suvs-gm-ford-toyota-chevrolet/4408728002/"> added pounds and inches</a> — now comprise more than <a href="https://jalopnik.com/trucks-and-suvs-are-now-over-80-percent-of-new-car-sale-1848427797">four out of every five new cars sold</a> in the US, up from just over half in 2013, even as national household size <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/">steadily declines</a>.</p>

<p id="fF4PSD">The expanding size of automobiles — <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/12/cars-trucks-suv-sales-electric-safety-risk.html">a phenomenon I call car bloat</a> — has deepened a slew of national problems. Take road safety: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-03/why-us-traffic-safety-fell-so-far-behind-other-countries">Unlike peer nations</a>, the US has endured a steep rise in traffic deaths, with fatalities among pedestrians and cyclists, who are at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pedestrian-cyclist-deaths-safe-cars-afcf8e6fd1b1cbfbd1a5360a29f08308#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMany%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,organs%2C%20rather%20than%20the%20legs.">elevated risk</a> in a crash with a huge car, recently hitting <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-says-traffic-deaths-fell-slightly-first-nine-months-2022-2023-01-09/">40-year highs</a>. Vehicle occupants face danger as well. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2019.1632442">2019 study</a> concluded that compared to a smaller vehicle, an SUV or a pickup colliding with a smaller car was 28 percent and 159 percent, respectively, more likely to kill that car’s driver.</p>
<p id="UmXKlY">Car bloat also threatens the planet. Because heavier vehicles require more energy to move, they tend to gulp rather than sip the gasoline or electricity that powers them, increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Extra weight also accelerates the erosion of <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/06/electric-vehicles-auto-haulers-weight-capacity-roads.html">roadways</a> and <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/car-tires-6ppd-pollution-epa.html">tires</a>, straining highway maintenance budgets and releasing microplastics that damage ecosystems.</p>

<p id="el1OJ7">What lies behind this shift? Some Americans prefer bigger cars, especially when gas prices are low, for their ample storage space, ability to see over other vehicles on the road, and perceived safety benefits (more on that later). But shifting consumer demands tell only part of the story.</p>
<p id="4Klv9c">For half a century, a litany of federal policies has favored large SUVs and trucks, pushing automakers and American buyers toward larger models. Instead of counteracting car bloat through regulation, policymakers have subtly encouraged it. That has been a boon for car companies, but a disaster for everyone else.</p>
<p id="zdEawh">Here are some of the most egregious examples.</p>
<h3 id="ZsvvYC">Why we let bigger cars pollute more</h3>
<p id="FFBhtm">After the 1970s OPEC oil embargo triggered a spike in gas prices, the federal government adopted an array of policies intended to reduce energy demand.</p>
<p id="Cvt5Af">One of Congress’s most consequential moves was creating the <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards#:~:text=First%20enacted%20by%20Congress%20in,of%20cars%20and%20light%20trucks.">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) standards, which require that the average fuel economy (miles per gallon, or MPG) of a carmaker’s vehicles remain below a set threshold.</p>
<p id="OI4H7Q"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Mighty-Dangerous-Rise-Suv/dp/B000A176P6" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/High-Mighty-Dangerous-Rise-Suv/dp/B000A176P6?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Pressed by auto lobbyists</a>, Congress made a fateful decision when it established CAFE. Instead of setting a single fuel economy standard that applies to all cars, CAFE has two of them: one for passenger cars, such as sedans and station wagons, and a separate, more lenient standard for “light trucks,” including pickups and SUVs. In 1982, for instance, the <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10562">CAFE standard</a> for passenger cars was 24 mpg and only 17.5 mpg for light trucks. </p>
<p id="W24lfu">That dual structure didn’t initially seem like a big deal, because in the 1970s SUVs and trucks together accounted for <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a2108816/definition-truck-cafe-loophole-critics-say/">less than a quarter </a>of new cars sold. But as gas prices fell in the 1980s, the “light truck loophole” encouraged automakers to shift away from sedans and churn out more pickups and SUVs (which were also more profitable). </p>
<p id="f8gRdx">Car ads of the 1980s and 1990s frequently featured owners of SUVs and trucks <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=349512193261157">taking family trips</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9fYfKlPltI">going out with friends</a>, activities that could also be done in a sedan or station wagon. The messaging seemed to resonate: By 2002, light trucks comprised <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/fact-714-february-13-2012-light-truck-sales-rise">more than half of new car sales</a>.</p>
<p id="14FtbS">In the early 2000s, the federal government made these distortions even worse.</p>
<p id="wxXTXh">During the George W. Bush administration, CAFE was <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2011/04/20/driving-to-545-mpg-the-history-of-fuel-economy">revised</a> to further loosen rules for the biggest cars by tying a car model’s efficiency standard to its physical footprint (which is basically the shadow cast by the vehicle when the sun is directly above it). President Obama then incorporated <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/05/obama-announces-new-national-fuel-policy-two-harmonized-standards-with-fleet-average-of-355-mpg-250-.html">similar footprint rules </a>into new greenhouse gas emissions standards that are overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
<p id="HCO78I">Dan Becker, who led the Sierra Club’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate" data-source="encore">global warming</a> program from 1989 to 2007, told me that he and others <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna30327904">warned</a> federal lawmakers that adopting footprint-based standards was a mistake. “People like me were saying, ‘give carmakers another loophole and they’ll use it,’” he said. “But we lost.” </p>
<p id="yKEYkZ">Those concerns proved justified. The average vehicle footprint expanded 6 percent between 2008 and 2023, a “historic high,” according to an <a href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/download-automotive-trends-report">EPA report</a>, which also found that some carmakers, such as General Motors, actually had lower average fuel economy and higher average carbon emissions in 2022 than in 2017. To its credit, the EPA recently announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html">revisions</a> to its vehicle GHG rules that would narrow (but not close) the gaps between standards for large and small cars.</p>
<p id="UWQqBt">But the shift toward <a href="https://www.vox.com/electric-vehicles" data-source="encore">electric vehicles</a> may further entrench car bloat. The EPA’s rules assume that all EVs, regardless of their design, generate no emissions — a questionable assumption, because EVs create emissions indirectly through the production and transmission of power that flows into their <a href="https://www.vox.com/batteries" data-source="encore">batteries</a>. A huge or inefficient battery requires more electricity, which can lead to significant pollution (especially in regions where <a href="https://www.vox.com/fossil-fuels" data-source="encore">fossil fuels</a> dominate the energy mix). </p>
<p id="VLqKd6">The EPA’s policy of treating all EVs equally makes a monstrously wasteful vehicle <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90790197/yes-to-electric-cars-but-not-the-hummer-ev">like the Hummer EV</a> seem cleaner than it is, encouraging carmakers to manufacture more of them. </p>
<p id="hbwZCy">To counteract EV bloat, Peter Huether, a senior research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, would like to see the EPA revise its GHG rules to consider emissions from power generation and transmission: “If these standards look at upstream emissions, it could have a downstream effect on shape and size of EVs.” </p>
<h3 id="tpqxH3">Blocking smaller cars from abroad</h3>
<p id="LtlL12">What does a 60-year-old trade dispute have to do with car bloat? More than you might imagine.</p>
<p id="tKiFnM">In the early 1960s, Europe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/10/archives/the-chicken-war-a-battle-guide.html">raised the ire</a> of American officials by slapping a 50 percent tariff on chicken exported from the United States. In retaliation, the US enacted a 25 percent tax on pickup trucks imported from abroad. The dispute is long forgotten, but the “Chicken Tax” lives on.</p>
<p id="LW144y">Although the tariff was initially aimed at Germany’s immense auto industry (<a href="https://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2009/05/the-chickens-have-come-home-to-roost.html">Volkswagen in particular</a>), it also applies to pickups imported from newer automaking powers such as Japan and South Korea, where carmakers are often adept at building vehicles much smaller than those available to Americans. </p>
<p id="SeqRZ5">Toyota’s <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/toyota-hilux-double-cab-2020.html#aeng_toyota-hilux-double-cab-2020-24l-d-4d-6mt-150-hp">Hilux Double Cab pickup</a>, for instance, weighs several hundred pounds less than a 2024 <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/f-150">Ford F-150 Tremor or Lariat</a> and is about half a foot shorter. But Americans who might want it are out of luck. Toyota does not sell the Hilux in the US (but does in countries like <a href="https://www.toyotabharat.com/showroom/hilux/">India</a> and <a href="https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/hilux">Britain</a>); the 25 percent tariff would make it prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p id="GJgd8v">“The Chicken Tax has prevented competitive Asian or European truck makers from entering the US market,” said Jason Torchinsky, a co-founder of the Autopian, a media outlet focused on the auto industry. “American manufacturers have really never had to compete.” John Krafcik, who previously led Hyundai, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/06/19/415671756/how-a-tax-on-chicken-changed-the-playing-field-for-u-s-automakers">has called</a> the Chicken Tax “one of the most important determinants of how the [auto] industry looks today and how it operates today in the US.” </p>
<p id="VXeqPf">The tariff has been condemned by everyone from the Libertarian <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/hidden-costs-tariffs#:~:text=In%20retaliation%2C%20President%20Lyndon%20B,tax%20on%20light%20trucks%20remains.">Cato Institute</a>, the center-right <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-anti-consumer-25-chicken-tax-on-imported-trucks-has-insulated-the-big-3-from-foreign-competition-for-50-years/">American Enterprise Institute</a>, and the left-leaning <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/does-chicken-tax-encourage-people-purchase-larger-trucks">Tax Policy Center</a>. “Tariffs in general hurt consumers, and the Chicken Tax is no exception,” wrote Robert McClelland of the Tax Policy Center.</p>
<p id="xcYkLf">There are other protectionist rules blocking smaller vehicles from abroad: Carmakers from China, an emerging automaking behemoth, face a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-want-biden-hike-tariffs-chinese-made-vehicles-2023-11-08/">25 percent tariff</a> enacted by Donald Trump. As a result, Americans <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/4/24087919/biden-tariff-chinese-ev-byd-battery-detroit">cannot buy small Chinese EV sedans</a> like the BYD Seagull that cost around $10,000, <a href="https://www.livenowfox.com/news/average-price-for-new-car-used-falling-us-2024">barely a fifth</a> the price of an average American car. </p>

<p id="Pk5DuO">And those hoping to import a kei truck, a miniature pickup common in Japan, must navigate a labyrinth of <a href="https://keitruckconnect.com/how-to-import-a-kei-truck-into-the-usa/#:~:text=If%20you're%20looking%20to,year%20exemption%20rule%20for%20importation.">federal</a> and <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/travel/miniature-japanese-imports-owners-hire-laywer-legislature-fails/85-f707d2b4-d82a-4c35-8535-f5130b2ae7a2">state</a> rules. (Even Afghanistan seems ahead of the US in minitruck offerings, as the Wichita Eagle’s Dion Lefler noted in a <a href="https://www.kansas.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/dion-lefler/article274837471.html">tongue-in-cheek 2023 </a>column: “In the land of the free, why can’t we have mini-pickup trucks like the Taliban?”)</p>
<p id="LEZdYh">These policies have established a regulatory moat protecting US automakers whose profits <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/suv-sales-best-sellers.html">disproportionately come from pricey, hulking SUVs and trucks</a>. </p>
<h3 id="suXAIE">The Hummer Tax Loophole</h3>
<p id="7ciqVw"><a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/legislative-documents/public-laws-and-legislative-history/deficit-reduction-act-of-1984-p.l-98-369-div-a/dsyf">In 1984</a>, Congress stopped allowing small business owners to take a tax deduction for the purchase price of cars used for work. But the bill included a giant loophole: To protect those who need a heavy-duty vehicle (think farmers or construction workers), Congress made an exception, known as Section 179, for cars that weigh over 6,000 pounds when fully loaded with passengers and cargo. Today such behemoths are eligible for a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946#:~:text=Section%20179%20deduction%20dollar%20limits.,-For%20tax%20years&amp;text=deduction%20is%20%241%2C220%2C000.-,This%20limit%20is%20reduced%20by%20the%20amount%20by%20which%20the,beginning%20in%202024%20is%20%2430%2C500.">tax deduction of up to $30,500</a>, while business owners who opt for a smaller car can claim nothing at all.</p>
<p id="a4drJE">Few car models were heavy enough to qualify for the tax break 40 years ago, but that is no longer the case: A<a href="https://www.hummer1.com/specs"> Hummer 1, for instance,</a> weighs about 10,300 pounds (leading Section 179 to be dubbed the “<a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5476-section-179.html">Hummer Tax Loophole</a>”). Other huge cars, such as a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/suburban-2024/specs">Chevrolet Suburban</a> or an <a href="https://www.ford.com/trucks/super-duty/models/f250-xlt/">F-250 Ford Super Duty truck</a> can qualify, too. </p>
<p id="gWou5F">“Few folks at EPA know about Section 179,” said Becker, the former Sierra Club executive. “But every auto dealer does.” Some car dealerships even offer <a href="https://www.kengrodyfordsandiego.com/ford-section-179-tax-deduction-san-diego-ca-dtw/">handy Section 179 guides</a> on their websites. The tax advantage of buying a behemoth may be powerful enough to tilt the vehicle purchase decisions of individuals like <a href="https://corofy.com/can-real-estate-agents-take-section-179-deductions-for-specialized-equipment-vehicles/#:~:text=Section%20179%20deduction.-,This%20deduction%20allows%20real%20estate%20agents%20to%20deduct%20the%20full,to%20succeed%20in%20their%20industry.">real estate agents</a>, who use their vehicles for both professional and personal use. And as cars electrify, the added tonnage from batteries will allow more models to qualify for favorable tax treatment.</p>
<p id="6JYKqq">If Section 179 sounds crazy, consider another federal loophole that has endured for decades. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/gas-guzzler-tax">In 1978</a>, Congress established the “Gas Guzzler Tax,” requiring automakers to pay <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/gas-guzzler-tax/">between $1,000 and $7,700</a> for every car produced that gets less than 22.5 miles per gallon. But the tax only applies to passenger vehicles like sedans and station wagons. SUVs and pickups, which often have much worse gas mileage, are exempt. That omission makes no sense from a policy perspective, but it is good news for carmakers producing inefficient behemoths.</p>
<h3 id="A1jVfR">Freezing the gas tax</h3>
<p id="avZwl2">Every time a car owner fills her gas tank, a portion of the bill goes into the federal <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-highway-trust-fund-and-how-it-financed">Highway Trust Fund</a>, a central source of funding for roads and <a href="https://www.vox.com/transportation" data-source="encore">mass transit</a>. That tax rate is set at $0.184 per gallon, a level that has <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm#:~:text=The%20Omnibus%20Budget%20Reconciliation%20Act,to%20the%20Highway%20Trust%20Fund.">been frozen since 1993</a>, when Bill Clinton was less than a year into his presidency. Congressional proposals to increase the gas tax to close a <a href="https://enotrans.org/article/running-on-empty-the-highway-trust-fund/">yawning highway budget gap</a>, or at least tie it to inflation, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/11/infrastructure-bill-gas-tax-faq/">gone nowhere</a>. </p>
<p id="97MZwn">Over the last 31 years, consumer prices have risen <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">113 percent</a>, making the real value of the gas tax less than half what it was in 1993. That decline has reduced the cost of powering a huge SUV or truck with abysmal gas mileage, like the 6,270-lb 2024 Cadillac Escalade that gets around <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/cadillac/escalade-escalade-esv">16 mpg</a>.</p>
<p id="dckPbz">A <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/oecd-gas-tax/">2018 OECD study</a> found that the US had the lowest average gas tax (including both federal and state taxes) among rich nations, which averaged $2.24 per gallon — four times the typical US rate. “Why are European cars so small?” said McClelland, of the Tax Policy Center. “One reason has got to be the much higher gasoline tax.” </p>
<h3 id="zd7OaT">Federal policy ignores crash risk for anyone outside a car</h3>
<p id="Wk5ERo">A vehicle’s design affects not just the safety of its occupants, but also people walking, biking, or inside other cars. Although seemingly obvious, this basic truth has eluded federal regulators for decades.</p>
<p id="O9UiWt">Car safety rules are laid out in the encyclopedic Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), which touches on everything from power windows to seat belts. But the FMVSS revolves around protecting a vehicle’s occupants; nothing within its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Federal-Standards-Regulations-Amendments-Interpretations/dp/1379016444" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Federal-Standards-Regulations-Amendments-Interpretations/dp/1379016444?ascsubtag=___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_23903188__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">562 pages</a> limits a car’s physical design to protect someone who might come into contact with it in a collision. That omission invites <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html">an arms race of vehicle size</a> — precisely what the US is experiencing.</p>
<p id="CNPeic">Nor does the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) consider pedestrians, cyclists, or other car occupants when calculating its safety ratings from crash tests. Unlike safety ratings in Europe and elsewhere, the American crash ratings program also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-18/fix-the-crash-test-dummies">ignores</a> the danger that vehicle designs pose to those walking and biking.</p>
<p id="knrFhp">NHTSA’s myopic focus on car occupants is a boon for the heaviest and tallest cars, which pose disproportionate risk to those outside of them. Weightier vehicles exert more force in a crash, and they require additional time to come to a halt when a driver slams on the brakes. A <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians">2023 study</a> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) found that vehicles with tall, flat front ends (common on big pickups and SUVs) are significantly more likely to kill pedestrians in crashes. <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/suvs-other-large-vehicles-often-hit-pedestrians-while-turning#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20possible%20that%20the%20size,Senior%20Transportation%20Engineer%20Wen%20Hu.">An earlier IIHS study</a> found that large cars also make it harder to see pedestrians at intersections.</p>

<p id="OnQvlU">With pedestrian and cyclist deaths <a href="https://www.vox.com/23784549/pedestrian-deaths-traffic-safety-fatalities-governors-association">now soaring</a>, NHTSA last year took its first, tentative step toward protecting so-called vulnerable road users by proposing that <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-proposes-new-crashworthiness-pedestrian-protection-testing-program">its vehicle safety ratings be revised</a> to include an evaluation of automatic pedestrian braking technology, which can force a vehicle to halt before striking someone on foot. But even if adopted, it would not affect NCAP’s 5-star safety rating, the hallmark of the program.  </p>
<p id="pWciBT">And NHTSA’s focus on automatic pedestrian braking, an imperfect tech fix, ignores car bloat, a root cause of America’s traffic safety crisis. Earlier this year, a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377261425_Unreliable_Pedestrian_Detection_and_Driver_Alerting_in_Intelligent_Vehicles">paper</a> co-authored by former NHTSA executive Missy Cummings gave an ominous <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377261425_Unreliable_Pedestrian_Detection_and_Driver_Alerting_in_Intelligent_Vehicles">assessment</a> of automatic braking systems, concluding that they did not work consistently. By contrast, the potential safety benefits of constraining vehicles’ <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/808569">weight</a> and <a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians#:~:text=Vehicles%20with%20hoods%20more%20than,of%2030%20inches%20or%20less.">height</a> have been well established.</p>
<h3 id="IfGpBy">Why can’t we fix things?</h3>
<p id="AmGQZ4">All of these policies have distorted the US car market, leading the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-ownership-statistics/#:~:text=Sources-,National%20Car%20Ownership%20Statistics%20at%20a%20Glance,in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202022.">278 million vehicles</a> plying American roads to become ever bigger, more dangerous, and more destructive. So why have they remained on the books after the growing societal costs of car bloat became impossible to miss?</p>
<p id="rOzXDp">To find an answer, consider who benefits from oversized vehicles. American carmakers like Ford and GM (which are headquartered in Michigan, a crucial swing state) rely on juicy margins from big SUVs and pickups, which are more expensive and <a href="https://www.ttnews.com/articles/plunging-pickup-truck-sales">profitable</a> than smaller models. They enjoy protection from foreign competition through tariffs like the Chicken Tax, as well as favorable policies like CAFE’s light-truck loophole. </p>
<p id="wTy7jU">The regulatory status quo suits domestic automakers just fine — and they act as a roadblock to even modest attempts to change it. In 2022, for example, the largest auto industry association <a href="https://x.com/DavidZipper/status/1532427288792518657?s=20">lobbied</a> District of Columbia council members against a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/a-new-way-to-curb-the-rise-of-oversized-pickups-and-suvs">proposal</a> to charge owners of the most egregiously oversized cars $500 per year, seven times more than a light sedan (the District adopted the policy anyway).</p>

<p id="6UhWi8">As American sales of big SUVs and trucks have surged, their owners are likely to resist policy moves they see as penalizing them. Many are likely to be unaware of the federal loopholes and policy oversights that have distorted their vehicle choices.</p>
<p id="92QZ6I">The negative externalities of supersized cars — in emissions, crash deaths, and the erosion of tires and pavement — are what economists call a market failure, since their costs are borne by society writ large, not the people who buy big pickups and SUVs. Left unaddressed, those societal costs will grow as more people replace their modest-sized cars with big SUVs or trucks. After all, everyone else seems to be doing it — why not do the same, if only for self-preservation?</p>
<p id="vNu1jQ">Regulation can end such a cycle toward enormity. Countries including <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20201015-government-u-turn-as-france-slaps-weight-tax-on-heavy-cars-suvs-climate-pollution">France</a> and <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/norway-became-an-ev-paradise-now-it-s-imposing-a-weight-tax-and-bringing-back-the-vat-200685.html#:~:text=EV%20owners%20will%20also%20have,powered%20cars%20(including%20hybrids)">Norway</a> have enacted weight-based taxes to counteract car bloat’s collective costs and avoid giving huge vehicles implicit subsidies. But American policymakers have done the exact opposite, and they rarely even acknowledge the problem. Asked explicitly about ways that the Department of Transportation could address car bloat, Secretary Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90841997/this-is-a-preventable-crisis-pete-buttigieg-on-spending-800-million-to-eliminate-traffic-deaths">ducked</a>, calling merely for “further research.”</p>
<p id="Adhh7h">With the feds refusing to lead, it has fallen on state and local leaders to try and address car bloat themselves. <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2023/09/29/colorado-pedestrian-safety-suv-truck-owners/">Colorado</a> and <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/california-charge-owning-trucks-suvs-17771795.php">California</a>, for instance, have proposed weight-based vehicle registration fees, following the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/a-new-way-to-curb-the-rise-of-oversized-pickups-and-suvs">District of Columbia</a>’s lead. But such moves are an imperfect solution to a national problem (vehicles can, after all, be driven across state lines). A true policy fix will require action from Congress, NHTSA, and the EPA.  </p>
<p id="bgFcNL">It need not begin with new regulations or taxes. Federal leaders could do a world of good if they simply unwind the ill-advised policies already on the books.</p>

<h2>Workplace surveillance is coming for you (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/21/great-taylors-ghost/#solidarity-or-bust">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>If you want to do something terrible with technology, you can't just roll it out on people with money and social capital. They'll complain and your idea will tank. Successful shitty tech rollouts start with people you can abuse with impunity (prisoners, kids, migrants, etc) and then work their way up the privilege gradient. I call it the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve.</p>
<p>The point of the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve is to normalize technological oppression, one group at a time. 20 years ago, if you were eating your dinner under the unblinking eye of a video-camera, it was because you were in a supermax prison. Now, thanks to "luxury surveillance," you can get the same experience in your middle-class home with your Google, Apple or Amazon "smart" camera. Those cameras climbed the curve, going from prisons to schools to workplaces to homes.</p>
<p>The pandemic was a great accelerant for late-stage capitalism, converting our homes to rent-free annexes of our employers' facilities, and turning "work from home" into "live at work." Bossware, a fringe technological category, experienced a massive boom, rocketing up the privilege gradient.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware</a></p>
<p>For most of its history, bossware was used to police the most marginalized, oppressed workers, like the mostly Black, mostly female workforce at Arise, a company that charges workers for their own training and then fines them if they quit.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless</a></p>
<p>But when lockdown turned high-status white collar workers into home-workers, their bosses rolled out incredibly invasive spyware, including tools that watched them through their cameras, listened to their microphones, logged their keystrokes, scoured their hard-drives and read their text messages.</p>
<p>This was the second coming of Taylorism, AKA "scientific management," an early 20th Century pseudoscience practiced by high-priced, unaccountable consultants who would fan out on factory floors in literal science cosplay, including lab-coats and clipboards, and loom over workers, watching their every movement, often going so far as to film them.</p>
<p>Then the consultants would go back to their workplace, soup the negatives, and produce completely arbitrary workplace rules about how workers must stand, hold their limbs and heads, and move – it was a kind of corporate anti-yoga whose asanas were designed to make workers <em>look</em> productive to their bosses, who often had no idea how to perform or evaluate their jobs.</p>
<p>The pandemic's new Taylorists do not confine themselves to the factory floor. Thanks to digital tools, they can come right into your home, and they can take high-frequency measurements of unimportant things in great detail, and then produce scores that your boss can use to decide whether and how much to pay you.</p>
<p>Bossware is the subject of an <em>excellent</em> <em>New York Times</em> feature by Jodi Kantor, Arya Sundaram, Aliza Aufrichtig and Rumsey Taylor, which documents the ways that "Worker Productivity Scores" undermine the workers' ability to perform their jobs, while also allowing their bosses to steal their wages:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html</a></p>
<p>Their case-studies are a trip up the Shitty Tech Adoption Curve, and includes $200/hour finance exec Carol Kraemer, who discovered that her boss was tracking her time in 10-minute increments and docking her pay for stretches where she took her fingers off her keyboard – to think, say, or make notes with pen and paper.</p>
<p>Kraemer discovered that the only way to avoid wage-theft was to do "mindless busywork" that produced the clicks that her bossware demanded, even if it got in the way of her work. This is yet more proof that "you treasure what you measure," or, more formally, "any measurement becomes a target" (AKA Goodhart's Law).</p>
<p>The decline of worker productivity in pursuit of metrics is an inescapable failure mode of bossware. In 2020, I reported on a reader's experience working in an engineering shop where her boss evaluated her performance based on the number of trouble-tickets she closed, turning her into "a ticket-closing machine."</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#goodhartism">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#goodhartism</a></p>
<p>Being an engineer, this worker applied herself to the problem in a methodical fashion, and realized that she could juke her stats by closing tickets prematurely by marking them "did not respond" – and also that she could close and re-open the same tickets over and over, racking up points.</p>
<p>She closed by saying, "Your execs should fucking well know this: how would THEY like to be evaluated based on, like, how many emails they send in a day? Do they believe that would be good for the business? Or would they object that they are tasked with the holistic success of the org, and that their roles are too complex to reduce to a set of metrics without context?"</p>
<p>The irony, of course, is that bossware is now coming for execs, and, what's more, they lack the engineering skills to optimize their work so they can get a high score <em>and</em> do the job, so they have to settle for just getting the score – and hang the job itself.</p>
<p>In the <em>NYT</em> story, the authors profile a wide range of people who are deliberately doing a worse job in order to get higher scores, including a group of hospice chaplains who are given points based on their work with dying patients and their families, scored in a way that is utterly disconnected from providing compassionate care.</p>
<p>Activities are scored based on their priority to management, without regard to the comfort they provide: 0.25 points for a phone call with a grieving relation; one point for a visit with a dying patient, 1.75 points for presiding over a funeral.</p>
<p>Chaplains' ability to accumulate points was undermined by patients – who would take longer than anticipated to draw their final breaths, or break down in tears, or cancel appointments as they made their peace with their impending deaths. To maintain their wages, chaplains resorted to "spirtual care drive-bys" – like sticking their head in a room where a patient was unconscious, exchanging a brief word with a nurse, and marking it down as a "patient visit."</p>
<p>Healthcare offers a fascinating window into the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve, as doctors' and nurses' work has been transformed by the electronic health record and its relationship to billing – so that now these high-paid, high-demand, high-skill professionals have to organize their work around data-entry on a system designed without their input and without regard to their priorities.</p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> reporters dig into the social workers, therapists and addiction counselors at Unitedhealth, a private-equity-backed healthcare monopoly. They get marked as "idle" if they stop typing to talk with their patients. If those conversations go on too long, they are marked as "derelict" and risk employment sanctions.</p>
<p>Social workers with masters' degrees are compensated based on the number of keystrokes they generate on the job. For Unitedhealth admin workers who work from home, glitches in the system can imperil their jobs, for example, if the system hangs when you log out for the day, it can mark you as "idle" all night, killing your average score. Workers facing these problems are advised by their managers to jiggle their mouses periodically to keep the division's score from falling.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting part of the <em>Times</em> feature is the work it does profiling the pseudoscientists who created and marketed this junk software. There's Federico Mazzoli, co-creator of Worksmart, who explained the benefits of his product: "Once you see those metrics, those insights, something changes: You realize how much you waste doing nothing, or just multitasking and not accomplishing stuff."</p>
<p>Mazzoli seems to have either not used his product, or, if he did, did so under conditions where <em>he</em> was in charge of it – using it the way an athlete might use a stopwatch to time their own sprints, and not the way a boss might: to decide whether to dock your pay or fire you.</p>
<p>This inability to understand the difference between <em>using</em> a technology and having the same technology <em>used against you</em> is endemic to the industry. Take Crossover, which bills itself as "the Fitbit of productivity," but whose customers rhapsodize about the product giving them "powers of near X-ray vision." The point of a Fitbit is to help <em>you</em> improve something that matters to you – but Crossover's customers want to use it to <em>punish other people</em> for failing to follow orders. It's the difference between a Fitbit and a prisoner-tracking cuff – which make crossover "the ankle-braclet of productivity."</p>
<p>Ironically, the <em>Times</em> reports that Crossover's own employees so resented the company's intrusive monitoring of them (as they created and sold intrusive monitoring tools) that Crossover hemorrhaged employees and struggled to hire replacements. Eventually, Crossover had to turn off its most intrusive features so that it could keep the employees needed to make and sell its bossware product.</p>
<p>One major focus of "productivity trackers" is measuring bathroom breaks and punishing workers for pissing. Piss-tracking tools are another shitty technology that has been racing up the privilege gradient, making the leap to white-collar workers after being imposed on blue-collar workers, like the Amazon warehouse workers and drivers who have to piss in bottles to satisfy their bossware:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex">https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex</a></p>
<p>The next step on the gradient was students – children have slightly more privilege than nonunion blue-collar workers, it seems – with 1,000+ US schoools handing public money to E-hallpass, a company that tracks children's urination:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73n7/ehallpass-1000-thousand-schools-monitor-bathroom">https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73n7/ehallpass-1000-thousand-schools-monitor-bathroom</a></p>
<p>As the metaphor of corporate personhood has become more and more concrete (for example, through the Supreme Court's <em>Citizen's United</em> decision, which ruled that limits on corporate political spending violated their corporate persons' free speech rights) many have pondered the question, "What sort of person is a corporation?"</p>
<p>The 2003 documentary "The Corporation" investigated this, declaring the if corporations are people, they are psychopaths – remorseless and totally lacking in empathy. Science fiction writers have claimed that corporations are "slow AIs" (Charlie Stross), or Skynet (Ted Chiang) or immortal colony organisms that use humans as gut flora (me):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card">https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card</a></p>
<p>But the rise and rise of bossware implies another personality archetype for the corporation: the abusive alcoholic dad, whose own life is spinning out of control and who finds comfort by seeking to control the lives of others in humiliating ways that ultimately leads to his own destruction.</p>
<p>Because bossware doesn't just radically reduce productivity by shifting the point of work from getting the job done to getting the boxes ticked – it also exposes the businesses who use it to existential risks. Take Office 365, the cloud-based word processing/spreadsheet/email system from convicted monopolist Microsoft.</p>
<p>Office 365 went from being an online version of Microsoft Office to being a bossware delivery-system. The Office 365 sales-pitch focuses on fine-grained employee tracking and comparison, so bosses can rank their workers' performance against each other. But beyond this automated gladiatorial keystroke combat, Offce 365's analytics will tell you how your company performs against <em>other companies.</em></p>
<p>That's right – Microsoft will spy on your competitors and sell you access to their metrics. It's wild, but purchasing managers who hear this pitch seem completely oblivious to the implication of this: that Microsoft will also spy on <em>you</em> and deliver your metrics to your competitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge</a></p>
<p>Even wilder is the further implication: that Microsoft might use the data its product gathers on your business – every keystroke made by every worker in the entire company! – to <em>compete</em> with <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>A century ago, "scientific management experts" tricked bosses out of fat consulting fees by promising to turn managers' preference for "a smartly turned out workforce" into a scientific best-practice. This is pure empiricism-washing, where an irrational bias is encoded in mathematics and declared to be scientific truth.</p>
<p>Bossware companies target employers' insecurity about their workers' power to actually undermine the employers' businesses, transforming productive workers into efficient metric-satisfiers, while raiding the company for valuable market-intelligence.</p>
<p>The bossware problem is a <em>boss</em> problem, in other words. It follows that fixing the bossware problem is the <em>workers'</em> job, and indeed, the <em>Times</em> feature notes that Amazon has been dismantling its bossware surveillance in a bid to reduce its workers' support for unionization, which promises to ban bossware from Amazon workplaces.</p>
<p>Bosses deride unions as reducing "freedom" – but just the <em>threat</em> of unions delivers more freedom to workers than any right-to-work law ever could. Bossware-infected jobsites are Stalinist dystopias, where workers are punished for <em>looking in the wrong direction</em> or failing to hit the keys fast enough, irrespective of whether they're getting the job done.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, I wrote about this in "Affordances," a short story for Slate Future Tense, which set out to explore how the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve may start with the most downtrodden and immiserated among us – but how, left unchecked, it will come for each and every one of us:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Williams-Sonoma could be paying a hefty fine for claiming a small chunk of its products were "Made in USA" when they weren't.</p><p>In a federal court filing on Monday, the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge to sign an order that would fine the luxury home goods company $3.18 million for violating a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/07/ftc-approves-final-order-settling-charges-williams-sonoma-inc-made-overly-broad-misleading-made-usa" data-cms-ai="0">2020 order</a> regarding the same false label claims. Williams-Sonoma settled those charges and was required to pay $1 million to the FTC, and the following year, it submitted a report describing how it had complied with every provision in the order.</p><p>However, the FTC's new claims state the company has violated the order with multiple deceptive U.S.-origin claims in the years since — including on three products in July 2021, when it filed the compliance order.</p><p>One such claim, which the FTC says Williams-Sonoma made between April 2022 and August 2023, involved certain PBTeen mattress pads that were advertised as "crafted in America from domestic and imported materials." The federal body said in numerous instances, those products were actually "wholly imported" from China.</p><p>The FTC said this finding led them to discover six other products on the retailer's websites that were advertised as American-made despite either containing foreign components or being processed internationally. It states Williams-Sonoma couldn't demonstrate the validity of its own claims, and the retailer admitted to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/williams-sonoma-is-fined-by-us-ftc-over-made-usa-claims-2024-04-23/" data-cms-ai="0">Reuters</a> that the allegations made in the complaint were true.</p><p>Williams-Sonoma ranked No. 1,469 on Forbes' largest companies in the world list last year. With brands under its own moniker, Pottery Barn, West Elm and more, the company raked in nearly $8.7 billion in sales last year.</p><p>It's interesting to question, however, if U.S.-made labels have at all contributed to the company's success.</p><p>One survey last year found two-thirds of its 1,000 respondents said they regularly sought out "Made in America" products, and 50% said they'd be willing to pay more for them. Another survey from the <a href="https://reshoringinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/made-in-usa-survey.pdf" data-cms-ai="0">Reshoring Institute</a>in 2020 found over 69% of respondents preferred American-made products, and more than 80% were willing to pay 10% to 20% more for them.</p></div><p>Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc.

          <p>The Cessna 185 Skywagon is a high wing, single engine aircraft: basically a Cessna 180 with six seats, a strengthened fuselage and a slightly more powerful engine. It’s a popular aircraft in remote areas where access to modern airstrips may be minimal.</p>

<p>The Skywagon can be fitted with floats or skis: this particular one, registered in Finland as OH-CVT, was equipped with floats. It also had a cargo pack and a Robertson STOL (short take-off and landing) kit, which reduces the stall speed.</p>
<p>The aircraft was owned by Polar Lento Ltd. Originally, the aircraft and the pilot were operating under Polar Lento’s certificate. However, on the 30th of April 2003, the Finnish Flight Safety authority cancelled the certificate, as the maintenance manager of the company was not approved. Polar Lento Ltd applied for the aircraft to be added to the certificate of Ivalon Lentopalvelu Ltd. The authority added the aircraft to Ivalon Lentopalvelu’s operations on the 2nd of May 2003. The contract between the two companies stipulated that Polar Lento Ltd would cover all fixed and variable expenses of the aircraft while operated by Ivalon Lentopalvelu.</p>
<p>The pilot held his commercial licence and had 2,176 hours on floatplanes, most of which were on Cessna 180-types.</p>
<p>On the 24th of June, the day before the accident, the pilot flew the Skywagon from Lake Kilpisjärvi to Lake Ounasjärvi, Enontekiö , the Finnish part of Lapland. His fuel load had been close to the maximum when he departed Lake Kilpisjärvi. The floatplane landed at Hetta fishing harbour and docked there overnight.</p>
<p>The morning of the 25th, the pilot did his preflight checks and pumped the water out of the floats with a hand pump. When the passengers arrived, he weighed the baggage. He loaded some of it into the netted cargo pack under the fuselage and the rest in the cargo area behind the seats.</p>
<p>It is common for flight operations in the wilderness to have the take-off weight close to the maximum. After the luggage and the passengers were loaded, the aircraft weighed 1,460 kilograms (3,220 pounds); the maximum take-off weight was 1,520 kilograms (3,351 pounds). The centre of gravity was within limits, though close to the forward limit.</p>
<p>They taxied from the pier to the take-off position. During the taxi, the pilot checked the engine. He then took off along the lake, heading due east into a light headwind of three knots. The waves on the lake were about 10 cm high (just under four inches).</p>
<p>When looking at the length of an aircraft’s take-off, we usually split it into two parts: the ground roll or ground run, where the aircraft is moving along the ground, and the distance from when the aircraft leaves the ground (rotation) until it reaches 15 metres (50 feet). Acceleration is based on the propeller thrust, which has to overcome the surface friction of the wheels and the aerodynamic drag of the aircraft.</p>
<p>On water, however, the hydrodynamic drag of the water causes the most resistance to acceleration. Take-off is effectively broken down into three phases. The aircraft starts its take-off run until the resistance reaches its peak (at about 27 knots). Then there is a short second-stage take-off phase where the floats are placed so that the aircraft is “on the step”: the floats have lifted partway and are hydroplaning across the surface of the water. The aircraft is no longer fully supported by the water but retains just enough surface friction to manoeuvre. Each successive wave is struck with increasing severity, so the pilot has to use elevator pressure in order to skim across the waves as the aircraft continues to accelerate. An error at this stage risks capsizing the aircraft; but soon, especially with a good head run, the aircraft will lift off the water (rotation), transitioning to the final stage of take-off.</p>
<p>At this stage, when the aircraft “unsticks” itself from the water, the pitch angle needs to be reduced — that is, the nose pitched slightly down — in order to give the aircraft a chance to gain speed. When the friction between the floats and the water disappears, the pitch up is briefly unbalanced; for how long depends on the float type. In addition, as the aircraft climbs, the ground effect reduces. The downwash behind the wing increases, the horizontal stabiliser angle of attack changes and the downward load on the stabiliser increases. As a result, the aircraft pitches up unless the pilot controls the flight path using the elevator. If this pitch up is not controlled, the aircraft is at risk of exceeding the stall angle of attack. The aircraft accelerates more easily when it is close to the water because the aircraft-induced drag is less in the ground effect. Thus, it is even more important for the floatplane pilot to control the pitch of the aircraft and gain airspeed before climbing away.</p>
<p>The Cessna 185’s take-off run on Lake Ounasjärvi that morning was approximately 500 metres (1,640 feet) of which the last 300 metres (980 feet) was on the step. The pilot noticed that the wind was coming slightly from the left (easterly).</p>
<p>The pilot had set the trim so that the aircraft would lift off from the step and begin to climb away. The rudder trim was set almost as far right as it could go. The pilot described the take-off as quick and easy. “I let it lift off by itself. It was well-trimmed and it lifted off normally by itself.”</p>
<p>The aircraft suddenly yawed and rolled to the right. They were about 15 metres above the water, ready to transition to the next phase of flight. The pilot immediately applied full opposite aileron and left rudder in an attempt to straighten out the aircraft. He pressed his right foot on top of his left foot in an attempt to gain full left rudder.</p>
<p>It didn’t help.</p>
<p>The aircraft yawed more than 90° to the right; that is, it turned at a right angle to its direction of travel. The right wing tip hit the water first, throwing the aircraft into a cartwheel. The nose and right wing hit the water, followed by the empennage as the cartwheeling continued. The left door and windshield were torn off of the fuselage.</p>
<p>When the tail impacted the water, the aircraft capsized and came to a halt, floating upside down in the lake, buoyed up by its floats. The water at the crash site was approximately 30 metres (100 feet) deep.</p>
<p>The cabin roof was at a depth of two metres (6.5 feet) and the cabin filled with water immediately. 170 litres of aircraft fuel and 10 litres of engine oil spilt into the lake. The water temperature was 8-10°C (46-50°F).</p>
<p>The pilot unbuckled his seat and tried to undo the seat belt of the passenger in the right-hand seat next to him. He couldn’t find the buckle. The passenger didn’t move and showed no signs of life. Running out of air, the pilot had to dive to get to the surface.</p>
<p>The passenger in the middle row, a 14-year-old boy, unbuckled his seat belt. He saw the surface through the left door opening and dived through it and swam to the surface.</p>
<p>A number of people witnessed the crash. Boats raced to the capsized aircraft, arriving within three minutes of the accident. One bystander dived into the water twice to try to reach the passenger trapped in the right-hand seat. It had been five minutes since the aircraft had capsized. The diver touched the passenger’s lifeless hand but was unable to free him from the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Enontekiö fire brigade arrived on the scene about twenty minutes later. One of the fire brigade with scuba diving gear attempted to recover the passenger but was unable to free him. The aircraft was towed towards the Hetta shore but became stuck in the bottom of the lake about 60 metres (200 feet) from the shore.</p>
<p>Two hours later, another, more experienced diver arrived on the scene. He was able to release the seat belt, which had tangled around the right ankle of the now-drowned passenger who was trapped in the front. Although the front seats were equipped with shoulder harnesses, neither the pilot nor the passenger had worn them. The diver carried the body to shore where a doctor pronounced him dead. The cause of death was later confirmed as by drowning. The passenger’s face was badly bruised, probably from hitting his face on the instrument panel. Although wearing a life jacket would not have saved the passenger, as the seat belt was not released in time, wearing the shoulder harness would have meant that he would have been conscious and able to escape once the aircraft had capsized. However, at that time, in Finland, there was no obligation to do so, although some countries do require this.</p>
<p>The surviving passenger said that the pilot did not give any safety briefing before they took off. The pilot said that he had given the briefing, including how to use the life jackets, seat belts and doors.</p>
<p>The pilot suffered a cut to his face and bruises around his body. The surviving passenger also had some bruising but no serious injuries. In both cases, most of the injuries were on the left side. The aircraft was beyond repair.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105248" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105248"><img decoding="async" src="https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/OH_CVT.png" alt="" width="412" height="326" srcset="https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/OH_CVT.png 412w, https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/OH_CVT-400x317.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-105248">OH-CVT being pulled out of the lake</figcaption></figure>
<p>No one in the plane was wearing a life jacket. Although this wasn’t a factor in the accident, the Finnish report points out that passengers on a boat naturally wear life jackets and it seems illogical that sea- and floatplane operators do not usually wear them. One reason for this is that the certification of airworthiness inspection standard <em>requires</em> that the life jackets be stored in their original plastic bags. Aircraft life jackets are not very rugged because they are intended to be used only once, in an emergency. Floating and automatically operating life jackets aren’t practical, specifically because of cases like this where the occupants have to dive out of the capsized aircraft in order to escape the cabin. However, there are approved life jackets which could be used to deal with these circumstances.</p>
<p>The life jackets are required to be easily accessible; but, in most instances, there would not be enough time to put the life jackets on in an emergency unless the aircraft is planning a forced landing from cruise altitude. The investigators of the accident put forward that, if the intent is to have life jackets practically available in all phases of flight, the occupants of the aircraft should be wearing them throughout.</p>
<p>In interviews after the accident, the pilot said that the aircraft lifted off easily and quickly. When it suddenly rolled and yawed to the right, he tried to stop the movement by using full opposite aileron and rudder. He said that the aircraft was gaining altitude and speed at the time. He said that he tried to stop the roll and the yaw and continue the take-off. He never considered aborting the take-off or lowering the nose. The aircraft continued to roll and yaw and the nose dropped. The pilot remembered that he held the yoke with two hands but could not remember whether he pushed or pulled.</p>
<p>The investigation focused on the control systems. The impact damage to the aircraft made this difficult: the left wing was attached to the fuselage only by the aileron cables and one of the flap cables. The right wing was still attached, with the flap set to 20° down, which matched the setting of the flap control lever in the cockpit. The elevator control cables were intact and, although they were loose as a result of the bent empennage, investigators were able to confirm that movement of the yoke still transferred to the elevator. The elevator trim system position indicator showed neutral and the tailplane was in the neutral position. Both the left and right rudder pedals were intact. The rudder trim was ⅓ turn (one-third turn) from the extreme right position.</p>
<p>There was no reason why the control systems would not be working normally during the flight.</p>
<p>The pilot didn’t know the speed at which the Cessna 185 lifted off that day, although he said that it was normally around 55 knots. He didn’t have any observations about the speed during the take-off run or the initial climb. He never lowered the nose to gain airspeed as the aircraft lifted off, nor did he consider any other manoeuvres to increase his airspeed. He simply let the aircraft lift off and climb by itself.</p>
<p>The pilot had flown since 1988 in north-east Lapland, mostly for the reindeer industry or tourist flights. His home bases were Lake Ounasjärvi and Lake Kilpisjärvi; most of his flights had been short hops to the lakes around the area. He had had no previous accidents nor incidents in 2,940 hours of flight, with 8,125 take offs.</p>
<p>However, the investigation discovered that despite his experience, he had never practised stall recovery on the Cessna 185. The pilot had no knowledge of the aircraft’s stall behaviour at all. His opinion was that the Cessna 185 simply didn’t stall.</p>
<p>A further issue was that his Cessna 185 had been extensively modified. The addition of floats, cargo pack, short take-off and landing kit and a three-blade propeller had never had their combined effect documented.</p>
<p>The stall speed, at least, should normally have been documented as a part of the airworthiness check. A test flight was logged from four years previous by another pilot. The checklist showed that, at that time, with floats installed, the clean stall warning was triggered at 64 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and the aircraft stalled at 56 KIAS. The landing configuration stall warning was triggered at 58 KIAS and the aircraft stalled at 48 KIAS.</p>
<p>However, the aircraft had undergone further modifications and maintenance since then.</p>
<p>Earlier that year, a hangar roof had collapsed onto the aircraft at Enontekiö airport during a storm. The collapse dented the upper wing surfaces, ailerons and flaps. The aircraft was flown (carefully, one assumes!) to Rovaniemi airport for repairs.</p>
<p>The maintenance team discovered an incorrect right wing geometric twist, which was unrelated to the hangar roof collapse but probably happened during repairs done previously in the USA. As a result, the aircraft had a tendency to roll and had been uncomfortable to fly because of a lack of aileron trim. This might explain why the pilot had the aircraft trimmed full right rudder on take-off: to correct for this roll. When they repaired the damage to the right wing, they also corrected the geometric twist, removing the aircraft’s tendency to roll. They did not notify the Flight Safety Authority for the correction as they considered it to have been a minor repair.</p>
<p>The repair and maintenance were finished on the 20th of June, five days before the accident. The accident pilot ran up the engines and flew a test flight. He confirmed that, after the adjustment of the geometric twist, the aircraft no longer had the tendency to roll.</p>
<p>Then he filled out the test flight documents . . . except for the section on level flight where data was missing. The documents included blank fields for the pilot to fill out for the speed at which the aircraft stalled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stall speed clean ___ KIAS (knots indicated airspeed)  </li>
<li>Stall speed landing configuration ___ KIAS  </li>
<li>Stall warning ___ KIAS  </li>
</ul>
<p>The pilot had put dashes in the blank fields, instead of noting the speed where the aircraft begins to stall when clean and the speed at which the stall begins when the aircraft is configured for landing. The last blank field, which should have stated the speed at which the stall warning sounds, had been filled in with the word OK.</p>
<p>The maintenance company received the document and gave the aircraft a certificate of release to service.</p>
<p>No one had <em>any idea</em> what the stall speed of the aircraft was. With the changes to the right wing geometric twist, the angle of incidence of the wings had been changed, which would have affected the stall speed. It seemed that the pilot had no knowledge of the aircraft’s stall behaviour at all. His opinion was that the Cessna 185 simply doesn’t stall. The investigators believed that he may have been afraid of stalling and so never tested the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Skywagon was a write-off but the investigation needed to understand the aerodynamics of the accident flight, taking into account the modifications. So, they re-created the aircraft. They equipped a Cessna A185E to match the accident aircraft, adding a Robertson STOL, floats (although not exactly alike), a cargo pack under the fuselage and a three-blade propeller. The aircraft’s weight was approximately 50 kilograms below the maximum take-off weight.</p>
<p>The first simulation of the accident scenario was done at 3,000 feet. The test pilot set idle power and then maintained altitude in order to allow the airspeed to reduce. Then when the airspeed had dropped to 48 knots, the test pilot applied maximum power. The nose pitched up by 10° which increased the angle of attack by 10°. The increased angle of attack caused the right wing to stall violently and the aircraft rolled and yawed to the right. The aircraft was travelling at 55 knots at the time.</p>
<p>The test pilot recovered the aircraft using the normal procedure, losing only 150-200 feet. The stall warning horn sounded throughout. The simulation was then repeated with the same result. Further flights, however, did not always result in the violent right wing stall. In five of the fourteen attempts, the aircraft rolled 50-70 degrees to the right in two seconds. Nothing significant happened on the other nine attempts, even when the speed was reduced to 40 knots.</p>
<p>Further test flights were done to check the stall warning and air speed indicators of the aircraft. The stall warning horn did not sound during take-off.</p>
<p>The investigation shifted their focus to aerofoil aerodynamics. They covered the test aircraft with hundreds of 90 mm wool threads. These threads made the airflow around the aircraft visible. The thread movements were filmed in flight with five video cameras: two cameras attached to each wing strut and one on top of the fin.</p>
<p>This allowed the study to document the airflow direction and turbulence from the movement of the threads. There was also a sixth camera attached to the cabin roof filming the instrument panel and horizon as well as recording the cabin sounds.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105251"><img decoding="async" src="https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/The-aircraft-fuselage.png" alt="" width="412" height="309" srcset="https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/The-aircraft-fuselage.png 412w, https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/The-aircraft-fuselage-400x300.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-105251">The aircraft fuselage, empennage and right wing upper surface were covered with wool threads.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The wool threads showed that, on those occasions where the aircraft rolled to the right, the airflow separated first from the right wing tip and immediately after this, from the right wing root. The separation line progressed rapidly from the trailing edge to the leading edge and led to the sudden roll. The sudden aircraft roll was immediately stopped and the aircraft recovered when the pilot moved the yoke forward, reducing the angle of attack.</p>
<p>The investigators discovered that it was possible to suddenly stall the aircraft at a speed of 50-55 knots in the take-off configuration. The aircraft regularly suffered a sudden right wing tip stall, which caused the right roll and pitch down. They concluded that the cause of the right wing tip stall was the aileron angle, which caused a sharp edge to form on the upper surface. The short take-off and landing kit incorporates a link between the flaps and the ailerons. The ailerons turn downwards in the take-off configuration. Cessna aircraft have a hinge line on the upper surface. As a result, turning the aileron down causes a sharp angle on the upper surface. The air is unable to flow around such a sharp edge and stays attached. The result is a sudden right wing tip flow separation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105252" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-105252"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/Figure-8.png" alt="" width="455" height="364" srcset="https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/Figure-8.png 455w, https://fearoflanding.com/files/2024/04/Figure-8-400x320.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-105252">Flap in take off position (20°), when the aileron is at a 13° angle, air speed 80 kt. The flow separation can be seen from the wool threads.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite this detailed study, they were never able to make sense of why this only happened a third of the time.  By rights, the aircraft should have stalled every time. In any event, the pilot had been lucky up until the day of the accident.</p>
<p>The commission named three direct causal factors of the accident.</p>
<p>The first factor was the pilot’s take-off procedure, which allowed the aircraft to climb after getting airborne, rather than controlling the pitch in order to increase the airspeed. As a direct result of this, the angle of attack increased and the right wing stalled.</p>
<p>The second factor was the tip-stalling tendency of the STOL kit. The flow separation of a standard Cessna aircraft begins from the wing root area. The sharp edge on the upper surface induced flow separation which caused the right wing tip to stall.</p>
<p>The third factor was the pilot’s response. There was no evidence that he pushed the yoke forward to unstall the wing, which in the flight tests consistently dealt with the issue. Instead, he applied full left aileron and rudder. If he had pushed the yoke forward, the aircraft may still have crashed but it was unlikely to have cartwheeled across the water and injured the passengers in such a way. Instead, his full opposite aileron turned the right aileron downwards, which made the right wing tip stall worse.</p>
<p>The indirect causal factor was the pilot’s lack of experience with stalling the aircraft. He told the investigation that he had never stalled the aircraft, which meant that he was unable to recognise the stall during the take-off. He was quite convinced that the aircraft would not stall and believed it was such an abnormal flight condition that he saw no need in practising it.</p>
<p>With the changes to the right wing geometric twist, the angle of incidence of the wings had changed, which affected the stall speed. The maintenance organisation should not have given the aircraft a certificate of release without verification of the slow flight and stall characteristics. Of course, even if another test pilot had completed the flight test, the pilot should still have practised stalls in the aircraft, knowing that the slow flight and stall characteristics of his aircraft had changed.</p>
<p>But, even though he knew both wings had been taken off the aircraft and maintenance done which would affect the stalling characteristics of the aircraft, he did not see the point in any stall manoeuvres as a part of the test flight or for general practice.</p>
<p>One last indirect causal factor was not wearing the shoulder harnesses in the front seat.</p>
<p>The Finnish Safety Investigation Authority has published the <a href="https://turvallisuustutkinta.fi/en/index/tutkintaselostukset/ilmailuonnettomuuksientutkinta/tutkintaselostuksetvuosittain/ilmailu2003/b22003llento-onnettomuusenontekiolla25.6.html#">full accident report in English</a>.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the accident report:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <strong>Probable cause</strong></p>
<p>  The pilot let the aircraft continue to climb after getting airborne without reducing the pitch angle to gain airspeed. The aileron and flap connection of the R/STOL kit of the aircraft combined with the aileron type caused right wing to tip stall in the take-off configuration.</p>
<p>  The pilot did not recognise the stall and did not act in the required sense to recover.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Two recommendations were made by the investigation commission.</p>
<p>The first was that pilots be informed about the stall behaviour of the Robertson short take-off and landing kit on the Cessna 185 aircraft, both by listing the issue in the aircraft flight manual supplement and through education through the aviation authority.</p>
<p>The second was that the Finnish Flight Safety Authority revise existing regulations so that all persons on board must wear a life jacket during water operations, rather than insist that they be kept in plastic bags.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we show that Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021) leads to suboptimal finetuning of models with large width (embedding dimension). This is due to the fact that adapter matrices A and B in LoRA are updated with the same learning rate. Using scaling arguments for large width networks, we demonstrate that using the same learning rate for A and B does not allow efficient feature learning. We then show that this suboptimality of LoRA can be corrected simply by setting different learning rates for the LoRA adapter matrices A and B with a well-chosen ratio. We call this proposed algorithm LoRA$+$. In our extensive experiments, LoRA$+$ improves performance (1-2 $\%$ improvements) and finetuning speed (up to $\sim$ 2X SpeedUp), at the same computational cost as LoRA.

<div><p><span>Reentry is a space flight simulator based on real life spacecrafts. You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.</span></p><p><span>Spacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.</span></p><p><span>Reentry provides a balance between realism and gamification. It's main focus is not to create one 100% accurate implementation of one space craft but to provide you with a gamified but still realistic experience on multiple spacecrafts.</span></p></div>

<p><span>You will learn how to operate these spacecrafts using procedures used by the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. It will let you explore the surface of Earth and the Moon from Orbit, and let you enjoy the solitude of being in space.</span><br></p>

<div><p><span>Imagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle.

<p>Each spacecraft is very different when it comes to how they behave, and how they are operated. Hundres of switches are used to configure systems and subsystems. Some have on-board computers, while others don't. Multiple power sources such as eletrical batteries, inverters or fuel cells are powering electrical components, while valves, pipes and tanks guide substances to where they belong. Reaction Control Systems can modify the spacecraft attitude, or even modify its trajectory. While many of these systems are automatic, some require manual control, or provide manual override if needed.</p>

<p>The simulator comes with flight manuals for each spacecraft and hundreds of checklists based on those the real astronauts used. In-game mechanics guide you through them using interactive elements and guidance tools.</p></div><div data-in-template="false" data-id="CB7B3520-55DD-49F2-A527-74BBD52DE5EF" data-kind="IMAGE" data-specific-kind="IMAGE"><p><img loading="lazy" role="presentation" data-scalestrategy="crop" src="https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/missionPad.png?etag=%223aa6e-5edf7f7f%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=415%2B296&amp;extract=0%2B0%2B415%2B269" srcset="https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/missionPad.png?etag=%223aa6e-5edf7f7f%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=415%2B296&amp;extract=0%2B0%2B415%2B269, https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/missionPad.png?etag=%223aa6e-5edf7f7f%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=763%2B544&amp;extract=0%2B0%2B763%2B494 2x, https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/missionPad.png?etag=%223aa6e-5edf7f7f%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=763%2B544&amp;extract=0%2B0%2B763%2B494 3x, https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/missionPad.png?etag=%223aa6e-5edf7f7f%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=763%2B544&amp;extract=0%2B0%2B763%2B494 4x" height="269" width="415" data-width="415" data-height="269"></p></div><div data-in-template="false" data-id="0EB52A8D-FC0B-48FB-94A6-67AA4AE69770" data-kind="TEXT" data-specific-kind="TEXT"><p>The game also comes with an in-game checklist editor so you can add your own checklists, or modify the default ones.</p></div></div><div><div data-in-template="false" data-id="764E562E-2219-429A-80A2-9825723EA260" data-kind="TEXT" data-specific-kind="TEXT"><p data-mve-font-change="0"><h2><span>LEARN TO OPERATE THESE SPACECRAFTS</span></h2></p></div><div data-in-template="false" data-id="6010F547-8325-4AB3-AE79-7E714120FBCE" data-kind="IMAGE" data-specific-kind="IMAGE"><p><img loading="lazy" role="presentation" data-scalestrategy="crop" src="https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/MercuryCockpit.png?etag=%2223d37a-5edf6468%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=482%2B269&amp;extract=6%2B0%2B476%2B269" srcset="https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/MercuryCockpit.png?etag=%2223d37a-5edf6468%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=482%2B269&amp;extract=6%2B0%2B476%2B269, https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/MercuryCockpit.png?etag=%2223d37a-5edf6468%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=964%2B538&amp;extract=12%2B0%2B952%2B538 2x, https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/MercuryCockpit.png?etag=%2223d37a-5edf6468%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=1446%2B807&amp;extract=18%2B0%2B1428%2B807 3x, https://reentrygame.com/____impro/1/onewebmedia/MercuryCockpit.png?etag=%2223d37a-5edf6468%22&amp;sourceContentType=image%2Fpng&amp;ignoreAspectRatio&amp;resize=1611%2B899&amp;extract=20%2B0%2B1590%2B898 4x" height="269" width="476" data-width="476" data-height="269"></p></div><div data-mve-font-change="0" data-in-template="false" data-id="AC21371A-31A6-4FF5-8341-CD161BBB7E51" data-kind="TEXT" data-specific-kind="TEXT"><h3><span>PROJECT MERCURY<br></span></h3>

<p>Let's face it. Flying and operating a spacecraft is no simple task. Given the amount of subsystems, procedures and controls, the learning curve to even get the rocket off the pad in a safe and controlled manner can be hard. After ignition, the only way out of the capsule is through an abort. Thousands of gallons of fuel are consumed to produce enough thrust to bring the rocket through the initial layer of the atmosphere, where the dangers of maximun dynamic pressure are pushing the structural limits of the launch vehicle. The automatic guidance logic carefully guides the spacecraft into space. At the same time, the astronauts are busy monitoring the available data and completes checklists while the cockpit shakes violently.</p>

<p>Once in orbit, the next maneuvers are planned, while also constantly verifying that the essential systems needed to keep you alive are functional, and that you have a way of returning back to Earth.</p>

<p>Reentry - An Orbital Simulator uses realistic orbital mechanics, and every force applied to the spacecraft will affet its attitude and trajectory. Luckily, you don't have to learn it all at once to get started. The in-game Academy provides multiple lessons for each spacecraft available. Each lesson is focused on one or two procecures, and explain them at a basic level. Slowly you will be able to put the pieces together, and attempt to get certified in a given spacecraft by taking the exam.</p>

<p>Each of the available space crafts has a dedicated campaign. This is a set of missions put together to challenge what you have learned. Once you have completed the Academy of a spacecraft, you will be ready to complete the Campaing. You will need to use what you have learned to complete multiple missions in fictional story largely based on real life events and missions.</p>

<p>One campaing and space craft builds on your knowledge from the previous era so I recommend you to complete the campaings in order. This will let you learn and see the evolution of the technologies used in human space flight like in real life. You will see how to reach your first orbits in the Mercury Campaingn, how to rendezvous and dock in the Gemini campaing, how to reach the Moon in the Apollo Command Module campaing, and finally how to land on the Moon in the Lunar Module campaign.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy this experience as you explore the frontiers of space flight in these historic space crafts.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><p>For this second post in <strong>Zed Decoded</strong>, our blog &amp; video series in which we're taking a closer look at how Zed is built, I've talked to Zed's three co-founders —&nbsp;Nathan, Max, Antonio — about the data structure at the heart of Zed: the rope.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Companion Video</b>: <!-- -->Rope &amp; SumTree</p><p>This post comes with a 1hr companion video, in which Thorsten, Nathan, Antonio, and Max use Zed to look at how Zed uses the Rope and SumTree types. It's a loose conversation in which we write and read a lot of code to understand how the rope in Zed works and is implemented.</p><p>Watch the video here:<!-- --> <a href="https://youtu.be/uUu9eFNNbjg">https://youtu.be/uUu9eFNNbjg</a></p></div><p><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-rope-sumtree/thumbnail.jpg" width="230" height="150"></p></div>
<p>Going in I knew that data structures to represent text are a favorite topic in text editor circles. I had also used the <code>Rope</code> type in the Zed codebase and knew a little bit about ropes.</p>
<p>What I didn't really understand was how Zed's rope is implemented and what that implementation enables. So I asked Nathan, Max, and Antonio about it. They've been writing code on top, below and inside the rope for years now. And, as it turns out, Zed's rope isn't really a rope, at least not in the classical sense. It's very impressive, but first: what's a rope?</p>
<h2 id="why-not-a-string"><span data-br=":R4nbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Why not a string?</span></h2>
<p>One of the most important things a text editor has to do is to represent text in memory. When you open a file in a text editor, you expect to see its contents and want to navigate through it, and — hey, that's where the name comes from —&nbsp;you also want to <em>edit</em> the text.</p>
<p>To do that, a text editor has to load the file contents into memory — you can't just let the user stare at the raw bytes on disk. You also <em>want</em> to keep it in memory, because not every change should immediately be saved to disk.</p>
<p>So the question is: how do you represent the text in memory?</p>
<p>My naive first choice would be to use a string. Good old string. Our best friend from when we started programming. Why not use a string? It's how we represent text in memory all the time. It's not immediately obvious that that would be a bad choice, right?</p>
<p>Hey, I bet you <em>could</em> go a long way with a string, but there are some problems with strings that prevent them from being the best choice, especially once you start dealing with large files and want your program to still be efficient and responsive.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-strings"><span data-br=":Ranbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Problems with strings</span></h3>
<p>Strings are usually allocated as a continuous block of memory. That can make edits inefficient. Say you have a file with 20k lines in a string and you want to insert a word right in the middle of that string. In order to do that, you have to make room for the new word in the middle of the string, so that you still end up with a string that's a continuous block of memory. And to make room, you have to move all of the text that would come after your newly inserted word. And moving here really means making allocations. In the worst case you have to move everything —&nbsp;all 20k lines —&nbsp;to make room for your new word.</p>
<p>Or say you want to delete a word: you can't just poke a hole in a string, because that would mean it isn't a string — a continuous block of memory — anymore. Instead you have to move all the characters except the ones you deleted, so that you end up with a single, continuous block of memory again, this time without the deleted word.</p>
<p>When dealing with small files and small strings, these aren't problems. We all do similar string operations all day every day, right? Yes, but most of the time we're talking about relatively small strings. When you're dealing with large files and thus large strings or a lot of edits (maybe even at the same time — hello multiple cursors!) these things —&nbsp;allocations, moving strings in memory —&nbsp;become problems.</p>
<p>And that's not even touching on all the other requirements a text editor might have of its text representation.</p>
<p>Navigation, for example. What if the user wants to jump to line 523? With a string and without any other data, you'd have to go through the string, character by character, and count the line breaks in it to find out where in the string line 523 is. And then what if the user presses the down-arrow ten times to go down ten lines and wants to end up in the same column? You'll again have to start counting line breaks in your string and then find the right offset after the last line break.</p>
<p>Or, say you want to draw a horizontal scrollbar at the bottom of your editor. To know how big the scroll thumb has to be, you have to know how long the longest line in the file is. Same thing again: you have to go through the string and count the lines and this time keeping track of the length of each line too.</p>
<p>Or what if the text file you want to load into your editor is larger than 1GB and the language you used to implement your text editor can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length">only represent strings up to 1GB</a>? You might say "1GB of string should be enough for everybody" but that only tells me you haven't talked to enough users of text editors yet.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I think we've established that strings probably aren't the best solution to represent text in a text editor.</p>
<p>So what else can we use?</p>
<h2 id="whats-better-than-a-string"><span data-br=":Rknbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">What's better than a string?</span></h2>
<p>If you really love strings, you might now be thinking "better than a string? easy: multiple strings." And you wouldn't be that far off! Some editors <em>do</em> represent text as an array-of-lines with each line being a string. VS Code's <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/03/23/text-buffer-reimplementation">Monaco editor worked that way for quite a while</a>, but an array of strings can still be plagued by the same problems as a single string. Excessive memory consumption and performance issues made the VS Code team look for something better.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are better things than strings. Builders of text editors have long ago realized that strings aren't the best tool for the job and have come up with other data structures to represent text.</p>
<p>The most popular ones, as far as I can tell, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">gap buffers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table">piece tables</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">ropes</a>.</p>
<p>They each have their pros and cons and I'm not here to compare them in detail. It's enough to know that they are all significantly better than strings and different editors made different decisions in face of different trade-offs and ended up with different data structures. To give you a taste: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buffer-Gap.html">Emacs uses gap buffers</a>, VS Code uses <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/03/23/text-buffer-reimplementation">a twist on piece tables</a>, Vim has <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/memline.c#L15">its own tree data structure</a>, and Helix <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">uses a rope</a>.</p>
<p>Zed, too, uses a rope. So let's take a look at the rope and see what advantages that has over a string.</p>
<h2 id="ropes"><span data-br=":Rqnbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Ropes</span></h2>
<p>Here's how Wikipedia explains what a rope is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A rope is a type of binary tree where each leaf (end node) holds a string and a length (also known as a "weight"), and each node further up the tree holds the sum of the lengths of all the leaves in its left subtree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of a continuous block of memory, a rope is a tree and its leaves are the characters of the text it represents.</p>
<p>Here's what the text <code>"This is a rope"</code> would look like in a rope:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-rope-sumtree/rope.png" alt="A rope representing &quot;This is a rope&quot;"><figcaption>A rope representing "This is a rope"</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>You might now be thinking that this is a lot more complex than a string and you'd be right — it is. But here's the crucial bit that makes this a rope triumph over strings in many cases: the leaves - <code>"This", " is ", "a ", "rope"</code> —&nbsp;are essentially <em>immutable</em>. Instead of modifying strings, you modify the tree. Instead of poking holes in strings and moving parts of it around it memory, you modify the tree to get a new string. And by now, we as programmers have figured out how to efficiently work with trees.</p>
<p>Let's use the example from above again: deleting a word at a certain position in the text. With a string, you'd have to reallocate all of the text that comes after the word, possibly the whole string. With a rope, you find the start and end positions of the word you want to delete, then split the tree at these two positions so you have four trees, you throw away the middle two trees (that only contain the deleted word), concatenate the other two, then rebalance the tree. Yes, <em>it does</em> sound like a lot and it does require some algorithmic finesse under the hood, but the memory and performance improvements over strings are very real: instead of moving things around in memory, you only have to update a few pointers. That might look silly for a text as short as <code>"This is a rope"</code>, but it pays off big time when you have very large texts.</p>
<p>I understand that this is very abstract, so let me show you. Let's take a look at Zed's rope implementation.</p>
<h2 id="zeds-rope-implementation"><span data-br=":R13nbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Zed's rope implementation</span></h2>
<p>Zed has its own rope implementation in its own crate: <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/ae3c641bbee2029fb4588d008e45ddb783593622/crates/rope/src/rope.rs"><code>rope</code></a>. (One reason for why Zed has its own implementation instead of using a library is that a lot of libraries didn't exist when the Zed founders laid the groundwork for Zed in 2017.)</p>
<p>The main type in the <code>rope</code> crate is <code>Rope</code>. Here's how you'd use it:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> rope</span><span> = </span><span>Rope</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World! This is your captain speaking."</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>So far, so similar to <code>String</code>. Now let's say we have two ropes:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> rope1</span><span> = </span><span>Rope</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope1</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> rope2</span><span> = </span><span>Rope</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope2</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"This is your captain speaking."</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>If we want to concatenate them, all we have to do is this:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>rope1</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>rope2</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    rope1</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(),</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    "Hello World! This is your captain speaking."</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>()</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>The call to <code>rope1.append</code> connects the two trees — <code>rope1</code> and <code>rope2</code> —&nbsp;by building a new tree that contains both. That's barely more than updating a few pointers. Compare that to strings: if you concatenate two strings, you'll have to move at least one of them in memory so that they end up next to each, forming a continuous block. Often you have to move both of them, because there's not enough space after the first string. Again: the text in this example is laughably short, but what if someone wants to have ten copies of the 25k line <a href="https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">SQLite amalgamation</a> in a single file?</p>
<p>What about replacing a word?</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>// Construct a rope</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> rope</span><span> = </span><span>Rope</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"One coffee, please. Black, yes."</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>// Replace characters 4 to 10 (0-indexed) with "guinness".</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>..</span><span>10</span><span>, </span><span>"guinness"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(), </span><span>"One guinness, please. Black, yes."</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>What happens under the hood:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>replace()</code> creates a new rope that contains all of the nodes of the original <code>rope</code>, up until the 5th character (<code>c</code>)</li>
<li>the new text, <code>guinness</code>, is appended to the new rope</li>
<li>the rest of the original <code>rope</code>, everything after character 11, is appended to the new rope</li>
</ul>
<p>Deleting a word? Just replace it with <code>""</code>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> rope</span><span> = </span><span>Rope</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"One coffee, please. Black, yes."</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>..</span><span>10</span><span>, </span><span>""</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>These operations are very quick even when dealing with large amounts of text, because then most of the nodes in the tree can be reused and only have to be rewired.</p>
<p>But what happens with the word that was deleted, <code>"coffee"</code>? The leaf nodes that contain these characters will get automatically cleaned up as soon as no other node references them anymore. That's what immutable leaf nodes in ropes enable: when a rope is mutated, or a new rope is constructed from an old one, or two ropes are merged into a new one, essentially all that's changing are references to leaf nodes. And those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">references are counted</a>: as soon as there's no reference to a node anymore, the node gets cleaned up, deallocated.</p>
<p>To be precise and get technical: the leaf nodes, the ones containing the actual text, aren't fully immutable in Zed's rope implementation. These leaf nodes have a maximum length and if, say, text gets appended to a rope and the new text is short enough to fit into the last leaf node without exceeding its maximum length, then that leaf node will be mutated and the text appended to it.</p>
<p>On a conceptual level, though, you can think of the rope as a persistent data structure and its nodes as reference-counted immutable nodes in a tree. That's what makes it a better choice than the string and brings us back to the question we skipped above: why did Zed chose a rope instead of one of the other data structures?</p>
<h2 id="why-use-a-rope-in-zed"><span data-br=":R1mnbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Why use a rope in Zed?</span></h2>
<p>Zed's goal is to be a high-performance code editor. Strings, as we saw, won't get you to high-performance. So what do you use instead? Gap buffers, ropes, piece tables?</p>
<p>There isn't a single, obvious best choice here. It all comes down to specific requirements and trade-offs you're willing to make to meet those requirements.</p>
<p>Maybe you've heard that <a href="https://coredumped.dev/2023/08/09/text-showdown-gap-buffers-vs-ropes/">gap buffers can be faster than ropes</a>, or that they're easier to understand, or that piece tables are more elegant. That may be true, yes, but that still doesn't mean they're an obvious choice over, for example, a rope. Here's what <a href="https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-ng/issues/378#issuecomment-907680382">the author of <code>ropey</code>, a popular rope implementation in Rust, wrote about the performance trade-offs between ropes and gap buffers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ropes make a different performance trade-off, being a sort of "jack of all trades". They're not amazing at anything, but they're always solidly good with <code>O(log N)</code> performance. They're not the best choice for an editor that only supports local editing patterns, since they leave a lot of performance on the table compared to gap buffers in that case (again, even for huge documents). But for an editor that encourages non-localized edits, or just wants flexibility in that regard, they're a great choice because they always have good performance, whereas gap buffers degrade poorly with unfavorable editing patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ropes are "not amazing at anything, but they're always solidly good." It depends on what you want to do, or what you want your editor to be able to do.</p>
<p>So what if you really want to make use of all the cores in your CPU? In <a href="https://coredumped.dev/2023/08/09/text-showdown-gap-buffers-vs-ropes/">"Text showdown: Gap Buffers vs Ropes"</a> concurrency&nbsp;is mentioned in a paragraph at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ropes have other benefits besides good performance. Both Crop and Ropey [note: both are rope implementations in Rust] support concurrent access from multiple threads. This lets you take snapshots to do asynchronous saves, backups, or multi-user edits. This isn't something you could easily do with a gap buffer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/uUu9eFNNbjg">companion video</a> you can hear what Max said about this paragraph: "Yeah, it matters more than any of that other stuff." Nathan added that "we use that all over the place", with "that" being concurrent access, snapshots, multi-user edits, asynchronous operations.</p>
<p>In other words: concurrent access to the text in a buffer was a hard requirement for Zed and that's why the rope ended up being the top choice.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how deeply ingrained concurrent access to text is into Zed: when you edit a buffer in Zed, with syntax highlighting enabled, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/a0fa8a489bb4af98059e5a064c7fac2a77b49aff/crates/language/src/buffer.rs#L1000-L1016">a snapshot of the buffer's text content is sent to a background thread</a> in which it's re-parsed using <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter</a>. That happens on every edit and it's very, very fast and efficient, since the snapshots don't require a full copy of the text. All that's needed is to bump a reference count, because the reference-counting for the nodes in Zed's rope is implemented with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a>, Rust's "thread-safe reference-counting pointer".</p>
<p>That brings us to the most important bit: how Zed's rope is implemented. Because it isn't implemented like the classic rope you see on Wikipedia and its implementation gives Zed's rope certain properties that other rope implementations might not have and that implementation is actually what put the rope ahead of other data structures.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-a-rope-its-a-sumtree"><span data-br=":R22nbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">It's not a rope, it's a SumTree</span></h2>
<p>Zed's rope is not a classic binary-tree rope, it's a SumTree. If you <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/ae3c641bbee2029fb4588d008e45ddb783593622/crates/rope/src/rope.rs#L29">open up the definition of Zed's <code>Rope</code></a>, you'll see that it's nothing more than a <code>SumTree</code> of <code>Chunk</code>s:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>struct</span><span> Rope</span><span> {</span></span>

<p>A <code>Chunk</code> is an <code>ArrayString</code>, which comes from the <a href="https://docs.rs/arrayvec/latest/arrayvec/"><code>arrayvec</code> crate</a> and allows storing strings inline and not on the heap somewhere else. Meaning: a <code>Chunk</code> is a collection of characters. <code>Chunk</code>s are the leafs in the SumTree and contain <em>at most</em> <code>2 * CHUNK_BASE</code> characters. In release builds of Zed, <code>CHUNK_BASE</code> is <code>64</code>.</p>
<p>So then what is a SumTree? Ask Nathan and he'll say that the SumTree is "the soul of Zed". But a slightly more technical description of a SumTree is this:</p>
<p>A <code>SumTree&lt;T&gt;</code> is a B+ tree in which each leaf node contains multiple items of type <code>T</code> and a <code>Summary</code> for each <code>Item</code>. Internal nodes contain a <code>Summary</code> of the items in its subtree.</p>
<p>And here are the type definitions to match, which you can <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/6721c91ab000cea73ab30209c4a57bd1e2e2ce56/crates/sum_tree/src/sum_tree.rs#L37">find in the <code>sum_tree</code> crate</a>:</p>

<p>So what's a <code>Summary</code>? Anything you want! The only requirement is that you need to be able to add multiple summaries together, to create a sum of summaries:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>But I know you just rolled your eyes at that, so let's make it more concrete.</p>
<p>Since the <code>Rope</code> is a <code>SumTree</code> and each item in the SumTree has to have a summary, here's the <code>Summary</code> that's associated with each node in Zed's <code>Rope</code>:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>All nodes in the SumTree — internal and leaf nodes —&nbsp;have such a summary, containing information about its subtree. The leaf nodes have a summary of their <code>Chunk</code>s and the internal nodes have a summary that is <em>the sum of the summaries of its child nodes</em>, recursively down the tree.</p>
<p>Let's say we have the following text:</p>
<div><pre><code>Hello World!
This is
your captain speaking.
Are you
ready for take-off?
</code></pre></div>
<p>5 lines of text. If this is pushed into a Zed <code>Rope</code>, the <code>SumTree</code> beneath the <code>Rope</code> would look like this, simplified:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-rope-sumtree/sumtree_diagram.png" alt="A SumTree representing &quot;Hello World!\nThis is\nyour captain speaking.\nAre you\nready for take-off?\n&quot; with some summary fields left out"><figcaption>A SumTree representing "Hello World!\nThis is\nyour captain speaking.\nAre you\nready for take-off?\n" with some summary fields left out</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>(I left out some of the fields of <code>TextSummary</code> to keep the diagram small-ish and also adjusted the maximum size of the chunks and maximum number of children per node. In a release-build of Zed, all five lines of the text would fit in a single node.)</p>
<p>Even with only three summary fields — <code>len</code>, <code>lines</code>, <code>longest_row_chars</code> —&nbsp;we can see that the summaries of the internal nodes are the sum of their child nodes summaries.</p>
<p>The root node's summary tells us about the complete text, the complete <code>Rope</code>: 72 characters, 5 lines, and the longest line has 22 characters (<code>your captain speaking.\n</code>). The internal nodes tell is about parts of the text. The left internal node here tells us, for example, that it's <code>38</code> characters from <code>"Hell"</code> to <code>"spea"</code> (including newline characters) and that there are two line breaks in that part of the text.</p>
<p>Okay, you might be thinking, a B+ tree with summarized summaries —&nbsp;what does that buy us?</p>
<h2 id="traversing-a-sumtree"><span data-br=":R2onbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Traversing a SumTree</span></h2>
<p>The SumTree is a concurrency-friendly B-tree that not only gives us a persistent, copy-on-write data structure to represent text, but through its summaries it also indexes the data in the tree and allows us to traverse the tree along dimensions of the summaries in <code>O(log n)</code> time.</p>
<p>In Max's words, the SumTree is "not conceptually a map. It's more like a <code>Vec</code> that has these special indexing features where you can store any sequence of items you want. You decide the order and it just provides these capabilities to seek and slice."</p>
<p>Don't think of it as a tree that allows you to lookup values associated with keys (although it <em>can</em> do that), but think of it as a tree that allows you lookup items based on the summaries of each item and all the items that come before it in the tree.</p>
<p>Or, in other words: the items in a SumTree are ordered. Their summaries are also ordered. The SumTree allows you find any item in the tree in <code>O(log N)</code> time by traversing the tree from root to leaf node and deciding which node to visit based on the node's summary.</p>
<p>Say we have a <code>Rope</code> with three lines of text in it:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> rope</span><span> = </span><span>Rope</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"Line one.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"This is the second line.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"This is three.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>Once the <code>Rope</code> is constructed, it looks like this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-rope-sumtree/sumtree_three_lines.png" alt="A SumTree representing &quot;Line one.\nThis is the second line.\nThis is three.\n&quot; with some summary fields left out"><figcaption>A SumTree representing "Line one.\nThis is the second line.\nThis is three.\n" with some summary fields left out</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Like we said above: each leaf node will hold multiple <code>Chunk</code>s and each leaf node's summary will contain information about the text in its <code>Chunk</code>s. The type of that summary is <code>TextSummary</code> from above. That means each node's summary can tell us about the <code>len</code> of the text in its chunks, the lines &amp; rows in them, the longest line, and all the other fields of <code>TextSummary</code>. The internal nodes in the SumTree then contain summaries of the summaries.</p>
<p>And since the items in the tree — internal nodes, leaf nodes, chunks —&nbsp;are <em>ordered</em> we can traverse that tree very efficiently, because the SumTree allows us to <em>traverse the tree based on the values in the summaries</em>. It allows us to seek along a single <em>dimension</em>, a single field for example, of a given summary.</p>
<p>Say we want to find out what the line and column in the rope is at the absolute offset <code>26</code>. Meaning: what's at character 26? In order to find out, we can traverse this three-line <code>rope</code> along the <code>len</code> field of the <code>TextSummary</code>. Because the <code>len</code> field, when added up from left to right, <em>is</em> an absolute offset. So in order to find what's at absolute offset <code>26</code>, we traverse down the tree, taking left or right turns, depending on the <code>len</code> value in the summaries of the internal nodes, until we end up at the leaf node we want:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> point</span><span> = </span><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>offset_to_point</span><span>(</span><span>26</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>.row, </span><span>1</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>.column, </span><span>16</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>On the surface, the call to <code>rope.offset_to_point(26)</code> converts an absolute 0-based offset (<code>26</code>) into a row and column (<code>1</code> and <code>16</code>). What happens inside of <code>offset_to_point</code> is that a cursor traverses the SumTree until it finds the items where the aggregated <code>len</code> of the <code>TextSummary</code> is <code>&gt;= 26</code>. Once it found the first leaf node where that's true, it finds the exact chunk where the offset matches and parks the cursor there. On the way there, it not only kept counting the <code>len</code> field of the summaries it came across, but it also aggregated the <code>lines</code> field, which contains <code>row</code> and <code>column</code>. Neat, right?</p>
<p>Here's what I just described but in actual code, here's the <code>offset_to_point</code> method on the <code>Rope</code>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>fn</span><span> offset_to_point</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>offset</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Point</span><span> {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>        return</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>summary</span><span>().lines;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> mut</span><span> cursor</span><span> = </span><span>self</span><span>.chunks.</span><span>cursor</span><span>::&lt;(</span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>Point</span><span>)&gt;();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    cursor</span><span>.</span><span>seek</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>offset</span><span>, </span><span>Bias</span><span>::</span><span>Left</span><span>, &amp;());</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> overshoot</span><span> = </span><span>offset</span><span> - </span><span>cursor</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>().</span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    cursor</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>().</span><span>1</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        + </span><span>cursor</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>What it does is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>sanity checks that the offset isn't past the end of the whole <code>Rope</code></li>
<li>creates a cursor that seeks along the <code>usize</code> (offset) and <code>Point</code> (a <code>Point</code> is a struct with two fields: <code>row</code> and <code>column</code>) dimensions, aggregating both while doing that</li>
<li>once it found an item at <code>offset</code>, it calculates the overshoot: the <code>offset</code> we're looking for might be in the middle of a single chunk and <code>cursor.start().0</code> is the <code>usize</code> (offset) at the start of a given chunk</li>
<li>take the lines up to the start of the current chunk (<code>cursor.start().1</code>) — which is the summary of <code>TextSummary.len</code> of the complete tree to the left of the current item!</li>
<li>add them to the lines at the offset in the, possibly, middle of the chunk (<code>chunk.offset_to_point(overshoot)</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most interesting bit here is, of course, the cursor that's constructed with <code>self.chunks.cursor::&lt;(usize, Point)&gt;()</code>. This particular cursor has two dimensions and allows you to seek to a value on one dimension (<code>usize</code>) in the given <code>SumTree</code> and in the same operation also get the sum of the second dimension, the <code>Point</code>, at a particular cursor position.</p>
<p>The beauty of that is that it can do that in <code>O(log N)</code> time, because each internal node contains a summary of summaries (meaning: the total <code>len</code> of all items in its subtree in this case) and it can skip over all of those where <code>len &lt; 26</code>. In the diagram above, you can see that we don't even have to traverse the first two leaf nodes.</p>
<p>Isn't that amazing? There's more.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-sumtree"><span data-br=":R3dnbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Using the SumTree</span></h2>
<p>You can also traverse the <code>SumTree</code> the other way around, seeking along lines/rows and getting the final offset:</p>

<p>This seeking along one dimension and aggregating (summarizing!) along multiple dimensions is made possible by some <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/6721c91ab000cea73ab30209c4a57bd1e2e2ce56/crates/sum_tree/src/sum_tree.rs#L43-L94">very clever Rust code</a> that I won't explain in detail, but the short version is this.</p>
<p>Given a <code>TextSummary</code> like the following (which we already saw in full above) and a <code>ChunkSummary</code> that wraps it...</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>struct</span><span> TextSummary</span><span> {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    text</span><span>: </span><span>TextSummary</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>... we can define the <code>len</code> and <code>lines</code> fields as <code>sum_tree::Dimensions</code>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>impl</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt; </span><span>sum_tree</span><span>::</span><span>Dimension</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>ChunkSummary</span><span>&gt; </span><span>for</span><span> usize</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    fn</span><span> add_summary</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> self</span><span>, </span><span>summary</span><span>: &amp;'</span><span>a</span><span> ChunkSummary</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>: &amp;()) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        *</span><span>self</span><span> += </span><span>summary</span><span>.text.len;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>impl</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>&gt; </span><span>sum_tree</span><span>::</span><span>Dimension</span><span>&lt;'</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>ChunkSummary</span><span>&gt; </span><span>for</span><span> Point</span><span> {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>        *</span><span>self</span><span> += </span><span>summary</span><span>.text.lines;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>With that we can then <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/6721c91ab000cea73ab30209c4a57bd1e2e2ce56/crates/sum_tree/src/sum_tree.rs#L323-L329">construct cursors</a> for a given <code>sum_tree::Dimension</code> or a <em>tuple of dimensions</em> (which is what we did above with <code>(usize, Point)</code>).</p>
<p>Once constructed, the cursor can then seek along any <code>Dimension</code> we have defined and aggregate either the complete <code>TextSummary</code> or just a single <code>Dimension</code> of a given summary type.</p>
<p>Or we can also seek along a single dimension and then get the whole summary once the cursor has found the target:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> rope</span><span> = </span><span>Rope</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"This is the first line.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"This is the second line.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>"This is the third line.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>// Construct cursor:</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mut</span><span> cursor</span><span> = </span><span>rope</span><span>.</span><span>cursor</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>// Seek it to offset 55 and get the `TextSummary` at that offset:</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> summary</span><span> = </span><span>cursor</span><span>.</span><span>summary</span><span>::&lt;</span><span>TextSummary</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>55</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>summary</span><span>.len, </span><span>55</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>summary</span><span>.lines, </span><span>Point</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>6</span><span>));</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>summary</span><span>.longest_row_chars, </span><span>24</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>The cursor stopped in the middle of line 2, at column 6, and up until that location the <code>longest_row_chars</code> in the summaries was <code>24</code>.</p>
<p>This is very, very powerful stuff. To scratch the surface: it allows us to easily convert between UTF8 rows/columns and UTF16 rows/columns, which is <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/10/12/lsp-could-have-been-better.html#Coordinates">sometimes required when working with the language server protocol (LSP)</a>. Just seek to a UTF8 <code>Point</code> and aggregate the UTF16 <code>Points</code>:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>fn</span><span> point_to_point_utf16</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>point</span><span>: </span><span>Point</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>PointUtf16</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    if</span><span> point</span><span> &gt;= </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>summary</span><span>().lines {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        return</span><span> self</span><span>.</span><span>summary</span><span>().</span><span>lines_utf16</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> mut</span><span> cursor</span><span> = </span><span>self</span><span>.chunks.</span><span>cursor</span><span>::&lt;(</span><span>Point</span><span>, </span><span>PointUtf16</span><span>)&gt;();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    cursor</span><span>.</span><span>seek</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>Bias</span><span>::</span><span>Left</span><span>, &amp;());</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    // ... you know the rest ...</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>But there's more and I could go on and on and on and show more examples or use big words like <a href="https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_02.html">monoid homomorphism</a>, but I'll stop here. You get the idea — the <code>SumTree</code>, a thread-safe, snapshot-friendly, copy-on-write B+ tree is very powerful and can be used for more than "just" text, which is why it's everywhere in Zed. Yes, literally.</p>
<h2 id="everythings-a-sumtree"><span data-br=":R3vnbrrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Everything's a SumTree</span></h2>
<p>Currently there are <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/zed-industries/zed%24+lang:rust+content:%22:+SumTree%3C%22&amp;patternType=keyword&amp;sm=0">over 20 uses of the <code>SumTree</code> in Zed</a>. The <code>SumTree</code> is not only used as the basis for the <code>Rope</code>, but in many different places. The list of files in a project is a <code>SumTree</code>. The information returned by <code>git blame</code> is stored in a <code>SumTree</code>. Messages in the chat channel: <code>SumTree</code>. Diagnostics: <code>SumTree</code>.</p>
<p>At the very core of Zed sits a data structured called <code>DisplayMap</code> that contains all the information about how a given buffer of text should be displayed —&nbsp;where the folds go, which lines wrap, where the inlay hints are displayed, ... —&nbsp;and it looks like this:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>struct</span><span> DisplayMap</span><span> {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    /// Decides where the [`Inlay`]s should be displayed.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    inlay_map</span><span>: </span><span>InlayMap</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /// Decides where the fold indicators should be and tracks parts of a source file that are currently folded.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    fold_map</span><span>: </span><span>FoldMap</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /// Keeps track of hard tabs in a buffer.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    tab_map</span><span>: </span><span>TabMap</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /// Handles soft wrapping.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    wrap_map</span><span>: </span><span>Model</span><span>&lt;</span><span>WrapMap</span><span>&gt;,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /// Tracks custom blocks such as diagnostics that should be displayed within buffer.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    block_map</span><span>: </span><span>BlockMap</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /// Regions of text that should be highlighted.</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    text_highlights</span><span>: </span><span>TextHighlights</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /// Regions of inlays that should be highlighted.</span></span>

<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    // [...]</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>Guess what? All of these use a <code>SumTree</code> under the hood and in a future post we will explore them, but the point I want to make now is this:</p>
<p>The Zed co-founders didn't so much decide to use a rope over a gap buffer or over a piece table. They started with the <code>SumTree</code>, recognized how powerful it is, how it fits Zed's requirements, and then built the rope on top of it.</p>
<p>The rope may be at the heart of Zed, but the SumTree is, to quote Nathan again, "the soul of Zed".</p><hr></article></div></div>]]></description>

Come on... don't they know what I'm asking?</p><p>Let's just get to the answer:</p><pre><code>  ollama run llama3
</code></pre>
&gt; how is Cloudflare backed by governments?<pre><code>  Cloudflare has partnerships with various government agencies around the world to help improve internet security, stability, and overall performance. Here are some examples:

  1. *US Department of Defense (DoD): Cloudflare is a certified provider for the DoD's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC).

  2. *UK Government*: Cloudflare is a partner with the UK Government's Cabinet Office, supporting their efforts to improve internet security and stability in the UK.

  3. *European Union's (EU) Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA)*: Cloudflare collaborates with ENISA, the EU's cybersecurity agency, to help prevent and respond to cyber threats across Europe.

  4. *Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)*: Cloudflare is a partner with ASD, Australia's premier cybersecurity agency, supporting their efforts to improve internet security and stability in Australia.

  5. *Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE)*: Cloudflare collaborates with CSE, Canada's national cyber security authority, to help protect Canadian interests online.

  These partnerships often involve:

  1. *Security research*: Cloudflare works with government agencies to identify and mitigate emerging threats, such as DDoS attacks, malware, and other types of cyber attacks.

  2. *Cybersecurity training*: Cloudflare provides training and education to government officials, security personnel, and industry professionals on best practices for cybersecurity and cloud-based services.

  3. *Technology development*: Cloudflare collaborates with governments on developing new technologies and solutions to address specific cybersecurity challenges, such as combating online terrorism or protecting critical infrastructure.

  4. *Incident response*: In the event of a significant cyber incident, Cloudflare works closely with government agencies to respond quickly and effectively, minimizing the impact on affected organizations.

  These partnerships demonstrate the trust and confidence governments have in Cloudflare's ability to help protect their interests online. By  working together, they can create safer, more secure, and more resilient internet ecosystems for everyone.
</code></pre>
&gt; how does Cloudflare partner with DoD? Answer in a single paragraph<pre><code>  Cloudflare partners with the US Department of Defense (DoD) through various initiatives, including Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), joint cybersecurity initiatives, research and development projects, training and education programs, incident response and recovery efforts, and market research and analysis. Specifically, Cloudflare collaborates with the DoD on threat hunting and cloud security solutions, develops AI-powered tools for detecting and responding to cyber threats, provides secure cloud storage and compute services tailored to the DoD's needs, offers training and education to DoD personnel on best practices for cybersecurity, cloud-based services, and threat hunting techniques, responds quickly and effectively in the event of significant cyber incidents, and analyzes emerging cybersecurity trends and threats to inform the DoD's security strategies and investments.
</code></pre>
&gt; how much does dod pay cloudflare<pre><code>  I couldn't find exact figures on how much the US Department of Defense (DoD) pays Cloudflare, as this information is likely classified or not publicly disclosed. However, I can provide some context:

  1. *Cloudflare's revenue*: In 2020, Cloudflare reported $185 million in revenue, which was a 52% increase from 2019.

  2. *Defense spending*: The DoD has a significant budget for cybersecurity and cloud services. For example, the DoD's 2022 budget request included $15.4 billion for "Cybersecurity" and $3.8 billion for "Cloud Computing Services".

  3. *Cloudflare's defense contracts*: Cloudflare has secured several defense-related contracts with the DoD, including a $40 million contract in 2019 to provide cloud security services to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Another example is a $20 million contract in 2020 to develop an AI-powered threat detection system for the US Air Force.
</code></pre>
I could go on...<p>What might be scarier is I learned this information from reading regular news articles maybe 5-6 years ago, so I've known for a long time that Cloudflare was vaguely involved with, or at least sold services to the U.S. federal government and military. But in 2024 it's very hard to find anything detailed through Google or DuckDuckGo, or even Wikipedia. You can find it on Cloudflare's website when they want to use it for marketing:</p><p>“Cloudflare has long served the most technical, security-aware agencies like the FBI and U.S Department of State,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder &amp; CEO of Cloudflare.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://cloudflare.net/news/news-details/2022/Cloudflare-Earns-FedRAMP-Moderate-Authorization-to-Further-Help-Government-Agencies-Modernize-and-Secure-U.S.-Infrastructure/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://cloudflare.net/news/news-details/2022/Cloudflare-Ear...</a></p><p>But I like that the LLM is able to really grab the information in a way search engines are getting worse at (through censorship and other algorithmic pressures).

If they did that, they'd have to keep your CVC on file too, and that would end with them losing their certificate to process credit cards entirely. So that probably didn't happen.</p><p>Another way it could've gone down is if the payment provider is unchanged. I.e. Google processed payments through global collect and handed your subscription IDs to square space. Now there is no need to pass credit card information as the collecting party hasn't changed. Only the person triggering the collection.</p><p>That's just an example however, I don't work for Google nor am i involved in this migration.

I'd wait at least that long after the tld servers update before dropping the zone on the old server. But you may want to wait much longer, because some DNS servers cache some records for an unreasonable amount of time. If you can change the NS records on the old servers to point at your new ones, that might help, but it might not. I don't know how much effort you want to put into keeping things working on servers that act unreasonable.

Of course, as others have alluded to you can also just use them as a registrar and define other nameservers.

A concrete example: When trying to register aucky.com [for an auction site], a domain resulting from brainstorming and creation, previously non-existent, I was informed that it was a premium domain and therefore subject to other acquisition conditions. I did not accept it and had to content myself with the registration under my country's TLD, which has less punch than a pure .com. My failed domain is up for grabs in the premium market, and the issue will have to be settled in court. This is almost criminal and it has to stop.</span></p></div></td></tr>
