<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>In early May, OpenAI announced </span><a href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/openai-for-countries/" rel="">OpenAI for Countries</a><span>. Referencing their </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/" rel="">Stargate</a><span> effort to build massive AI data centers in Texas and elsewhere in the United States, they wrote:</span></p><blockquote><p>It’s clear to everyone now that this kind of infrastructure is going to be the backbone of future economic growth and national development. [...] This is a moment when we need to act to support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails, and provide a clear alternative to authoritarian versions of AI that would deploy it to consolidate power.</p></blockquote><p><span>So far, so straightforward. Paraphrasing: national governments are realizing that 1) large clusters of AI compute are a key input to having a strong AI ecosystem, and 2) having a strong AI ecosystem will be a major determinant of national power in the coming decades. So they want OpenAI to help them build computing clusters, and OpenAI wants to help because yay, democratic AI, </span><a href="https://openai.com/about/" rel="">benefiting humanity</a><span>, what’s not to like.</span></p><p>When I saw this announcement, I knew that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was accompanying President Trump on a trip to the Gulf the following week, and I knew that OpenAI had been talking to Gulf governments about compute deals for a long time. It was not hard to connect the potential dots.</p><p><span>Still, I thought to myself, surely it would be too brazen to do a deal with the UAE or Saudi Arabia under this new “democratic AI” initiative. Or at the very least, if they did want to try to sell it this way, surely they would announce </span><em>one</em><span> deal with an actual democracy first.</span></p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>The week after returning from the Gulf, OpenAI announced a major new partnership to build large-scale AI data centers in the UAE. The partnership, they write, is “rooted in democratic values.”</p><p>Let’s take a quick look at the UAE’s democratic bona fides.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/" rel="">Freedom House</a><span> is an independent nonprofit that has released an annual assessment of countries’ civil liberties and political rights for the last 50 years. Their </span><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/scores" rel="">2024 report</a><span> gives the UAE a score of 18/100, lower than Haiti, Zimbabwe, and Iraq.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The UAE </span><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-arab-emirates/freedom-world/2024#PR" rel="">political system</a><span> grants its hereditary monarchy “a monopoly on power.” Political parties are banned. Candidates can run in elections as independents, but cannot meaningfully challenge the system. Representatives are only elected to half the seats of an advisory council, where the other half of the seats are filled by government appointees, and the council has no real legislative power in any case.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Criticizing the government is </span><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-arab-emirates/freedom-world/2024#CL" rel="">banned</a><span>. Political candidates and activists who advocate for human rights or political reform are </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/uae-nearly-a-decade-of-unjust-imprisonment-for-uae-94-dissidents-2/" rel="">imprisoned</a><span>, often in </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/07/uae-scores-convicted-in-sham-mass-trial-violating-fundamental-legal-principles/" rel="">mass trials</a><span> carried out without due process. The government systematically surveils and punishes </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/12/22/uae-unrelenting-harassment-dissidents-families" rel="">family members</a><span> of imprisoned dissidents.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Media outlets self-censor, are </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/united-arab-emirates/#report-toc__section-2__subsection-1" rel="">actively censored</a><span> by the government, or face being </span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/01/24/al-roeya-newspaper-uae-press-freedom-uncomfortable-question/" rel="">shut down</a><span>. Textbooks and school curriculums are censored by the government.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Around 90% of the UAE population is made up of migrant workers with no political rights. These workers are often subject to </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/03/questions-and-answers-migrant-worker-abuses-uae-and-cop28" rel="">labor abuses</a><span> such as having their passports confiscated, wages withheld, and being forced to work in extreme heat. One human rights organization </span><a href="https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/united-arab-emirates/" rel="">claims</a><span> that the UAE has the 7th highest prevalence of modern slavery in the world.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This is not controversial. Refer to </span><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-arab-emirates/freedom-world/2024" rel="">Freedom House</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/united-arab-emirates/report-united-arab-emirates/" rel="">Amnesty International</a><span>, the </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/united-arab-emirates/" rel="">State Department</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates" rel="">Wikipedia</a><span> for more.</span></p><p>Maybe it’s supposed to be obvious that this talk of democracy is a facade. Obviously OpenAI wants as much compute as it can get, and partnering with the UAE gets them money, energy, and permitting they couldn’t get elsewhere. Maybe we’re supposed to see through the spin and go on with our day.</p><p><span>But they’re really trying quite hard to sell this as promoting democracy. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global affairs, attempted to make the case in </span><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5319030-the-false-choice-threatening-americas-lead-on-ai/" rel="">The Hill</a><span> last week. Some excerpts:</span></p><blockquote><p>Ensuring that democratic values shape the future of AI is the most urgent challenge of our time, and we need to seize this moment and think big, act big and build big — both here and abroad — to ensure that it prevails over authoritarian AI in the competition over the technology’s future.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Many countries are navigating complex choices as they evaluate what kind of AI systems — and what kinds of values — they wish to adopt. Supporting these nations is not just about competition. It is about offering a meaningful alternative: a version of AI development that upholds individual rights, resists central control and aligns with the long-standing principles of transparency and fairness embedded in the international system.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If the U.S. doesn’t engage with countries looking to build AI, autocrats will step in to fill that void — and core freedoms may fall by the wayside.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As part of this effort, the UAE — a close American ally and leader in the global push to develop renewable, economically viable sources of energy — will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide, giving people across the country the ability to access OpenAI’s technology.</p></blockquote><p>If I try to be charitable, I can glean two lines of argument in Lehane’s piece and other OpenAI comments on the deal:</p><ol><li><p>American AI embodies democratic values, so giving it to more people spreads democracy.</p></li><li><p>The US is a democracy and China isn’t, so anything that helps the US “win” the AI “race” is good for democracy.</p></li></ol><p>I don’t think these two arguments are a good summary of the situation.</p><p><strong>Argument 1</strong><span> is probably true-ish in extreme cases, but not particularly relevant here.</span></p><p><span>AI systems can certainly embody more or less democratic values, depending on their training data, what behavior they were </span><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/how-developers-steer-language-model-outputs-large-language-models-explained-part-2/" rel="">fine-tuned</a><span> towards, and what kinds of </span><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/controlling-large-language-models-a-primer/" rel="">filters and censors</a><span> are built around them. Hypothetically, if a country went from prohibiting access to uncensored AI chatbots to allowing it, that could be a win for democratic values, freedom of information, etc. Or hypothetically, if a company provided access to pro-democracy AI tools against the wishes of a non-democratic government, that could be valuable; the benefits would likely be modest if residents still weren’t allowed to criticize their government, be elected to actual governing bodies, or be tried in a fair court, but perhaps it could help shift the country in a democratic direction over the long term.</span></p><p><span>But there’s nothing to indicate this deal is trying to realize either of those hypotheticals. I honestly don’t know how to parse OpenAI’s boast that “the UAE will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide.” Was ChatGPT previously restricted in the UAE? Do the US, Australia, Canada, etc. not have ChatGPT “enabled” nationwide? What does this even mean?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-164818379" href="https://helentoner.substack.com/p/supercomputers-for-autocrats#footnote-1-164818379" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>And there’s no sign that OpenAI plans to stick their neck out to make ChatGPT more democratic than other AI tools UAE residents have access to (which, as far as I know, include other US offerings like Gemini, Claude, and Llama). If anything, it might be the opposite. COO Brad Lightcap was asked recently whether it was safe to assume that ChatGPT in the UAE would uphold the “red lines” that prevent media from criticizing the royal family and other sensitive topics. His answer: “Well, we don’t know. We’ve got to work on this together in partnership with the country.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-164818379" href="https://helentoner.substack.com/p/supercomputers-for-autocrats#footnote-2-164818379" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>What a farce.</p><p><strong>Argument 2</strong><span>, about “winning” the “race,” could be more compelling. In theory, I get it. Compute is a big driver of AI success, but it’s hard to build big data centers in the US right now. If other countries can provide funding, energy, and permitting, then US companies get more compute, build better AI, and beat China. Great.</span></p><p>But thinking solely about the US and China misses one of the biggest implications of this deal. Let’s look at some more excerpts from the Lehane piece:</p><blockquote><p>Countries that build the most AI infrastructure today will reap the greatest rewards in the coming Intelligence Age.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Only the U.S. and China have the resources and capacity to shape the future trajectory of AI and determine whether it advances in ways that protect freedom, dignity and human agency or whether it becomes a tool of surveillance and repression.</p></blockquote><p>And let’s also return to the quote from the top of this post:</p><blockquote><p>It’s clear to everyone now that this kind of infrastructure is going to be the backbone of future economic growth and national development.</p></blockquote><p><span>These quotes get at what I think is actually the most important force here: </span><strong>large-scale compute is becoming an important driver of national power</strong><span>. In particular, access to world-class </span><a href="https://epoch.ai/data/ai-supercomputers" rel="">AI supercomputers</a><span> (comprising hundreds of thousands of the most advanced AI accelerators) is becoming an important driver of national power. Because of this, I agree that it is a very good thing for the US to have more AI compute, including more AI supercomputers, than China.</span></p><p>But if you take this argument seriously at all, the implication of the UAE deal becomes plain: this is a significant power boost for the UAE’s autocratic government. Public materials about the deals are very vague about who has what kind of ownership and usage rights of the compute, but it’s obvious that the UAE would not want to spend this amount of money if they weren’t getting significant access to—or ownership of—the chips in question.</p><p><span>The above excerpts from Lehane’s piece make it clear that the company knows very well that this deal empowers the UAE to be a big player in AI. Which means that when I read this from Lehane: “Only the U.S. and China have the resources and capacity to shape the future trajectory of AI…” I’m tempted to finish the sentence for him: “...and so it’s clear that the most democratic thing for us to do is equip a third country—an </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uae-intelligence-chief-ai-money/" rel="">AI-obsessed</a><span>, wealthy, energy-rich autocracy—with the main ingredient it was lacking to become a global AI heavyweight: </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-13/us-weighs-letting-uae-buy-over-a-million-advanced-nvidia-chips" rel="">hundreds of thousands</a><span> of leading-edge AI chips.”</span></p><p><span>Making semiconductor deals with Gulf countries is not inherently a bad thing. Most of the details of OpenAI’s UAE deal and the flurry of similar deals announced a few weeks ago are not public (and in many cases </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-uae-multi-billion-dollar-ai-data-campus-deal-far-finalised-sources-say-2025-06-06/" rel="">not yet finalized</a><span>). The United States has a long history of partnering with Gulf autocrats for national security reasons, and there are </span><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/05/ai-chip-trump-gulf-uae-saudi-security-risk-good-deal" rel="">versions of these deals</a><span> that could have more benefits than costs from a hard-nosed realpolitik perspective. The details of the chip quantities involved, ownership/usage rights, and protections against technology transfer to China are all major factors in whether it will look in retrospect like the US made smart deals or got played.</span></p><p>But even the very best version of a Stargate UAE deal would, by definition, be under terms that are agreeable to the UAE royal family. This should be a clue that this partnership is not destined to be a powerful force for democracy.</p><p><span>If OpenAI were a regular for-profit company, maybe their spin around this deal wouldn’t matter so much. If AI were a less consequential technology, it certainly wouldn’t matter so much. But OpenAI is, as they keep reminding us, a </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/" rel="">mission-driven nonprofit</a><span> aiming to build </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/" rel="">incredibly powerful technology</a><span>. Their mission, “to ensure AI benefits all of humanity,” sometimes gets paraphrased as building safe AGI. But that’s a huge simplification—figuring out what it could look like to develop incredibly powerful, world-transforming technology in a way that actually benefits everyone is far more complicated than just “make it safe” and “build it in the US.”</span></p><p>The question of who has access to and control over powerful AI systems is absolutely central to who will benefit from them. Building increasingly advanced AI in a way that doesn't widen existing power gaps, entrench autocracies, and disempower regular people is a civilizational-scale open question. Trying to pitch Stargate UAE as a democratic project gives us a window into how unseriously OpenAI is treating these challenges.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>If you just want the answer to the question posed in the title, click the TLDR below and then move on with your day. Otherwise, buckle in, we’re going debugging; this post is mostly about my thought process and techniques I used to arrive at the answer rather than the answer itself.</p><details><summary><b>TLDR:</b> Just tell me why CDC Ethernet doesn't work on Android</summary><br>Android's EthernetTracker service only acknowledges interfaces that are named <tt>ethX</tt>; Linux's CDC Ethernet drivers create interfaces that are named <tt>usbX</tt>. There is no way to work around this, short of rooting the phone to change the value of <tt>config_ethernet_iface_regex</tt>.</details><p>Android contains support for USB ethernet adapters. There’s even menus for them!</p><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/connection-settings.jpg" alt="Android connection settings, with 'Ethernet' greyed out" title="Android connection settings, with 'Ethernet' greyed out"></p><p>This means that if you very carefully select a USB Ethernet adapter that you know has a chipset compatible with your Android device, you can plug it in and these settings will spring to life. How do you know what chipsets are compatible with your phone?</p><p>Hearsay!</p><p>I’m not entirely kidding. If the company that you bought your phone from sells a USB ethernet adapter as an accessory to it, you have a pretty good chance of that one working. Otherwise, it’s hit-or-miss; phone manufacturers rarely, if ever, publish lists of supported Ethernet adapters. The best you’re going to get is finding a forum post from someone that has the same phone as you saying that they bought a particular adapter that worked, and hoping you can find the same thing to buy.</p><p>Or is it?</p><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/i-know-this.jpg" alt="This is a Linux system... I know this" title="This is a Linux system... I know this"></p><p>As you may know, if you dig deep beneath Android’s Googly carapace, you’ll find a Linux kernel. To build the Linux kernel, you must first configure it. This configuration determines what features and hardware the resulting kernel will support. Thus, the list of Ethernet adapters supported by your phone will more-or-less correspond to those selected in the kernel configuration for your phone, although it’s possible (but unlikely) that your phone’s manufacturer doesn’t ship all of the drivers that they build, or that they build additional third-party drivers separately.</p><p>So, in order to figure out what Ethernet adapters your phone supports, you’re going to want to find your phone’s kernel configuration. How do we do that?</p><h3 id="first-enable-usb-debugging-and-install-adb">First, enable USB debugging and install ADB</h3><p>If you’d like to follow along with this blog post, you’re going to need enable USB debugging and to install ADB (Android Debug Bridge) — this is a command-line tool that is used by developers to interact with Android devices. In this post, we will be using it to run shell commands on a phone.</p><p>There’s good documentation elsewhere on how to do these things so I’m not going to waste time by rewriting it poorly. Instead, have some links:</p><ol><li>First, <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#Enable-debugging">enable USB debugging</a> on your phone</li><li><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/">Install ADB</a> on your computer</li><li>Run <code>adb shell</code>, which will give you a shell prompt on the phone.</li></ol><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/im-in.jpg" alt="I'm in" title="I'm in"></p><p>Congratulations, you can now run commands on your phone. Type <code>exit</code> and press enter when you’re ready to exit the ADB shell.</p><p>Next, we need to switch things up so that ADB connects to the phone over the network, instead of via USB. We need to do this because we’re going to try plugging some network adapters into the phone’s USB port, so we can’t also use the port for debugging.</p><p>With your phone connected to your computer via USB:</p><ol><li>Connect your phone to the same network as your computer via wifi</li><li>Figure out your phone’s IP address - you can do this by digging around the Settings app, or you can try <code>adb shell ifconfig wlan0</code></li><li>With the phone still connected via USB, run <code>adb tcpip 5555</code></li><li>Disconnect the USB cable from the phone</li><li>Reconnect to the phone by running <code>adb connect YOUR_PHONE_IP:5555</code> (replacing YOUR_PHONE_IP with the IP address from the phone)</li><li>Try <code>adb shell</code> to make sure it still works</li></ol><p>Once you have ADB working over the network, you can proceed with trying to figure out what version of the kernel your Android device is running.</p><h3 id="if-you-have-a-newer-phone">If you have a newer phone…</h3><p>These days, Google publishes an <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/android-common">Android Common Kernel</a>, which downstream phone manufacturers are required to derive their kernels from. The source to this kernel is hosted in a <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/">Git repository at googlesource.com</a>.</p><p>If your phone shipped with Android 11 or later, you have something called a <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/generic-kernel-image">GKI kernel</a> - in this case, Google builds the kernel and the phone manufacturer puts all of their model-specific secret sauce into kernel modules. In this case, you can find the configuration that Google is using by navigating to the appropriate branch of the kernel repository, and looking at the file <code>arch/$ARCH/configs/gki_defconfig</code>, where <code>$ARCH</code> is the processor architecture of your phone. For example, if your phone has a 64-bit ARM processor (and it almost certainly does) then you will find this configuration at <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-mainline/arch/arm64/configs/gki_defconfig"><code>arch/arm64/configs/gki_defconfig</code></a>.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-find-out-for-sure-what-kernel-version-and-processor-architecture-my-phone-has">How do I find out for sure what kernel version and processor architecture my phone has?</h3><p>Now that we have the ability to run shell commands on the phone, we can turn to good old <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/uname.2.html"><code>uname</code></a> to discover the kernel version and architecture that’s currently running.</p><ol><li>Go back and <a href="#first-enable-usb-debugging-and-install-adb">enable USB debugging and install ADB</a>, if you haven’t arleady</li><li>Run <code>uname -a</code> on the phone, either by running <code>adb shell</code> and then running <code>uname -a</code>, or all in one go by running <code>adb shell uname -a</code>.</li></ol><p>You should get output something like this:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Linux localhost 4.19.113-26203352 #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 18 16:05:51 KST 2023 aarch64 Toybox</span></span></code></pre><p>You’ll the kernel version in the third field and the architecture in the second-to-last; you’ll have to make an educated guess about which branch or tag in Google’s kernel repository corresponds to the one running on your phone.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-have-an-older-phone">What if I have an older phone?</h3><p>If you have an older phone, then you’re in the same boat as me; I have an iPhone as a daily driver, but I keep a Samsung Galaxy s20 around as an Android testbed. Unfortunately, the s20 shipped with Android 10, which is the version just before all of this standardized kernel stuff from Google became required. Even though the s20 has since been upgraded to Android 13, Google doesn’t require phone manufacturers to update the kernel along with the Android version, and so Samsung didn’t; it still runs a kernel based on Linux 4.19.</p><p>In this case, you need to get the kernel configuration from your phone manufacturer, so you’d better hope they’re actually doing regular source releases. Samsung does do this; you can find sources for their phones at <a href="https://opensource.samsung.com/uploadList?menuItem=mobile&amp;classification1=mobile_phone">opensource.samsung.com</a>.</p><p>Once you have the sources for your device, you’re going to have to dig around a bit to figure out what kernel config. The sources I obtained for my phone from Samsung included a <code>Kernel.tar.gz</code>; inside of this archive was a Linux kernel source tree, along with a few additions. One of those additions was a shell script called <code>build_kernel.sh</code>, which goes a little something like this:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#!/bin/bash</span></span>

<span><span># CONFIG_USB_NET_HUAWEI_CDC_NCM is not set</span></span>
<span><span>... and so on ...</span></span></code></pre><p>Look for a <code>CONFIG_USB_NET_something</code> that looks like it relates to the chipset of the adapter you want to use. The best news is if it is set to <code>y</code>; that means the driver is built-in to your kernel and that your phone’s kernel definitely supports that chipset. If it’s set to <code>m</code>, that’s still <em>probably</em> good news; that means that the driver was compiled as a module when your kernel was built, and that the module is likely loadable on your phone unless your phone’s manufacturer specifically left it out. If you see <code>is not set</code>, then that is the worst news; the driver was neither built-in to your kernel, nor was it compiled as a module, so it’s likely not available for you to use.</p><p>If you’re having trouble figuring out which configuration items correspond to which chipsets, have a look at <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-mainline/drivers/net/usb/Kconfig"><code>drivers/net/usb/Kconfig</code></a> in your kernel tree. This file will contain extended descriptions of each configuration item.</p><p>Unfortunately, to figure out which chipset a particular adapter uses, you’re mostly back to hearsay; few manufacturers of USB Ethernet adapters explicitly advertise which chipset they use.</p><h3 id="so-whats-this-about-cdc-ethernet-and-why-should-i-care">So what’s this about CDC Ethernet and why should I care?</h3><p>CDC stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class">Communications Device Class</a>. This is a set of interrelated standards that manufacturers of USB devices can follow; among them are a trio of standards called EEM (Ethernet Emulation Model), ECM (Ethernet Control Model), and NCM (Network Control Model) that can be used to build USB Ethernet adapters. Most of the difference between these three standards is a matter of complexity; EEM is the simplest to implement and is easy to support on underpowered devices, but may not result in the best performance. ECM is more complex to implement for both the USB host and the device, but promises better performance than EEM; NCM is a successor to ECM that promises even higher speeds. Many devices implement more than one of these protocols, and leave it up to the host operating system to communicate with the device using the one that it prefers.</p><p>The point of these standards is that, assuming manufacturers follow them, operating systems can provide a single common driver that works with a variety of drivers. You generally don’t need special drivers for USB keyboards or mice because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class">USB HID</a> standard; the USB CDC standard attempts to accomplish the same for USB networking devices.</p><p>One particularly fun thing is that Linux implements both the host and the device side of the CDC Ethernet standards. That means that if you have hardware with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">USB OTG</a> port, which is common on the Raspberry Pi and other small ARM devices, you can tell the kernel to use that port to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget">pretend to be an Ethernet adapter</a>. This creates a USB network interface on the host that is directly connected to an interface on the guest; this lets you build cool things like embedded routers, firewalls, and VPN gateways that look like just another Ethernet adapter to the host.</p><p>Linux, as well as Windows and macOS (but not iOS) include drivers for CDC Ethernet devices. Unfortunately, none of this works on Android devices, despite Android being based on Linux. Why is Android like this?</p><h3 id="based-on-the-kernel-configuration-android-appears-to-support-cdc">Based on the kernel configuration, Android <em>appears</em> to support CDC</h3><p>Let’s have another look at our kernel config, and grep for USB_NET_CDC:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ grep USB_NET_CDC my_kernel_config</span></span>
<span><span>CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER=y</span></span>
<span><span>CONFIG_USB_NET_CDC_EEM=y</span></span>
<span><span>CONFIG_USB_NET_CDC_NCM=y</span></span>
<span><span>... and so on ...</span></span></code></pre><p>Here we can see that Samsung has built support for all 3 CDC Ethernet standards into their kernel (<code>CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER</code> corresponds to ECM). Google’s GKI kernels are somewhat less generous and appear to leave out ECM and NCM, but still include support for EEM as a module.</p><p>I’ve got a device with an OTG port that I’ve configured as an Ethernet gadget. It works when I plug it into my Mac. It works when I plug it into my Ubuntu desktop. It even works when I plug it into my Windows game machine (actually the same computer as the Ubuntu desktop, booted off of a different drive <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" role="img">😁</span>). It doesn’t work at all when I plug it into my Galaxy s20. The Ethernet settings are still greyed out:</p><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/grey-ethernet.jpg" alt="'Ethernet' greyed out" title="'Ethernet' greyed out"></p><p>Let’s grab a shell on the phone and dig in a bit.</p><p>The Linux kernel exposes information about itself in a pseudo-filesystem called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs">sysfs</a> - this looks like a directory tree full of files, but reading the files actually gets you information about the current state of the kernel.</p><p>Among other things, sysfs contains a directory named <code>/sys/class/net</code>, which contains one entry for every network interface that the kernel is aware of. Let’s connect our Ethernet gadget to the phone and see if anything shows up there:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ adb shell ls /sys/class/net</span></span>
<span><span>... lots of output ...</span></span>
<span><span>usb0</span></span>
<span><span>wlan0</span></span></code></pre><p>Could <code>usb0</code> be the gadget? Let’s use <code>ifconfig</code> to check it out:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ adb shell ifconfig usb0</span></span>
<span><span>usb0      Link encap:UNSPEC    Driver cdc_eem</span></span>

<span><span>          RX bytes:0 TX bytes:0</span></span></code></pre><p>That certainly looks like our gadget. Too bad the interface is down.

<span><span>$ # no output</span></span></code></pre><p>Yep, it’s gone.</p><p>It looks like we’re using EEM mode. In addition to the <code>g_ether</code> module, Linux also includes a thing called <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/usb/gadget_configfs.html">configfs</a> that can be used to create custom gadgets. Let’s try one that only supports ECM and see if that works:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ adb shell ls /sys/class/net | grep usb</span></span>

I’m pretty sure that if I wanted to, I could root this phone, manually configure the interface with <code>ifconfig</code>, and it would pass traffic just fine. That means the problem must be somewhere in the stack of software above the kernel.</p><p>If this was a regular Linux system, this is the point where I’d start poking at systemd-networkd, or NetworkManager, or ifupdown, depending on the particulars. This is not a regular Linux system, though; it’s an Android device, and none of that stuff exists here. What do I know about how Android configures network interfaces?</p><p><strong>NOTHING.</strong> I know nothing about how Android configures network interfaces. How do we figure this out?</p><p>Well, Android is at least sort of open source; many of the good bits are closed behind the veil of something called “Google Play Services” but maybe there’s enough in the sources that are released to figure this out.</p><p>To play along with this bit, you’ll need to <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download/downloading">download the source to Android</a>. This is a whole process on its own, so I’ll leave you to Google’s documentation for this, except to note that you’ll need a special tool called <code>repo</code>. This seems to be meant to make it easier to download sources from multiple Git repositories at once; sometimes it feels like I’m the only person that actually likes <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodules</a>. There are a lot of sources to download, so start this process and then go knock off a few shrines in Zelda while it wraps up.</p><p>I figure that searching for the string <code>Ethernet</code> is probably a good starting point. Because there is so much source to go through, I’m going to skip vanilla <code>grep</code> this time and enlist the aid of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>. There’s a lot of configuration files and other clutter in the Android sources, as well as most of a Linux distro, but I know that any code that we’re going to care about here is likely written in Java, so I’m going to restrict <code>rg</code> to searching in Java files:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ rg -t java Ethernet</span></span>
<span><span>... SO MUCH OUTPUT ...</span></span></code></pre><p>At this point, there’s not much else to do but look at the files where we’ve got hits and try to figure out what part of the code we can blame for our problem. Fortunately for you, I’ve saved you the trouble. After reading a bunch of Android code, I’m certain that our culprit is <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/Connectivity/+/refs/heads/master/service-t/src/com/android/server/ethernet/EthernetTracker.java"><code>EthernetTracker.java</code></a>. This appears to be a service that listens on a <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro.html">Netlink</a> socket and receives notifications from the kernel about new network interfaces. The EthernetTracker contains a method that determines if an Ethernet interface is “valid”; if it is valid, the EthernetTracker reports to the rest of the system that an interface is available, and the Settings app allows the interface to be configured. If an interface is not valid, then the EthernetTracker simply ignores it.</p><p>How does the EthernetTracker determine if an interface is valid?</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>boolean</span><span> </span><span>isValidEthernetInterface</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span> iface) {</span></span>

<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>With a regex, of course.</p><p>Where does this regex come from?</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>// Interface match regex.</span></span>
<span><span>mIfaceMatch = </span><span>mDeps</span><span>.</span><span>getInterfaceRegexFromResource</span><span>(mContext);</span></span></code></pre><p>It comes from a method called <code>getInterfaceRegexFromResource</code>.

<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>There’s actually a nice comment at the top of the file that explains this:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/**</span></span>
<span><span> * Tracks Ethernet interfaces and manages interface configurations.</span></span>
<span><span> *</span></span>
<span><span> * &lt;p&gt;Interfaces may have different {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities}. This mapping is defined</span></span>
<span><span> * in {@code config_ethernet_interfaces}. Notably, some interfaces could be marked as restricted by</span></span>
<span><span> * not specifying {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities.NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_RESTRICTED} flag.</span></span>
<span><span> * Interfaces could have associated {@link android.net.IpConfiguration}.</span></span>
<span><span> * Ethernet Interfaces may be present at boot time or appear after boot (e.g., for Ethernet adapters</span></span>
<span><span> * connected over USB). This class supports multiple interfaces. When an interface appears on the</span></span>
<span><span> * system (or is present at boot time) this class will start tracking it and bring it up. Only</span></span>
<span><span> * interfaces whose names match the {@code config_ethernet_iface_regex} regular expression are</span></span>
<span><span> * tracked.</span></span>
<span><span> *</span></span>
<span><span> * &lt;p&gt;All public or package private methods must be thread-safe unless stated otherwise.</span></span>
<span><span> */</span></span></code></pre><p>Let’s go back to ripgrep to see if we can skip to finding out what <code>config_ethernet_iface_regex</code> is:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ rg config_ethernet_iface_regex</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml</span></span>
<span><span>410:    &lt;string translatable="false" name="config_ethernet_iface_regex"&gt;eth\\d&lt;/string&gt;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>packages/modules/Connectivity/service/ServiceConnectivityResources/res/values/config.xml</span></span>
<span><span>170:    &lt;string translatable="false" name="config_ethernet_iface_regex"&gt;eth\\d&lt;/string&gt;</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></pre><p>…and there it is. The default value of <code>config_ethernet_iface_regex</code> is <code>eth\d</code>; in regex parlance, that means the literal string <code>eth</code>, followed by a digit.</p><p>The kernel on the phone calls our CDC Ethernet gadget <code>usb0</code>. This doesn’t start with the string <code>eth</code>, so EthernetTracker ignores it. Unfortunately, this setting is not user-configurable, although you can hack it by rooting the phone.</p><p>It really is that silly; an entire USB device class brought low by a bum regex.</p><h3 id="is-it-a-bug">Is it a bug?</h3><p>I can’t tell if this is intentional or not; it feels like an oversight by Google, since even the newest GKI kernels apparently go out of their way to include support for EEM adapters, but because the interface name doesn’t match the regex, the kernel’s support for EEM adapters is unusable. This puts you in a rather perverse situation when shopping for USB Ethernet adapters to use with Android; instead of looking for devices that implement the CDC standards, you need to explicitly <em>AVOID</em> the standards-based devices and look for something that is supported with a vendor/chipset-specific driver.</p><h3 id="thanks-for-playing">Thanks for playing!</h3><p>I hope you enjoyed going on this journey with me, or even better that I saved you from duplicating my efforts. Perhaps if I am feeling feisty, I will try to figure out how to submit a patch to Android to change that regex to <code>(eth|usb)\d</code> in the next few weeks. If a real Android dev or someone at Google reads this and beats me to the punch, I owe you the beverage of your choice.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Sicker patients have strangely-timed emergency lab orders at 2AM, healthy patients have routine morning blood draws. Timing is hard to rely on!</span></p><p><span>But this paper was </span><strong>not</strong><span> a retrospective study of electronic health records, it was a randomized clinical trial, which is the gold standard. This means that we’ll be forced to immediately throw away our list of other obvious complaints against this paper. Yes, healthier patients may come in the morning more often, but randomization fixes that. Yes, patients with better support systems may come in the morning more often, but randomization fixes that. Yes, maybe morning nurses are fresher and more alert, but…well, randomization doesn’t fix evening nurse performance (</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36707921/" rel="">which does dip during the night</a><span>!), but I am inclined to believe the errors aren’t so high there as to cause this magnitude of a survival shift. </span></p><p><span>Okay. Well. </span><strong>Maybe</strong><span> there is something here.

Now, skepticism here would be justified given that these are all retrospective studies, and it’d be very easy for these to be confounded. But this evidence </span><strong>combined</strong><span> with the extremely similar results from the randomized clinical trial done I showed at the start of this essay should lead us towards at least suspecting that this is an honest-to-god free lunch. </span></p><p>What’s going on? Where is this coming from? </p><p><span>First, it’s worth reminding ourselves that the human body — and perhaps most complex life on Earth — exists on a schedule: the circadian rhythm. There exist 15-or-so ‘clock’ genes, like BMAL1, CLOCK, PER, and CRY, that oscillate with a rhythm. Not in structure or conformation, but in </span><strong>expression</strong><span>; </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3758473/" rel="">the amount of them present in cells rises and falls over the course of the day</a><span>. BMAL1 and CLOCK form a complex that drives the expression of PER and CRY. Once PER and CRY accumulate to a certain threshold, they feed back to inhibit BMAL1 and CLOCK, suppressing their own production. Over time, PER and CRY degrade, releasing the inhibition, and the cycle begins again. </span></p><p><span>One full loop takes just about 24~ hours, </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8363277/" rel="">though there is some degree of individual variation.</a></p><p><span>So our cells have evolved to take advantage of these genes as an internal timestamp, a marker of where we are in the circadian rhythm. Some things occur early in the cycle, some things occur later, purely as a matter of convenience.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-165378453" href="https://www.owlposting.com/p/the-time-of-day-that-immunotherapy#footnote-2-165378453" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span></p><p>What’s the point of the cycle? One way to understand them is through an evolutionary lens, a way for the body to prepare for dependable environment cues. </p><p>For example, at the start of our circadian rhythm, we wake up. We crawl out of our safe cocoon — a private bed in modernity, or a predator-sheltered hole in ancient history — and start to engage in very risky behavior, immunologically speaking. Eating leftover food that may be contaminated, being scrapped by bacteria-covered rocks, holding dead animals to roast for dinner, and so on. But, as night comes, we retreat back to our private beds or holes, feasting on freshly cooked food, few interactions with unknown creatures, and little chance for injury as we wind down. </p><p><span>To anthropomorphize for a minute, millennia of evolution likely recognized this phenomena, and </span><strong>also</strong><span> noted that loading up an immune response is an unfortunately long process. A dendritic cell floating in the blood stream must first recognize + grab onto an antigen, then it needs to crawl into the lymphatic system, and </span><strong>then</strong><span> it hopes to bump into the few naive T-cell that recognizes that specific antigen. </span><strong>Then</strong><span> the adaptive immune response can kick off.</span></p><p>How could evolution optimize this process?</p><p>Well…if you didn’t have any priors on when new antigens would come through the door, you wouldn’t care when T cells decided to exit/enter the lymphatic system. When they exit, they are moving to new tissue. When they enter, they are actively looking for dendritic cells to bind to. Perfectly fine to do this randomly in the null case of uniform antigen exposure. </p><p><span>But! If you believe that antigen load is highest in the morning (which is something you can track via the clock genes), it would be smart to ensure that the lymphatic system is bloated with lymphocytes in the morning, removing their ability to migrate into the bloodstream. </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263259/" rel="">And according to one paper, that does empirically turn out to be the case in mouse models!</a><span> Here’s a particularly useful graph:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png" width="372" height="390" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:390,&quot;width&quot;:372,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:162392,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.owlposting.com/i/165378453?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The authors characterize the lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) of mice and find that it is highest during the resting period for mice (ZT 1-9), meaning that they are currently migrating throughout the body. Once the mice get closer to awakening (ZT10), circulating lymphocytes sharply drop, implying that they have moved themselves into the lymphatic system, awaiting for the morning antigens to arrive. Finally, </span><strong>the authors demonstrate that this entire process entirely depends on clock genes</strong><span>. If they are genetically edited out, bloodstream lymphocytes stay constant. </span></p><p>But this is just one immune-circadian tweak that evolution has made. Are there others?</p><p><span>How about prime T-cells such that they are more ‘willing’ to be activated by antigen-presenting dendritic cells at the start of the circadian rhythm? </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1905080116" rel="">That exists</a><span>.

In the common case of immune checkpoint blockades, it is simply allowing the immune system to more easily attack the cancer, since cancer typically chemically dampens their ability to do so. That’s all it does. It doesn’t provide new antigens, it doesn’t create new T-cell receptors, it doesn’t summon dendritic cells. </span><strong>Which means the effectiveness of that green light depends entirely on what the immune system is already doing at that moment.</strong></p><p>Thus, we can propose a decent argument as to why immunotherapies seem to work best during the start of a circadian rhythm. The immune system, by evolutionary coincidence, is simply most prepared to begin their assault during that time. </p><p><span>But you may balk at this and say, “</span><em>That would only make sense if immune checkpoint blockades had an extremely short half life that fit into this primed immune system period, but they don’t.</em><span> </span><em>To take an example,</em><span> </span><em><span>Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) has an </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546616/" rel="">extremely long half life of 27 days</a><span>, is dosed every 3 weeks, and</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613934/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel=""> reaches steady-state blood levels at 19 weeks</a><span>. How could it possibly be affected by initial infusion time?”. </span></em></p><p>Well, you’ve got me there! I am unsure what the answer could be. And as far as I can tell, so is everyone else, nobody has a clear, consistent answer to the question. But let’s take a stab at it. </p><p><span>Let’s pretend you have very early-stage cancer. The dendritic cells are in their normal cycle of desperately presenting tumor fragments to T cells, the T-cells rightfully getting upset, activating themselves, and going off to hunt the cancer. But cancer simply shuts them down by expressing an immune blocker protein: PD-L1. In response, the T-cell mostly shuts down, wanders back to the lymphatic system, and </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2015162" rel="">gets a little bit more ‘exhausted’.</a><span> It believes that it activated itself for no reason, and thus will require a much higher bar for doing anything else in the future. The more times this occurs, the more exhausted the T-cell becomes, the more unwilling to ever activate again.</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3595615/" rel=""> In the limit, it will simply kill itself. </a><span>Hence why you need immunotherapy to revitalize these cells!</span></p><p><span>Now let’s assume you received the immune checkpoint blocker </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" rel="">Pembrolizumab</a><em> </em><span>at one of the best possible times: 7:30am in the morning, when the most T-cells are in your lymphatic system. Those get activated by the dendritic cells and are now finally able to attack the cancer, the checkpoint blocker preventing them from shutting down. Cancer is being killed! What advantages are you potentially privy to now as a result of the morning dose? </span></p><p>Of course all the ones we talked about earlier: </p><ul><li><p>A greater number of T-cells are in the lymphatic system, so more opportunity to prevent exhaustion.</p></li><li><p>Dendritic cells are more aggressively collecting cancer antigens, so more opportunity for T cells to be activated.</p></li><li><p>The lymphatic system is more permissible to dendritic cell entry, allowing more interactions between dendritic cells and T-cells.</p></li></ul><p>And so on. </p><p><span>But, all of this would </span><strong>also </strong><span>eventually happen if you had an evening injection. If we squint, the only downside an evening injection would have is that the highest concentration of the drug (at the moment of injection) does not have access to all of these advantages.</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9256782/" rel=""> But given the clearance rate of Pembrolizumab, only 1.25% of it would have dropped in the 12 hours from the evening injection → following morning</a><span>. </span><strong>So the morning injection upside entirely stands on this +1.25% drug concentration bump.</strong><span> Either we are missing something, or the sum total of the initial 12-hour-long immune advantages are so high that +1.25% is extremely significant. </span></p><p>Perhaps the second take is genuinely true and answers the story entirely. Lots of immunologically useful things are going on in the morning, each contributing a little bit. As is often the case in biology, there is no singular causal factor for why early-morning immunotherapy seems to help so much, just many small things. </p><p>But let’s veer off into speculation.

So you’d ideally want the first ceiling to be as high as possible, which implies that a morning injection would be best! Is this true? Well, we do know that the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30804515/" rel="">clinical impact of the first immunotherapy injection is strongly tied to long term outcomes</a><span>, and, accordingly, </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel="">the timing of that </a><strong><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel="">first</a></strong><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel=""> immunotherapy injection seems to matter the most</a><span>. This same latter paper also says this:</span></p><blockquote><p><span> …</span><em>it appears that challenging the immune system with an antibody at a specific time of day not only changes the quantity but also the quality of the response so that the immune system, once stimulated at the “wrong” time, may not be able to respond anymore to the same level and quality as an immune system challenged at the “right” time—just 12 h apart. </em></p></blockquote><p><span>Hence, why we should suspect that there is something fundamentally </span><strong>special</strong><span> about the first wave of activation of T-cells. </span></p><p>Of course, many questions follow from this. What is the temporal “window of imprintability” for T cells? Does that imply that early-activated T-cell clones dominate the final pool of T-cells? And what would mechanistically cause all of this? I don’t have the answer to any of these, and I suspect nobody does. </p><p>But again, maybe this is the wrong idea entirely, and there is no singular causal factor for these impressive time-of-day results. Maybe it is, once again, a bunch of small things — increased T-cell activation, but also stronger dendritic cell function and increased lymphatic vessel permissibility and many others — adding up to a strong signal. </p><p><span>For what it’s worth, we do know that this</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4874947/" rel=""> ‘early morning immunotherapy is useful’ phenomenon are also important for infectious disease vaccines, </a><span>so it feels unlikely that this whole observation is entirely spurious. But vaccines mostly contain short-lived antigens and one-shot adjuvant signals, meaning they rely heavily on getting the initial priming window exactly right. That’s not the case for immunotherapy, so I suspect the benefits of morning injections in that context arise from a different mechanism—one that’s distinct from what makes morning timing valuable for vaccines.</span></p><p><span>We’ll see what the future holds. The phase 3 trial page that we talked about at the start </span><a href="https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/NCT05549037/effect-of-time-of-day-tod-for-immunochemotherapy-on-pfs-in-nsclc?NewOnly=Y&amp;city=Chang%20Sha&amp;country=China" rel="">is still ongoing</a><span> and is currently the only randomized test of chronoimmunotherapy. But one more is getting kicking off</span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392303314_The_TIME_trial_Phase_II_randomized_controlled_trial_of_time-of-day-specified_immunotherapy_for_advanced_melanoma" rel=""> for melanoma</a><span> and </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11877229/" rel="">there are calls for more to be run</a><span>. Incredibly interesting subject, please reach out to me if you have any interesting light to shed here!</span></p><p><em>Edit on 08/06/2024</em></p><p><span>At least one person has mentioned that chronotherapy was also thought to matter for blood pressure medication, with rather convincing large retrospective studies, specifically the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31641769/" rel="">HYGIA trial</a><span>. There was some mild mechanistic reason to suggest that circadian variation in sympathetic tone and cortisol levels could influence blood pressure regulation; going up when you sleep, potentially leading to more cardiac events. Thus, bedtime dosing of antihypertensives may prevent the ‘</span><em>potentially harmful territory</em><span>’ spike. </span></p><p><span>But multiple follow-up randomized studies, such as </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833860" rel="">this</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01786-X/fulltext" rel="">this</a><span> largely disproved the whole concept. Given that, shouldn’t we be on guard for chronotherapy working in immunotherapy? </span></p><p>Well, yes! We should be on guard for everything, especially since our only major piece of evidence is a as-of-yet incomplete trial. But I’m personally erring on the side of the connection between the immune system and the circadian rhythm being much stronger than it is for other physiological functions, just given how large the lymphocyte concentrations in the bloodstream can shift from night to day. I’m also betting a little on the first wave of T-cell activation being particularly important, for reasons that are still not understood. Very open to being completely wrong though!</p><p><span>On a bigger note, </span><a href="https://x.com/houndcl/status/1929649189560197408" rel="">someone else mentioned that the clinical trial methodology shifted midway across the 2 years of the study. </a><span>I asked OpenAI’s Operator to create a table of the biggest changes made: </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

But, if you're trying to get hired programming CUDA, what that really means is they want you implementing AI stuff (unless it's game dev).  AI programming is a much wider and deeper subject than CUDA itself, so be ready to spend a bunch of time studying and hacking to come up to speed in that.  But if you do, you will be in high demand.  As mentioned, the fast.ai videos are a great introduction.</p><p>In the case of games, that means 3D graphics which these days is another rabbit hole.

Back then I didn't find any tutorials that cover anything beyond the basics (which are still important).
Once you have understood the principle working mode and architecture of a GPU, I would recommend the following workflow:
1. First create an environment so that you can actually test your kernels against baselines written in a higher-level language.
2. If you don't have an urgent project already, try to improve/re-implement existing problems (MatMul being the first example). Don't get caught by wanting to implement all size cases. Take an example just to learn a certain functionality, rather than solving the whole problem if it's just about learning.
3. Write the functionality you want to have in increasing complexity. Write loops first, then parallelize these loops over the grid. Use global memory first, then put things into shared memory and registers. Use plain matrix multiplication first, then use mma (TensorCore) primitives to speed things up.
4. Iterate over the CUDA C Programming Guide. It covers all (most) of the functionality that you want to learn - but can't be just read an memorized. When you apply it you learn it.
5. Might depend on you use-case but also consider using higher-level abstractions like CUTLASS or ThunderKitten. Also, if your environment is jax/torch, use triton first before going to CUDA level.</p><p>Overall, it will be some pain for sure. And to master it including PTX etc. will take a lot of time.</p></div></td></tr>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/">https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44215667">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I decided today to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider">CloudFlare’s new OAuth provider library</a>, which they apparently coded almost entirely with Anthropic’s Claude LLM:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>This library (including the schema documentation) was largely written with the help of&nbsp;<a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a>, the AI model by Anthropic. Claude’s output was thoroughly reviewed by Cloudflare engineers with careful attention paid to security and compliance with standards. Many improvements were made on the initial output, mostly again by prompting Claude (and reviewing the results). Check out the commit history to see how Claude was prompted and what code it produced.</p><p>[…]</p></div>



<p>To emphasize,&nbsp;<strong>this is not “vibe coded”</strong>. Every line was thoroughly reviewed and cross-referenced with relevant RFCs, by security experts with previous experience with those RFCs. I was&nbsp;<em>trying</em>&nbsp;to validate my skepticism. I ended up proving myself wrong.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have done a fair amount of LLM-assisted “agentic” coding of this sort recently myself. I’m also an expert in OAuth, having written <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">API Security in Action</a>, been on the OAuth Working Group at the IETF for years, and previously been the tech lead and then security architect for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ForgeRock">leading OAuth provider</a>. (I also have a PhD in AI from an <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/research/agents-lab.aspx">intelligent agents group</a>, but that predates the current machine learning craze). So I was super interested to see what it had produced, so I took a look while sitting in some meetings today. Disclaimer: I’ve only had a brief look and raised a few bugs, not given it a full review.</p>



<p>Initially, I was fairly impressed by the code. The code is all in one file, which is common from my experience from LLM coding, but it’s fairly well structured without too many of the useless comments that LLMs love to sprinkle over a codebase, and some actual classes and higher-level organisation. </p>



<p>There are some tests, and they are OK, but they are woefully inadequate for what I would expect of a critical auth service. Testing every MUST and MUST NOT in the spec is a bare minimum, not to mention as many abuse cases as you can think of, but none of that is here from what I can see: just basic functionality tests. (From a cursory look at the code, I’d say there are probably quite a few missing MUST checks, particularly around validating parameters, which is pretty light in the current implementation).</p>



<p>The first thing that stuck out for me was what I like to call “YOLO CORS”, and is not that unusual to see: setting CORS headers that effectively disable the same origin policy almost entirely for all origins:</p>


<div><pre title="">private addCorsHeaders(response: Response, request: Request): Response {
    // Get the Origin header from the request
    const origin = request.headers.get('Origin');

    // If there's no Origin header, return the original response
    if (!origin) {
      return response;
    }

    // Create a new response that copies all properties from the original response
    // This makes the response mutable so we can modify its headers
    const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response);

    // Add CORS headers
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', '*');
    // Include Authorization explicitly since it's not included in * for security reasons
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Authorization, *');
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400'); // 24 hours

    return newResponse;
  }
</pre></div>


<p>There are cases where this kind of thing is OK, and I haven’t looked in detail at why they’ve done this, but it looks really suspicious to me. You should almost never need to do this. In this case, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/16ed01f825d5bcc2fa8862f2da719495c92963c3">the commit log</a> reveals that it was the humans that decided on this approach, not the LLM. They haven’t enabled credentials at least, so <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors#server-generated-acao-header-from-client-specified-origin-header">the sorts of problems this usually results in</a> probably don’t apply.</p>



<p>Talking of headers, there is a distinct lack of <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html">standard security headers</a> in the responses produced. Many of these don’t apply to APIs, but some do (and often in surprising ways). For example, in my book I show how to exploit an XSS vulnerability against a JSON API: just because you’re returning well-formed JSON doesn’t mean that’s how a browser will interpret it. I’m not familiar with CloudFlare Workers, so maybe it adds some of these for you, but I’d expect at least an<code> X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header and HTTP Strict Transport Security to protect the bearer tokens being used.</p>



<p>There are some odd choices in the code, and things that lead me to believe that the people involved are not actually familiar with the OAuth specs at all. For example, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/a103ed06d94cc097db0744da36618153e1f27789">this commit adds support for public clients</a>, but does so by implementing the deprecated “implicit” grant (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-removal-of-the-oauth-20-imp">removed in OAuth 2.1</a>). This is absolutely not needed to support public clients, especially when the rest of the code implements PKCE and relaxes CORS anyway. The commit message suggests that they didn’t know what was needed to support public clients and so asked Claude and it suggested the implicit grant. The implicit grant is hidden behind a feature flag, but that flag is only checked in an entirely optional helper method for parsing the request, not at the point of token issuance.</p>



<p>Another hint that this is not written by people familiar with OAuth is that they have <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/41">implemented Basic auth support incorrectly</a>. This is a classic bug in OAuth provider implementations because people (and LLMs, apparently) assume that it is just vanilla Basic auth, but OAuth adds a twist of URL-encoding everything first (because charsets are a mess). Likewise, the code has a secondary bug if you have a colon in the client secret (allowed by the spec). I don’t think either of these are issues for this specific implementation, because it always generates client IDs and secrets and so can control the format, but I haven’t looked in detail.</p>



<p>A more serious bug is that the code that generates token IDs is not sound: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/42">it generates biased output</a>. This is a classic bug when people naively try to generate random strings, and the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/3b2ae809e9256d292079bb15ea9fe49439a0779c">LLM spat it out in the very first commit </a>as far as I can see. I don’t think it’s exploitable: it reduces the entropy of the tokens, but not far enough to be brute-forceable. But it somewhat gives the lie to the idea that experienced security professionals reviewed every line of AI-generated code. If they did and they missed this, then they were way too trusting of the LLM’s competence. (I don’t think they did: according to the commit history, there were 21 commits directly to main on the first day from one developer, no sign of any code review at all).</p>



<p>I had a brief look at the encryption implementation for the token store. I mostly like the design! It’s quite smart. From the commit messages, we can see that the design came from the human engineers, but I was quite impressed by the implementation. It’s worth <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/adcbb5de9c24f5b6a7dbea2e0a313a87c304d9bb">reproducing the commit message</a> from this work here, which shows the engineer’s interactions with Claude to get the desired code implemented:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ask Claude to store the props encrypted.</p>



<p>prompt: I would like to encrypt the `props` stored in `Grant` and `Token` records. It should be encrypted such that you need a valid token to decrypt. This is a bit tricky since there are multiple valid tokens over time: there’s the authorization code, the refresh tokens (which rotate), and individual access tokens. We don’t want to repeatedly re-encrypt `props`. Instead, we should encrypt in once, with a symmetric key, and then we should store that key “wrapped” for each token, while the token is valid. Please use WebCrypto to implement all cryptography. </p>



<p>Claude started on the wrong track making me realize I forgot an important design consideration: </p>



<p>prompt: One thing I forgot to note: The `listUserGrants()` helper function will no longer be able to return the `props`, since it doesn’t have any token with which to decript it. That’s OK: `props` need only be delivered to the app upon an authorized API request. We should actually change `listUserGrants()` to make it return a narrower representation of a grant. Right now it returns the entire grant record from storage, but we really only need it to return `id`, `clientId`, `userId`, `scope`, `metadata`, and `createdAt`. We don’t need to return any of the token IDs or code challenge information. </p>



<p>Claude produced beautiful code with one big flaw. </p>



<p>prompt: There’s a security flaw in the way you wrap keys for tokens: You used a SHA-256 hash of the token as the key material for the wrapping. However, SHA-256 is also how we compute “token IDs”. With this construction, someone would be able to unwrap the keys using only the token ID, which is stored alongside the wrapped keys, hence all keys can be trivially unwrapped. To fix this, we need to compute the hash differently when computing the key material for wrapping, in such a way that it’s not possible to derive the key material from the token ID. </p>



<p>Claude initially tried to solve this by switching to using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive the key material. </p>



<p>prompt: PDKDF2 with 100000 iterations would be very expensive. This would be important if the input were a low-entropy password, but is not necessary for high-entropy input. Instead of PBKDF2, let’s use a SHA-256 HMAC, with a static HMAC key (which essentially acts as the “salt”). </p>



<p>Claude produced code that used a string “OAUTH_PROVIDER_WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_v1” as the HMAC key. </p>



<p>prompt: This looks pretty good, but for performance, let’s define WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_KEY as a 32-byte array, so that it doesn’t have to be encoded or hashed down to the right size (as HMAC would do for larger keys). Here are 32 bytes of hex which I have chosen randomly, to use as the HMAC key: 22 7e 26 86 8d f1 e1 6d 80 70 ea 17 97 5b 47 a6 82 18 fa 87 28 ae de 85 b5 1d 4a d9 96 ca ca 43</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(NB: using a hard-coded “key” here is fine: it’s essentially HKDF-Extract with a fixed random salt, which is fine and dandy for this use-case. The security property we’re looking for here is that the two uses are <em>independent random oracles</em>, for which this is a decent design. I would maybe use the same approach for generating the token ID too, with a different salt, but that’s a minor tweak).</p>



<p>What this interaction shows is how much knowledge you need to bring when you interact with an LLM. The “one big flaw” Claude produced in the middle would probably not have been spotted by someone less experienced with crypto code than this engineer obviously is. And likewise, many people would probably not have questioned the weird choice to move to PBKDF2 as a response: LLMs really do not “reason” in any real way.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>As a first cut of an OAuth library, it’s not bad, but I wouldn’t really recommend it for use <em>yet</em>. In my experience, it is very hard to build a correct and <strong>secure</strong> OAuth provider implementation, and it deserves way more time and attention than has clearly gone into this one (yet). IMO, it’s not an appropriate domain for testing out an LLM. At ForgeRock, we had <em>hundreds</em> of security bugs in our OAuth implementation, and that was despite having <em>100s of thousands</em> of automated tests run on every commit, threat modelling, top-flight SAST/DAST, and extremely careful security review by experts. The idea that you can get an LLM to knock one up for you is not serious.</p>



<p>The commit history of this project is absolutely fascinating. The engineers clearly had a good idea of many aspects of the design, and the LLM was tightly controlled and produced decent code. (LLMs are absolutely good at coding in this manner). But it still tried to do some stupid stuff, some of which were caught by the engineers, some were not. I’m sure some are still in there. Is this worse than if a human had done it? Probably not. Many of these same mistakes can be found in popular Stack Overflow answers, which is probably where Claude learnt them from too. But I know many engineers who would have done a better job, because they are extremely diligent. Code like this needs careful attention. Details matter. Yes, this does come across as a bit “vibe-coded”, despite what the README says, but so does a lot of code I see written by humans. LLM or not, we have to give a shit.</p>



<p>What I am taking away from my experience with LLMs, and from reviewing this project is this: you need to have a clear idea in your head of the kind of code you’re expecting the LLM to produce to be able to judge whether it did a good job. Often, to really know what that looks like, and engage your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">“System 2” thinking</a> (so you’re not just accepting what’s in front of you as the best way to do things), you need to have built one yourself first. For trivial things where I don’t really care how it’s done, then sure, I’m happy to let an LLM do whatever it likes. But for important things, like <em>my fucking auth system</em>, I’d much rather do it myself and be sure that I <em>really</em> thought about it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">





<p><code>Last update: 2018-10-26</code></p>

<h2 id="tl;dr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>DoH is not about protecting your DNS queries from peepers. That is a
big lie. It is about making sure only one peeper can see all of your
queries.</p>

<p>Refuse to use it today: Open about:config in Firefox and set
<code>network.trr.mode</code> to <code>5</code>. This will prevent Firefox from using DoH
under all circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="What%20is%20DNS%20over%20HTTPS%20(DoH)?">What is DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?</h2>

<p>DNS over HTTPS is described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484.html">RFC 8484</a>
as a way perform DNS by wrapping it in HTTP and additionally encrypt the
data using TLS.
Advocates of DoH stress that the transport encryption protects your DNS
queries from peepers like your ISP or your network admin at work.
Adversaries critic that all DNS queries are directed to single DNS
provider who becomes the one known peeper.</p>

<h2 id="The%20basic%20idea">The basic idea</h2>

<p>The basic idea behind new developments like DoH is to protect your DNS
queries from peepers by implementing transport encryption. The same type
of transport encryption that protects many other application protocols
like HTTP and SMTP.
This is a very good idea because DNS queries in clear text contain very
interesting meta data about the sites you communicate with over the
Internet. This can be useful information for any kind of bad guy, be it
the NSA or the cyber-criminal.</p>

<h2 id="DoH%20encrypts,%20so%20it%20must%20be%20a%20good%20thing">DoH encrypts, so it must be a good thing</h2>

<p>The public didn't care about this RFC until Mozilla announced that they
implement this new protocol in Firefox for broad field testing in
collaboration with Cloudflare. The first reactions to this were: “DNS
gets encryption? This must be good thing.“ But slowly people started to
realize what the collaboration between Mozilla and Cloudflare really
means: Cloudflare gets all your DNS queries.</p>

<h2 id="But%20Cloudflare%20has%20a%20data%20protection%20policy">But Cloudflare has a data protection policy</h2>

<p>So what? Cloudflare is a commercial company. And commercial companies,
by definition, must earn money. How does a modern company in the IT
business earn money? By selling data.</p>

<h2 id="Is%20there%20an%20alternative%20way?">Is there an alternative way?</h2>

<p>Yes, there is. It is called DNS over TLS and is specified as a proposed
standard in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858">RFC 7858</a>.  This
provides transport encryption to DNS without abusing HTTP as transport
protocol.</p>

<h2 id="Why%20are%20you%20against%20changes%20in%20DNS?">Why are you against changes in DNS?</h2>

<p>I'm not. The DNS needs modernization. The DNS needs security features
that prevent the peepers from reading your DNS traffic. I'm all in for
it. But DoH is NOT the answer to this.</p>

<h2 id="But%20the%20protocol%20itself%20is%20a%20good%20idea">But the protocol itself is a good idea</h2>

<p>No, it is not. Abusing HTTP as a transport protocol for DNS data adds a
unneeded complexity to the protocol. You must add a HTTP module to all
DNS servers or interact with a separated HTTP server on the same system
in order to support DoH. That is a lot of code which can contain a lot
of bugs and security flaws. Complexity is the enemy of security.</p>

<p>Numerical integration techniques are often used in a variety of domains where exact solutions are not available.

<p>At it's core, gaussian quadrature gives us a way to evaluate a definite integral of a function by using the function evaluations at special points called nodes, the exact location of which can vary depending on the technique used - we'll look at a specific example using chebyshev nodes later on. Here's the basic idea for a definite integral over <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[-1,1]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we'll extend this to an arbitrary interval <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>[</mo><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[a,b]</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> later on. An integral of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be expressed as a weighted sum of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> evaluated at <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> nodes :</p>

</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Elementary integration techniques work by approximating the function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with a polynomial. If we sample the function at n points, we can fit a polynomial of degree n-1, and integrate <em>that</em> to get the approximation. Basically this means that with n nodes, we can integrate polynomials with degree n-1. In contrast, Gaussian quadrature can estimate a polynomial of order 2n-1 with n nodes and another set of n weights. The weights are easily determined based on the specific technique, but now you need roughly half the number of function evaluations for an accurate integral approximation.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement in terms of numerical accuracy for the accuracy you get per function evaluation at a node. Gaussian quadrature does this by carefully selecting nodes - the nodes are given by the roots of an orthogonal polynomial function. These orthogonal polynomials act as a "basis", just like spline coefficients do for <a href="https://rohangautam.github.io/blog/b_spline_intro/">spline fitting</a> (with the difference of global instead of local support). By the definition of orthogonality, these have an inner product (dot product in euclidean space) of zero with each other, and that simplifies the necessary calculations (<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1877415/proving-exactness-of-gauss-legendre-integration-formula">proof</a>)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> .</p>
<h2 id="chebyshev-gauss-quadrature" tabindex="-1">Chebyshev-Gauss quadrature <a href="#chebyshev-gauss-quadrature">#</a></h2>
<p>This flavour of gaussian quadrature involves using the roots of chebyshev polynomials to decide which nodes to evaluate the function for integration at. The roots of this polynomial are concentrated more on the edges of the domain helping counter oscillation at the boundaries when fitting polynomials (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon">Runge's phenomenon</a>). Additionally, the weights w are fixed at <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi/n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> , where n is the number of nodes - a parameter you choose.</p>

<p>This is my first time trying a <a href="https://marimo.io/">marimo notebook</a>. It reminds me of what <a href="https://plutojl.org/">pluto</a> is for julia - in the sense it's a reactive notebook, but with a lot of other cool features. The result is a highly interactive, embeddable notebook experience that's great for short blogs like this - and runs in the browser with WASM! I've also made the code available as a gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/RohanGautam/2f4951f0c8163836737e8c7423f8ec95">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can play around with the slider which controls the number of nodes used for integration. Changing it effects all other conencted cells, allowing you to compare the accuracy of the two integral approximation techniques. For this example, we integrate <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts" tabindex="-1">Parting thoughts <a href="#parting-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a cool numerical integration technique I thought I'd share. I used it in my library for estimating rates of sea level change - check out <a href="https://github.com/RohanGautam/EIV_IGP_jax">EIV_IGP_jax</a>. A gaussian process prior is fit with MCMC on the <em>rate</em> of sea level change, which is then compared to the observation (heights and times) of sea level proxies by integrating the rate process. The integration step uses chebyshev-gauss quadrature. The <a href="https://github.com/RohanGautam/EIV_IGP_jax/blob/main/src/utils.py#L30">specific implementation</a> of the quadrature in that project makes heavy use of <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html#a-practical-example-vector-quantization">broadcasting operations</a> for efficient vectorisation of these calculations over a grid. That was a fun project too, and maybe can be a blog for another day.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The proof linked to stackoverflow is for when legendre polynomials are used to compute node locations (Gauss-Legendre integration). The proof is largely unchanged for Chebyshev-Gauss integration with a notable difference that the "weight function" (multiplied inside the integral) in the latter case is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mo>(</mo><msqrt><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/(\sqrt{1-x^2})</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for the prior case. This is why the functional form requirement for chebyshev-gauss has that term, as seen in the next section. The use of "weight function" inside the integral and "weight" in the summation term is confusing, I'll agree. This is why introductions to the chebyshev-gauss quadrature directly introduce it as a functional form requirement, as I've done here. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<p>6th June 2025</p>



<p>I presented an invited keynote at the <a href="https://www.ai.engineer/">AI Engineer World’s Fair</a> in San Francisco this week. This is my third time speaking at the event—here are my talks from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/">October 2023</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/27/ai-worlds-fair/">June 2024</a>. My topic this time was “The last six months in LLMs”—originally planned as the last year, but so much has happened that I had to reduce my scope!</p>

With hindsight that was foolish—the space has been accelerating to the point that even covering the last six months is a tall order!</p>
<p>Thankfully almost all of the noteworthy models we are using today were released within the last six months. I’ve counted over 30 models from that time period that are significant enough that people working in this space should at least be aware of them.</p>
<p>With so many great models out there, the classic problem remains how to evaluate them and figure out which ones work best.</p>
<p>There are plenty of benchmarks full of numbers. I don’t get much value out of those numbers.</p>
<p>There are leaderboards, but I’ve been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/criticism-of-the-chatbot-arena/">losing some trust</a> in those recently.</p>
<p>Everyone needs their own benchmark. So I’ve been increasingly leaning on my own, which started as a joke but is beginning to show itself to actually be a little bit useful!</p>

<p>I’m running this against text output LLMs. They shouldn’t be able to draw anything at all.</p>
<p>But they can generate code... and SVG is code.</p>
<p>This is also an unreasonably difficult test for them. Drawing bicycles is really hard! Try it yourself now, without a photo: most people find it difficult to remember the exact orientation of the frame.</p>
<p>Pelicans are glorious birds but they’re also pretty difficult to draw. </p>

It’s 24B which means I can run it in my laptop using less than 20GB of RAM, leaving enough for me to run Firefox and VS Code at the same time!</p>
<p>Notably, Mistral claimed that it performed similar to Llama 3.3 70B. That’s the model that Meta said was as capable as their 405B model. This means we have dropped from 405B to 70B to 24B while mostly retaining the same capabilities!</p>
<p>I had a successful flight where I was using Mistral Small for half the flight... and then my laptop battery ran out, because it turns out these things burn a lot of electricity.</p>

They had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">a single hour</a> where they signed up a million new accounts, as this thing kept on going viral again and again and again.</p>
<p>I took a photo of my dog, Cleo, and told it to dress her in a pelican costume, obviously.</p>
<p>But look at what it did—it added a big, ugly sign in the background saying Half Moon Bay.</p>

(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models
demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scal-
ing properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily fo-
cus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. How-
ever, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights
into the reasoning traces’ structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these
gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of composi-
tional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis
of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs
“think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs
face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counter-
intuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then
declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM
counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-
complexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity
tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks
where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact
computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We
also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions
and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations,
and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been curious about what happens inside <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview" target="_blank">Claude Code</a> so I’ve spent a couple hours digging through prompts that it sends back to Anthropic.</p>
<p>As I’ve been going through that, I’ve gathered some insights why Claude Code is often slower and more expensive than other tools like Cursor.</p>
<h2>Capturing prompts</h2>
<p>It turned out a lot easier than I thought, thanks to <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a>:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>$ brew install mitmproxy
</span>$ mitmweb --mode reverse:https://api.anthropic.com --listen-port 8000
<!-- -->$ ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/ claude
</code></pre></pre>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I opened a <a href="https://github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com" target="_blank">repo</a> with my personal blog and entered “describe what’s in this project”.</p>
<p>The very first thing you see is that Claude Code tries to figure out whether what you have entered is a continuation of the previous conversation or a new topic.</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic.
</span>If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic.
<!-- -->Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Once it determines that, it wraps all your inputs into this system prompt:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>You are an agent for Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Given the user's prompt, you should use the tools available to you to answer the user's question.
</span>
<!-- -->Notes:
<!-- -->1. IMPORTANT: You should be concise, direct, and to the point, since your responses will be displayed on a command line interface. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is &lt;answer&gt;.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\".
<!-- -->2. When relevant, share file names and code snippets relevant to the query
<!-- -->3. Any file paths you return in your final response MUST be absolute. DO NOT use relative paths.
<!-- -->Here is useful information about the environment you are running in:
<!-- -->&lt;env&gt;
<!-- -->Working directory: /Users/kir/src/github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com
<!-- -->Is directory a git repo: Yes
<!-- -->Platform: macos
<!-- -->Today's date: 2025-04-13
<!-- -->Model: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
<!-- -->&lt;/env&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->As you answer the user's questions, you can use the following context:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;context name="directoryStructure"&gt;Below is a snapshot of this project's file structure at the start of the conversation. This snapshot will NOT update during the conversation. It skips over .gitignore patterns.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->- /Users/kir/src/github.com/kirs/kirshatrov-com/

<!-- --> ....
<!-- -->    - 2024-12-14-facebook-mysql-fork.md
<!-- -->  - bin/
<!-- -->...
<!-- -->&lt;/context&gt;
<!-- -->&lt;context name="gitStatus"&gt;This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.
<!-- -->Current branch: master
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Main branch (you will usually use this for PRs): master
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Status:
<!-- -->M .gitignore
<!-- --> D .ruby-version
<!-- --> M package-lock.json
<!-- -->?? playground/

<!-- -->Recent commits:
<!-- -->58ce3f9 m4 --force
<!-- -->3b1052a correction
<!-- -->82fe70a fix stuff
<!-- -->cfd73d9 follow-up
<!-- -->&lt;/context&gt;
</code></pre></pre>
<p>It’s nice that the state of git is included into the context.
You can also notice that the context includes full tree directory view which can get somewhat big.</p>
<p>Part of this system prompt is a list of 11 tools that are available for the LLM to call:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>dispatch_agent
</span>Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: View, GlobTool, GrepTool, LS, ReadNotebook, WebFetchTool. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.

<!-- -->Bash
<!-- -->Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures. Includes specialized functionality for git operations like commits and pull requests.

<!-- -->BatchTool
<!-- -->Batch execution tool that runs multiple tool invocations in a single request. Tools are executed in parallel when possible, and otherwise serially. Takes a list of tool invocations (tool_name and input pairs) and returns the collected results from all invocations.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->GlobTool
<!-- -->Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size. Supports glob patterns like "/*.js" or "src//*.ts". Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time.
<!-- -->GrepTool
<!-- -->Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size. Searches file contents using regular expressions. Supports full regex syntax and filters files by pattern with the include parameter.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->LS
<!-- -->Lists files and directories in a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->View
<!-- -->Reads a file from the local filesystem. The file_path parameter must be an absolute path. By default, reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Edit
<!-- -->Tool for editing files. For moving or renaming files, use the Bash tool with the 'mv' command instead. For larger edits, use the Write tool to overwrite files.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Replace
<!-- -->Write a file to the local filesystem. Overwrites the existing file if there is one.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->ReadNotebook
<!-- -->Reads a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and returns all of the cells with their outputs.

<!-- -->WebFetchTool
<!-- -->Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model. Takes a URL and a prompt as input, fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown, and processes the content.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>My original input (<code>“describe what’s in this project”</code>) then gets transformed into the <code>dispatch_agent</code> tool call with this instruction:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze the repository structure and determine what kind of project this is.
</span>Look at the file structure, package.json, and any configuration files to understand the tech stack,
<!-- -->then provide a concise summary of what this project appears to be.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is then transformed into a few <code>view</code> tool calls for those files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>package.json</code></li>
<li><code>pages/index.js</code></li>
<li><code>pages/post.js</code></li>
<li><code>pages/travels.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The result of feeding those files back to an LLM makes it into the following summary:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>This is Kir Shatrov's personal website/blog built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It includes:
</span>
<!-- -->- Blog posts on tech topics (Ruby/Rails, databases, engineering leadership)  
<!-- -->- Photography gallery  
<!-- -->- Travel map/history  
<!-- -->- Speaking engagements  
<!-- -->- Fabrication projects (woodworking/making)  
<!-- -->
<!-- -->The site uses markdown for blog content with posts dating back to 2015, following standard Next.js project structure.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The above took 40 seconds of LLM time and cost me $0.11.</p>
<p><img width="896" height="242" src="https://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/2025/claude-describe.png"></p><h2>Writing new code</h2>
<p>My next test input was:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Please write a bash script which displays the top story on Hacker News.
</span>It should show the title, the link, and the number of points.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>That spawned an agent use that has attempted to read <code>https://github.com/HackerNews/API</code>. But Claude’s self-limiting security policy has stopped that:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Error: Cannot fetch URL "https://github.com/HackerNews/API". For security, you can only fetch URLs from hosts that the user has mentioned in their messages or that are found in CLAUDE.md files or project files.
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Then it tried to read <code>https://hackernews.api-docs.io</code> and run into the same error.</p>
<p>Then it tried to read <code>https://firebase.google.com/docs/database</code> and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>It then changed the strategy and outputted this:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>I apologize for the limitations in accessing external URLs. Due to security restrictions, I can only fetch URLs that have been mentioned by you or are in project files.
</span>
<!-- -->The Hacker News API is hosted by Firebase and provides several endpoints, including:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->- `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json` - Returns IDs of top stories
<!-- -->- `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json` - Returns details of a specific item
<!-- -->
<!-- -->To create a bash script to fetch the top story, you would:
<!-- -->1. Fetch the array of top story IDs
<!-- -->2. Get the first ID from that array
<!-- -->3. Fetch the details for that ID
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Here's a basic bash script example:
<!-- -->
<!-- -->#!/bin/bash
<!-- -->...
<!-- -->
</code></pre></pre>
<p>What’s interesting is that none of that got saved or executed. So I’ve typed <code>save that and execute</code>.</p>
<p>Now, remember this prompt from the beginning?</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic.
</span>If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic.
<!-- -->Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Like any other input, my <code>save that and execute</code> command had to be run through determining whether it's a new topic or not.</p>
<p>Saving the file involved two tool usage calls:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Replace</code> to write the file</li>
<li><code>Bash</code> with <code>chmod +x hn_top.sh &amp;&amp; hn_top.sh</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now comes the fun part. Any <code>Bash</code> tool use is preceded by this this prompt:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>&lt;policy_spec&gt;
</span># Claude Code Code Bash command prefix detection
<!-- -->
<!-- -->This document defines risk levels for actions that the Claude Code agent may take. This classification system is part of a broader safety framework and is used to determine when additional user confirmation or oversight may be needed.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->## Definitions
<!-- -->
<!-- -->**Command Injection:** Any technique used that would result in a command being run other than the detected prefix.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->## Command prefix extraction examples
<!-- -->Examples:
<!-- -->- cat foo.txt =&gt; cat
<!-- -->- cd src =&gt; cd
<!-- -->- cd path/to/files/ =&gt; cd
<!-- -->- find ./src -type f -name \"*.ts\" =&gt; find
<!-- -->- gg cat foo.py =&gt; gg cat
<!-- -->- gg cp foo.py bar.py =&gt; gg cp
<!-- -->- git commit -m \"foo\" =&gt; git commit
<!-- -->- git diff HEAD~1 =&gt; git diff
<!-- -->- git diff --staged =&gt; git diff
<!-- -->- git diff $(pwd) =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git status =&gt; git status
<!-- -->- git status# test(`id`) =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git status`ls` =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- git push =&gt; none
<!-- -->- git push origin master =&gt; git push
<!-- -->- git log -n 5 =&gt; git log
<!-- -->- git log --oneline -n 5 =&gt; git log
<!-- -->- grep -A 40 \"from foo.bar.baz import\" alpha/beta/gamma.py =&gt; grep
<!-- -->- pig tail zerba.log =&gt; pig tail
<!-- -->- potion test some/specific/file.ts =&gt; potion test
<!-- -->- npm run lint =&gt; none
<!-- -->- npm run lint -- \"foo\" =&gt; npm run lint
<!-- -->- npm test =&gt; none
<!-- -->- npm test --foo =&gt; npm test
<!-- -->- npm test -- -f \"foo\" =&gt; npm test
<!-- -->- pwd
<!-- --> curl example.com =&gt; command_injection_detected
<!-- -->- pytest foo/bar.py =&gt; pytest
<!-- -->- scalac build =&gt; none
<!-- -->- sleep 3 =&gt; sleep
<!-- -->&lt;/policy_spec&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->The user has allowed certain command prefixes to be run, and will otherwise be asked to approve or deny the command.
<!-- -->Your task is to determine the command prefix for the following command.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->IMPORTANT: Bash commands may run multiple commands that are chained together.
<!-- -->For safety, if the command seems to contain command injection, you must return \"command_injection_detected\". 
<!-- -->(This will help protect the user: if they think that they're allowlisting command A, 
<!-- -->but the AI coding agent sends a malicious command that technically has the same prefix as command A, 
<!-- -->then the safety system will see that you said “command_injection_detected” and ask the user for manual confirmation.)
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Note that not every command has a prefix. If a command has no prefix, return \"none\".
<!-- -->
<!-- -->ONLY return the prefix. Do not return any other text, markdown markers, or other content or formatting.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Command: chmod +x hn_top.sh
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Once the security is assessed, it will try to grab the actual commands to let users make them always allowed to run</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Extract any file paths that this command reads or modifies. For commands like "git diff" and "cat", include the paths of files being shown. Use paths verbatim -- don't add any slashes or try to resolve them. Do not try to infer paths that were not explicitly listed in the command output.
</span>Format your response as:
<!-- -->&lt;filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->path/to/file1
<!-- -->path/to/file2
<!-- -->&lt;/filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->If no files are read or modified, return empty filepaths tags: &lt;filepaths&gt;&lt;/filepaths&gt;
<!-- -->Do not include any other text in your response.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Which renders the following UX bit:</p>
<p><img width="896" height="226" src="https://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/2025/claude-bash.png"></p><p>You can imagine that having to call an LLM at most twice for every <code>Bash</code> tool use makes things somewhat slower.</p>
<h2>/init</h2>
<p>Claude Code provides <code>/init</code> command which creates <code>CLAUDE.md</code> with generated contents about your project. Below is the prompt for that.</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file containing:
</span>1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
<!-- -->2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Usage notes:
<!-- -->- The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.\
<!-- -->- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, improve it.\
<!-- -->- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.\
<!-- -->- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:
<!-- -->
<!-- --># CLAUDE.md
<!-- -->
<!-- -->This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The prompt launches a <code>BatchTool</code> agent with a few more tool calls to collect more files — based on that context prompt that hints it the directory tree:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>{

<!-- -->    ]
<!-- -->  }
<!-- -->}
</code></pre></pre>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>Overall, Claude Code tends to be more generic and secure for the price of extra time and money billed on more tokens.</p>
<p>This is very much unlike Cursor which would never attempt to analyze suggested bash tools. And I would have most often prefer that Claude Code's approach.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that it uses <code>claude-3-7-sonnet</code> for most things that require reasoning, and <code>claude-3-5-haiku</code> for simpler calls like parsing Bash commands. But still, <code>claude-3.5</code> can be quite an overkill for those and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> would do that 10x cheaper ($1.5 vs $15 per 1M output tokens).</p>
<p>Still, in terms of UX, Claude Code is the winner for an agentic tool that runs in console. <a href="https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider" target="_blank">Aider</a> is close, but not nearly there in terms of reliability and UX. While Claude Code is a single NPM package (still requires a modern-ish version of Node which likely requires NVM installed), Aider's installation process self-installed <code>uv</code> on my machine just because it needed it. And <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands" target="_blank">OpenHands</a> had to download ~10Gb of Docker images.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I thought I would share my experience of maintaining an Android app.

              I was chatting with a fellow web developer recently and made a joke about the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and
              <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tags, only to discover that he had no idea what I was talking about. They’re a part of web history that’s fallen off the radar and younger developers are
              unlikely to have ever come across them. But for a little while, back in the 90s, they were a big deal.
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17882">
              <a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_17882" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2020/11/dreamweaver-blink-marquee.png" alt="Macromedia Dreamweaver 3 code editor window showing a <h2> heading wrapped in <marquee> and <blink> tags, for emphasis." width="1024" height="586"></a>
              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17882">
                Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver">Macromedia Dreamweaver</a>, which embodied the essence of 1990s web design, seemed to treat wrapping
                <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> as an antipattern.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Invention of the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element is often credited to <a href="https://montulli.blogspot.com/">Lou Montulli</a>, who wrote pioneering web browser <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> before being joining Netscape in 1994. <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag">He insists that he didn’t write any
              of the code</a> that eventually became the first implementation of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>. Instead, he claims: while out at a bar (on the evening he’d first meet his wife!), he
              pointed out that many of the fancy new stylistic elements the other Netscape engineers were proposing wouldn’t work in Lynx, which is a text-only browser. The fanciest conceivable
              effect that would work across both browsers would be making the text flash on and off, he joked. Then another engineer – who he doesn’t identify – pulled a late night hack session and
              added it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so it was that <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/netscape-navigator-2-0">when Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released in 1995</a> it added support for
              the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag. Also animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format (file)s">GIFs</abbr> and the first inklings of JavaScript, which collectively
              would go on to <em>define</em> the “personal website” experience for years to come. Here’s how you’d use it:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my blinking text!&lt;/BLINK&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              With no attributes, it was clear from the outset that this tag was supposed to be a joke. By the time <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language, version 4">HTML4</abbr> was
              published as a a recommendation two years later, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/HTML40-plus-blink.dtd">it was <em>documented</em> as being a joke</a>. But the Web of the late 1990s
              saw it used <em>a lot</em>. If you wanted somebody to notice the “latest updates” section on your personal home page, you’d wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag around the title (or,
              if you were a sadist, the entire block).
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17890" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17890">

            </figure>
            <p>
              In the same year as Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/internet-explorer-2-0">Microsoft released Internet Explorer
              2.0</a>. At this point, Internet Explorer was still very-much playing catch-up with the features the Netscape team had implemented, but clearly some senior Microsoft engineer took a
              look at the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag, refused to play along with the joke, but had an innovation of their own: the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag! It had <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/fun3.shtml">a whole suite of attributes</a> to control the scroll direction, speed, and whether it looped or bounced backwards and forwards. While
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> encouraged disgusting and inaccessible design as a joke, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> did it on purpose.
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <marquee>Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!</marquee>
              </p>
              
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              But here’s the interesting bit: for a while in the late 1990s, it became a somewhat common practice to wrap content that you wanted to emphasise with animation in <em>both</em> a
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag. That way, the Netscape users would see it flash, the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users
              would see it scroll or bounce. Like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my really important message!&lt;/BLINK&gt;&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
            <figure id="attachment_17887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17887">
              <a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_17887" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2020/11/IE5.gif" alt="Internet Explorer 5 showing a marquee effect." width="640" height="480"></a>
              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17887">
                Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users will see the marquee. Delightful.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              The web has always been built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel’s Law</a>: a web browser should assume that it won’t understand everything it reads,
              but it should provide a best-effort rendering for the benefit of its user anyway. Ever wondered why the modern <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is a block rather than a self-closing
              tag? It’s so you can embed <em>within</em> it code that an earlier browser – one that doesn’t understand <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> – can read (a browser’s default state when seeing a
              new element it doesn’t understand is to ignore it and carry on). So embedding a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> gave you the best of both worlds, right?
              <em>(welll…)</em>
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17889" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17889">
              <a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_17889" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2020/11/Netscape5.gif" alt="Netscape Navigator 5 showing a blink effect." width="640" height="480"></a>
              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17889">
                Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and Netscape users will see the blink. Joy.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Better yet, you were safe in the knowledge that anybody using a browser that didn’t understand <em>either</em> of these tags could <em>still read your content</em>. Used properly, the
              web is about <em>progressive enhancement</em>. Implement for everybody, enhance for those who support the shiny features. JavaScript and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can be applied with the same rules, and doing so pays dividends in maintainability and accessibility (though, sadly, that doesn’t stop people writing
              sites that needlessly <em>require</em> these technologies).
            </p>

                Personally, I was a (paying! – back when people used to pay for web browsers!) Opera user so I mostly saw neither <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> nor <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> elements.
                I don’t feel like I missed out.

              I remember, though, the first time I tried Netscape 7, in 2002. Netscape 7 and its close descendent are, as far as I can tell, the only web browsers to support <em>both</em>
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>. Even then, it was picky about the order in which they were presented and the elements wrapped-within them. But support was
              good enough that some people’s personal web pages suddenly began to exhibit the most ugly effect imaginable: the combination of both scrolling and flashing text.
            </p>

              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17892">
                If Netscape 7’s <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> didn’t already make your eyes bleed (I’ve toned it down here by installing the “classic skin”), its simultaneous
                rendering of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> would.

              The <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag is very-definitely <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=blink">dead</a> (<a href="http://tstbtbt.com/">hurrah!</a>), but you can <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">bring it back with pure&nbsp;</a><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"><a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">CSS</a></abbr> if you must.
              <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>, amazingly, still <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=marquee">survives</a>, not only in <a href="https://remysharp.com/2008/09/10/the-silky-smooth-marquee/">polyfills</a> but <em>natively</em>, as you might be able to see above. However, if you’re in any doubt as to whether or not
              you should use it: you shouldn’t. If you’re looking for digital nostalgia, <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8442/internet-nostalgia-2010s-geocities-tumblr-vaporwave">there’s a whole
              rabbit hole to dive down</a>, but you don’t need to inflict <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> on the rest of us.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-a3c25e27=""><h3 id="the-joy-and-pain-of-emacs" tabindex="-1">The Joy (and pain) of Emacs <a href="#the-joy-and-pain-of-emacs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Joy (and pain) of Emacs&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor.<br> —Neal Stephenson, <em>In the Beginning was the Command Line</em></p></blockquote><p>Some years ago, I went through a phase that I imagine many software developers go through at least once in their careers—a period of intense fascination with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emacs</a>. "Emacs is a great operating system that only lacks a decent text editor", as the old joke goes. This rang fairly true in my own experience. Emacs is ostensibly a text editor, but really it is a gateway to a whole world of text-based, flexible tools for managing data of various kinds. Tools like <a href="https://magit.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Magit</a> and <a href="https://orgmode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Org-mode</a> offered (and still offer) unique ways to make sense of a codebase, track tasks, manage notes, automate and integrate with other systems, etc. This was "personal computing" at its purest; most modern GUI productivity apps felt like toys in comparison.</p><p>Emacs is a powerful tool, but it also demands a lot from its user. Eventually I got tired of dealing with the host of plugins and customizations that I needed to keep my system running the way I wanted. I'm at a point in my life where I would rather spend my spare time on hobbies, hanging out with family and friends, and otherwise not messing around with a patchwork of ELisp code snippets that I've cobbled together from various sources. I gradually stopped using Emacs in favor of more modern tools that are less flexible but also less of a hassle.</p><p>However, I often found myself missing some of the features that Emacs provided –&nbsp;<a href="https://orgmode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Org-Mode</a> in particular. Org-Mode is a tool for writing hierarchical text documents, and can serve as the foundation for an entirely text-based workflow for note-taking, agendas, and various forms of personal knowledge management. Once you get the hang of it, it's very intuitive. Some people manage their entire lives through Org-Mode and use it to have years of information at their fingertips.</p><h3 id="obsidian-an-org-mode-replacement" tabindex="-1">Obsidian: An Org-Mode replacement? <a href="#obsidian-an-org-mode-replacement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Obsidian: An Org-Mode replacement?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I'm currently in the process of preparing for a new role on a new team at my job, and I have a lot of projects to get up to speed on. Enter <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Obsidian</a>: a markdown-based text editor and note-taking app that has a lot of features useful for "personal knowledge management". Obsidian is proprietary software, but like Emacs it has an extensive system of <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">community-provided plugins</a> that support all kinds of different workflows (currently I'm using the <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tasks</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=dataview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dataview</a> plugins, both of which let you dynamically aggregate different kinds of content from across documents in one place). Unlike Emacs, out-of-the-box usage of Obsidian is very straightforward (there's even a good Vim mode!), and there is a well-designed iOS client as well (the lack of an easy way to see tasks on a mobile device was one of the biggest limitations of Org-Mode in my experience).</p><p>Like Emacs, Obsidian can be used in a lot of different ways. If I'm going to be successful with this tool, I need to have a vision for how I want to use it. I did a little bit of research about frameworks for personal knowledge management and came across the <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PARA</a> method. The basic idea behind PARA is that you file all your various notes or documents into 4 distinct folders: <strong>Projects</strong> (actionable, short-term), <strong>Areas</strong> (long-term responsibilities or recurring work), <strong>Resources</strong> (useful info to reference later), and <strong>Archive</strong> (anything from any other category that is no longer active). Uncategorized notes typically go into a dedicated inbox folder, and then get organized during a weekly review session. The system seems pretty simple, which I hope will help with being consistent over time. I'd rather have a simple system that I can consistently apply as opposed to a complicated one that I give up on after a few months. PARA is software-independent but it's easy to implement in Obsidian – a "vault" in Obsidian is just a collection of folders and files. My top-level vault structure looks like this:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>00 Inbox/</span></span>
<span><span>01 Projects/</span></span>
<span><span>02 Areas/</span></span>
<span><span>03 Resources/</span></span>
<span><span>04 Archive/</span></span>
<span><span>Attachments/</span></span>
<span><span>Templates/</span></span>
<span><span>DASHBOARD.md</span></span>
<span><span>README.md</span></span>
<span><span>TODO.md</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In addition to the PARA folders (which are numbered to keep them in the desired order) I have an Inbox, an "attachments" directory (Obsidian will put any attached files there automatically, keeping the rest of the structure uncluttered), a "templates" directory for re-usable content, and a small number of top-level files&nbsp;– a dashboard that pulls together items from various places (using the Dataview plugin), a master todo list (which pulls in tasks from all documents and organizes them, using the Tasks plugin), and a README file to remind me how things are structured. Everything else lives on one of these folders – typically the Inbox first, and then one of the PARA folders after review.</p><p>We'll see how well this works in practice, but this is my plan for now.</p><h3 id="why-bother-doing-this" tabindex="-1">Why bother doing this? <a href="#why-bother-doing-this" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why bother doing this?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I mentioned above that I stopped using Emacs because I no longer wished to spend the time or effort in fine-tuning and maintaining the custom workflows I was relying on. Setting up a personally-curated system (complete with its own acronym) to manage notes, bookmarks, tasks, etc. sounds like a lot of similar fiddly computer work. So why bother doing it?</p><p>The rise of LLM-based AIs like ChatGPT amounts to a paradigm-shift in human-computer interaction. If Steve Jobs was building bicycles for the mind, then Sam Altman is operating a fleet of automated driverless taxis like the ones you can currently see cruising the streets of San Francisco. These tools offer a lot of convenience, but you are increasingly a passenger being taken along for a ride.</p><p>I'm not a complete AI doomer (not yet at least), but I worry about how much people may start to <a href="https://publiccomment.blog/p/you-ll-never-think-alone-17051813d0b4a40f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">outsource their own thinking</a> to these tools. I worry about succumbing to the convenience myself if I'm being honest.</p><p>So what is the value of maintaining a personal knowledge base in the age of AI? Task-tracking and note-taking are practical and useful, but ultimately I want to treat my own thoughts as if they have value. I want to be a little more intentional and deliberate in my own thinking, and to have a space to engage in dialog with my own ideas. I want to be able to draw from my own knowledge instead of relying on AI assistants for everything. Maybe such an approach can even be complimentary to using AI tools; with the right plugins Obsidian can serve as an MCP server, which would allow tools like Claude to discover and read items in your vault. Perhaps this could offer the best of both worlds. But the key thing is that the AI is the <em>assistant</em>, and my thoughts and ideas remain my own.</p><p>At the end of the day, I still want to ride my own damn bicycle.</p></div></div>]]></description>
