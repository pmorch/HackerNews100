    <p>Growing up, there was a more positive view of tech. The future looked awesome - media showing how the future could look like had amazing ideas about how tech could help us and look cool doing it. It was all about comfort, less work, personalized assistance, reducing friction and hassle, unconventional designs, improved materials. The ads were painting a bright future with glossy robots, blinking datacenters, transhumanist image of cyborg-esque humans <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>; an age of knowledge and connection, productivity and ease. We didn't have to think about how it was made, who would lose their job over it, how it would be profitable, how it would be repaired or recycled if broken, how much energy it would use or what rare metals would be needed. It was just <em>cool</em>.</p>
<p>Then came social media, and smartphones. A lot of tools in one, how convenient! How amazing to have the ability to record audio or take pictures while being so affordable! Now even poor people or people in poorer countries could access the internet and some valuable education unrestricted by their environments. I don't know if we had this view organically or if it was pushed on us by the tech companies in interviews and posts - but I distinctly remember this view that this would make society better, that it would be a big step forward for humankind.</p>
<p>The interconnection was presented as the ability to finally collaborate knowledge more quickly and enter a new knowledge era. The ability to produce and share your own content and become a star overnight online without casting managers and directors or record studios emboldened the idea of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps, a geographically unlimited American Dream. Everyone could suddenly be rich or become educated. More free time, more money, more means for people to leave their economic class upward and have financial freedom. The option of having communication channels outside of journalism and documentaries was portrayed as more uncensored as authentic or fringe voices were being heard, documenting events live that would have maybe never been reported on otherwise. There was this idea that it would somehow severely reduce or end xenophobia and racism as we would all suddenly be able to interact with each other globally and learn that the others weren't so bad - a very simplified, almost childlike view of racism. There'd be clean energy, a solution for climate change; poverty would be solved. Ideally, we would now all come together and create something big while overcoming limits and bigotry.</p>
<p>And the tech companies were all just there to facilitate that for the greater good. Right. But is that true?</p>
<p>They're still evoking this image. Their ads featuring grandparents who don't have to feel alone because the family can videocall, or students quickly finding out facts for their assignment, neighborhoods organizing via their platforms, the image of tech enhancing the family life with grocery lists and drawings and games for the family!<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> Nevermind that most of these are pretty dystopian if you sit and think on it. But more people are picking up on it now as it gets more overt, more apparent, that the marketing people and higher ups in tech seem to live in a bubble detached from the reality of millions; not realizing that a spot featuring how AI is writing the fan-letter for a child is not cute, not innovative or something to strive towards <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I do think the internet and tech managed to hit some of the advantages and goals - so far, it <em>did</em> facilitate more political knowledge and resistance<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>, circumvented government censorship<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>, let people meet and change each others lives who would have likely never met otherwise<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>; helped to gather knowledge<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>, gave better access to scientific studies, papers, statistics, and culturally important media<sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">8</a></sup>, helped piracy and archiving efforts<sup id="fnref-9"><a href="#fn-9">9</a></sup> and gave disabled and chronically ill more options to socialize<sup id="fnref-10"><a href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> - just to name a few things. But in my view, these positives are increasingly being overshadowed.</p>
<p>What about the goal of coming together to share knowledge and help everyone get better access to education? I think the internet undeniably helped with Wikipedia, YouTube tutorials, specialized blogs, forums and more - but now, the forums and specialized indie websites and blogs have been dying and are strongly de-prioritized by search engines, therefore hard to find <sup id="fnref-11"><a href="#fn-11">11</a></sup>. Informational posts on social media are walled off behind login screens<sup id="fnref-12"><a href="#fn-12">12</a></sup>. At the same time, it is the top breeding ground for disinformation<sup id="fnref-13"><a href="#fn-13">13</a></sup>, aided by AI that hallucinates information<sup id="fnref-14"><a href="#fn-14">14</a></sup>. Together with the Fake News President, I've seen our time described as the "post-truth era" <sup id="fnref-15"><a href="#fn-15">15</a></sup>. It doesn't matter what the truth is, it is for who has the most power and money to decide what the truth is.</p>
<p>How about the bootstrap mentality? The internet has undoubtedly made people rich or well-off who may wouldn't otherwise be; but it's apparent that these are often people accused (and sometimes convicted) of sexual assault, harassment, abusing their employees, wage theft, tax fraud, and other crimes <sup id="fnref-16"><a href="#fn-16">16</a></sup>.  They are people who need to game the attention economy by increasingly disrespectful and shocking content, gore, rage bait, dehumanizing pranks<sup id="fnref-17"><a href="#fn-17">17</a></sup>, extreme consumerism like huge shopping hauls, sloppy large mukbangs, shredding lamborghinis<sup id="fnref-18"><a href="#fn-18">18</a></sup>, gambling streams and websites<sup id="fnref-19"><a href="#fn-19">19</a></sup>, game shows<sup id="fnref-20"><a href="#fn-20">20</a></sup> and more. And they have to do that to sell us products we don't need, banking on our insecurities. We've created an internet economy that incentivizes the worst in humanity - for clout, for money.</p>
<p>Educational content is still there, but everything is getting increasingly more paywalled. Scientific data is still harder to access and read<sup id="fnref-21"><a href="#fn-21">21</a></sup>. The sensationalized rage bait articles are freely accessible, but the thorough analyses and takedowns are restricted<sup id="fnref-22"><a href="#fn-22">22</a></sup>. Archives get taken down<sup id="fnref-23"><a href="#fn-23">23</a></sup>, people are less willing to upload content for free. There's Patreon, and Udemy, and Skillshare, and more. You get a snippet, but the rest is in their 199$ course. Some of them are surely good and worth it, but it's still a shame that we have to do this when we were sold on a free future with less economic worries and in times where many people cannot even afford proper food.</p>
<p>What about xenophobia, racism and other forms of discrimination and bias? People are perceived as being more polarized and extreme<sup id="fnref-24"><a href="#fn-24">24</a></sup>, there's talk of echo chambers and divided nations<sup id="fnref-25"><a href="#fn-25">25</a></sup>. Comment sections are often toxic and full of hate speech<sup id="fnref-26"><a href="#fn-26">26</a></sup>. Members of oppressed groups are bullied off of platforms<sup id="fnref-27"><a href="#fn-27">27</a></sup>. Ads used online have been shown to be discriminatory because certain groups of people are specifically targeted and shown different prices, worse job offers or similar things<sup id="fnref-28"><a href="#fn-28">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The sustainability of it all is the cherry on top. We are now at a point when it isn't just cool and aspirational. Now we <em>do</em> have to think about how it was made, who <em>will</em> lose their job over it<sup id="fnref-29"><a href="#fn-29">29</a></sup>, on whose backs it makes profit<sup id="fnref-30"><a href="#fn-30">30</a></sup>, how it will be repaired or recycled if broken<sup id="fnref-31"><a href="#fn-31">31</a></sup>, how much energy or water it <em>uses</em><sup id="fnref-32"><a href="#fn-32">32</a></sup> or what rare metals or finite resources it <em>needs</em><sup id="fnref-33"><a href="#fn-33">33</a></sup>. The fantasy is over.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/avas/ai-1.webp" alt="&quot;You know what the biggest problem with pushing all-things-AI is? Wrong direction. I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I an do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.&quot; by Joanna Maciejewska"></p>
<p>Has the tech world kept up this image, their promise, their goals? No. Even with AI now and the ads released for Gemini, ChatGPT and others, they still bank on the utopian world state they failed to deliver even until now. It's like we're made to believe it is always just. out. of. reach. but the next technological advancement will fix it and finally make it real.</p>
<p>But they're lying. Obviously, companies will say and do what brings them the most money, this isn't new or a shocker. But greenwashing <sup id="fnref-34"><a href="#fn-34">34</a></sup> is a problem. Making wonderfully diverse ads while internally still discriminating against women, people of color, disabled people and more <sup id="fnref-35"><a href="#fn-35">35</a></sup> is a problem. Claiming you care about progress , innovation and talent but supporting anti-immigrant policies is a problem<sup id="fnref-36"><a href="#fn-36">36</a></sup>. Presenting your products as a solution for systemic issues that you help facilitate by your voting and your wages and political donations or endorsements is disgusting, and so is using marketing to curate an image of the caring, careful, fair pay, progressive and ecological company while union-busting<sup id="fnref-37"><a href="#fn-37">37</a></sup>, regularly losing your data or misusing it<sup id="fnref-38"><a href="#fn-38">38</a></sup> forcing RTO<sup id="fnref-39"><a href="#fn-39">39</a></sup> and pushing for deregulation in everything<sup id="fnref-40"><a href="#fn-40">40</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I want to have a closer look on some tech companies and VC lobbying, their values, endorsements and political or environmental consequences.</p>

<li><mark>Meta</mark> (owner of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, Quest, and more) - well known for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2024/10/31/facebook-ads-election-misinformation/" target="_blank">election misinformation</a>, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, its Facebook algorithm having

<li><mark>ByteDance</mark> (owner of TikTok, Douyin, CapCut, Lemon8 and others) routinely faces distrust because of Chinese national intelligence and ability for China to shape public opinion elsewhere by the powerful algorithm, and was involved in controversies around censorship of <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/08/tech/tiktok-data-china/index.html" target="_blank">Hong Kong</a> protests <a href="https://archive.is/xMeMu" target="_blank">in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bytedance-uighur-livestreams-douyin-censorship-2021-2" target="_blank">Uyghur oppression</a>, and allegedly pushing <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d460c6f6-ffc7-4d61-9350-bef378fcc5c5" target="_blank">pro-Russian propaganda</a>.</li>
<li><mark>Amazon</mark> (owner of Amazon and its services like Prime and Music, Audible, Twitch, IMDb, Goodreads, Whole Foods, Kindle and Fire TV, Echo etc.) - As previously mentioned in the footnotes, there has been union-busting, which effectively means being hostile to fair and livable wages, good <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/osha/osha20230201-0" target="_blank">working conditions</a> and worker protections in general. We've all heard of the Amazon warehouse horror <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-10-25/pain-exhaustion-rampant-among-amazon-warehouse-workers-study-says" target="_blank">stories</a> or Amazon driver <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehamilton/2023/05/24/delivery-drivers-sue-amazon-for-being-forced-to-pee-in-bottles/" target="_blank">pee bottles</a>. Ex-CEO Jeff Bezos has been in the news recently because of <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/28/media/jeff-bezos-defends-washington-post-endorsement/index.html" target="_blank">killing the Harris WaPo endorsement</a> and his subsequent <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/06/media/jeff-bezos-congratulates-trump-victory-amazon-post/index.html" target="_blank">tweet</a>.</li>
<li><mark>Alphabet</mark> (owner of Google and its services, YouTube, Waymo, Waze, Android, Fitbit ...) - often criticized for privacy violations, <a href="https://archive.is/GdWnH" target="_blank">offensive</a> tech, political censorship especially in regards to China, Turkey and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220329150922/https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-censors-war" target="_blank">Russia</a>, bad working conditions &amp; handling of <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/01/tech/google-walkout-one-year-later-risk-takers/index.html" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a> complaints, violating <a href="https://archive.ph/VKXEU" target="_blank">HIPAA</a> and more. They also ran an <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/google-had-secret-project-to-convince-employees-that-unions-suck/" target="_blank">anti-union</a> campaign.
Most notable figure is Sundar Pichai, its CEO. Pichai has made headlines for firing of employees over <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sundar-pichai-tells-google-staff-104845522.html" target="_blank">political expression</a> against Google being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Nimbus" target="_blank">allegedly complicit</a> in genocide.</li>
<li><mark>X</mark> is obviously by now very associated with Elon Musk and his personal brand/views that most people are very aware of, so I won't get too deeply into it. He created a super-PAC to support Donald Trump<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2022/11/27/elon-musks-political-shift-how-the-billionaire-moved-from-backing-obama-to-endorsing-desantis/" target="_blank">Since 2021</a>, he has donated exclusively to Republicans. His companies are well known for an extremely unforgiving and abusive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/16/23833447/tesla-elon-musk-ultra-hardcore-employees-land-of-the-giants" target="_blank">work culture</a>, are actively contributing to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-02-23/tesla-pollution-fined-epa" target="_blank">pollution</a> and helping erode forests and cause <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/03/1131695382/tesla-ev-electric-vehicles-europe-germany-drought-climate-change-factory" target="_blank">water issues</a>.</li>
<li><mark>Andreessen Horowitz</mark>, better known as <mark>a16z</mark>, is a private venture capital firm. They are known for investing into tech startups and used to invest into well known brands such as Skype, Twitter, Facebook, Groupon, Roblox, Stripe, Medium, Coinbase, Soylent, Buzzfeed, Airbnb and more - but also Anduril, which manufactures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_Industries" target="_blank">autonomous weapons</a>. As you can see, they have their money in a lot of things we use, so I think it is important to mention them. They committed to <a href="https://archive.ph/20221031200731/https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/31/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/" target="_blank">$400 million in equity investment</a> towards acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk back in 2022. Especially Marc Andreessen has been known to donate to Republicans, especially in support of deregulation, no government intervention and 'free speech', and against environmental sustainability and reduced gender inequalities, as per his own tech-optimism manifesto. They have made significant investments in cryptocurrency, which is environmentally questionable and constantly involved in <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/" target="_blank">scams and thefts</a>. Last July, the co-founders publicly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/andreessen-horowitz-co-founders-explain-why-theyre-supporting-trump/" target="_blank">endorsed</a> Donald Trump<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup>.</li>
<li><mark>YCombinator</mark> is a startup accelerator and venture capital firm; they helped start the companies DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Reddit, Stripe or Twitch, and many more. They should be on this list for the same reasons that a16z is. Its CEO, Garry Tan, is known to be vitriolic online, anti-progressive, opposed to regulation and deceleration, and very <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/09/27/garry-tan-y-combinator-declares-war-san-francisco-politics-progressives-elon-musk/" target="_blank">supportive</a> of Elon Musk.</li>
<li><mark>Sequoia Capital</mark> is a venture capital firm with who has in the past invested in Apple, Nvidia, ByteDance, Cisco, and many more - even the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank">FTX</a> that engaged in fraud. It has come under scrutiny for potentially <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b8d70626-b949-4a1b-969f-58896eb2ef71" target="_blank">helping</a> China's military. Individuals associated with Sequoia <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/sequoia-capital/summary?id=D000000803" target="_blank">donated</a> to <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/09/right-for-america/" target="_blank">"Right For America"</a> which is a super PAC for Donald Trump, Musk's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-america-pac-trump-d248547966bf9c6daf6f5d332bc4be66" target="_blank">America PAC</a>, <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/01/never-back-down-inc/" target="_blank">"Never Back Down Inc."</a> for DeSantis, and several Republican comittees. Most notable figures associated with the donations behind Sequoia are <a href="https://archive.is/Cp5xF" target="_blank">Shaun Maguire</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/elon-musk-pac-voter-data-trump-harris.html" target="_blank">Douglas Leone</a>.</li>
<li>There are also some notable people to be looking out for; like <mark>David Sacks</mark> (Venture capitalist and former PayPal COO), who has donated repeatedly to the Republican Party, hosted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks#Support_for_political_campaigns" target="_blank">fundraisers</a> for Republican figures like Vance, Masters, Kennedy, and Trump<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup>, being a speaker at the 2024 RNC and calling the Trump trial a <a href="https://archive.is/o/Cp5xF/https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1796294540388876543" target="_blank">sham</a>; or <mark>Peter Thiel</mark> (co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies#Controversies" target="_blank">Palantir Technologies</a> and PayPal and early Facebook investor) donated over $1 million to Trump’s<sup id="fnref-41"><a href="#fn-41">41</a></sup> campaign in 2016 and allegedly <a href="https://archive.is/dbMG8" target="_blank">warmed up to Trump</a> again this year. J. D. Vance is described as his <a href="https://archive.is/Z9i60" target="_blank">protégé</a> and he himself as super nationalistic, longing for a sort of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/20/peter-thiel-book-facebook-trump-jd-vance-blake-masters-josh-hawley-513121" target="_blank">dictator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a selection (I am writing a casual blog post after all, not a book) - there’s surely more to dig up and more companies to talk about. Yes, there have been notable efforts to ease the negative effects these companies have or use their money for good<sup id="fnref-42"><a href="#fn-42">42</a></sup>, but it is not enough, and there is a worrying trend of Tech veering strongly to the right and using the money they get from us and our data for questionable causes. And how is any of this in alignment with techs lofty, amazing sounding goals and marketing image? The solution cannot be to just throw more tech at it.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is to say: the tech utopia fantasy is truly dead to me. The image of the cool, hippie, leftist Silicon Valley tech is wrong. The companies themselves and the VC’s they take money from are supporting values and governments that do not act in your best interest and do not even align with their marketing image. Don’t be further misled. Stop giving them your money, time and data as much as possible for you. They won't bring us closer to these ideals they promise.</p>

<li id="fn-12"><p>I mean how you cannot view Instagram stories without being logged in, or how on Desktop you cannot even click on the posts. On mobile, you cannot watch the same video twice. Many TikTok embeds seem to redirect you to the App Store/Play Store to install the app. X seems to jumble the posts while not logged in and prompts you to sign up when scrolling down. Reddit is highly inaccessible now because many communities are marked as "Unreviewed" and therefore only accessible within the app. Content deemed NSFW also needs an account, which sadly often even includes non-sexual, non-gore things like queer topics and spaces.<a href="#fnref-12">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn-13"><p>Like this <a href="https://archive.is/hqOyB" target="_blank">study</a> that attempts to assign a Misinformation Amplification Factor to social media websites/apps.

<p>Edit: Sorry for the people seeing it on HackerNews, didn’t post it there and it wasn’t intended for that audience 🤷🏻‍♀️ yes, it’s an “immature rant”, because it starts with “I have to rant about the home office situation […] specifically at my place of employment”. This is not a professional article, it’s a personal blog; it was written after I was on the phone with the disability rep, talking to each other about these matters. I fear since this isn’t the US private sector I’m talking about, it may not match your experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to rant about the home office situation in general, but also specifically at my place of employment and similar places.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the fake positivity and cute-sounding arguments for returning to the office. It falls flat for so many and it’s trying to make it sound more legitimate by evoking this image of collaboration, being social, kindness, having a good time together when that’s not the point. The point is micromanagement and needing to justify the large office spaces they invested into. Very rarely are there positions or departments who truly need to collab in person, and then they can just do that for the occasion, not a fixed amount of days per week or month where they need to go in at all times.</p>
<p>It’s a joke. At my place, we don’t innovate, we don’t develop new products for a mass market; we do lots of data entry, emails, and writing reports in SharePoint or with comments and track changes in Word. Excel spreadsheets and databases. Absolutely everything is digitized, we send auto-emails and all communication is via Teams or Mail and very rarely over phone. Documents arrive digitally. All the collaboration is already online and there is no need for an office presence. Even when you are in office, you don’t even see the people for the work since it’s all online!</p>
<p>But they’ll look at FAANG and be like: “Ooh, they’re asking everyone to be back at the office because of better collaboration!” You clown, the collaboration happens the same regardless where my ass sits and we are not designers or knowledge workers solving issues, we handle data! We are not pioneers or a Silicon Valley tech firm!</p>
<p>Asking everyone back to the office for the supposed social aspect is truly the fruit-bowl-ification of it all. It’s about as convincing to work for you as the mention of the kicker table in your job listings. I like my coworkers, and I call them often just to talk, or create Teams meetings just to catch up in private matters and not a work meeting. But asking people back into the office to be more social and combat supposed isolation is dumb! The people who need this are not prevented to come in and do just that anyway. But you’re asking people to waste fuel and time commuting there, tired, sitting their ass off at a table for that? You’re asking me as an immunocompromised and chronically ill person in pain and dealing with fatigue to show up and do the same stuff I do at home so others can play family at work?</p>
<p>Babes, I am less social with the office than without. When I come home from the office I lie in bed and that’s it. I am drained. I haven’t had the time or energy to see the people I truly care about much. This isolates me more. When I get sick from it (like last year at the Christmas function when someone brought Covid!) I am isolated at home. And for what, so people who insist on office time have someone they see in the hallway on the way to the toilet?</p>
<p>They haven’t taken it away yet, but the threat seems to always be there and often serves as a way to enact pressure or as a bargaining chip. Behave or we can’t do that anymore, it’s a privilege not a right, we do this out of goodwill, some people abuse this and so on.</p>
<p>Home office is the only way for many people to have a decent work output because family, household, caretaking, further education, illness and free time activities are better taken care of this way and people can work focused in silence without noise and interruption.  It lessens stress and burnout and allows people to see more of their loved ones - much more meaningful socially than office interactions.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t had home office possibilities, I would’ve been gone from work for 8 months minimum due to my illness. But this way, I was still able to do the daily work, launch new features needed in our database, sign stuff as a representative and more. Home office is so important for disabled and chronically ill people to get and retain employment, and team members and coworkers deserve it as well to not have to take over someone else’s work for so long just because of a refusal to let people work from home. You cannot dangle what people need to effectively work in front of them like a carrot and subtly threaten to take it away. It’s ableist. You wouldn’t dare to do that with elevators or other accessibility features at the office, so don’t do it with that either.</p>
<p>And that’s also what I sent the staff council and our disability representative at work. So far, I received positive feedback for that.</p>
<p>The past few years but especially this year, I saw my coworkers bust their ass to make it all work. More work, more responsibilities, no extra hires, no pay increase. I busted my ass to make it all work despite my illness. Twice in a row in my three years in that spot, I got a performance bonus for my great work. Well, they told us all this year there won’t be any for anyone despite it all.</p>
<p>If they take away or severely limit home office too, I’m throwing, man. Then do your shit alone and drive all the young capable people away, in the place where like 50% of the work force will retire in the next 5 years. Fuck around and find out.</p>

<p>Each image is actually a mosaic of 25 high-resolution shots snapped by the Solar Orbiter mission on March 22, 2023. The spacecraft captured all 100 total images when it was less than 46 million miles from the sun. The process took more than four hours, since the spacecraft had to change position for each individual photograph. In the final mosaics, the sun’s diameter is almost 8,000 pixels across.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter">Solar Orbiter</a> is a joint mission between the ESA and NASA, operated by the ESA, that launched in February 2020 and released its first images the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-our-suns-surface-unprecedented-detail-180975380/">following July</a>. Since its launch, the program has hit many milestones, capturing both the closest-ever images of the sun and the first close-up images of its polar regions.</p>

<p>While the spacecraft totes six <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/01/Solar_Orbiter_s_instruments">imaging instruments</a>, the newly released images were captured with just two: the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The PHI is responsible for three of the new solar views—an image in visible light, a map of the direction of the magnetic field and a velocity map featuring the speed and direction of parts of the sun’s surface. The EUI, meanwhile, produced an image of our star’s outer atmosphere, called the corona, in ultraviolet light.</p>

<p>“These new high-resolution maps from Solar Orbiter’s PHI instrument show the beauty of the sun’s surface magnetic field and flows in great detail. At the same time, they are crucial for inferring the magnetic field in the sun’s hot corona, which our EUI instrument is imaging,” <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/personal-profiles/daniel-mueller">Daniel Müller</a>, a Solar Orbiter project scientist with the ESA, says in a <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter/New_full_Sun_views_show_sunspots_fields_and_restless_plasma">statement</a>. “The sun’s magnetic field is key to understanding the dynamic nature of our home star from the smallest to the largest scales.”</p>

<p>The four images offer a high-definition tour of the sun. First, the visible light image below depicts the star’s constantly moving surface of hot plasma—or charged gas, simply put. This layer has a temperature between 8,132 and 10,832 degrees Fahrenheit and emits most of the sun’s radiation.</p>

<p>Beneath the surface is the sun’s convection zone, in which dense plasma swirls around, rather like the magma in Earth’s mantle. This phenomenon makes the sun’s surface look grainy, and scientists say the star’s magnetic field is <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/researchers-trace-the-origin-of-the-suns-magnetic-field-shedding-light-on-space-weather-and-solar-cycles-180984410/">driven by the churning plasma</a>.</p>

<p>Dark shapes called sunspots are seen in both PHI’s visible light image and its magnetic map, shown below. The sun’s <a href="https://www.weather.gov/fsd/sunspots#:~:text=Sunspots%3A%20One%20interesting%20aspect%20of,anywhere%20else%20on%20the%20Sun.">magnetic field is stronger at the sunspots</a>, with red in the image indicating where it moves outward and blue indicating where it moves inward.</p>

<p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/sun/sunspots/">Sunspots</a> are concentrated tangles of magnetic fields, where plasma is diverted from the sun’s heat-mixing convective flow, making it cooler than surrounding areas. As a result, the plasma in sunspots gives off less light and appears dark in the visible light image.</p>

<p>The image processing that produced the PHI’s images was “new and difficult,” per the statement, but moving forward, ESA experts expect to produce similar images with greater speed, potentially releasing two a year.</p>

<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

<p>
SQLite is a TCL extension that has escaped into the wild.


</p><p>
The design of SQLite was inspired by the design of TCL, both in
the way it handles datatypes and in the formatting of its source
code.
The index use case for SQLite was in a Tcl/Tk application for an
industrial company.
From its inception, SQLite has always depended heavily on TCL.
These days, SQLite no longer uses TCL internally and can be run
separately from any TCL interpreter, and yet the SQLite development
process still depends heavily on TCL.
</p>

<h3>1.1 About SQLite</h3>

<p>
SQLite is an SQL database engine, and 
the most widely used database engine in the world.
SQLite is built into all cellphones as a core component and is the
primary means of data persistence on phones.  SQLite is also an
integral part of most web browsers.  SQLite is built into MacOS and
is used by most of the default applications on that platform.
Windows10 requires the C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll file in
order to boot.  Countless other popular applications like Skype 
and WhatsApp and iTunes depend on SQLite.

</p><p>
Because SQLite is open source and can be freely downloaded and
duplicated, exact usage numbers are unavailable.  But reasonable
estimates are that there are more SQLite instances in operation
today than there are people on earth.  Most devices that
use the SQLite database engine contain hundreds of separate databases,
and there are billions of such devices.  Hence, there are likely
around one trillion SQLite databases in active use.

</p><p>
There are more copies of SQLite in use than there are copies of Linux.
We know this because SQLite is used on almost all Linux systems, but
SQLite is also used on many other non-linux systems such as Macs, iPhones,
and Windows computers.
By similar arguments, there are more copies of SQLite in use than
there are Macs, or Windows PCs.
There are probably more copies of SQLite in use than all other database
engines combined.
It seems likely that SQLite is the most widely used and deployed
software component of any kind, with the possible exception of the
zLib compression library.

</p><h3>1.2 SQLite Is A TCL Extension, Not A TCL Application</h3>

<p>
SQLite is not written in TCL.  Rather, SQLite is intended to be used
by TCL.  Like the TCL interpreter, SQLite is written in ANSI C.

</p><p>
The fact that SQLite was primarily intended to be used from TCL
is evident in an number of ways.

</p><p>
All programming languages, other than C/C++, require some kind of
adaptor in order to interface with the SQLite C implementation.  Language
adaptors for SQLite are widely available from third party programmers.
The adaptors for PHP and Python are built into those languages, for
example.  A Java adaptor is baked into Android.  And so forth.  Only
the TCL adaptor is included as part of the SQLite core.  The source code
file that implements the TCL adaptor for SQLite, "tclsqlite.c",
was part of the very first check-in on the SQLite source repository
on 2000-05-29.  (See 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9">https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9</a>.)

</p><p>
All modern SQL implementations provide a means to do late binding of
parameter values to the SQL statements.  Usually a naked "?" character,
or a "?" followed by an integer is used.  For example:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=<b>?1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The "?1" token in the SQL above would be assigned a value at run-time
in order to look up the password and photograph of a particular user.

</p><p>
SQLite supports this syntax.  But because of its TCL heritage, SQLite
also allows the parameter to take the form of a TCL variable.  Hence:

</p><blockquote><pre>SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=<b>$uid</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
When a statement such as the above is run, the TCL language adaptor
automatically binds the value of the $uid TCL variable to the SQL statement
before it is evaluated, providing an intuitive and seamless interface
between TCL and SQL.  SQLite is the only database engine that behaves
this way.

</p><p>
The TCL heritage of SQLite is visible in the type system of
SQLite.  Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic
TCL principal that "everything is a string".  Beginning with SQLite3
(2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data.  However, types are still
very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL.  SQLite treats the datatypes
on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than
hard requirements.  SQLite is happy to store a 100KB string value in a
column that is declared "SHORT INT", just as TCL is happy to store either
a large string or a small integer in the same variable.  There are some
differences in how SQLite deals with datatypes, in comparison to TCL, due
to the different nature of the SQL language.  SQLite has the concept of
"type affinity".  If a column is declared "INT" and one inserts a string
into that column that looks like an integer and can be safely converted into
an integer without loss of information, then that conversion occurs
automatically.  This provides a measure of compatibility with the rigid
type systems of other SQL database engines.

</p><p>
The flexible type system of SQLite seems natural and intuitive to programmers
with prior experience programming in TCL.  Curiously, though, it is a source
of frustration and frequent complaining from programmers accustomed to the
rigid and unforgiving type systems of languages like Java.

</p><p>
The similarities in the type systems of TCL and SQLite extends to more than
just the interface.  An important part of the C/C++ interface for SQLite
is the "sqlite3_value" object
(<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html">https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html</a>) which is analogous to the
Tcl_Obj object in TCL.  Both TCL and SQLite use a dual-representation approach,
where each value can be represented simultaneously as both a string and
some other type.

</p><h2>2.0 How SQLite Depends On Tcl</h2>

<p>
SQLite began as a TCL extension, though these days most uses of SQLite
are in applications written in languages other than TCL.  Many programmers
who use SQLite in their applications have no knowledge or awareness of TCL.
The SQLite source code used by most developers is a single file of pure
C code named "sqlite3.c" that contains no TCL code.  
This is what we mean when we
say that SQLite as "escaped" into the wild.  Deployed instances of SQLite
no longer depends on TCL.

</p><p>
Nevertheless, SQLite is still heavily dependent upon TCL and the ongoing
support, maintenance, and enhancement of SQLite would not be possible without
TCL, and would be seriously inconvenienced without Tk.


</p><h3>2.1 SQLite Source Code Is Mostly TCL</h3>

<p>
The deliverable source code for SQLite is a single file named
"sqlite3.c" and its companion header "sqlite3.h".
Both files are 100% ANSI-C code.  But developers do not edit these
files directly.  The sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h source files are build
products, and the source tree used to build those files is over 50%
TCL code.  Figure 1 nearby shows the exact ratios.

cases and much of the documentation is held in separate repositories,
not included in Figure 1.  The separate repositories also contain a great
deal of TCL code.

</p><p>
Much of the TCL code in the main SQLite repository consists of test scripts.
At this writing, the core repository contains 1153 separate test scripts
totally about 389 KB of space.
But this is not the only use of TCL in SQLite.

</p><h3>2.2 Machine Generated C Code</h3>

<p>
A non-trivial amount of the deliverable C code for SQLite is machine
generated.  Some of the machine generated code is created by C programs,
such as LEMON which translates the SQL language grammar into C code to
implement a push-down automaton to parse the SQL language.  But much of
the automatically generated code is created using TCL scripts.  TCL is
well suited for scanning source files to extract information to be
merged with other files and for making mechanized edits.  For example,
the byte-code engine used to evaluate SQL statements inside of SQLite
is implemented as a large "switch" statement inside a "for" loop, with a
separate "case" for each opcode, all in the "vdbe.c" source file.
At build-time, TCL scripts scan the vdbe.c source file looking for the
appropriate "case" statements and then build header files that assign
consecutive integers to each symbolic opcode name.  (The opcodes used by
the SQLite byte-code engine are not an API as they are in TCL and thus
can change from one build to the next.)  This mapping of symbolic opcode
names into integers is not a simple as one might suppose.  For reasons
of optimization, there are many constraints on the specific values that
are assigned to opcodes.  For example, many opcodes such as OP_Add must
have the same numeric value as the corresponding "+" token in the SQL
language parser.  Sometimes a group of related opcodes, such as the
comparison operators OP_Eq, OP_Ne, OP_Lt, OP_Le, OP_Ge, and OP_Gt, need
to be assigned consecutive integers in a specific order.  These constraints
are all handled effortlessly in TCL.  Accomplishing the
same with AWK would be rather more difficult.

</p><p>
Perhaps the most important task for TCL during the SQLite build process
is constructing the SQLite amalgamation source code file.
Recall that most developers use SQLite in the form of a single big file
of C code named "sqlite3.c" and referred to as "the amalgamation".
A TCL script named "mksqlite3c.tcl" runs in order to construct the
amalgamation from over one hundred separate input files.  Each of these
inputs files must be added to the amalgamation in just the right order.
Furthermore, the source files are edited as part of the amalgamation building
process.  When mksqlite3c.tcl encounters a "#include" for an SQLite header,
it replaces the "#include" with a copy of that header file, taking care
to make sure each header file is only included once.  The mksqlite3.tcl
script automatically adds the "static" keyword to internal SQLite APIs
to give them file linkage, and makes other similar edits.

</p><h3>2.3 The sqlite3_analyzer.exe Utility</h3>

<p>
In addition to the core SQLite library, the SQLite source tree also contains
code for several analysis and control programs.  One of these programs
is called "sqlite3_analyzer" (or "sqlite3_analyzer.exe" on Windows).
The sqlite3_analyzer program examines an SQLite database and generates
a detailed report on the disk usage by the various tables and indexes
within that database.  The sqlite3_analyzer program is very useful in
understanding how an application is using disk space.

</p><p>
It turns out that sqlite3_analyzer, though disguised as an ordinary
executable, is really a TCL application.  The main source code file for
this application is
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file/tool/spaceanal.tcl">tool/spaceanal.tcl</a>.
During the build process, this script is converted into a C-language
string constant (using another TCL script) and added to a very simple
C-language wrapper than starts a TCL interpreter and then passes the
application script to that interpreter.

</p><p>
The sqlite3_analyzer program could be rewritten in pure C.  But that
would be a lot of code.  The TCL script that implements sqlite3_analyzer is
less than 1000 lines long.  The equivalent C program would surely be at
least ten times larger.

</p><p>
Note that the sqlite3_analyzer utility program statically links a TCL
interpreter and so does not require a TCL installation on the target
computer to use.  The sqlite3_analyzer utility program is used by
tens of thousands of developers, most of whom do not realize that they
are really running a TCL application.

</p><h3>2.4 TCL Used For Testing SQLite</h3>

<p>
One of the key features of SQLite is that it uses aviation-grade testing.
The tests of SQLite, at a minimum, provide 100% modified condition/decision
coverage (MC/DC) of the SQLite code, with independence.  100% MC/DC roughly
means that every branch instruction at the machine code level is exercised
at least once in each direction.  The precise definition of
MC/DC is slightly stricter than this, for example when comparing boolean
vectors, but the 100% branch tests coverage definition is very close
approximation.  The "with independence" term means that SQLite is tested
in multiple ways with test code being written and maintained by different
individuals.

</p><p>
The amount of testing done on SQLite is fanatical.  On the other hand,
that level of testing is necessary for a fundamental low-level component,
such as a database engine, that is used by billions of devices.  If an
ordinary application encounters an obscure bug, it can normally be rebooted 
to clear the problem.  But the job of a database engine is to remember things,
and so databases tend to remember their mistakes across reboots.  For these
reasons, it is important that SQLite have a very low bug density.

</p><p>
TCL is used in every aspect of SQLite testing.
The test cases that are part of the primary SQLite source code
repository are written in TCL.
Other test cases such as 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3</a> and
<a href="https://sqlite.org/sqllogictest">SQLLogicTest</a> are written
in C but still depend on TCL for operation.

</p><p>
The TH3 test suite is a set of proprietary tests for SQLite that form the
primary means of achieving 100% MC/DC.  TH3 is designed to
run on embedded hardware without the support of a desktop operating system.
TH3 consists of over 1350 test modules together with over 100 control files.
The test modules are written in either C or SQL or a combination of both.
The control files are text formatted in a way that easily parsed by TCL.
To build a TH3 test, a TCL script is run that combines some subset of the
test modules and control files into a single large C program that will
automatically run the required tests.  This C program is then linked against
the "sqlite3.c" amalgamation and the resulting binary is moved to the target
computer and executed.  TCL scripts automate this entire process on
all major host platforms.

</p><p>
To verify that the TH3 tests really do provide 100% MC/DC, special options
are added to the TCL scripts that run the tests, causing the GCC coverage
analysis tools to be invoked.  The output of gcov is then postprocessed to
reveal and report any branch instructions that were missed by the tests.
The TH3 tests themselves are all implemented in C and SQL, but the operation
and management of those tests is all done with TCL.

</p><h3>2.5 TCL Generated Documentation</h3>

<p>
The extensive documentation for SQLite available on the SQLite website
(<a href="https://sqlite.org/">https://sqlite.org/</a>) is all generated
by TCL.  Many of the documents, such as the API reference documentation and
the descriptions of the byte-code engine opcodes, are created by TCL scripts
that scan C source code and extract the necessary information from the code
and comments.  Thus, the API documentation is largely derived from
comments in the source code.  Keeping the official documentation (in
comments) and the source code close together helps ensure that they are
in agreement.

</p><p>
Other whitepaper documents are generated from source files that look 
mostly like
HTML but which contain additional TCL code embedded inside of
&lt;tcl&gt;...&lt;/tcl&gt; markup.  The added TCL code is used for
advanced formatting techniques, for automatically creating cross-references
and cross-links, and for constructing complex displays such as the
popular "rail-road" syntax diagrams for SQL.

</p><h3>2.6 Tcl/Tk Used During Development Of SQLite</h3>

<p>
The text editor used by the primary author of SQLite is a custom editor
with emacs-style key bindings that is built on top of the Tk Text widget.
The "e" editor, as it is called, is cross-platform, which helps in the
development of a cross-platform software library like SQLite.  The "e"
editor has been used for the entire 17-year history of SQLite.  It has
been enhanced over the years with various customizations created especially
to help manage the SQLite source code.

</p><p>
The Fossil version control system used for the SQLite source code
(and written specifically for that purpose) uses Tcl/Tk to show graphical
side-by-side diffs in a separate window.  When the "fossil diff --tk"
command is run, Fossil generates a script to show the diff graphically
and then kicks off a separate "wish" process to run that script and
display the diff in a separate window.  This graphical diff window has
a "Save" button which will cause the Tcl/Tk code needed to reproduce itself
to be written to a file.  This file can be, in turn, sent to a collaborator
for display.  Passing around graphical diffs as ordinary text files is
much simpler and easier than passing around JPEG images or text "context"
diffs.

</p><p>
No two SQLite developers work in the same office.  The team is
geographically distributed.  To help the team stay in touch, a custom
chatroom has been created using a Tcl/Tk script.  The same script works
as both client and server.  The chatroom is private and uses a proprietary
protocol, so that developers are free to discuss sensitive matters without
fear of eavesdropping.  The chatroom is implemented as just over
1000 lines of Tk code, and is thus accessible and easy to customize.
Among the customizations is the ability to send saved "fossil diff --tk"
graphical diffs to collaborators and have the diff pop automatically on
the collaborators screen.  Small features like this seem trivial
by themselves, but together than help the developers
to work much more efficiently.  These kinds of productivity-enhancing
features are unavailable to users of commercial business collaboration 
packages such as HipChat.

</p><h2>3.0 Summary</h2>

<p>
SQLite is an indispensable element of most modern computer systems, and
TCL is an indispensable tool used in the production and maintenance of
SQLite.  Thus, the computing infrastructure we enjoy today would not exist
except for TCL.

</p><p>
As deployed, SQLite contains no TCL code.
However, the design of SQLite is inspired by TCL.
And TCL is used extensively in the code generation, testing,
analysis, documentation, and development of SQLite.  Without
TCL, SQLite would not exist.

</p><p>
Every developer and every team has a finite number of "brain cycles"
available to do their job.  The fewer cycles spent messing with tools,
the more cycles are available to devote towards solving the problem.
So for maximum productivity, it is important to use tools that get
the job done with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Our 17-year experience using TCL in the SQLite project has convinced
us that TCL is just such a tool.  Tcl provides the most help per
brain cycle of any similar technology.

That's mostly because the estate of <a href="https://a16z.com/" target="_blank">Andreessen Horowitz</a>-backed Synapse doesn't have the money to hire an outside firm to perform a full reconciliation of its ledgers, according to Jelena McWilliams, the bankruptcy trustee.</p><p>But what is now clear is that regular Americans like Morris are bearing the brunt of that shortfall and will receive little or nothing from savings accounts<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that they believed were backed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/brochures/insured-deposits#:~:text=Since%20the%20FDIC%20began%20operations,penny%20of%20FDIC%2Dinsured%20deposits.&amp;amp;text=FDIC%20insurance%20covers%20depositor%20accounts,up%20to%20the%20insurance%20limit." target="_blank">full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</a></p><p>The losses demonstrate the risks of a system where customers didn't have direct relationships with banks, instead relying on startups to keep track of their funds, who offloaded that responsibility onto middlemen like Synapse.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108065781" data-test="InlineImage"><p>Zach Jacobs, 37, of Tampa, Florida helped form a group called Fight For Our Funds after losing more than $94,000 that he had in a fintech savings account called Yotta.</p><p>Courtesy: Zach Jacobs</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>'Reverse bank robbery'</h2><div><p>There are thousands of others like Morris.

<p>
       June 30, 2012</p>
   <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/qvm.php">
   </a><div id="paperbox"><p><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/qvm.php">
	   	
          </a><a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/index.php">
          <img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/quake3_icon.jpg">   
          </a> 
         

The network model of Quake3 is with no doubt the most elegant part of the engine. At the lower level Quake III still abstract communications
with the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quakeSource/quakeSourceNetWork.php">NetChannel module that first appeared in Quake World</a>.
The most important thing to understand is:</p><p>
In a fast paced environment any information that is not received on first transmission is not worth sending again because it will be too old anyway.</p><p>

As a result the engine relies essentially on UDP/IP: There is no trace of TCP/IP anywhere since the "Reliable transmission" 
aspect introduced intolerable latency. The network stack has been augmented with two mutually exclusive layers:
</p></div><ul>
    <li>Encryption using preshared key.</li>
    <li>Compression with pre-computed huffman key.</li>
</ul>
<div>

<p><img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_netstack.png"></p><p>

But where the design really shine is on the server side where an elegant system minimize the size of each UDP datagram while 
compensating for the unreliablity of UDP:
An history of snapshots generate deltas packets via memory introspection.

</p></div>



<h3>Architecture</h3>
<div id="paperbox"><p>
The Client side of the network model is fairly simple: Client sends commands to the Server each frame and receive update for the gamestate. The Server side is as bit more complex since it has to propagate the Master gamestate to each Client while accounting for lost UDP packets. This mechanism features three key elements:<br>
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_archi.png"></p></div><ul>
  <li>A <b>Master Gamestate</b> that is the universal true state of things. Clients send theirs commands on the Netchannel. They are transformed in event_t which will modifiy the state of the game when they arrive on the Server.</li>
  <li>For each Client the server keeps the <b>32 last gamestate</b> sent over the network in a cycling array: They are called snapshots. The array cycle with the famous binary mask trick I mentioned in Quake World Network (<a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/quakeSource/quakeSourceNetWork.php">Some elegant things</a>).</li>
  <li>The server also features <b>a "dummy" gamestate</b> with every single field set to zero. This is used to delta snapshots when there is no "previous state" available.</li>
 </ul>
 <div><p>
When the server decides to send an update to a client it uses each three elements in order to generate a message that is then carried over the NetChannel.</p><u><b>Trivia :</b></u><p> To keep so many gamestate for each players consumes a lot of memory: 8 MB for 4 players according to my measurements.  
</p></div>


<h3>Snapshot systems</h3>
<p id="paperbox">
In order to understand the snapshop system, here is an example with the following conditions:
</p><ul>
    <li>The server is sending update to a Client1.</li>
    <li>The server is attempting to propagate the state of Client2 which has four 4  fields (3 ints position[X], position[Y], position[Z] and one int health).</li>
    <li>Communication are done over UDP/IP: Those messages gets lost quite often on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<u>Server Frame 1:</u><p>

The Server has received a few updates from every client. They have impacted the Master gamestate (in green). It is now time to propagate the state to Client1:
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t1.png"></p><p>

In order to generate a message the network module will ALWAYS do the following :
</p></div><ol>
   <li>Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot.</li>
   <li>Compare it with an other snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is what we can see in the next drawing:
</p><ol>
   <li> Master gamestate is copied at index 0 in Client1 history: It is now called"Snapshot1".</li>
   <li> Since this is the first udpate, there are no valid snapshot in Client1 history so the engine is going to use the "Dummy snapshot" where all fields are always ZEROed. This results in a FULL update since every single field is sent to the NetChannel.</li>
 </ol>
 <div>
<p><img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t2.png"><br>
The key point to understand here is that if no valid snapshots are available in the client history the engine will pick "dummy snapshot" to
 generate a delta message. This will result in a full udpate sent to the Client using 132 bits (each field is <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/msg.c#L1200">
preceeded by a bit marker</a>): <code>[1 A_on32bits 1 B_on32bits 1 B_on32bits 1 C_on32bits]</code>.
</p><u>Server Frame 2:</u><p>

Now let's move forward in time: this is the Server second frame. As we can see each client have sent commands and they have impacted the Master gamestate: Client2 has moved on the Y axis so pos[1] is now equal to E (in blue). Client1 has also sent commands but more important it has also acknowledged receiving the previous udpate so Snapshot1 has been marked as "ACK":
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t3.png"><br>

The process is the same:</p></div><ol>
   <li>Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot: (index 1): This is Snapshot2</li>
   <li>This time we have a valid snapshot in the client history (snapshot1). Compare those two snapshots</li>
</ol>
<div><p>
As result only a partial update (   pos[1] = E ) is sent over the network. This is the beauty of the design: The process is always the same.
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t4.png"></p><u>Note :</u><p> Since each field is <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/msg.c#L1200">
preceeded by a bit marker</a> (1=changed, 0=not changed) the partial update above would uses 36 bits: <code>[0 1 32bitsNewValue 0 0]</code>. 
</p><u>Server Frame 3:</u><p>

Let's move forward one more step in order to see how the system deals with lost packets. This is now Frame 3. Clients have kept on sending commands to the server.
Client2 has lost life and health is now equal to H. But Client1 has not acknowledged the last update. Maybe the Server's UDP got lost, maybe the ACK from the Client
got lost but bottom line is that it cannot be used.

<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t5.png"></p><p>


Regardless the process remains the same:
</p></div><ol>
   <li>Copy the Master gamestate in the next Client history slot: (index 2): This is Snapshot3</li>
   <li>Compare with the last valid acknowledged snapshot (snapshot1).</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p><img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/lazy_load/grey.gif" data-original="/fd_proxy/quake3/q3_network_t6.png"></p><p>

As a result the message sent it partial and contains a combination of old changes and new changes: (pos[1]=E and health=H). Note that snapshot1 could have been too old to be used. In this case the engine would have used the "dummy snapshot" again, resulting in a full update.</p><p>

The beauty and elegance of the system resides in its simplicity. The same algorithm automatically:
</p></div><ul>
   <li>Generate partial or full update.</li>
   <li>Resend OLD information that were not received and NEW information in a single message.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Memory introspection with C</h3>
<div id="paperbox"><p>
You may wonder how Quake3 is comparing snapshots with introspection...since C does not have introspection.<br>
The answer is that each field locations for a <code>netField_t</code> is preconstructed via an array and some clever 
preprocessing directives:</p></div><pre>

    typedef struct {
        <span>char</span>    *name;
        <span>int</span>     offset;
        <span>int</span>     bits;
    } netField_t; 

    // using the stringizing operator to save typing...
    #define	NETF(x) #x,(<span>int</span>)&amp;((entityState_t*)0)-&gt;x

    netField_t	entityStateFields[] = 
    {
    { NETF(pos.trTime), <span>32</span> },
    { NETF(pos.trBase[0]), <span>0</span> },
    { NETF(pos.trBase[1]), <span>0</span> },
    ...
    }

</pre>
<div><p>
The full code of this part can be found in <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/msg.c">snapshot.c</a>'s 
<code>MSG_WriteDeltaEntity</code>. Quake3 does not even know what it is comparing: It just blindly follow <code>entityStateFields</code>'s index,offset and size...and
sends the difference over the network.

</p></div>





<h3>Pre-fragmentation</h3>
<p id="paperbox">
Digging into the code we see that the NetChannel module slices messages in chunks of 1400 bytes (<a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/qcommon/net_chan.c">
<code>Netchan_Transmit</code></a>), even though the maximum size of an UDP datagram is 65507 bytes. Doing so the engine avoid having its packets
fragmented by routers while traveling over the internet since most network MTU are 1500 bytes. Avoiding router fragmentation is very important since:<br>
</p><ul>
   <li>Upon entering the network the router must block the packet while it is fragmenting it.</li>
   <li>Upon leaving the network problems are even worse since every part of the datagram have to be waited on and then time-costly re-assembled.</li>
</ul>










<h3>Reliable and Unreliable messages</h3>
<div id="paperbox"><p>
If the snapshot system compensate for UDP datagrams lost over the network,  some messages and commands must be GUARANTEED to be delivered (when
a player quits or when the Server needs the Client to load a new level).</p><p>

	This guarantee is abstracted by the NetChannel: I wrote about it <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quakeSource/quakeSourceNetWork.php">a few years ago</a> (wow my drawings have come a long way !!).
</p></div>

<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-v2.1.1-"><strong>MaXXdesktop v2.2.0 (alpha) running in Modern Look &amp; Feel with Indigo Magic SGI Scheme (4K @120Hz)</strong></p>

<h3 id="bkmrk-introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-the-maxx-interactive">The MaXX Interactive Desktop a.k.a. MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> is the continuation of the 5Dwm project released many years back. So don't be mistaken, there is only one real&nbsp; re-implementation of the IRIX Interactive Desktop found on SGI systems, and&nbsp; it's MaXX<strong>desktop</strong>!</p>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-a-tr">MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> is a true re-implementation of the "SGI Desktop" with the added benefits of using a modern software stack of highly tuned loosely-coupled components delivering maximum performance and stability while using as little resources as possible. We believe that high performance&nbsp; computing and energy friendly are not mutually exclusive. What if you could run applications in a smarter, greener and sustainable way? MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> aims at improving just that, do more with less.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-while-respecting-the">While respecting the original retro CLASSIC SGI look and feel, which is very important for us to get it right,&nbsp; we created a newer and more modern user experience called the MODERN look that feels like a natural evolution of the original SGI look, as if SGI did it themselves throughout the years perfecting an already pretty awesome recipe. The MODERN look still supports SGI Colour Schemes but introduce Unicode and UTF-8 support, anti-aliased font rendering, more hardware acceleration and a new virtual-desktop manager. The user can switch between looks with one mouse-click, now that's cool.</p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-goals-and-features-l">Goals and Features List</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-so-there-is-no-surpr">We believe in the need of&nbsp; a highly tuned workstation environment where performance, robustness, low resources consumption are at the core of everything.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-here-are-the-goals-w">Here are the goals we want to achieve and features that makes a great modern desktop:</p>
<ul id="bkmrk-it%27s-learn%2C-very-fas"><li>Lean, very fast and robust. Basically MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> gets out of your way.</li>
<li>Smart and efficient multi-cores workload management with CPU and Core partitioning which help reduce process bouncing of&nbsp; CPU cores and computation resources allocation/partitioning translate in better throughput (<a title="MaXX Scope" href="https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/software-architecture/page/maxx-scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaXXscope</a>).</li>
<li>Built on solid and time proven foundations.</li>

<p id="bkmrk-our-design-philosoph"><em>Our design philosophy is simple, do more with less...</em></p>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-desi">The MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> is designed from the ground up for speed,&nbsp; fast/responsive, lightweight/simplicity over eye-candidness, but more importantly, to get the heck out of your way... The name <em>MaXX Interactive</em> doesn't mean maximum visual interaction, which are distractions or so what we call, UI noises. It's means maximum creativity with interactive assistance from the Desktop. In many ways, it's made for you and your brain so that it can relax, focus on let the creative juice flowing with far fewer distractions. We see desktop notifications in a very different way, but this is for another discussion. In short, the MaXX<strong>desktop</strong> let you focus on the creative&nbsp; tasks ahead without interference or visual distractions.<em><strong>&nbsp; <br></strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-experience-matter">Experience Matters</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-finally%2C-our-team-me">Our team is sharing the same vision of making use of the right set of technologies with industry proven best practices and guidelines to build the right software, the right way.&nbsp; We aim at providing a consistent and pleasant user experience built on top of modern and stable foundations.&nbsp; Every good and useful piece of tech deserves to be future-proof and this is where several decades of experience in building battle-proven mission critical systems for high performance Enterprise class applications comes in. If it's architect-ed properly,&nbsp; it can evolve without breaking apart!</p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-is-maxx-desktop-for-">Is MaXX Desktop for you?</h3>

<p dir="auto">A cross-platform lightweight single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction library for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. Written in pure C99.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2><a id="user-content-about" aria-label="Permalink: About" href="#about"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">RGFW is a free multi-platform single-header very simple-to-use window abstraction framework for creating graphics Libraries or simple graphical programs. it is meant to be used as a very small and flexible alternative library to GLFW.</p>
<p dir="auto">The window backend supports XLib (UNIX), Cocoas (MacOS), webASM (emscripten) and WinAPI (tested on windows <em>XP</em>, 10 and 11, and reactOS)<br>
Windows 95 &amp; 98 have also been tested with RGFW, although results are iffy</p>
<p dir="auto">Wayland: to compile wayland add (RGFW_WAYLAND=1). Wayland support is very experimental and broken.</p>
<p dir="auto">The graphics backend supports OpenGL (EGL, software, OSMesa, GLES), Vulkan, DirectX, <a href="https://github.com/RSGL/RGFW-Metal">Metal</a> and software rendering buffers.</p>
<p dir="auto">RGFW was designed as a backend for RSGL, but it can be used standalone or for other libraries, such as Raylib which uses it as an optional alternative backend.</p>
<p dir="auto">RGFW is multi-paradigm,<br>
By default RGFW uses a flexible event system, similar to that of SDL, however you can use callbacks if you prefer that method.</p>
<p dir="auto">This library</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>is single header and portable (written in C99 in mind)</li>
<li>is very small compared to other libraries</li>
<li>only depends on system API libraries, Winapi, X11, Cocoa</li>
<li>lets you create a window with a graphics context (OpenGL, Vulkan or DirectX) and manage the window and its events only with a few function calls</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This library does not</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Handle any rendering for you (other than creating your graphics context)</li>
<li>do anything above the bare minimum in terms of functionality</li>
</ol>
