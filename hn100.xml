          <p>One Houston resident was suspicious of the city's "all plastic accepted" recycling program, and used <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/airtags" title="AirTag" data-kpt="1">AirTags</a> to discover where the plastic waste actually ended up.
</p><p>Deason, who regularly recycles her packaging and other waste, began to have doubts about the city's plastic recycling program. Houston's program boasted of being able to accept even types of plastic that aren't normally considered recyclable.
</p><p>Curious as to where the plastic was going, she bought a set of AirTags, and included them in various bags of her plastic recycling. Of the bags she tracked, nearly all of them went to a company called Wright Waste Management, located in nearby Harris County.
</p><p>The company is not approved to store plastic waste, and has failed three fire inspections.
</p><p>CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/houston-recycling-tracking-device-plastic/">referred</a> to Deason as "the James Bond of plastic recycling" for her initiative. Aerial footage showed that the facility had large piles of plastic waste as tall as 10 feet high.
</p><p>Deason said she thought that the company simply storing the unrecyclable plastic waste was "kind of strange." She later contacted Houston's Director of Solid Waste Management Mark Wilfalk, to ask about the discrepancy.
</p><p>When shown the drone footage, Wilfalk admitted "it's not the most desirable-looking site." He promised Deason he'd investigate the problems that caused Wright Waste Management to fail the fire inspections.
</p><p>Wilfalk later acknowledged that the city had collected some 250 tons of plastic since the end of 2022. He revealed that none of it had been recycled as of yet.
</p><p>"We're gonna stockpile it for now," he admitted. "We're gonna see what happens."
</p><p>By contrast, Apple has been an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/04/16/apple-highlights-device-recycling-iphone-trade-in-and-the-removal-of-leather-for-earth-day" title="Apple's environmental efforts">industry leader</a> in reducing its use of plastic. It uses paper for packaging, and metal rather than plastic for its computer line.
</p><p>It does use some plastic for products such as its <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/airpods" title="AirPods" data-kpt="1">AirPods</a> earbuds. It has invested in robotics to help recycle old Apple products.
</p><p>Houston, as it turns out, is waiting on a promised sorting facility to open, where the stored recycling will be sorted and treated. The company behind the sorting facility, Cyclix, says it has developed a method to create recyclable pellets out of the plastic waste.
</p><p>However, only a fraction of these pellets can be made into new plastic. Most will be melted and turned into fuel that is burned, adding to carbon emissions.
</p><p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has been investigating Cyclix owner and plastic manufacturer ExxonMobil's claims regarding plastic recycling in that state. He has characterized Cyclix's claims of plastic recycling are largely fictional.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Microchip designer <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/">Nvidia</a> more than doubled its second-quarter revenue thanks to just a handful of whales that accounted for nearly one out of every two dollars in sales the company booked.</p><div>



<p>Four customers, whose identities were kept anonymous for competitive reasons, directly purchased goods and services collectively worth 46% of Nvidia’s $30 billion in turnover. That amounts to roughly $13.8 billion, according to the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001045810/78501ce3-7816-4c4d-8688-53dd140df456.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001045810/78501ce3-7816-4c4d-8688-53dd140df456.pdf" rel="noopener">10-Q regulatory filing</a>&nbsp;published alongside its&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/23/nvidia-jensen-huang-quarterly-earnings-tech-bull-market-ai/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/23/nvidia-jensen-huang-quarterly-earnings-tech-bull-market-ai/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">hotly anticipated</a>&nbsp;quarterly investor update.</p>



<p>Each was responsible for more than a tenth of overall top line, and their purchases were all related to its booming business selling chips to data centers, the likes of which entrepreneurs such as&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/29/elon-musk-tesla-ai-fsd-china-ev-sales/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/04/29/elon-musk-tesla-ai-fsd-china-ev-sales/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">Elon Musk</a>&nbsp;are in a&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/06/18/elon-musk-xai-memphis-supercomputer-site/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/06/18/elon-musk-xai-memphis-supercomputer-site/">rush to build</a>&nbsp;amid the gold rush in artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, this quartet of customers contributed more in sales than Nvidia reported for the prior year’s period as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the names of the mystery AI whales are not known, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-largest-customers-201900375.html?" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-largest-customers-201900375.html?" rel="noopener">they are likely to include</a> Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, OpenAI, or Tesla.</p>



<p>Nvidia’s hottest products are AI chips like the H200. These are needed to train large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4. They are also used to power inference, the process that ChatGPT or&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/sora-openai-sam-altman-text-to-video-generative-ai/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/sora-openai-sam-altman-text-to-video-generative-ai/">Sora</a>&nbsp;uses to generate answers to text-based prompts.</p>



<p>This dependency on a handful of major customers also highlights a rising concern in the market over just how sustainable this abrupt, exponential growth from just one corner of its business can be. Some investors like&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/ai-nvidia-intel-arm-stock-bubble-elliott/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/ai-nvidia-intel-arm-stock-bubble-elliott/">Elliott Management</a>&nbsp;and Citadel have&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/ken-griffin-citadel-generative-ai-hype-openai-mira-murati-nvidia-jobs/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/07/02/ken-griffin-citadel-generative-ai-hype-openai-mira-murati-nvidia-jobs/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">voiced skepticism</a>&nbsp;over how long this can be maintained.</p>



<p>History does give reason for concern. The semiconductor industry is known for its boom-and-bust cycles.</p>



<p>Shares in Nvidia are expected to open lower on Thursday, underperforming the broader equity market.</p>



<h2>One customer provided revenue greater than Nvidia’s second-largest business</h2>



<p>In fact Nvidia’s business ties with these whales are so significant the company flags them in a section of its quarterly reports titled “concentration of revenue,” which is dedicated to cluster risks.</p>



<p>“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,” it stated in its 10-Q regulatory filing, “and this trend may continue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a trend that is staggeringly profitable. Nvidia pocketed $5.60 out of every $10 of revenue it made over the entire first half as net income—margins most companies can only dream of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That explains why profit after tax nearly quadrupled to $31.5 billion during this six-month period over the previous year. Whether revenue, and therefore earnings, can continue to grow at this blistering pace is crucial to its investment story.</p>



<p>Take “Customer B” cited in the filing, for example: Its direct purchases represented 11% of Nvidia’s $30 billion in revenue. That means a single company contributed more in business than the group’s second largest division—gaming, with $2.9 billion—did as a whole.</p>



<p>Customer B, however, remained below the 10% threshold for the entire first half, which suggests it significantly ramped up spending during the past quarter seemingly out of the blue. The exact same could be said about “Customer C”; the numbers provided by Nvidia are identical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking to Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang answered a question on where demand is coming from, beyond the handful of hyperscalers like <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a>.</p>



<p>“We’re relatively diversified today,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC5NZPrxbHk&amp;t=99s" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC5NZPrxbHk&amp;t=99s" rel="noopener">claimed</a>, citing a range of different customer groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet his own company’s numbers appear to dispute that conclusion. This time last year, for example, there were no direct customers whose business made up 10% or more of total revenue—neither for the first nor the second quarter.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>I<span>n rare moments</span></span> within the history of capitalism, too few workers exist. Not as an absolute, of course: in total, workers always outnumber paid possibilities for work; that’s how our economy functions. But in a specific industry, a shortage may emerge, if only for a brief time. In 1998, on my first day of work as an analyst with the accounting and consulting firm Arthur Andersen LLP, it was clear that some aberration in accumulation had placed me in the twenty-fourth-floor conference room of a Manhattan skyscraper, overlooking the Museum of Modern Art’s sculpture garden, staring at a PowerPoint presentation for new hires. On one slide was a cartoon duck, bespectacled and presented in profile, standing on the tiptoes of its webbed feet. In its hands was a sledgehammer, held overhead, ready to smash a desktop computer.</p><p>I would learn soon enough that this—my first professional and only corporate work experience—was a fake job. It was fake because although I worked with Arthur Andersen, I never worked <span><i>for</i></span> them. (Their shade of blue-chip firm would never have hired the likes of me: they recruited from places like Harvard; I’d recently graduated from Hampshire College. They required new hires to have impeccable GPAs; my school didn’t confer grades.) Instead, I was employed by a global advertising conglomerate that had hired Andersen on a consultancy project and then placed me alongside the Andersen team—the result of a confluence of staffing shortages.</p><p>It was, moreover, a fake job because Andersen was faking it. The firm spent the late 1990s certifying fraudulent financial statements from Enron, the Texas-based energy company that made <span><i>financial</i></span> <span><i>derivatives</i></span> a household phrase, until that company went bankrupt in a cloud of scandal and suicide and Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice, surrendered its accounting licenses, and shuttered. But that was later.</p><p>Finally, it was a fake job because the problem that the Conglomerate had hired Andersen to solve was not real, at least not in the sense that it needed to be solved or that Andersen could solve it. The problem was known variously as Y2K, or the Year 2000, or the Y2K Bug, and it prophesied that on January 1, 2000, computers the world over would be unable to process the thousandth-digit change from 19 to 20 as 1999 rolled into 2000 and would crash, taking with them whatever technology they were operating, from email to television to air-traffic control to, really, the entire technological infrastructure of global modernity. Hospitals might have emergency power generators to stave off the worst effects (unless the generators, too, succumbed to the Y2K Bug), but not advertising firms.</p><p>With a world-ending scenario on the horizon, employment standards were being relaxed. The end of the millennium had produced a tight labor market in knowledge workers, and new kinds of companies, called dot-coms, were angling to dominate the emergent world of e-commerce. Flush with cash, these companies were hoovering up any possessors of knowledge they could find. Friends from my gradeless college whose only experience in business had been parking-lot drug deals were talking stock options.</p><p>The employment agency through which I got my fake job made no epistemological distinction between knowing something and knowing about something. JavaScript, for example, a computer programming language: I knew about it but did not know it. Fine. Was I aware that the modern world might go on a catastrophic hiatus of unknown duration at the end of 1999? I had heard of something to that effect, although if pressed I couldn’t have explained. The Conglomerate was not much more stringent. My interview consisted of about twelve minutes with a laconic, mustachioed, middle-aged Arthur Andersen manager named Dick. (One of the services Andersen had been asked to provide was to help hire the Conglomerate’s Y2K team.) “On a scale of one to ten, what’s your knowledge of computer software?” he began. I paused for a moment, unsure of whether our interview would include a demonstrative component, as had so many previous interviews for jobs I had not gotten. But his office was empty. I couldn’t see how he would test me. I said <span><i>eight</i></span>.</p><blockquote><p><b>At a certain point all that had happened yesterday was our documenting, so then we documented that.</b></p><b> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=At+a+certain+point+all+that+had+happened+yesterday+was+our+documenting%2C+so+then+we+documented+that.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=At+a+certain+point+all+that+had+happened+yesterday+was+our+documenting%2C+so+then+we+documented+that.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624">Tweet</a></b></blockquote><p>“And what’s your knowledge of computer hardware, on a scale of one to ten?” Dick continued. The moment called for both boldness and modesty. I felt committed to eight, a number I had long appreciated for its intimations of infinity when turned sideways. So I repeated myself: “Eight.” It was true that one of my campus work-study jobs had been as a computer lab monitor. I could restart a PC or refill a printer’s paper tray if the situation demanded it, although it rarely did. I’d had the weekend evening shifts.</p><p>Dick’s next question would determine the development of my nascent career. “And what’s your level of problem-solving, on a scale of one to ten?” I sensed, suddenly, an opportunity to pass through a corporate loophole, to surmount my lack of credentials, training, and touch-typing skills and lean into my historical moment. “Nine,” I replied.</p><p>“That was it?” my girlfriend chirped when I reported to her the climax of my interview. The Conglomerate had hired me on the spot.</p><hr><p><span>I </span><span><span>was placed</span> on</span><span> the quality assurance team, assisting with work the Conglomerate had contracted to be carried out exclusively by the Arthur Andersen contingent. They weren’t called “a contingent” around the Y2K office. The consultants were referred to as the Andersen people, a term that exaggerated the partition between them and other Conglomerate employees, from whom they commanded both bewilderment and respect and, as often follows from the first two, a certain amount of resentment. These contradictory feelings stemmed from the fact that management consultants constituted then—and still do now—the vanguard of corporate work. They flit between companies and industries, parachuting in to diagnose problems and suggest, although rarely implement, “best-practice” solutions. It’s management consulting lingo, </span><span><i>best-practice</i></span><span>, and it indicates that the good is not enough: this isn’t Winnicott’s consulting room. Instead, management consultants aim for superlatives. They hire the best. They practice the best. They claim Pete Buttigieg among their alumni ranks. At the Conglomerate they had their own offices, their own meetings, their own schedules. They worked from the Conglomerate’s office space while they were on its project, but when they “rolled off” (they had their own terminology, too) they would take up residence within the ambit of another Andersen client. </span></p><p>“You’ve been selected because you’re Andersen quality but not Andersen price,” explained Cindy, the chipper data-warehousing expert who served as the quality assurance team’s Andersen-employed leader, on my second day of work. I felt like a piece of organic fruit found in the conventional produce bin. Cindy also told me that, as with wolves, pack solidarity was intense within Andersen groupings. So was a wariness toward intruders.</p><p>In the first meeting with my lupine team, I did stand out, though not for lack of credentials. In fact I was the only person not massaging a fistful of Play-Doh. The Conglomerate’s office was beige, the carpet beige, the people beige, too. But from each of the four quality assurance team members’ hands exploded a most brilliant collection of colors: neon greens and yellows, hot pink, siren red, an almost psychedelic scene. Team members twirled and juggled their own handfuls, separated their globs and recombined them. “It’s a new management technique,” Cindy said, before I could ask. “It helps relieve stress.”</p><blockquote><p><b>Most team members had their own Y2K doomsday clock on their desk, tracking the years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds until techno-rapture.</b></p><b> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=Most+team+members+had+their+own+Y2K+doomsday+clock+on+their+desk%2C+tracking+the+years%2C+months%2C+days%2C+hours%2C+minutes%2C+seconds%2C+and+milliseconds+until+techno-rapture.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Most+team+members+had+their+own+Y2K+doomsday+clock+on+their+desk%2C+tracking+the+years%2C+months%2C+days%2C+hours%2C+minutes%2C+seconds%2C+and+milliseconds+until+techno-rapture.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624">Tweet</a></b></blockquote><p><span>Cindy herself did not seem stressed, but the situation she laid out for our team was certainly overwhelming. The Conglomerate held more than a thousand advertising, public relations, and communication companies worldwide, with possessions in both emerging markets and well-established ones. These cumulatively raked in billions of dollars per year. But any or all of these “shops,” in industry lexicon, might collapse as one millennium ended and another began, preventing the Conglomerate from executing its global advertising operations and compromising its earnings and thus its stock price. Perhaps a radio station in Finland would go haywire and be unable to run a Conglomerate-booked spot; conceivably, a television station in Western Australia could disappear and, along with it, a Conglomerate-produced commercial; maybe a billboard would tumble off a highway in Rio de Janeiro amid social chaos, destroying a Conglomerate-created visual. If such events were to transpire, revenue loss would be a best-case scenario; one could imagine far worse. There had been a slide in the new-hire presentation, the one with the duck, that spelled out the possibilities: a stick figure with a thought bubble hovering above its perfectly circular head wondered: “On Jan. 1, 2000 will I still have: electricity, food, telephone, transportation</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>. ?” Each life-sustaining noun was contained in its own thought bubble, and the final thought bubble offered only a series of anxiety-producing question marks (“?????”). </span></p><p><span>That same tremulous atmosphere permeated the office, where a thumbtacked photocopy of a </span><span><i>Computerworld</i></span><span> article entitled “Economist Predicts Y2K-Based Recession” greeted team members on their daily arrival at the elevator bay. In the windowless kitchenette, several copies of the book </span><span><i>Time Bomb 2000</i></span><span> were available for employees to peruse while they warmed their instant coffee or selected a Pepsi product—Pepsi being a client—from the mini fridge. Most team members had their own Y2K doomsday clock on their desk, tracking the years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds until techno-rapture. </span></p><p>The first segment of the Conglomerate’s Y2K project, “Phase I: Inventory,” involved retrieving technological inventories from the Conglomerate’s various agencies and recording them in a database. The lesser, non-Andersen network analysts entered data about the number of PCs, routers, fax machines, and printers any given Conglomerate shop had in its possession, copying the material from a spreadsheet said shop had emailed them. The superior Andersen quality assurance analysts (and I) provided the oversight, identifying the mistakes our colleagues had made. Someone had hit the <span><i>0</i></span> instead of its keyboard neighbor, the <span><i>9</i></span>; another team member, her mind wandering perhaps, had neglected to check the “entry completed” box. Little errors, but the general sense was that history would not judge them kindly. My team set out to rectify them before it had the chance.</p><p>The verb under whose sign the quality assurance team labored was a new one for me: to <span><i>QA</i></span>, past tense <span><i>QAed</i></span>. All mistakes our QAing located were recorded by hand; all handwritten records of our QAing were photocopied; the copies were kept in Cindy’s office while the originals were bound for a secure document warehouse in New Jersey. Necessarily, our records would be kept on paper. If the predicted Doomsday 2000 did arrive, the digital world would be inaccessible, maybe gone forever. Computer technology had gotten us into this millennial quagmire and could not be trusted to extricate us from it. Perhaps that’s why my problem-solving abilities had mattered more than my knowledge of computer software and hardware on Dick’s scale of one to ten. The fact that the scale itself remained undefined, and that neither interviewer nor interviewee agreed to its coordinates, suggested both the fake nature of the whole endeavor as well as the desperation the Conglomerate felt, its keen awareness that it was running out of time.</p><hr><p><span>T<span>he Andersen position</span></span> was that “Y2K is a documentation problem, not a technology problem.” One could not know the magnitude of the technical problems we would face on January 1, 2000, with complete certainty until that revelatory day arrived, and so 1/1/2000 functioned as a kind of horizon of contingency: would we all be launched, <span><i>Back to the Future</i></span>–like, into a new stone age, or would a few rest-area vending machines conk out and everyone get on with it? To contend with this range of possible futures, we focused on the past. Instead of fixing things with the hope that they would function later, we would document the anti-Y2K efforts the Conglomerate had already undertaken, necessarily more knowable than those events not yet in existence. We would not, for legal reasons, promise things to come; we would certify that things that had already transpired had been appropriately recorded. To the alarming claim of the Y2K town criers—modern life after 12/31/1999 cannot be guaranteed—the quality assurance team responded retrospectively: whatever happened yesterday would be consigned to a database. At a certain point all that had happened yesterday was our documenting, so then we documented that. Then, exponentially, we had to document ourselves documenting our own documentation.</p><blockquote><p><b>Months of reading and populating spreadsheets turned me spreadsheet-like myself.</b></p><b> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=Months+of+reading+and+populating+spreadsheets+turned+me+spreadsheet-like+myself.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Months+of+reading+and+populating+spreadsheets+turned+me+spreadsheet-like+myself.+%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624">Tweet</a></b></blockquote><p>These efforts—designed to avoid the liabilities of selling a project that offered a Y2K fix, because what if Y2K wasn’t “fixable”?—were part of a floating corporate-compliance rubric referred to only as the Process. Proprietary, capitalized, and always prefaced with that exclusive definite article, the Process could only be implemented by Arthur Andersen LLP. When a business engaged Andersen in a consultancy project, they purchased the Process. The Process seemed to have no printed home. To the extent that it existed, it passed between the minds and speech of Cindy and Dick. It was both accessible enough to be constantly appealed to—“the Process says,” “How would we apply the Process here?” “I’m not sure this syncs with the Process”—and inaccessible enough never to be grasped with Play-Doh–like tangibility. In keeping with the Process, the quality assurance team scoured hundreds of thousands, millions even, of Excel spreadsheet lines. My day began and ended with comparing database entry to inventory spreadsheet and writing in my own script <span><i>Column 4, row 14: “18 routers” should be corrected to read “8 routers.” Column 9, row 10, empty. Indicate yes or no.</i></span> This was dissociative, diminutive work, and time passed vertiginously, minutes and seconds overlapping on my teammates’ unsynchronized doomsday clocks until the day concluded with a final collective effort at preservation. All quality assurance analysts—not Cindy, for hierarchical reasons—would convene in the photocopy room to ensure that, come what may on December 31, 1999, the deliverables from our day’s labor would be archived, in print, in perpetuity. The only times we really spoke to each other in an uncurated fashion were over the blinding flashes and tray clicks of the Minolta copy machine. There we would discuss our commuting woes, roommate dramas, awkward dates, student loan repayment plans, as well as a rather unarticulated feeling of: What?</p><hr><p><span>W<span>ho managed</span> the management consultants?</span> Cindy, shepherd of the Process, conducted random checks of all QAed spreadsheets and kept the results in her own spreadsheet. Dick and an elusive cabal of Andersen upper-tier management QAed Cindy. Once a rotund Andersen partner named Benjamin, outfitted in a yarmulke, a three-piece suit, and those unfortunate slipper-like Merrell suede shoes just making their way into the world in the late 1990s, spent an hour in the office, presumably to QA Dick.</p><p>The Conglomerate’s Y2K managing director, Justin, had constructed a makeshift smoking lounge in the utility closet across the hall from my cubicle. It was there that Justin and Dick would liaise and swap status updates, and Justin often hosted other visitors in his windowless, walk-in humidor. Invariably these were older, suited white men, a world of Dicks. I’d try to eavesdrop, to pry bits of information from the clouds of secondhand smoke that escaped under the door and hovered momentarily about my cubicle before being absorbed into the carpet. A few gems did waft out. I learned, for example, that I wasn’t the only team member to whom Cindy had described Arthur Andersen LLP as a pack of wolves: slender, agile, fangs bared, lips curled, marking their territory with urine (complimentary). When Justin heard this interspecies analogy, he balked. “More like bloodsucking leeches. They overcharge. Bullshit their billable hours. They want my employees to fuck up so I’ll fire them and they can bring in more Andersen people.<span> </span>.<span> </span>.<span> </span>. Of course they’re part of our team.”</p><p>But what, really, was there to hear? That the Process was vertically integrated apocrypha? That Dick had knowledge of his firm’s various fraudulent endeavors at Enron and was up to something similar here? In fact, Dick and Cindy could not have been more devoted, insistent as they were on evangelizing the Process to the Conglomerate’s office. “Y2K is a documentation problem, not a technology problem,” Cindy repeated at our weekly analyst meetings, and she invited us to say it with her.</p><p>Several months into my employment, in November 1998, a group of Andersen and Conglomerate elite visited our Y2K office to see what the $4 million Andersen project had produced in terms of Y2K preparedness. CEOs, COOs, CFOs, CTOs, an alphabet of executives, all men and some with aides-de-camp, filed through our office into a closed meeting. After their departure, Justin invited all team members into the conference room, where a Roman banquet of muffins and fruit pyramids, a well-appointed coffee cart, and the usual assortment of Pepsi products greeted us. None of these provisions had been touched, and team members were invited to pick through the refuse. “We just had over one hundred million dollars’ worth of executives in here,” Justin began. “They wanted updates.”</p><p>We were encouraged to review for ourselves a paper copy of the executive council presentation, many of which lay scattered about the oblong conference table. I was perplexed to see that it was essentially a rehash of the new-hire presentation. The cartoon duck holding the sledgehammer. The stick figure wondering, “On Jan. 1, 2000 will I still have<span> </span>.<span> </span>.<span> </span>. ?” The floating text box, conceptual art–like in display, “Y2K is a documentation” et cetera. But the mood in the conference room was ebullient and self-assured. Even the always starched and monogrammed Dick looked pleased. The man seldom spoke outside of closed-door klatches, but as a measure of the morning’s importance, he was invited by Justin to address the team. He rose and delivered a brief, litigious soliloquy:</p><p>“When January first of the year 2000 hits and a floodgate of Y2K lawsuits descends, and [we’re] being sued by everyone, and the firms who aren’t suing us, we’re suing, the indemnification issues, the claims of fiduciary responsibility and accusations of abandonment thereof. What are we going to need? Proof. They’re going to want to know what we did and how we did it. So that’s what this Council is concerned with, proof, paper, documentation. And that’s why our battle plan is simple: keep documenting, team.”</p><hr><p><span>M<span>onths of reading</span></span> and populating spreadsheets turned me spreadsheet-like myself: capacious but conceptless, able to record, to list, and to organize and sort, but according to an unthought, unthinkable orientation. After six weeks or so, and without much consideration, I began producing my own documentation, a kind of casual corporate ethnography. I noted the distribution of titles and nicknames at the Conglomerate. All the managers were men; all the analysts were women. Cindy was referred to as “the den mother.” Dick had an alliterative title that recognized his central place: “Dick, the documentation expert.” Justin, our commander, was hailed as “the general.” I, along with another young woman and quality assurance analyst, an engineer by training who shared my hair color, were given the clunky moniker “the blond QA twins.”</p><p>My favorite team member was a Viennese network analyst named Magdalena, who went by the German diminutive Leni. Tall and thin, accented and bespectacled, she hailed from fallen Austrian nobility. Her family had lost seven-eighths of their estate in World War I, but they nonetheless remained comfortable enough not to have to concern themselves with bourgeois trifles like work or mortgages. Had her father been a Nazi? Indeed, he had. Imagine a Captain von Trapp–like personality who had never softened under the melodious ensorcellment of a Fraulein Maria. Leni had fled her father’s eastern Reich not by yodeling her way over the Alps but through an American husband who got her a green card, then a transnational law firm that got her experience, and then, finally, an analyst position at the Conglomerate. When she interviewed with Dick, she had been asked to rate her foreign language abilities on his mysterious scale. Fluent in German, English, and French, proficient in Spanish, she had given herself a ten.</p><p>Each Wednesday we gathered for a general meeting with all team members: the database programmers, who never spoke; the disheveled but crucial IT coterie; all the Andersen people; Conglomerate managers; Dick. Sometimes the receptionist even set the phone to an automated answer function and popped by. By January 1999, after five months on the job, I’d come to find some comfort in the routine coordinates of the general meeting. At 2 <span>PM</span>, everyone except Justin would be seated in the conference room, Pepsi product in one hand, Cindy-authored agenda in the other, waiting for the meeting’s commencement, at which point Justin would announce through the all-office intercom that the meeting would begin five minutes late. Those minutes would pass and he would trudge in, a cloud of smoke all but trailing him.</p><p>General meetings involved an anonymous all-team exercise called “What’s Good? What Needs Improving?” Team members were instructed to rip a piece off some desolate corner of their 8 x 11 agenda and compose two reflections on these stated questions. The compositions were then passed to the table’s head for Justin to read.</p><p>Justin read aloud one Wednesday from the shrinking pile of anonymous comments. “What’s good: getting a lot done. Needs improving: kitchen out of Sweet’n Low.” And then: “What’s good: enjoyed my office Secret Santa gift. Needs improving: I don’t understand what the media team does and I will not accept ‘ask a member of the media team’ for an answer.” As he read, Justin’s countenance shifted from curiosity to uncertain disdain. He became aware—as did all team members—that his managerial style, his habit of punting, was being subtly mocked. Not only that: his antagonist was sitting among us. With a sly smile, somewhere between intrigued and embarrassed, he asked: “Who wrote this?” This query caused a swift reaction in Cindy, who responded, “This is an anonymous exercise.” Justin interrupted with <span><i>Thank you, Cindy</i></span>, who, so chastened, let Justin continue: “I asked—who wrote this?”</p><p>Dead silence of the urban kind only a skyscraper can provide, where a soft machinic din emits from the building itself. Team members, careful to avoid potentially implicating eye contact with each other, fixed their downcast stares on their Pepsi beverages. “You don’t want to tell me?” said Justin. “Fine. We’ll sit here all goddamn day. We’ll sit here till Y2K. Because I’m going to find out who wrote this fucking note.”</p><p><span>Sitting to the right of Cindy, an Andersen analyst named Tracy reached over, took the offending paper scrap, and meekly announced to the nervous audience, “It’s a girl’s handwriting.” I couldn’t have felt more relieved. My script is scraggly and angular, the furthest thing from that of a girl. Tracy too must have felt some relief, having just exculpated herself. And Cindy—who would suspect her? As team members began scanning the conference table, privately searching for someone whose handwriting was bubbly and who menstruated, the silence broke.</span></p><p>“I did it—I wrote the note.” Leni! Daughter of a Nazi. “It’s just that you never answer questions and I thought—well, I thought: You’re the boss, you will know.”</p><p>Justin ended the meeting by ordering her to stay alone with him in the conference room. Later I asked what Justin had said to her in private. “That I’m ‘on his shit list,’” she told me. And what did she say? “Fine.”</p><hr><p><span>I<span>n February,</span></span> with ten months left until the possible techno-finale of modernity, the Conglomerate decided to expand its Y2K preparedness operations and bring more Andersen people into the office. The new consultants also seemed to be wondering what the media team did. Located in an office directly behind my cubicle, they appeared to occupy themselves in the same way we did: printing spreadsheets, photocopying them, faxing them, and placing them in binders. Where the media team distinguished itself was in its leadership: it was the one team in the Conglomerate’s Y2K shop run by a manager of color. Perhaps the only bit of knowledge I had of this manager was that he had somehow managed to board a plane to Brazil without having secured the necessary entrance visa. When he arrived in São Paulo he was detained, denied passage, and put on a flight back to NYC. He’d blamed the corporate travel agent, the gay and moody Carlos, and demanded his firing.</p><p>Instead, the Andersen axe fell on him. In a presentation to the Conglomerate higher-ups, Dick and a group of Andersen top brass declared that the media team was floundering. Their recommendation: the Conglomerate should fire its one Black Y2K manager, clear out any of his remaining loyalists on what came to be known as the old media team, bring yet more Andersen consultants into the office, and let them staff a new media team. Heather, the Andersen person who had conceived this coup de grâce, naturally took the reins. Her first move was into the old media team’s office; her second charge was to populate her team. She needed someone familiar with the Process, someone of Andersen quality but not Andersen price. “You’d actually be helping with critical management considerations,” Cindy said, after she’d invited me, for the first time since my hiring, into her office. “Think of it as a promotion.”</p><p><span>I didn’t know what the media team did, and Leni had been placed on a private shit list for even asking. And the quality assurance team was almost finished with our QA of the inventory database—we had located around 6,700 typos, many of which had been remediated and all of which had been documented as the result of our efforts. After such a collective accomplishment, it felt like an odd time to jump ship. In talking to Cindy, however, I realized that just as the offer to join the media team was to be </span><span><i>thought of</i></span><span> as a promotion, it was also to be </span><span><i>thought of</i></span><span> as a choice. </span></p><p>Changing teams meant learning the ways of a new Cindy, namely a Heather, whose ward I became and whose office I now shared. In contrast to Cindy’s genuine enthusiasm for everything about management consulting, from the Play-Doh to the Process, Heather had a hardened corporate cynicism about her. She daily took calls from her interior decorator, Yves, who always seemed to be fifteen blocks away selecting upholstery and end-table pairings at Upper East Side boutiques. In those days before smartphone image-sharing, Yves would engage in elaborate ekphrastic descriptions of this piece or that. Heather put these conversations on speakerphone so she could continue typing with both hands, her manicured nails dancing above the keyboard with such intensity that often she had to ask Yves to repeat himself.</p><blockquote><p><b>It was one of those out-of-body, disassociated experiences, so often provoked by trauma but here provoked by management consulting.</b></p><b> <a onclick="return popitup('https://twitter.com/share?text=It+was+one+of+those+out-of-body%2C+disassociated+experiences%2C+so+often+provoked+by+trauma+but+here+provoked+by+management+consulting.++%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624')" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=It+was+one+of+those+out-of-body%2C+disassociated+experiences%2C+so+often+provoked+by+trauma+but+here+provoked+by+management+consulting.++%7C+n%2B1+%7C&amp;lang=en&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nplusonemag.com%2F%3Fp%3D54624">Tweet</a></b></blockquote><p><span>She overheard me, too, of course. Leni had learned that our Y2K office had a toll-free number that, in the case of an advertising-oriented Y2K emergency, Conglomerate employees could call to solicit expert advice: 1-800-Y2K-SAVE. But it was March—hardly time for the world’s advertisers to panic about a Time Bomb 2000 detonation—and the line was usually quiet. In the meantime, team members in the know had begun giving out the office 800 number. Friends anywhere in the world could chat with any team member toll free. For me, free long-distance telephony was an enjoyable extracurricular perk, a way to talk to my girlfriend in Massachusetts, ideally when Heather wasn’t around to listen. </span></p><p>The objective of the media team was to inquire into the state of Y2K preparedness for the radio stations, television stations, and newspapers that were the Conglomerate’s most important global media vending partners. We would do this by mailing them a Y2K questionnaire. Within a few weeks of our dour partnership, Heather had condensed our team’s trajectory into a single PowerPoint slide featuring so many capitalized common nouns that, looking back over my notes from the time today, I get the anachronistic sense of reading late-18th-century English.</p><blockquote><p>New Media Team:</p><ul><li>Media is Y2K mission critical</li><li>Is designing Y2K Questionnaire</li><li>Will be contacting Media Vendors</li><li>Will suggest Y2K Contingency Guidelines</li></ul></blockquote><p>The first bullet point was a bit of a non sequitur, more atmospheric than definitional, and I’m surprised it won Dick’s approval. The second? An outright fabrication—Heather downloaded our team’s generic questionnaire from a fly-by-night website called Y2K.com. The third bullet point, at least, was not entirely fake. The new media team had inherited from the old media team a bulging, imposing binder full of vendors’ mailing addresses. A data dump would transfer those addresses from the binder to a database, and those addresses would be used to send the questionnaire—but first, a QA of the media vendor database was required. Someone needed to identify the bugs and infelicities, the doubles and deletions, that even the cleanest data always seems to include. That someone would be me.</p><p>It fell to Leni to reveal what I should have already known: that mine had been a fake promotion. Perhaps I had been moved laterally, or perhaps even that was too optimistic of an assessment. Some clues were obvious: I hadn’t received a raise, for example. Others, more subtle. <span><i>Quality assurance analyst</i></span> has a certain corporate gravitas to it, but what would <span><i>media vendor analyst</i></span> mean on my resume if I wanted to leverage my Conglomerate time into a future Fortune 500 life or defect to Deloitte? She observed my simmering angst and provided a German term: <span><i>Weltschmerz</i></span>, or world-weariness. Leni said I was suffering from it. She advised me to open an E*TRADE account and to orient my portfolio toward biotech. She had staked out a position in Amgen and had, within some months, doubled her money.</p><hr><p><span>I<span>t’s a tricky</span> risk proposition</span> to mail unsolicited and legally implicating requests to corporate partners all over the world, but the Process demanded it. What, the questionnaire asked, were they doing to prepare for Y2K? For example, were they contacting third-party suppliers to inquire about their Y2K readiness? We knew very well that those five thousand media vendors wouldn’t respond to our questionnaire, because the Conglomerate itself didn’t respond to the thousands of questionnaires it received from its own business partners asking basically the same question. Heather explained that the Process wouldn’t allow a response, due to the legal vulnerability created by the disclosure of such information to another company.</p><p>By summer, perhaps our final one, the Andersen people decided that in addition to documentation, personal contact with the Conglomerate agencies was needed to stress the importance of Y2K. Many team members began trotting the globe to conduct Y2K site visits, and the office took on a transient, desolate quality. The speckled dropped ceiling seemed to sag under the weight of the HVAC infrastructure. The Diet Pepsi began to leave a sour aftertaste. Leni decamped to Asia for two weeks to support a series of Y2K regional meetings. Cindy headed for Vancouver to instruct the Conglomerate’s Pacific Rim shops in the ways of the Process. Even Justin left his smoking lounge to take a pre-millennial working tour of Paris, Brussels, and London.</p><p>“This is your chance, LC,” Cindy informed me at the commencement of my own Y2K grand tour. My ambitious itinerary included cities I had long fantasized about visiting: Tokyo, Hong Kong, urban constellations along the eastern coast of Australia. There would be time for surreptitious tourism, too: the café in Buenos Aires where Marcel Duchamp played chess, the Zócalo and its murals in Mexico City. None of this is what Cindy meant, however. She told me of one team member who “earned so many frequent flier miles, he took his whole family to Sydney business class. They got a club-level suite at the harbor Hyatt.” Other team members had redeemed miles for Hawaii junkets, or converted them into points for cruise bookings, vouchers for rental-car upgrades, discounts on duty-free alcohol and tobacco purchases. Around me, I realized, had whirred an opaque economy whose currency was only now becoming apparent. Suddenly, the number of mission-critical Y2K situations throughout the Asia-Pacific region made sense: first-class tickets generate triple frequent flier miles. So did team members’ preoccupation with South Africa, a fourteen-hour flight from NYC, and not just Johannesburg: Durban and Cape Town, too, had become improbable locations of Y2K concern. Meanwhile, Canada, our proximal neighbor and English-speaking sibling, home to multiple Conglomerate shops but no long-haul flights, was judged to be fairly Y2K-prepared.</p><p>I became as greedy a reward accumulator as the next team member. But during many of my international media site visits, I felt the reliable tug of impostor syndrome. On a trip to Tokyo, in place of the usual audience of one or two media-vendor colleagues in a dingy conference room, two analysts and I were led into the agency’s unexpected auditorium to find that a sea of suited businessmen awaited us. Perhaps they had taken our intra-Conglomerate communications seriously: we had after all sent word that the world—or at least the advertising industry—might be ending in short order.</p><p>I had always taken some comfort in knowing I was speaking to people whose fluency in English could not be guaranteed. That distance in communication, real or perceived, had been crucial for me as I asked my series of absurd questions. If global technology ceased 1/1/2000, how would your agency continue its operations? The Tokyo shop, however, had arranged for a translator. In an English accent, she asked me to enunciate slowly so she could select her words with the kind of care a world-ending situation demanded.</p><p>“On January 1, 2000, will you still have<span> </span>.<span> </span>.<span> </span>.” I began. Concerns were shared about the Tokyo media market: “No Japanese media vendors responded to our Y2K preparedness questionnaire.” It was one of those out-of-body, disassociated experiences, so often provoked by trauma but here provoked by management consulting. As Leigh Claire the media-vendor analyst held forth, paused for translation, and then continued, a second, depersonalized Leigh Claire wandered off the stage, collected herself, and took notes. I was disturbed at my own ability to make millenarian pronouncements. Exponentially, like a QAer documenting her own documentation, I began to doubt my own self-doubt.</p><p>Many of my Japanese colleagues’ responses to my presentation concerned my appearance. My Conglomerate confrères noted how unusual it was to have a young woman with blond hair in their presence, the translator, a brunette woman herself, seemed somewhat embarrassed to convey. “It’s exciting for them,” she editorialized, “you know, the difference.” My blond hair color, the highlights—were these a naturally occurring phenomenon, they wondered. One male media hand after another went up: How old was I and what was my marital status? How long would I be in Tokyo and what were my plans? What were my recreational interests?</p><p>This attention to my person was not without benefit: it did distract from Y2K. If someone had asked about servers, routers, why the response rates to our questionnaire mailing in Japan were so low, what advice I had for Y2K compliance, I would have likely taken recourse to my own contingency plan, one developed just then—I would have spoken about the contingency of knowledge itself. Perhaps I had become a convert to the Process: the future could not be known until its moment arrived, and at that point it was no longer the future.</p><hr><p><span>L<span>ate in that anxious</span> August</span> of 1999, a freak midnight flood struck New York City. Small puddles dotted the paving stones of Brooklyn’s sidewalks and the asphalt had that technicolor, water-mixed-with-gasoline slickness about it. The trains were delayed enough that I didn’t leave for Midtown until 10:30. I emerged from the damp morning into a transformed corporate world.</p><p>Cindy was perched with hawklike intensity inside a kind of bivouac she’d created between the office door and the elevator. She had a clipboard in one hand and a pen in the other. I had barely crossed the threshold when she broadcast clear across the stand of cubicles: “LC made it!” A different voice rang back: “Check.” Cindy had meant to affect a tone of relief at my arrival, but her excitement won out. The woman had spent more than a year preparing the office for a crisis, and now we had one: a flash flood. She herself had walked to work, she said. From the Upper West Side! She said this as though reporting on an alpine trek. A swift and unexpected nocturnal rain had swept through the city, Cindy related. “Some team members won’t make it,” she said, and, without any sense of her own drama, let a pause take hold before finishing her sentence: “into the office today.”</p><p>At Wednesday’s general meeting, Justin gave Cindy all kinds of commendations for her swift crisis management. The phone tree she had set up practically out of the ether. A collection of alternate transportation routes she’d compiled that team members could consult to solicit guidance on getting into the office in the event of a natural or—dare one say it—technological disaster. A buddy system she organized in which team members could locate a partner, alphabetically or by neighborhood. Already she had initiated the process of assembling the materials into a binder. Dick, her mentor and her boss, gave off a silent but approving glow. Cindy had saved the office, but the flood had exposed a striking irony: the Y2K office, so busy advising others on contingency plans, hadn’t developed its own.</p><p><span>“We all knew to expect the unexpected,” said Justin. It seemed like he might verge into contemplation and consider the idea of contingency in and of itself: can one really plan for something truly unknown? Instead, he took a more imperative course. “It’s balls to the wall from here on out. We’ve got four months.” His charge occasioned a flurry of activity, as team members sought to seize the day while it still existed to be seized. We had lived through a flash flood, and things had gone berserk in a dozen different ways. What would an actual millennial meltdown occasion?</span></p><hr><p><span>B</span><span><span>y December 1999,</span> </span>the feeling at the Conglomerate’s Y2K office was that nothing more could really be done. This is a common enough cliché on the approach of any moment of finality, but was particularly apt in our case, since nothing really <span><i>had</i></span> been done. The travel diminished, and colleagues I’d last seen lounging under a shaded terrace in Milan were again denizens whom I passed in the office kitchenette, Pepsi product in hand. To mark the progress of the calendar and to demarcate our work, team members did what we did best: preside over the expenditure of large sums of corporate cash. With most air travel suspended, we trained our focus on accruing hotel reward points. A series of suites were booked at hotels around Midtown so team members could monitor the developing Y2K situation across the collection of global time zones with which so many of us had become familiar. These graveyard shifts did not require remaining awake, only sleeping within a several-block radius of the office—and with whomever one pleased. Christmas and New Year’s vacations were revoked, of course, but that meant that team members could enjoy a series of multicourse dinners on the Conglomerate’s tab, including those inflated prix fixe menus that always seem to pop up around the holidays.</p><p>Limited time remained, certainly in the office and possibly in the world. But the mood around Midtown seemed the furthest thing from that of end times, unless end times are distinguished by towering Christmas stockings and holiday wreaths the size of tractor tires. At a holiday party, we drank drinks named after 1980s financial instruments: a Poison Pill, an LBO, a Killer Bees, a Bear Hug. Not that those dated terms of corporate chicanery concerned team members: the Conglomerate’s stock price was as buoyant as the atmosphere, and team members who had taken some of their salary in options were feeling festive indeed.</p><p>Then, as in a modernist novel whose conclusion one knows will not provide an ending, our mission-critical moment, our finale—composed of the scaffolded segments of temporality that team members took such pleasure in delineating: second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade, century, and, yes, millennium—came and went, as any other had and many others would. It seems both necessary and anticlimactic to state what everyone now knows: we survived, with minimal difficulties. Cindy dutifully reported that some automatic toilets in Singapore hadn’t flushed properly, stuck as they were in an expired world order. Other team members scoured news sources for tales of Y2K glitches and compiled a modest list. There was an electric garage door opener whose open and close buttons had become reversed; a selection of already-odd Sharper Image gadgets that had no discernible clock control but that had nonetheless broken down somewhere on the momentary midnight bridge between 12/31/1999 and 1/1/2000; and an industrial blender at a cattle-culling facility in Alberta whose whirl wouldn’t cease even when unplugged from a power source.</p><p>By the time team members reconvened in the conference room on the bright, crisp morning of Monday, January 3, 2000, even these millennial malfunctions seemed little more than a set of curious examples, representatives of a larger case of something whose dimensions had already begun to recede from the Conglomerate’s collective consciousness. The sensation of collapse would return, of course, with the two scandalous bankruptcies that would signal the end of the ’90s economy, the first great financial bubble of our era. Both Enron and WorldCom had had Andersen as their auditor, and on both projects, it turned out, Andersen had been operating far short of best practices. It had been systematically shredding records for Enron and faking others entirely at WorldCom—documentation problems for the ages. But in the first days of the millennium, I was surprised by how quickly Y2K disappeared from office discourse as though censored, and by how team members adopted an almost amnesiac approach to a period so many of us had let so eventfully structure our lives. There was no self-consciousness: Why did we do that? More one felt a sense of process: This happened.</p></div><p>If you like this article, please <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/subscribe/?affid=article">subscribe</a> or leave a tax-deductible tip below to support n+1.</p></div>]]></description>

<p>Everything is bigger in Texas—including state police contracts for surveillance tech.</p>
<p>In June, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) signed an acquisition plan for a 5-year, nearly $5.3 million contract for a controversial surveillance tool called Tangles from tech firm PenLink, according to records obtained by the <em>Texas Observer</em> through a public information request. The deal is nearly twice as large as the company’s <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=fcef1f90000404554ca15e6b5373d65c">$2.7 million two-year contract</a> with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tangles is an artificial intelligence-powered web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep, and dark web. Tangles’ premier add-on feature, WebLoc, is controversial among digital privacy advocates. Any client who purchases access to WebLoc can track different mobile devices’ movements in a specific, virtual area selected by the user, through a capability called “geofencing.” Users of software like Tangles can do this without a search warrant or subpoena. (In <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/08/federal-appeals-court-finds-geofence-warrants-are-categorically-unconstitutional">a high-profile ruling</a>, the Fifth Circuit recently held that police cannot compel companies like Google to hand over data obtained through geofencing.) Device-tracking services rely on location pings and other personal data pulled from smartphones, usually via in-app advertisers. Surveillance tech companies then buy this information from data brokers and sell access to it as part of their products.</p>
<p>WebLoc can even be used to access a device’s mobile ad ID, a string of numbers and letters that acts as a unique identifier for mobile devices in the ad marketing ecosystem, according to a <a href="https://govtribe.com/opportunity/federal-contract-opportunity/ssa-geoint-webloc-sw-n0001521pr11439#related-government-files-table">US Office of Naval Intelligence procurement notice</a>.</p>
<p>Wolfie Christl, a public interest researcher and digital rights activist based in Vienna, Austria, argues that data collected for a specific purpose, such as navigation or dating apps, should not be used by different parties for unrelated reasons. “It’s a disaster,” Christl told the <em>Observer</em>. “It’s the largest possible imaginable decontextualization of data. … This cannot be how our future digital society looks like.”</p>
<p>While a device’s mobile ad ID is technically an anonymous piece of information, it is easy to cross reference other data points to determine the owner, according to Beryl Lipton, an investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “If there is another data point—like the address of the person who lives at the place where your phone seems to be all of the time—it can be very easy to quickly identify and build a profile of people using this supposedly anonymous information,” Lipton said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <em>Carpenter v. United States</em> that police must have a warrant to obtain cell phone location data from service providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon. But Nate Wessler, the attorney who argued the <em>Carpenter</em> case and the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the <em>Observer</em> that companies have justified selling phone location information through data brokers by arguing that mobile ad IDs are anonymous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“These companies absolutely trot that out as one of their defenses, and it is pure poppycock. … It’s transparently a ridiculous defense, because the entire thing that they’re selling is the ability to track phones and to be able to figure out where particular phones are going,” Wessler said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The privacy implications of police using services—like Tangles—that provide location data are “identical” to the issues raised in the <em>Carpenter </em>case, Wessler said. That’s because location data harvested from apps, as opposed to that obtained from service providers, can be even more invasive, he said. “You can tell just as much about somebody’s GPS history from their apps as you can from their cell phone location data from their phone provider. And in some cases, you can tell more,” Wessler said.</p>

<p>Tangles is a product offered by the cybersecurity company Cobwebs Technologies, which was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/cobwebs-technologies-an-israeli-firm-presents-its-anti-terror-tech-to-high-profile-us-delegation-300882579.html">founded in Israel in 2014</a> by three former members of Israeli military special units. The company has said their products, which are marketed as open source intelligence (OSINT) tools, have been used to combat terrorism, drug smuggling, and money laundering, but Meta has accused the company of operating as a surveillance-for-hire outfit. In 2023, Cobwebs Technologies was acquired by the Nebraska-based tech firm PenLink Ltd.</p>
<p>Christl, the Austria-based digital rights researcher, said that companies selling software that incorporates data harvested from mobile phone apps have greatly expanded the definition of OSINT tools. If a company has to buy personal data from third-party brokers to incorporate into a software that they sell to police, he said, then that isn’t really an open source tool.</p>
<p>Lipton, the investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that’s troubling for the public. “People don’t realize that some of this stuff comes with a high cost,” she said. “Both price-wise and privacy-wise.”</p>
<p>In a written statement, a PenLink spokesperson told the <em>Observer</em> their “open-source intelligence (OSINT) solutions are used to protect our communities from crime, threats, and cyber-attacks by providing seamless access to data that is publicly available. From a technology perspective, we want to note that we operate only according to the law, adhering to strict standards and regulations.” The spokesperson did not answer other specific questions.</p>
<p>Cobwebs Technologies, now part of PenLink, has scored contracts through its Delaware-based subsidiary Cobwebs America Inc. with <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=25ee2d9b32801254c245abff6a2048d5">various federal agencies</a>, including ICE, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Education, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ICE holds Cobwebs America’s highest-dollar federal contract so far, according to <a href="http://usa.spending.gov/">usa.spending.gov</a>.</p>
<p>DPS’ Intelligence and Counterterrorism division has used Tangles since 2021, as first reported by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/07/26/texas-phone-tracking-border-surveillance/"><em>The Intercept</em></a>. The agency first purchased the software as part of Governor Greg Abbott’s multi-billion dollar Operation Lone Star border crackdown, doling out an initial $200,000 contract as an “emergency award” with no public solicitation. Each year since, DPS has expanded the contract: In 2022, it paid $300,000, and in 2023, more than $400,000, according to contracting records on <a href="https://www.dps.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/iod/doingbusiness/docs/contractsover100k.pdf">DPS’ website.</a> The agency’s new plan for a 5-year Tangles license, from 2024 through 2029, will cost about $1 million per year.</p>
<p>In its acquisition plan, DPS states that Intelligence and Counterterrorism division personnel need the tool to “identify and disrupt potential domestic terrorism and other mass casualty threats.” The plan references two Texas mass shootings. In August 2019, a racist white man from Allen killed 23 at a Walmart <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/to-understand-the-el-paso-massacre-look-to-the-long-legacy-of-anti-mexican-violence-at-the-border/">in El Paso</a>. A few weeks later, a different perpetrator went on a deadly shooting in Midland and Odessa. The plan does not mention the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, when <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/dps-mccraw-transparency-uvalde/">91 DPS officers</a> formed part of a massive botched law enforcement response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Following the attacks in El Paso and Midland-Odessa Governor Abbott issued several executive orders designed to prevent similar events,” the acquisition plan obtained by the<em> Observer </em>states. “In response to these orders, DPS [Intelligence and Counterterrorism division] dedicated staff to identify potential mass attackers and terrorist threats.”</p>
<p>It is unclear how DPS has used Tangles or whether the software has helped stop any potential mass shootings. DPS did not respond to written questions or an interview request for this story.</p>
<p>Following initial publication of this story, Republican state Representative Brian Harrison said <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1828238854001668396">on social media</a> that he would be requesting more information from DPS about its use of the surveillance software. Reached by phone, Harrison told the <em>Observer</em>: “I want to make sure that we don’t have Fourth Amendment violations going on here, whether it’s intentional or not. … Government should be protecting our civil liberties, not violating them.”</p>
<p>After DPS purchased the initial license for Cobwebs’ software in 2021, local Texas law enforcement agencies followed suit. Operation Lone Star spending records from the Goliad County Sheriff’s Office, obtained by the <em>Observer</em>, show that the Goliad sheriff obtained a “cooperative use of [Cobwebs] software” in fall 2023 along with the sheriffs of Refugio and Brooks counties to “identify, link, and track the movements of cartel operatives throughout the region.”</p>
<p>Other Texas clients that have purchased Cobwebs’ software include the Dallas and Houston police departments and the sheriff’s office in Jackson County, which shares access with the Matagorda County Sheriff’s Office, according to local government meeting minutes and DPS emails.</p>
<p>Prior to its acquisition by PenLink, Cobwebs Technologies received backlash for how clients used its products. In 2021, Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Threat-Report-on-the-Surveillance-for-Hire-Industry.pdf">banned seven companies</a>—including Cobwebs—that it had identified as participating in an online surveillance-for-hire ecosystem. As part of its sanctions, Meta removed 200 accounts operated by Cobwebs and its customers. In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Threat-Report-on-the-Surveillance-for-Hire-Industry.pdf">company report</a>, Meta investigators wrote that they identified Cobwebs customers in Bangladesh, Hong Kong, the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Poland, and other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobwebs’ customers were not solely focused on public safety activities, Meta’s report said. “We also observed frequent targeting of activists, opposition politicians and government officials in Hong Kong and Mexico,” the report stated.</p>
<p>Agencies across the globe have used Tangles. From at least 2021 to 2022, Salvadoran police used it, according to <a href="https://elfaro.net/es/202301/el_salvador/26687/Gobierno-compr%C3%B3-$22-millones-en-equipo-de-espionaje-a-empresa-de-amigo-israel%C3%AD-de-Bukele.htm">the investigative outlet <em>El Faro</em></a><em>.</em> Police in Mexico have also purchased the software, according to <a href="https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/ya-llego-a-mexico-iott-tangles-nuevo-ciberespionaje/1610932"><em>Excelsior</em></a>, a Mexico City newspaper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2022, a Cobwebs Technologies sales rep asked a DPS employee if the state agency could serve as a customer referral for a police agency in Israel, according to an email obtained by the <em>Observer</em>. In the email, the sales rep stated that DPS had at least 20 Tangles users at the time. DPS’ new acquisition plan allows for 230 named users.</p>
<p>Wessler, the ACLU attorney, said the sale of mobile device data to third-party data brokers and surveillance tech firms remains a legal gray area. “There are some legal frameworks that get at the edges of this, but there’s a whole kind of core of issues that the law just hasn’t caught up to,” Wessler said.</p>
<p>But he said other government agencies already have moved away from purchasing products that use massive amounts of cell phone location data. The services can be expensive, the use of data is invasive, and there isn’t much evidence that these services have substantially helped investigations or solved a lot of cases, he added.</p>
<p>“It’s just like the juice isn’t worth the squeeze,” Wessler said. “We shouldn’t be spending taxpayer money for this kind of haystack of data that they then are trying to pick needles out of, right?”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, you’ve read about “buy, borrow, die” but you’re left with more questions than answers about how - and why - it works. Maybe you’re skeptical that it works at all. Is it just a concept journalists have manufactured that sounds good on paper but falls apart under closer scrutiny? </p>

<p>I’m a private wealth attorney at an international law firm headquartered in the U.S. and I implement “buy, borrow, die” for a living. The short answer is, yes, “buy, borrow, die” works, and it’s a devastatingly effective tax elimination strategy. </p>

<p>Let's dive into the planning a little bit and use some concrete examples to illustrate. In the comments below I will answer some of the frequently asked questions I see in discussions about “buy, borrow, die,” and address some of the misconceptions people have about it. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1A. Buy.</strong> </p>

<p>This stage of the planning really is that simple. Peter will purchase an asset for $50M. His "basis" in the asset is therefore $50M. Let's assume the asset appreciates at an annual rate of 8 percent. After 10 years, the asset now has a fair market value of $108M and Peter has a "built-in" (or "unrealized") capital gain of $58M.</p>

<p>If Peter sells the asset, it's a "realization" event and he'll be subject to income tax. The asset is a capital asset, and since Peter has owned the asset for more than 1 year, he'd receive long-term capital gain treatment and pay income tax at preferential rates if he sold it. Nevertheless, Peter's long-term capital gain rate would be 20 percent, he'd be subject to the net investment income tax of 3.8 percent, and Peter lives in Quahog which has a 5 percent income tax rate. </p>

<p>So, if Peter were to sell the asset and cash in on his gain, he'd have a total tax liability of around $17M, and his after-tax proceeds would be $91M. </p>

<p>Peter's buddy Joe overheard some of his cop buddies talking about how the ultrawealthy never pay taxes because they implement "buy, borrow, die," and he shares the idea with Peter. Peter decides to look into it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2A. Borrow.</strong> </p>

<p>Peter goes to the big city and hires a private wealth attorney, who connects him with an investment banker at Quahog Sachs. The investment bank might give Peter a loan or line of credit of up to $97M (a "loan to value" ratio of 90 percent) based on several conditions, including that the loan/line of credit is secured by the asset. Now Peter has $97M of cash to use as he pleases, and he's paid no taxes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3A. Die.</strong> </p>

<p>Peter has been living off these asset-backed loans/lines of credits and his asset has continued appreciating in value. Let's say 35 years have passed. With an annual rate of return of 8 percent, the asset now has a fair market value of $740M.</p>

<p>Then Peter dies. When Peter dies, the basis of the asset is "adjusted" to the asset's fair market value on Peter's date of death. In other words, Peter's basis of $50M in the asset is adjusted to $740M.</p>

<p>Peter's estate can now sell the asset tax free, because "gain" is computed by subtracting adjusted basis from the sales proceeds ($740M sales proceeds less $740M adjusted basis equals $0 gain). </p>

<p>Peter's estate can use the cash to pay back the loans/lines of credits. He's paid no income tax and his beneficiaries can now use the cash to buy assets and begin the "buy, borrow, die" cycle themselves. </p>

<p><strong>BUY, BORROW, DIE IN THE REAL WORLD:</strong></p>

<p>Actual “buy, borrow, die” planning is enormously complicated. If that weren't the case, the ultrawealthy wouldn’t have to pay private wealth attorneys like me upwards of $2,500 an hour for their tax, asset protection, and estate planning needs. </p>

<p>First, this type of planning is generally not economically feasible unless the taxpayer has a net worth exceeding around <strong>$300M</strong>. If you’re worth less than that, you’re not going to be able to command attractive loan/line of credit terms from investment banks. You’re going to have to get a plain vanilla product from a retail lender which is going to have relatively high interest rates (typically the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus some amount of spread) and other terms that make implementing “buy, borrow, die” expensive enough that you aren’t much better off (or you’re much worse off) than you would have been had you sold the asset and taken the after-tax proceeds. (Caveat: even loans/lines of credit at retail interest rates can still be very useful for short-term borrowing needs.) Clients with a net worth exceeding around $300M, however, can obtain bespoke products from the handful of lenders that specialize in this market, and the terms and conditions of these products make “buy, borrow, die” a no-brainer for virtually everyone who has this level of wealth. </p>

<p><strong>These types of loans/lines of credit will typically be interest-only and mature on the borrower’s death. The interest rates can be ultra-low based on numerous factors—I’ve seen anywhere from 0.5 percent to 3 percent, even in the current interest rate environment.</strong> But again, these types of loans/lines of credit are highly customized and the terms depend on the facts and circumstances. </p>

<p>Generally, in exchange for such favorable terms (i.e., interest-only, matures on death), the bank will ask for a share of the collateral’s appreciation (essentially, "stock appreciation rights"), and this obligation will be settled upon the borrower’s death along with the loan. The amount of the bank’s share of the collateral’s appreciation depends on many factors and it is fundamentally a matter of the bank’s underwriting process. </p>

<p>Ultimately, when the debt is settled, the taxpayer is going to pay a large sum to the investment bank, taking into consideration the risk involved and the time value of money. But by structuring the loan/line of credit in this way, the taxpayer has deferred the vast majority of their debt repayment until their death – at which point, as explained above, they can sell their assets tax-free and use the cash to satisfy those obligations. When faced with the alternatives of (i) paying the investment bank and attorneys $X or (ii) paying the government $1,000X, it’s a pretty easy choice for the taxpayer. </p>

<p><strong>The simple explanation described above, and as described in most media accounts of "buy, borrow, die," totally ignores wealth transfer taxes (in particular, gift and estate taxes).</strong> This is a very unusual oversight because “buy, borrow, die,” as it exists in the real world at least, is very much an integrated tax and estate planning strategy. </p>

<p>The unified estate and gift tax exemption for 2024 is $13.61M per taxpayer, or $27.22M per married couple. That means you can give up to $13.61M to anybody you want, either during your lifetime or upon your death, without paying any wealth transfer tax. Amounts you give away above that are generally subject to wealth transfer tax at a rate of 40 percent. So, if Peter gifts (or bequests) $15M to Meg, the first $13.61M is tax free, and the remaining $1.39M is subject to a 40 percent gift (or estate) tax, creating a tax liability of $556,000.</p>

<p>In the above example, when Peter dies with an asset worth $740M – assuming he has no other assets or liabilities and he has not used any of his wealth transfer tax exemption – he is going to be subject to an estate tax of $290.5M ($740M less $13.61M then multiplied by 40 percent) (assuming Peter does not make any gifts to his spouse, Lois, that qualify for the marital deduction, or any gifts to charitable organizations that qualify for the charitable deduction). Peter has avoided income tax by virtue of the basis adjustment that occurs at death, but he's subject to a substantial estate tax that in theory serves as a backstop to make sure he pays some taxes eventually (even if it’s not until his death).</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom is that you can avoid income tax (via the basis adjustment at death) <em>or</em> you can avoid estate tax (via lifetime gifting and estate freezing strategies) but you can’t do both. This conventional wisdom is wrong, and I’ll explain why below.</p>

<p><strong>What a well-advised taxpayer would do is implement an estate freezing technique early on in the “buy, borrow, die” game.</strong> This will involve transferring assets to an irrevocable trust. </p>

<p>Importantly, the trust agreement is going to provide Peter with a retained power of substitution (i.e., a power to remove assets from the irrevocable trust and title them in his own name so long as he replaces the removed assets with assets having the same fair market value) and the right to borrow from the trust without providing adequate security. These powers serve two principal purposes. First, they cause the trust to be treated as a “grantor” trust for federal income tax purposes (which, among other things, allows Peter to transact with the trust without any adverse tax consequences). And second, they allow Peter to pull appreciated properly and/or cash out of the trust to perfect the techniques described below. </p>

<p>Now, let’s revisit “buy, borrow, die,” but instead of the oversimplified concept we see in the news that seems (i) totally ineffective in a moderate to high interest rate environment and (ii) exposes the taxpayer to an enormous estate tax, let’s look at how “buy, borrow, die” is actually carried out by private wealth attorneys in the real world.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1B. Buy.</strong></p>

<p>Peter buys an asset worth $50M and transfers it to the PLG 2024 Irrevocable Trust (the "Trust"). To eliminate gift tax on that transfer, he'll use his $13.61M exemption amount and a variety of sophisticated techniques we don’t really need to get into here which might involve preferred freeze partnerships, zeroed-out grantor retained annuity trusts, and installment sales to intentionally defective grantor trusts. Suffice to say, we move the $50M asset out of Peter's ownership and all appreciation thereafter occurs outside of his estate for wealth transfer tax purposes. </p>

<p>After 10 years of appreciating at an annual rate of 8 percent, the asset is worth $108M. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2B. Borrow.</strong></p>

<p>Peter goes to the bank to get a loan. But now Peter doesn't have the asset to use as collateral because he transferred it to the Trust! Not a problem. The trustee of the Trust is going to guarantee the loan, using the Trust asset as collateral. In return, Peter will pay the Trust a guaranty fee (typically, around 1 percent of the assets serving as collateral, annually, which will be cumulative and payable upon Peter’s death). Peter can transact with the Trust like this without any adverse consequences because it’s a grantor trust. </p>

<p>Prior to Peter's death, he's going to use a loan/line of credit to obtain cash. Then, he’s going to exercise his power of substitution to swap the highly appreciated asset out of the Trust and swap the cash into the Trust. </p>

<p>So, immediately before the loan, Peter might have $0 assets and $0 liabilities. The trust will have an asset worth $780M and no liabilities. Immediately after the loan, Peter will have perhaps $700M cash (90 percent loan-to-value collateralized by the Trust assets) and $700M liabilities. The Trust will still have $780M assets and no liabilities. </p>

<p>Then Peter will exercise his power of substitution. He’ll swap $700M worth of cash into the trust in exchange for $700M worth of interests in the asset and he'll “buy” the remaining interest - $80M - from the Trust pursuant to a promissory note.</p>

<p>Immediately after the swap, Peter has the $780M asset and $780M liabilities ($700M owed to the bank and $80M owed to the Trust). The Trust has $780M assets ($700M cash and an $80M note) and no liabilities.  </p>

<p>Then Peter dies. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3B. Die.</strong> </p>

<p>Peter's gross estate includes the $780M asset. His estate receives an indebtedness deduction for $780M (the $700M he owes to the lender plus the $80M he owes to the Trust under the promissory note). <strong>Peter's taxable estate is $0 and he pays no estate tax.</strong> </p>

<p>Because the $780M asset is includible Peter's gross estate, it receives a basis adjustment to FMV upon his death. It can now be sold for $780M cash. His personal representative will use $700M to pay off the debt to the bank, and he'll use $80M to pay off the promissory note owed to the Trust. <strong>The Trust now has $780M in cash. All of the built-in (unrealized) capital gain has been eliminated, and Peter and his estate have paid no income tax.</strong> </p>

<p>(But recall that some share of the asset’s appreciation during Peter's lifetime is going to go the bank pursuant to the stock appreciation rights Peter granted them under the terms of the “buy, borrow, die” loan. Peter can’t avoid all costs, he can only avoid all taxes. But the costs are a <em>tiny</em> fraction of the taxes saved, so that’s okay.) </p>

<p>Peter's descendants/beneficiaries can now continue the “buy, borrow, die” cycle, avoiding all wealth transfer taxes and all income taxes in perpetuity, generation after generation after generation. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                          <p>An Italian cultural heritage outfit has announced the recovery of a Roman battering ram from the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

 <p>The ram, or rostrum, made up the prow of a Roman warship. It was used in the Battle of the Aegates, the team stated, a naval battle between Rome and Carthage that marked the end of the first Punic War in 241 BCE, after 23 years of conflict between the two empires.</p> <p>The discovery of the rostrum, announced by Sicily’s Department of Cultural Heritage’s Superintendence of the Sea, was recovered by divers with the Society for the Documentation of Submerged Sites. The recovery team also used the research vessel <em>Hercules</em> to aid in the rostrum’s identification and recovery.</p>

 <p>The dive team found the rostrum on the seabed at a depth of about 262 feet (80 meters). The artifact was recovered from a stretch of the Mediterranean between Levanzo and Favignana, small islands just west of Sicily, where archaeological surveys have been conducted over the last 20 years. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/2200-year-old-battering-ram-from-epic-battle-between-rome-and-carthage-found-in-mediterranean">According to LiveScience</a>, the ram is now on land in Favignana, and initial study of the artifact has revealed an ornamental relief of a helmet and feathers.</p> <p>Since the early 2000s, 27 rostra have been found, according to the team’s social media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sopmare/posts/pfbid0ji5fR9Jaihigdm3Jza6mCKV5ByN5mjkUDbvQ95fLEM66LoEy3QJhvVvE7cHV7Q7cl">post</a>. The rostra were used for—you guessed it—ramming enemy ships, with the goal of punching holes in them, ultimately sinking them. Other ancient wartime artifacts have also been identified in the team’s surveys, including 30 Roman helmets, two swords, and a relatively common find in Mediterranean archaeology, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/archaeologists-shipwrecks-mediterranean-keith-reef-1850519506">plenty of amphorae</a>.</p>

 <p>The Mediterranean Sea near Sicily and Tunisia was a popular maritime corridor during the Roman Empire—or at least it seems so based on recent archaeological findings. Last year, a UNESCO-coordinated mission found three shipwrecks off the treacherous Keith Reef between Sicily and Tunisia, one of which was dated to between 200 BCE and 100 BCE. That research team also studied three Roman wrecks off the Italian coast, two of which were 1st-century merchant vessels and one of which dated to the 1st-century BCE.</p> <p>The recently recovered rostrum is older than those wrecks, however, and is a remarkably vivid window into an ancient battle, and the fierce naval conflicts that shaped the ancient world.&nbsp;The Battle of the Aegates saw most of the Carthaginian fleet sunk or captured, and resulted in Roman supremacy on the Mediterranean. All told, there were three Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome, which resulted in the destruction of Carthage.</p>                          </div></div>]]></description>

                                        Create wrapping <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements by putting content inside pairs of <code>:::</code>. The content inside can be any valid Markdown, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, form fields, etc. Class names and other attributes are supported via <code>[...]</code> (<a href="#class-attrs">see above</a>). Moreover, you can bind one or more fields to a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element by adding the names of the fields inside <code>{$...$}</code> (separated by spaces), and placing this within the <code>[...]</code>. This means that whenever the value of a binded field changes, the content inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will be automatically re-rendered.

                                        The templating is done using <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/" target="_blank">Nunjucks</a>, so its entire list of features such as if-else statements, loops, filters, etc. are fully supported. You can also bind a single field to a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element using <code>{$ field $}</code>. This is obviously not as flexible, but it is simple, and can be used inside paragraphs, headings, list items, etc.

                                        Configure a setting by adding <code>#! {name} = {value}</code>, so you can change things like the <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code>, <code>accent</code>, etc. You can also add branding, call to action (CTA), change page layout and alignment, and so much more. Moreover, you can remove <em>our branding</em> too using <code>#! blocksmd-branding = hide</code> as soon as you <a href="#pricing">buy a license</a>, so the page becomes entirely your own.

                                        Some settings (like the colors and brand) can accept up to two values in the format <code>#! {name} = {value1} || {value2}</code>. The first value is used for the initial color scheme (which is light by default), and the second value is used for the alternate or dark color scheme. If you change the default color scheme to dark by setting <code>#! color-scheme = dark</code>, then the first value would be used in dark mode, and the second value would be used in light mode.

You can also read data from a URL using <code>#! get-url = {url}</code>. By default, CSV is the expected format, and the incoming data is formatted so that each key is a spreadsheet cell reference.

                                        Moreover, you can set <code>#! page = single</code> to create a normal webpage that is not a form. This way, you can create blog posts and articles which are reactive, and change depending on the data. In this example for instance, the data is coming in from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTH5NCCwxeYO2VHZBOHv_Eem3yaI2iepoZnltwFtxFw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this spreadsheet</a>, and the author would only need to turn off cell <code>D3</code> to show that they are not looking for work. <a href="https://blocksmd.gitbook.io/docs/google-sheets-integration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Learn how to connect with Google Sheets</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Around a decade ago, I was happy to learn about bcache – a Linux block cache system that implements tiered storage (like a pool of hard disks with SSDs for cache) on Linux. At that stage, ZFS on Linux was nowhere close to where it is today, so any progress on gaining more ZFS features in general Linux systems was very welcome. These days we care a bit less about tiered storage, since any cost benefit in using anything else than nvme tends to quickly evaporate compared to time you eventually lose on it.</p><p>In 2015, it was announced that bcache would grow into its own filesystem. This was particularly exciting and it caused quite a buzz in the Linux community, because it brought along with it more features that compare with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> (and also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">btrfs</a>), including built-in compression, built-in encryption, check-summing and RAID implementations.</p><p>Unlike ZFS, it didn’t have a dkms module, so if you wanted to test bcachefs back then, you’d have to pull the entire upstream bcachefs kernel source tree and compile it. Not ideal, but for a promise of a new, shiny, full-featured filesystem, it was worth it.</p><p>In 2019, it seemed that the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/10/762">time has come for bcachefs to be merged into Linux</a>, so I thought that it’s about time we have the userspace tools (bcachefs-tools) packaged in Debian. Even if the Debian kernel wouldn’t have it yet by the time the bullseye (Debian 11) release happened, it might still have been useful for a future backported kernel or users who roll their own.</p><p>By total coincidence, the first git snapshot that I got into Debian (version 0.1+git20190829.aa2a42b) was committed exactly 5 years ago today.</p><p>It was quite easy to package it, since it was written in C and shipped with a makefile that just worked, and it made it past NEW into unstable in 19 January 2020, just as I <a href="https://jonathancarter.org/2020/02/07/random-bits-from-fosdem-2020/">was about to head off to FOSDEM</a> as the pandemic started, but that’s of course a whole other story.</p><p>Fast-forwarding towards the end of 2023, version 1.2 shipped with some utilities written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a>, this caused a little delay, since I wasn’t at all familiar with Rust packaging yet, so I shipped an update that didn’t yet include those utilities, and saw this as an opportunity to learn more about how the Rust eco-system worked and Rust in Debian.</p><p>So, back in April the Rust dependencies for bcachefs-tools in Debian didn’t at all match the build requirements. I got some help from the Rust team who says that the common practice is to relax the dependencies of Rust software so that it builds in Debian. So errno, which needed the exact version 0.2, was relaxed so that it could build with version 0.4 in Debian, udev 0.7 was relaxed for 0.8 in Debian, memoffset from 0.8.5 to 0.6.5, paste from 1.0.11 to 1.08 and bindgen from 0.69.9 to 0.66.</p><p>I found this a bit disturbing, but it seems that some Rust people have lots of confidence that if something builds, it will run fine. And at least it did build, and the resulting binaries did work, although I’m personally still not very comfortable or confident about this approach (<em>perhaps</em> that might change as I learn more about Rust).</p><p>With that in mind, at this point you may wonder how any distribution could sanely package this. The problem is that they can’t. Fedora and other distributions with stable releases take a similar approach to what we’ve done in Debian, while distributions with much more relaxed policies (like Arch) include all the dependencies as they are vendored upstream.</p><p>As it stands now, bcachefs-tools is impossible to maintain in Debian stable. While my primary concerns when packaging, are for Debian unstable and the next stable release, I also keep in mind people who have to support these packages long after I stopped caring about them (like <a href="https://www.freexian.com/lts/debian/details/">Freexian who does LTS support for Debian</a> or <a href="https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle">Canonical who has long-term Ubuntu support</a>, and probably other organisations that I’ve never even heard of yet). And of course, if bcachfs-tools don’t have any usable stable releases, it doesn’t have any LTS releases either, so anyone who needs to support bcachefs-tools long-term has to carry the support burden on their own, and if they bundle it’s dependencies, then those as well.</p><p>I’ll admit that I don’t have any solution for fixing this. I suppose if I were upstream I might look into the possibility of at least supporting a larger range of recent dependencies (<em>usually</em> easy enough if you don’t hop onto the newest features right away) so that distributions with stable releases only need to concern themselves with providing some minimum recent versions, but even if that could work, the upstream author is 100% against any solution other than vendoring all its dependencies with the utility and insisting that it must only be built using these bundled dependencies. I’ve made 6 uploads for this package so far this year, but still I constantly get complaints that it’s out of date and that it’s ancient. If a piece of software is considered so old that it’s useless by the time it’s been published for two or three months, then there’s no way it can survive even a usual stable release cycle, nevermind any kind of long-term support.</p><p>With this in mind (not even considering some hostile emails that I recently received from the upstream developer or his public rants on lkml and reddit), I decided to remove bcachefs-tools from Debian completely. Although after discussing this with another DD, I was convinced to <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1078599" data-type="link" data-id="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1078599">orphan it instead, which I have now done</a>. I made an upload to experimental so that it’s still available if someone wants to work on it (without having to go through NEW again), it’s been <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1079375">removed from unstable</a> so that it doesn’t migrate to testing, and the ancient (especially by bcachefs-tools standards) versions that are in <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1078543">stable and oldstable will be removed too</a>, since they are very likely to cause damage with any recent kernel versions that support bcachefs.</p><p>And so, my adventure with bcachefs-tools comes to an end. I’d advise that if you consider using bcachefs for any kind of production use in the near future, you first consider how supportable it is long-term, and whether there’s really anyone at all that is succeeding in providing stable support for it.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>
