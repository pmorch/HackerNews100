<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Eastern District of Michigan - Detroit)</p>

<p>My husband, Conrad Rockenhaus, is wrongly incarcerated in a county jail. I‚Äôm posting this here because you are one of the few communities that will understand the full technical and political reality of how he ended up there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My husband is a former Tor operator, and at one point, he ran some of the fastest relays and exit nodes in the world.</p>

<p>This nightmare began when he refused to help the FBI decrypt traffic from his exit nodes.</p>

<p>Months later, the government arrested him. Their official reason? A minor, non-violent CFAA charge from an old workplace dispute that had nothing to do with Tor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, the statute of limitations was just a couple of months from expiring. It was a clear pretext to target him.</p>

<p>That minor charge was all they needed to get him into the system. To deny him bail, a U.S. Probation Officer in Texas lied under oath, telling a judge that Conrad had installed a "Linux OS called Spice" to "knock out their monitoring software" and access the "dark web."</p>

<p>(Read the transcript <a href="https://rockenhaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/U.S.-v.-Rockenhaus-2-20-20-2.pdf">https://rockenhaus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/U.S.-v.-Rockenhaus-2-20-20-2.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Here is the technical reality of their lie: The software was a standard SPICE graphics driver needed for his Ph.D. program. As many of you know, this is a basic utility for displaying graphics from a virtual machine. It is not an OS, has no connection to the dark web, and was technically incapable of interfering with their monitoring software.</p>

<p>The claim is a technical absurdity, equivalent to saying a mouse pad can hack a server.</p>

<p>Based on that lie alone, he was held in pre-trial detention for three years.</p>

<p>Now, the retaliation has escalated in Michigan. After I filed a formal complaint against his US probation officers for harassment, they used fraudulent warrants to jail my husband again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this violent arrest by US Marshals (who smashed in our windows and nearly shot my dog) he sustained a severe head injury that caused him to have a grand mal seizure in court. The jail‚Äôs ‚Äúmedical attention‚Äù was to ask him what year it was (he said 2023) and then send him back to his cell. He is being denied real medical care.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, U.S. District Judge Stephen J. Murphy, III has created a procedural trap that has stripped my husband of his right to a lawyer to fight for his life, health, or innocence. He is trapped in a constitutional and medical crisis.</p>

<p>I am not asking for money. I am asking for your help to amplify this story. You understand the technical truth and why this fight is so important.</p>

<p>We have all the evidence: the court transcript of the false testimony, the fraudulent warrants, the proof of medical neglect. It‚Äôs documented on my website:</p>

<p><a href="https://rockenhaus.com/">https://rockenhaus.com</a></p>

<p>TL;DR: My husband, a former Tor operator, refused to help the FBI decrypt Tor traffic. They retaliated by using an old, unrelated CFAA offense to arrest him and then lied about him using a "graphics driver to access the dark web‚Äù to keep him in pre-trial detention for 3 years. Now he's been jailed again in Michigan on fraudulent violations, is being denied care for a head injury, and has no lawyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need help getting the word outüôè</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-blog-post=""><h2>Executive Summary</h2><p>The NPM ecosystem is facing another critical supply chain attack. The popular @ctrl/tinycolor package, which receives over 2 million weekly downloads, has been compromised along with more than 40 other packages across multiple maintainers. This attack demonstrates a concerning evolution in supply chain threats - the malware includes a self-propagating mechanism that automatically infects downstream packages, creating a cascading compromise across the ecosystem. The compromised versions have been removed from npm.</p><p>The incident was discovered by <a href="https://github.com/franky47" target="_blank">@franky47</a>, who promptly notified the community through a <a href="https://github.com/scttcper/tinycolor/issues/256" target="_blank">GitHub issue</a>. </p><p>In this post, we'll dive deep into the payload's mechanics, including deobfuscated code snippets, API call traces, and diagrams to illustrate the attack chain. Our analysis reveals a Webpack-bundled script (bundle.js) that leverages Node.js modules for reconnaissance, harvesting, and propagation; targeting Linux/macOS devs with access to NPM/GitHub/cloud creds. </p><h2>Technical Analysis</h2><p>The attack unfolds through a sophisticated multi-stage chain that leverages Node.js's process.env for opportunistic credential access and employs Webpack-bundled modules for modularity. At the core of this attack is a ~3.6MB minified bundle.js file, which executes asynchronously during npm install. This execution is likely triggered via a hijacked postinstall script embedded in the compromised package.json.</p><p><strong>Self-Propagation Engine</strong>‚Äç</p><p>The malware includes a self-propagation mechanism through the NpmModule.updatePackage function. This function queries the NPM registry API to fetch up to 20 packages owned by the maintainer, then force-publishes patches to these packages. This creates a cascading compromise effect, recursively injecting the malicious bundle into dependent ecosystems across the NPM registry.</p><p><strong>Credential Harvesting</strong>‚Äç</p><p>The malware repurposes open-source tools like TruffleHog to scan the filesystem for high-entropy secrets. It searches for patterns such as AWS keys using regular expressions like AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}. Additionally, the malware dumps the entire process.env, capturing transient tokens such as GITHUB_TOKEN and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.</p><p>For cloud-specific operations, the malware enumerates AWS Secrets Manager using SDK pagination and accesses Google Cloud Platform secrets via the @google-cloud/secret-manager API. The malware specifically targets the following credentials:</p><ol role="list"><li>GitHub personal access tokens</li><li>AWS access keys (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)</li><li>Google Cloud Platform service credentials</li><li>Azure credentials</li><li>Cloud metadata endpoints</li><li>NPM authentication tokens</li></ol><p><strong>Persistence Mechanism</strong>‚Äç</p><p>The malware establishes persistence by injecting a GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml) via a base64-encoded bash script. This workflow triggers on push events and exfiltrates repository secrets using the expression ${{ toJSON(secrets) }} to a command and control endpoint. The malware creates branches by force-merging from the default branch (refs/heads/shai-hulud) using GitHub's /git/refs endpoint.</p><p><strong>Data Exfiltration</strong>‚Äç</p><p>The malware aggregates harvested credentials into a JSON payload, which is pretty-printed for readability. It then uploads this data to a new public repository named <code>Shai-Hulud</code> via the GitHub /user/repos API.</p><p>The entire attack design assumes Linux or macOS execution environments, checking for os.platform() === 'linux' || 'darwin'. It deliberately skips Windows systems. For a visual breakdown, see the attack flow diagram below:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68c9067c02ea9a2f037ae6ad_Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%2011.40.28%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Attack Mechanism</h2><p>The compromise begins with a sophisticated minified JavaScript bundle injected into affected packages like @ctrl/tinycolor. This is not rudimentary malware but rather a sophisticated modular engine that uses Webpack chunks to organize OS utilities, cloud SDKs, and API wrappers.</p><p>The payload imports six core modules, each serving a specific function in the attack chain.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68c91b23b911622bbe928502_Screenshot%202025-09-16%20at%201.08.52%E2%80%AFAM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>OS Recon (Module 71197)</h3><p>This module calls getSystemInfo() to build a comprehensive system profile containing platform, architecture, platformRaw, and archRaw information. It dumps the entire process.env, capturing sensitive environment variables including AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, GITHUB_TOKEN, and other credentials that may be present in the environment.</p><h3>Credential Harvesting Across Clouds</h3><h4>AWS (Module 56686)</h4><p>The AWS harvesting module validates credentials using the STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentityCommand.

It implements pagination using nextPageToken and returns objects containing the secret name and decoded payload. The module fails silently on PERMISSION_DENIED errors without alerting the user.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68c9017078b319a3d4fac17a_Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%2011.18.57%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h4><strong>Filesystem Secret Scanning (Module 94913)</strong></h4><p>This module spawns TruffleHog via child_process.exec('trufflehog filesystem / --json') to scan the entire filesystem. It parses the output for high-entropy matches, such as AWS keys found in ~/.aws/credentials.</p><h3>Propagation Mechanics</h3><h4>NPM Pivot (Module 40766)</h4><p>The NPM propagation module parses NPM_TOKEN from either ~/.npmrc or environment variables. After validating the token via the /whoami endpoint, it queries /v1/search?text=maintainer:${username}&amp;size=20 to retrieve packages owned by the maintainer.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>// Deobfuscated NPM update snippet</span><span>

</span>rm -f .github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml
<!-- -->

<!-- -->
<span></span><span># Delete any malicious branches found</span><span>
</span>git push origin --delete shai-hulud</code></pre><p>‚Äç</p><h3>Rotate All Credentials Immediately</h3><p>The malware harvests credentials from multiple sources. Rotate ALL of the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>NPM tokens (automation and publish tokens)</li><li>GitHub personal access tokens</li><li>GitHub Actions secrets in all repositories</li><li>SSH keys used for Git operations</li><li>AWS IAM credentials, access keys, and session tokens</li><li>Google Cloud service account keys and OAuth tokens</li><li>Azure service principals and access tokens</li><li>Any credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager or GCP Secret Manager</li><li>API keys found in environment variables</li><li>Database connection strings</li><li>Third-party service tokens</li><li>CI/CD pipeline secrets</li></ul><h3>Audit Cloud Infrastructure for Compromise</h3><p>Since the malware specifically targets AWS Secrets Manager and GCP Secret Manager, you need to audit your cloud infrastructure for unauthorized access. The malware uses API calls to enumerate and exfiltrate secrets, so reviewing audit logs is critical to understanding the scope of compromise.</p><h4>AWS Security Audit</h4><p>Start by examining your CloudTrail logs for any suspicious secret access patterns. Look specifically for BatchGetSecretValue, ListSecrets, and GetSecretValue API calls that occurred during the time window when the compromised package may have been installed. Also generate and review IAM credential reports to identify any unusual authentication patterns or newly created access keys.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span># Check CloudTrail for suspicious secret access</span><span>

</span><span>aws iam get-credential-report --query </span><span>'Content'</span></code></pre><h4>GCP Security Audit</h4><p>For Google Cloud Platform, review your audit logs for any access to the Secret Manager service. The malware uses the @google-cloud/secret-manager library to enumerate secrets, so look for unusual patterns of secret access. Additionally, check for any unauthorized service account key creation, as these could be used for persistent access.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span># Review secret manager access logs

If you are not an existing enterprise customer, you can start our 14 day free trial by installing <a href="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/artifact-monitor" target="_blank">the StepSecurity GitHub App</a> to complete the following recovery step.</p><h4>‚Äç<br>Use NPM Package Cooldown Check</h4><div><p><a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/introducing-the-npm-package-cooldown-check" target="_blank">The NPM&nbsp;Cooldown check</a> automatically fails a pull request if it introduces an npm package version that was released within the organization‚Äôs configured cooldown period (default: 2 days). Once the cooldown period has passed, the check will clear automatically with no action required. The rationale is simple - most supply chain attacks are detected within the first 24 hours of a malicious package release, and the projects that get compromised are often the ones that rushed to adopt the version immediately. By introducing a short waiting period before allowing new dependencies, teams can reduce their exposure to fresh attacks while still keeping their dependencies up to date.</p><p>Here is an example showing how this check protected a project from using the compromised versions of packages involved in this incident:</p></div><p><a href="https://github.com/step-security/test-reporting/pull/16/checks?check_run_id=49850926488" target="_blank">https://github.com/step-security/test-reporting/pull/16/checks?check_run_id=49850926488</a></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68bf0ba9eb58ed09a40a6832_Screenshot%202025-09-08%20at%209.59.17%E2%80%AFAM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Discover Pull Requests upgrading to compromised npm packages</h4><p>We have added a new control specifically to detect pull requests that upgraded to these compromised packages. You can find the new control on the StepSecurity dashboard.</p><p>‚Äç</p><h4>Use StepSecurity Harden-Runner to detect compromised dependencies in CI/CD</h4><p>StepSecurity Harden-Runner adds runtime security monitoring to your GitHub Actions workflows, providing visibility into network calls, file system changes, and process executions during CI/CD runs. Harden-Runner detects the compromised nx packages when they are used in CI/CD. Here is a sample Harden-Runner insights page demonstrating this detection:</p><p><a href="https://app.stepsecurity.io/github/actions-security-demo/compromised-packages/actions/runs/17259145119">https://app.stepsecurity.io/github/actions-security-demo/compromised-packages/actions/runs/17259145119</a></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/68af60ec28c0c2eec02c4d1f_Screenshot%202025-08-27%20at%2012.47.35%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you're already using Harden-Runner, we strongly recommend you review recent anomaly detections in your Harden-Runner dashboard. You can get started with Harden-Runner by following the guide at <a href="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner">https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner</a>.</p><h4>Use StepSecurity Artifact Monitor to detect software releases outside of authorized pipelines</h4><p>StepSecurity Artifact Monitor provides real-time detection of unauthorized package releases by continuously monitoring your artifacts across package registries. This tool would have flagged this incident by detecting that the compromised versions were published outside of the project's authorized CI/CD pipeline. The monitor tracks release patterns, verifies provenance, and alerts teams when packages are published through unusual channels or from unexpected locations. By implementing Artifact Monitor, organizations can catch supply chain compromises within minutes rather than hours or days, significantly reducing the window of exposure to malicious packages.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/673b71f0790aabf30bd30bf8/687df9387e6b08fe8bd27e5c_image.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Learn more about implementing Artifact Monitor in your security workflow at <a href="https://docs.stepsecurity.io/artifact-monitor" target="_blank">https://docs.stepsecurity.io/artifact-monitor</a>.</p><h2>Reference</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/scttcper/tinycolor/issues/256" target="_blank">GitHub Issue</a></p><p><a href="https://socket.dev/blog/tinycolor-supply-chain-attack-affects-40-packages" target="_blank">Socket.dev Blog Post</a></p><p>‚Äç</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>45257627</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 03:05:53 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://adamsilver.io/blog/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/">https://adamsilver.io/blog/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45257627">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>When referring to the user‚Äôs stuff, which is better out of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúMy account‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour account‚Äù?</li>
<li>‚ÄúMy orders‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour orders‚Äù?</li>
<li>‚ÄúMy cases‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour cases‚Äù?</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs a trick question because often you don‚Äôt need any prefix and can just use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account</li>
<li>Orders</li>
<li>Cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon is a good example of this in action because it‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs your account and your orders:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/amazon.png" alt="Amazon‚Äôs header which does not use ‚Äòyour‚Äô or ‚Äòmy‚Äô for account and orders"></figure>
</div>
<p>But what if your product contains things that belong to you and to others ‚Äì for example, a case working system that contains your cases and everyone else‚Äòs?</p>
<h2>The problem with ‚Äúmy‚Äù</h2>
<p>You could use ‚ÄúMy cases‚Äù in a navigation menu like this:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/nav.png" alt="Navigation menu with options for ‚ÄòMy cases‚Äô and ‚ÄòAll cases‚Äô"></figure>
</div>
<p>This seems fine on the face of it.</p>
<p>But screens are not only accessed or referred to through a menu.</p>
<p>For example, you might need to sign post users to their cases in an onboarding flow, email notification or help article.</p>
<p>Saying something like ‚ÄúGo to my cases‚Äù is awkward and unnatural ‚Äì if I told you to go to my cases, you‚Äôd think I was telling you to go to my cases, not yours.</p>
<p>Similarly, a support agent might tell you to ‚ÄúGo to your cases‚Äù over webchat or a phone call. This is confusing if the UI says ‚ÄúMy cases‚Äù.</p>
<p>These issues just don‚Äôt come up when you use ‚Äúyour‚Äù ‚Äì I‚Äôve used this approach in multiple products over the years, and seen exactly zero issues in user research.</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs good.</p>
<h2>‚ÄúBut what if the user is communicating to us using radio buttons, for example?‚Äù</h2>
<p>This is easy if we look at an example:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/radios-your.png" alt="Radios where the legend is ‚ÄòDo you want to share your profile photo?‚Äô and the options are ‚ÄòYes, share your profile photo‚Äô and ‚ÄòNo, do not share your profile photo‚Äô"></figure>
</div>
<p>This doesn‚Äôt make sense because it sounds like you‚Äôre instructing the computer to share their profile, not yours.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs clear if you use ‚Äúmy‚Äù:</p>
<div>
	<figure><img src="https://adamsilver.io/assets/images/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/radios-my.png" alt="Radios where the legend is ‚ÄòDo you want to share your profile photo?‚Äô and the options are ‚ÄòYes, share my profile photo‚Äô and ‚ÄòNo, do not share my profile photo‚Äô"></figure>
</div>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use ‚Äúyour‚Äù when communicating to the user</li>
<li>Use ‚Äúmy‚Äù when the user is communicating to us</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="postContent"><div><h2 dir="auto">E: apparently it needs to be said that I am not suggesting you switch to Linux on your phone today; just that development needs to accelerate. Please don‚Äôt be one of the 34 people that replied to tell me Linux is not ready.</h2>
<p dir="auto">Android has always been a <em>fairly</em> open platform, especially if you were <em>deliberate</em> about getting it that way, but we‚Äôve seen in recent months an <strong>extremely rapid</strong> devolution of the Android ecosystem:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/google-android-aosp-developement-private/" rel="noopener nofollow">The closing of development of an increasing number of components in AOSP.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://trendslife.in/samsung-one-ui-removed-bootloader-unlock/" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://droidwin.com/xiaomi-might-no-longer-allow-bootloader-unlocking-on-miui/" rel="noopener nofollow">Xiaomi</a> and <a href="https://droidwin.com/now-oneplus-restricts-bootloader-unlocking/" rel="noopener nofollow">OnePlus</a> have removed the option of bootloader unlocking on all of their devices. I suspect Google is not far behind.</li>
<li>Google implementing Play Integrity API and encouraging developers to implement it. Notably the EU‚Äôs own identity verification wallet requires this, in stark contrast to their own laws and policies, despite the protest of hundreds on Github.</li>
<li>And finally, the mandatory implementation of developer verification across Android systems. Yes, if you‚Äôre running a 3rd-party OS like GOS you won‚Äôt be directly affected by this, but it will impact 99.9% of devices, and I foresee many open source developers just opting out of developing apps for Android entirely as a result. <a href="https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discontinuing-syncthing-android/23002" rel="noopener nofollow">We‚Äôve already seen SyncThing simply discontinue development</a> for this reason, citing issues with Google Play Store. They‚Äôve also repeatedly denied updates for NextCloud with no explanation, only restoring it after mass outcry. And we‚Äôve already seen Google targeting any software intended to circumvent ads, labeling them in the system as ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äúuntrusted‚Äù. This will most certainly carry into their new ‚Äúverification‚Äù system.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Google once competed with Apple for customers. But in a world where Google walks away from the biggest antitrust trial since 1998 with yet another slap on the wrist, competition is dead, and Google is taking notes from Apple about what they can legally get away with.</p>
<p dir="auto">Android as we know it is dead. And/or will be dead very soon. We need an open replacement.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>A first version of this piece was almost ready to be published two days ago, but after writing more than 2,000 words, I grew increasingly angry and exasperated, and that made the article become too meandering and rant-like, so I deleted everything, and started afresh several hours&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>This, of course, is about <em>Awe-dropping</em>, Apple‚Äôs September 9 event, where they presented the new iPhone lineup, the new AirPods Pro, and the new Apple Watches. And the honest truth here is that I‚Äôm becoming less and less inclined to talk about Apple, because it‚Äôs a company that I feel has lost its alignment with me and other long-time Apple users and customers.</p>
<p>The more Apple talks and moves like other big tech companies, the less special it gets; the less special and distinctive it gets, the less I‚Äôm interested in finding ways to talk about it. Yes, I have admitted that Apple makes me mad lately, so they still elicit a response that isn‚Äôt utter indifference on my part. And yes, you could argue that if Apple makes me mad, it means that in the end I still&nbsp;care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But things aren‚Äôt this clear-cut. I currently don‚Äôt really care about Apple ‚Äî I care that their bad software design decisions and their constant user-interface dumbing down may become trends and get picked up by other tech companies. So, what I still care about that‚Äôs related to Apple is essentially the consequences of their actions.</p>
<h2>The Steve Jobs&nbsp;quote</h2>
<p>The event kicked off with the famous Steve Jobs&nbsp;quote,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it&nbsp;works.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>and I immediately felt the whiplash.</p>
<p>Why that quote? Why now, after months of criticism towards the new design √¶sthetic of Liquid Glass? I gave this choice three possible interpretations ‚Äî I still may be missing something here; I‚Äôm sure my readers will let me&nbsp;know.</p>
<ol>
<li>It‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs way of trolling the critics, who have repeatedly resorted to Steve Jobs‚Äôs words to criticise the several misguided UI choices in Liquid Glass. It‚Äôs the same kind of response as Phil Schiller famously blurting, <em>Can‚Äôt innovate anymore, my ass!</em> in 2013 during the presentation of the then-redesigned Mac Pro. But it feels like a less genuine, more passive-aggressive response (if this is the way we‚Äôre supposed to read their use of that&nbsp;quote).</li>
<li>Apple used the quote in earnest. As in, they really believe that what they‚Äôre doing is in line with Jobs‚Äôs words. If that‚Äôs the case, this is utter self-deception. The quote doesn‚Äôt reflect at all what Apple is doing in the UI and software department ‚Äî the Liquid Glass design is more ‚Äòlook <span>&amp;</span> feel‚Äô than ‚Äòwork‚Äô. And the very introduction of the iPhone Air proves that Jobs‚Äôs words are falling on deaf ears on the hardware front as&nbsp;well.</li>
<li>Apple used the quote ‚Äòfor effect‚Äô. As if Meta started a keynote by saying, <em>Our mission is to connect people, no more no less.</em> You know, something that makes you sound great and noble, but not necessarily something you truly believe (or something that is actually true, for that matter).</li>
</ol>
<p>I can‚Äôt know for sure which of these might be the correct interpretation. I think it heavily depends on whose Apple executive came up with the idea. Whatever the case may be, the effect was the same ‚Äî it felt really jarring and tone-deaf.</p>
<h2>AirPods and Watches</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre not new here, you‚Äôll know that these are the Apple products I care the least, together with HomePods and Apple TV. I always tune out when Apple presents these, so browse Apple‚Äôs website or go read the technical breakdown elsewhere. Personally, I‚Äôm too into traditional horology and therefore the design of the Apple Watch has always felt unimaginative at best, and plain ugly at&nbsp;worst.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a UI standpoint, the Apple Watch continues to feel too complicated to use, and too overburdened with features. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs design by committee, but more like designed to appeal to a whole committee. Apple wants the watch to appeal to a wide range of customers, therefore this little device comes stuffed with all kinds of bells and whistles. As I said more than once, the real feature I would love to see implemented is the ability to just turn off entire feature sets, so that if you only want to use it as a step counter and heart rate monitor, you can tell the watch to be just that; this would be more than just having a watchface that shows you time, steps, heart rate ‚Äî it would be like having a watch that does <em>only that</em>. With all the features you deem unnecessary effectively disabled, imagine how simpler interacting with it would be, and imagine how longer its battery life would&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>What really got on my nerves during the Apple Watch segment of the event, though, is this: Apple always, <em>always</em> inserts a montage of sob stories about how the Apple Watch has saved lives, and what an indispensable life-saving device it is. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm glad those lives were saved. But this kind of ‚Äòshowcase‚Äô every year is made in such poor taste. It‚Äôs clear to me that it‚Äôs all marketing above everything else, that they just want to sell the product, and these people‚Äôs stories end up being used as a marketing tactic. It‚Äôs depressing.</p>
<p>As for the AirPods, and true wireless earbuds in general, I find this product category to be the most wasteful. Unless someone comes up with a type of earbuds that have easily replaceable batteries, I‚Äôm not interested in buying something that‚Äôs bound to become e‚Äëwaste in a relatively short period of&nbsp;time.</p>
<h2>The new iPhones</h2>
<p>Don‚Äôt buy them. Don‚Äôt waste your money, unless you have money to waste and don‚Äôt care about a company with this kind of leadership. Read <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/"><em>How Tim Cook sold out Steve Jobs</em></a> by Anil Dash to understand how I feel. I couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd wrap up my article here, but then I‚Äôd receive a lot of emails asking me why I didn‚Äôt talk about the iPhones, so here are a few stray observations:</p>
<p>One, maybe involuntary, user-friendly move Apple did with this new iPhone lineup is that now we have three very distinct iPhone models, whose nature and price should really help people decide which to purchase.</p>
<p>The regular <strong>iPhone 17</strong> is the safe, iterative solution. It looks like an iPhone 16, it works like an iPhone 16 that has now better features. It‚Äôs the ideal phone for the average user (tech-savvy or not). It‚Äôs the safe choice and the best value iPhone overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong> is possibly the most Pro iPhone to date. During its presentation, I felt like Apple wants you to consider this more like a pro camera for videographers and filmmakers rather than just a smartphone with a good camera array. People who have no use for all these pro video recording features shouldn‚Äôt waste their money on it. Unless they want a big chunky iPhone with the best camera array and/or have money to burn. In my country (Spain), the 6.3‚Äëinch iPhone 17 Pro starts at ‚Ç¨1,319 with 256GB of storage, and goes up to ‚Ç¨1,819 with 1TB of storage. For the bigger iPhone 17 Pro, those prices become ‚Ç¨1,469 and ‚Ç¨1,969 respectively, and if you want the iPhone 17 Pro Max with 2TB of storage, it‚Äôll cost you ‚Ç¨2,469. You do you, but I think these are insane prices for phones (and&nbsp;SSDs).</p>
<p>The <strong> iPhone Air</strong> is just‚Ä¶ odd. I was curious to know about other techies‚Äô reactions, and of all the major tech YouTubers, I think the one I‚Äôm agreeing the most on their first impressions of the iPhone Air is Marques Brownlee. <a href="https://youtu.be/idEAABFzpfg?si=yS4-IoqZq1oFMiPs&amp;t=522">At this point</a> in his video, he&nbsp;says:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>
I really think this phone is gonna be a hard sell, because if you subtract emotions from it, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the worst one. This is gonna jump in the lineup at $999 ‚Äî it replaces essentially the Plus phones in the lineup ‚Äî and it is surrounded by other iPhones that are better than it in basically every way, other than being super thin and light. So it‚Äôs a fascinating gamble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phone has the same A19 Pro chip in it as the Pro phones, minus one GPU core. Interesting choice: apparently it‚Äôs a bit more efficient than the base A19, so that‚Äôs good for battery life. But we also just heard a whole long list of choices Apple made with the Pro phones to make them more thermally efficient to not overheat ‚Äî switching from titanium to aluminium, and adding a vapour chamber to the back. But this phone is <em>still</em> titanium, and absolutely does not have room for an advanced thermal solution or any sort of vapour chamber, so it sounds like this phone could get much hotter and throttle performance much quicker. It‚Äôs a red&nbsp;flag.</p>
<p>Now we also know that ultra-thin phones have a tendency to be a little bit less durable. They‚Äôve bent over the years. And I‚Äôm not gonna be the first one to point this out. [‚Ä¶] And Apple of course has thought about this. They‚Äôve for sure tested this, and they‚Äôre telling us it‚Äôs the most durable iPhone ever. But, I mean, I‚Äôm looking at the phone and I think it qualifies also as a red flag. And then we already know there is just no way battery life can be good on this phone, right? There‚Äôs just no way. I‚Äôve been reviewing phones for more than a decade, and all signs point to it being&nbsp;trash.</p>
<p>There was a slide in the keynote today about how they were still proud to achieve ‚Äòall-day battery life‚Äô. But, like, come on. Really? I mean they still do the thing where they rearranged the components up into the little plateau at the top to make room for more battery at the bottom. But there‚Äôs just absolutely not enough room in this phone for a large battery. And it doesn‚Äôt appear to be silicon-carbon, or any sort of a special ultra-high density battery.</p>
<p>And Apple also announced it alongside a special dedicated MagSafe battery accessory, just for this phone, that adds 3,149 mAh, and just barely, combined, will match the 17 Pro in terms of quoted video playback. So if that doesn‚Äôt scream red flag, I don‚Äôt know what to tell&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>It is also e‚ÄëSIM-only, globally, ‚Äôcause there‚Äôs no room in any version of this phone for a plastic SIM card. There‚Äôs also no millimeter-wave 5G. And like I said, it‚Äôs coming in at $1,000, which is more expensive than the base iPhone, which will have a better camera system, and better battery life, and may overheat less.</p>
<p>So look, I think there‚Äôs two ways to look at this phone. This is either Apple just throwing something new at the wall and seeing if it sticks. [‚Ä¶] Or you can see this as a visionary, long-time-in-the-making preview at the future of all phones. Like, maybe someday in the future every phone will be this thin. And Apple is just now, today, getting the tech together with the battery and display and modem and Apple Silicon to make this phone possible. Maybe kind of like how the first MacBook Air sucked, and was underpowered, but then eventually all laptops became that thin. Maybe that‚Äôs also what‚Äôs gonna happen to smartphones. And maybe the same way Samsung made the ultra-thin S25 Edge, and then a few months later they came out with their super-thin foldable, the Z Fold7, and I felt like the Edge phone was one half of that foldable. Maybe that‚Äôs also what Apple‚Äôs doing. Maybe we‚Äôre gonna see an ultra-thin foldable iPhone next year.&nbsp;Maybe.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I‚Äôm firmly in the ‚ÄúApple throwing something new at the wall and seeing if it sticks‚Äù camp. Because what‚Äôs that innovative in having thin smartphones? What‚Äôs the usefulness when the other two dimensions keep increasing? Making a thin and light and relatively compact MacBook and calling it ‚ÄòAir‚Äô made sense back when virtually no other laptop was that thin and light. It was, and is, a great solution for when you‚Äôre out and about or travelling, and space is at a premium; and you also don‚Äôt want a bulky computer to lug around.</p>
<p>Then Apple applied the ‚ÄòAir‚Äô moniker to the iPad, and that started to make less sense. It‚Äôs not that a regular or Pro iPad were and are that cumbersome to begin with. And then Apple felt the need to have MacBook Airs that are 13- and 15-inch in size, instead of 11- and 13-inch. A 15-inch MacBook Air makes little sense, too, as an ‚ÄòAir‚Äô laptop. It may be somewhat thin, somewhat light, but it‚Äôs not exactly compact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now we have the iPhone Air ‚Äî which is just thin for thinness‚Äô sake. It‚Äôs still a big 6.5‚Äëinch phone that‚Äôs hardly pocketable. I still happen to handle and use a few older iPhones in the household, and the dimensions of the iPhone 5/5S/SE make this iPhone more ‚ÄòAir‚Äô than the iPhone Air. If you want a slightly more recent example, the iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini have the real <em>lightness</em> that could make sense in a phone. Perhaps you‚Äôll once again remind me that the iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini weren‚Äôt a success, but I keep finding people telling me they would favour a more compact phone than a big-but-thin phone. I‚Äôll be truly surprised if the iPhone Air turns out to be a bigger success than the ‚Äòmini‚Äô iPhones. It is a striking device in person, no doubt, but once this first impact is gone and you start thinking it over and making your decision, what Marques Brownlee said above is kind of hard to&nbsp;deny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find particularly hilarious the whole MagSafe battery accessory affair. Apple creates a super-thin, super-light phone, proudly showcases its striking design, and immediately neutralises this bold move and thin design by offering an accessory 1) that you‚Äôll clearly need if you want to have a decently-lasting battery (thus admitting that that thinness certainly came with an important compromise); and 2) that instantly defeats the purpose of a thin design by returning the bulk that was shaved away in making the&nbsp;phone.</p>
<h2>What should I be in awe&nbsp;of?</h2>
<p>I found a lot of reactions to these products to be weirdly optimistic. Either I‚Äôm becoming more cynical with age and general tech fatigue, or certain people are easily impressed. What usually impresses me is some technological breakthrough I didn‚Äôt see coming, or a clever new device, or some clever system software features and applications that give new purposes to a device I‚Äôve known well for a while. This event, and what was presented, didn‚Äôt show any of&nbsp;this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Didn‚Äôt you expect Apple to be able to produce yet another iteration of Apple Watches and AirPods that were better than the previous one? Didn‚Äôt you expect Apple to be able to make a unibody iPhone after years of making unibody computers? Didn‚Äôt you expect Apple to be able to have iPhones with better cameras and recording capabilities than last year‚Äôs iPhones? Didn‚Äôt you expect Apple to be able to make a thinner iPhone? To come up with better chips? Or a vapour chamber to prevent overheating? Or a ‚Äòcentre stage‚Äô feature for the selfie camera? Are these things I should be in awe&nbsp;of?</p>
<p>I will probably be genuinely amazed when Apple is finally able to come up with a solution that entirely removes the dynamic island from the front of the iPhone while still having a front-facing camera up&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be similarly amazed when Apple finally gets rid of people who have shown to know very little about software design and user interfaces, and comes up with operating systems that are, once again, intuitive, discoverable, easy to use, and that both look and work well. Because the iOS, iPadOS, and Mac OS 26 releases are <em>not it</em> ‚Äî and these new iPhones might be awe-inspiring all you want, but you‚Äôll still have to deal with iOS 26 on them. These new iPhones may have a fantastic hardware and all, but what makes any hardware tick is the software. You‚Äôve probably heard that famous quote by Alan Kay, <em> People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware</em>. Steve Jobs himself quoted it, adding that ‚Äúthis is how we feel about it‚Äù at his Apple. Today‚Äôs Apple needs to hear a revised version of that quote, something like, <em>People who are this serious about their hardware should make better software for it</em>.</p>
<p>The level of <em>good-enough-ism</em> Apple has reached today in software is downright baffling. This widening gap between their hardware and software competence is going to be really damaging if the course isn‚Äôt corrected. The tight integration between hardware and software has always been what made Apple platforms stand out. This integration is going to get lost if Apple keeps having wizards for hardware engineers on one side, and software and UI people producing amateurish results on the other side. Relying on legacy and unquestioning fanpeople, for whom everything Apple does is good and awesome and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, can only go so far. Steve Jobs always knew that software is comparatively more important than the hardware. In a 1994 interview with Jeff Goodell, published by <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2010 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100325155945/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/31896381/from_the_archives_a_revealing_interview_with_steve_jobs/print">archived link</a>), Jobs&nbsp;said:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>
The problem is, in hardware you can‚Äôt build a computer that‚Äôs twice as good as anyone else‚Äôs anymore. Too many people know how to do it. You‚Äôre lucky if you can do one that‚Äôs one and a third times better or one and a half times better. And then it‚Äôs only six months before everybody else catches up. But you can do it in software.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>But not if you keep crippling it because you want to bring all your major platforms to the lowest common denominator.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The Great Pyramids took decades to build. It was a monumental feat of human
ingenuity and collaboration. Today, we software developers erect our own
pyramids each day - not from stone, but from code. Yet despite far more advanced
tools, these systems don‚Äôt always make the experience better. So why, when KISS
(Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a well-known mantra, do we keep gravitating toward
complexity?</p>

<h2 id="marketing--simplicity">Marketing &gt; Simplicity</h2>

<p>Sell me this pen: ‚úé</p>

<p>What? You don‚Äôt know how? Okay, instead, sell me this <em>Penzilla</em> - a pen that
can erase, write in different colors, play music, dial 911, act as a radio
antenna, and even help you cheat on your homework.</p>

<p>In the software world, how would you sell a competitor to the <code>cat</code> command?
Sounds insane, right? It‚Äôs so simple - why would anyone compete with it, let
alone build an alternative? (Let‚Äôs pretend Rust coreutils don‚Äôt exist.)</p>

<p>But what if instead of a <code>cat</code> competitor, it was <em>catzilla</em> - a tool that could
watch your files, hop through portals, and jump across networks? Now that‚Äôs
marketable! Still, nobody would take you seriously. Why? Because <code>cat</code> just
works, and it‚Äôs highly unlikely anyone will ever need anything else (just like
Penzilla).</p>

<p>However, if <code>catzilla</code> were hyped from every corner of the internet, with a
CatConf coming next month, you‚Äôd at least be curious to try it. Social proof
makes you take it seriously. Even if it‚Äôs just a gimmick, it‚Äôs still a gimmick
with users.</p>

<p>Complexity also signals effort, expertise, and exclusivity. If you struggle to
understand it, your brain rewards you with awe: ‚ÄúWow, this must be really
smart,‚Äù you think - even if a simpler solution would work just as well.</p>

<p>Marketers, engineers, and startups all exploit this trick. The more layers, the
fancier the terminology, the more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù it feels. Complexity turns into a
status symbol rather than a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-inside-the-great-pyramids">What is inside the Great Pyramids?</h2>

<p>Whatever you put inside, duh. Like the Pyramids, modern software is built layer
upon layer - dependencies, frameworks, and abstractions stacked high. But just
as the Pyramids‚Äô inner chambers are often empty, these layers can hide a lack of
substance, making maintenance a nightmare.</p>

<p>When you look at a Pyramid, only a moment later you notice your mouth is open
wide in awe (close it now). Simplicity, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt hold any
secrets inside. It‚Äôs invisible until you realize it‚Äôs genius.</p>

<p>Complexity shouts, ‚ÄúLook at me!‚Äù, while simplicity whispers ‚ÄúDid you notice?‚Äù.</p>

<p>One thing for sure, though, simplicity often wins in the long run. After the
initial amazement is gone, it‚Äôs the function that quietly does the job that most
people need.</p>

<h2 id="react-vs-vanilla-javascript">React vs. vanilla JavaScript</h2>

<p>This is a classic example I love to <a href="https://justfuckingusehtml.com/">rant about</a>.</p>

<p>React piles concepts into your mental backpack: rendering models, hooks, state
libraries, routing, and a build pipeline. Say no to it, and suddenly you‚Äôre the
‚Äúneckbeard stuck in the ‚Äô90s,‚Äù outside the cool-kids club.</p>

<p>The simple alternative is just around the corner: sprinkle vanilla JavaScript
where it‚Äôs needed and don‚Äôt build your identity around a framework. That mindset
is hard to swallow, though (especially when companies have spent millions
convincing developers their stack is the only way forward).</p>

<h2 id="beyond-marketing-why-we-embrace-complexity">Beyond marketing: why we embrace complexity</h2>

<p>While marketing glorifies and normalizes complexity, several deeper, more innate
forces draw us developers toward it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The creative temptation:</strong> We are problem-solvers by nature. Building a
complex, intricate system is a rewarding intellectual challenge, akin to
solving a magnificent puzzle. The temptation to over-engineer is a powerful
siren song when we‚Äôre flexing our creative muscles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Legacy systems and technical debt:</strong> Many projects inherit convoluted
codebases. Adding new features often means piling on more complexity rather
than simplifying, as time and budget constraints prioritize quick fixes over
elegant, simple solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Team dynamics and collaboration:</strong> In large teams, developers add layers of
abstraction to make code ‚Äúfuture-proof‚Äù or accommodate diverse requirements.
This can lead to over-engineered solutions as each contributor adds their own
signature, creating a complex whole that no single person fully understands.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pressure to innovate:</strong> In a competitive tech landscape, there‚Äôs a constant
pressure to differentiate. Novelty and innovation are often expressed through
new features and intricate designs, making complexity an easy, if not always
effective, way to stand out.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="build-pyramids-with-purpose">Build pyramids with purpose</h2>

<p>Build pyramids if you must, but build them like the Egyptians did: with a clear
purpose, a solid foundation, and chambers that actually contain something of
value - not just hollow, maze-like passages that future archaeologists (or the
poor soul maintaining your code in two years) will curse.</p>

<p>So next time you find yourself coding a 500-line abstraction for something that
could be copy-pasted a few times and done in 50 lines, ask yourself: are you
solving a real problem for the users and maintainers‚Ä¶ or just indulging in
intellectual masturbation?</p>

<p>
The author <a href="http://www.raybradbury.com/">Ray Bradbury</a> is
one of the early science fiction authors that moved science fiction
into a literary form.  As a writer Bradbury constructs beautifully
written stories and novels.  Bradbury's writing is in stark contrast
to Bradbury as a speaker.  The first time I heard Ray Bradbury speak
was at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) yearly conference
in Los Angeles in the 1980s.  Hearing Bradbury speak is an almost
painful experience.  The pictures that Bradbury can paint with the
written word seem to be entirely missing when Bradbury speaks.  He is
halting, awkward and does not seem to know where he wants to go
in his talk.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to Bradbury, listenting to William Gibson has the feel of
his written work.  The same complex world view and sentence structure
is there, although not as finely edited.  An example of this can be
found in the documentary made about William Gibson, <a href="http://www.nomaps.com/"><i>No Maps for these Territories</i></a>.
This documentary includes extensive interviews with William Gibson.
<i>No Maps</i> also provides a glimpse of the way Gibson looks at the
interconnections and relationships in the world around us.  This view
of Gibson's mind shows us his genius.
</p>

<p>
The mirror between William Gibson's spoken voice and his written voice
gives special force to his readings of his work.  Early in his career
Gibson did an abridged reading of <i>Neuromancer</i>, his first novel
and the work that made him famous.  It was in this novel that Gibson
coined the term <i>cyberspace</i>.  This reading was only published on
audio-tape and is now out of print.
</p>

<p>
I hate the idea that Gibson's wonderful reading of <i>Neuromancer</i>
should be lost or inaccessable.  I was only able to hear it because
the Mountain View (California) Library had a copy.  Fortunately I've
been able to find an MP3 copy of these audio tapes.  They can be
downloaded below.
</p>

<p>
I am only providing these MP3s because the original has been out of
print for years.  As a software engineer I believe that I should be
paid for my work.  If I hold this view then it is only reasonable that
I should also believe that artist should be paid for their work.  All
of the software and music I own I have paid for (or is open source).
I would prefer that the publisher re-issue the audio-tape of William
Gibson's reading in a more modern format (perhaps CD) and that William
Gibson collect royalties on this work.  Gibson's reading has been out
of print so long that I can only assume that this is unlikely to
happen.
</p>

<p>
If you're a fan of William Gibson I hope that others will mirror these
files as well so that they will never be lost.
</p>
<p>
This reading was published on four magnetic tape audio cassetts.
These have been re-recorded in MP3 format:

Neuromancer is one of the few books that I've read many times.  All of

            </div>
          <p><strong>By Park Hyun, editorial writer</strong></p><p>While many would have you believe that the fiasco involving over 300 Korean workers being arrested and detained by US immigration authorities has been resolved by allowing the workers to ‚Äúvoluntarily depart‚Äù back to Korea, this is far from the truth. Korea as a nation was deeply shocked to witness our workers, who had traveled to the US to work at the request of American investors, shackled at their hands and feet with chains. This barbaric incident will leave a lasting stain on Korea-US relations.</p><p>The mass arrests are undoubtedly a wake-up call, a major rupture that opens our eyes to what is happening in the US at this moment. We must heed this warning to close the loopholes and traps in our investment projects with the US. Otherwise, we may eventually face even greater calamity.</p><p>To understand what‚Äôs at the core of this situation, we must revisit the ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù movement championed by US President Donald Trump. MAGA represents a reactionary movement by white evangelical forces seeking to revert America to a time before the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Its core supporters are low-income, poorly educated white Americans and evangelical Protestants. Trump has become a voice amplifying the anxieties of these groups, whose societal status has been shaken by job losses due to globalization, deepening economic polarization, and a surge in immigration. Trump has incited them to channel their anger toward the established elite and ‚Äúoutsiders,‚Äù such as people of color, undocumented immigrants, and Muslims.</p><p>Trump is fundamentally a populist and white supremacist. His slogan of ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù would be phrased more accurately as ‚ÄúMake White America Great Again.‚Äù His insistence on imposing a 50% tariff specifically on steel and aluminum stems from the fact that white, Protestant populations are concentrated in the American Rust Belt.</p><p>The massive crackdown on allegedly undocumented immigrants at the Hyundai-LG Energy Solution plant in Georgia must also be understood within this context. The sight of our workers being led out in chains resembles images of African slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries being dragged out by their owners. The Department of Homeland Security boasted that the raid was ‚Äúthe largest single-site enforcement operation in [its] history,‚Äù and Immigration and Customs Enforcement even brazenly released footage of the operation ‚Äî which clearly risks human rights violations ‚Äî as if to flaunt these arrests as their achievement.</p><p>Far-right white Americans may have rejoiced inwardly at this incident. Even politicians like the governor of Georgia and local lawmakers, who had previously been enthusiastic about hosting the factory, have abruptly changed their stance and joined the chorus of discontent. This shift is likely because it‚Äôs difficult to ignore the anti-immigrant sentiment among Americans born into citizenship. The US is in the grip of an irrational frenzy, reminiscent of the McCarthyism that swept through American society in the 1950s. The US could have resolved this visa issue diplomatically by giving Korea advance notice as an ally. Yet, the crackdown ‚Äî complete with helicopters and armored vehicles, as if to gleefully flaunt their power ‚Äî can only be explained as a political performance.</p><p>The Trump administration‚Äôs plan to revive manufacturing in America is a strategy deeply influenced by political calculations rather than economic logic. Having stoked the discontent of the white working class in the Rust Belt to win his presidency, Trump has a strong motive to continue exploiting them politically. While he, as a political leader, may attempt to pursue such policies, these efforts amount to little more than wishful thinking. Historically, such attempts have rarely succeeded. If they had, why did the British Empire, once called a territory where the sun never sets, crumble over time?</p><p>Declining industries inevitably relocate to emerging nations over time. Even in Korea, we face difficulties in reviving such industries. How much more challenging would it be for the US, where production costs are at least 30% higher than ours, and over two decades of hollowing-out in manufacturing have collapsed the industrial ecosystem? Trump is dreaming a delusional fantasy of using imperial might to forcibly mobilize allies and reverse this trend. To make matters worse, treating allied workers who are trying their best to assist in realizing this pipe dream as if they are slaves of a vassal state will jeopardize even those projects that had some potential. We‚Äôre currently watching the US foolishly shoot itself in the foot.</p><p>This incident should prompt us in Korea to comprehensively reassess our investment projects in the US. We agreed to a tariff deal during a transitional period when President Lee Jae Myung had just taken office. Trump‚Äôs aggressive tactics forced us to follow Japan‚Äôs lead, but we must now take a cold, hard look at the specifics of what we agreed to. The US made outrageous demands on Japan: execute US$550 billion in investments within Trump‚Äôs term, provide funds within 45 days if Trump orders it, and hand over 50%-90% of profits to the US. Reports say the US is now making identical demands of us.</p><p>Following the footsteps of Japan, the world‚Äôs third-largest economy and a quasi-reserve currency nation, could poison our own economy. Rather than yielding to America‚Äôs unreasonable demands to avert an immediate crisis, the government must clearly distinguish what we can and cannot do and negotiate with the US. We must bear in mind that even if the manufacturing revival fails, the US, as the world‚Äôs largest economy and reserve currency holder, will likely suffer little harm. Our economy, on the other hand, could be severely shaken by a major shock.</p><p>Please direct questions or comments to [<a href="mailto:english@hani.co.kr">english@hani.co.kr</a>]</p></div></div>]]></description>

Here's the $15 Billion Lesson Every Restaurateur Must Learn.</strong></p><p>A ghost kitchen stripped away everything you think makes a restaurant a restaurant. No dining room. No servers. No storefront. No customers walking through the door. Just a kitchen. Four walls. Commercial equipment. And a phone that never stops ringing with delivery orders.</p><p>Ghost kitchens exist only in the digital world. Customers find them on DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub. They order through an app. Food gets cooked in a shared commercial space. A driver picks it up. 30 minutes later, it shows up at your door in a paper bag.</p><p>The kitchen itself operates like a factory assembly line. One space prepares food for multiple virtual restaurant brands¬≥. The same cook making your "authentic" Italian pasta also flips burgers for a completely different brand name. Then switches to preparing tacos for a third virtual restaurant. All from the same kitchen. All with different logos on the delivery apps.</p><p>These facilities rent space in industrial areas where the rent costs less. No need for prime real estate. No foot traffic required. No parking spaces. No bathroom maintenance. No dining room cleaning.</p><p>The promise sounded perfect. Lower costs. Higher profits. Multiple revenue streams from one location.</p><p>The numbers, however, tell the brutal story of the Ghost kitchen. Companies raised over $3 billion in venture capital from 2020 to 2022¬π. Today, their leaders are shutting down, pivoting away from physical operations, or laying off staff in waves.</p><p>You were sold efficiency. You got financial ruin.</p><p><strong>The Collapse of the Ghost Kitchen Giants</strong></p><p><span>Kitchen United raised $100 million in July 2022, including funding from grocery giant Kroger¬≤. Fifteen months later, the company shut down all eight of its Kroger locations¬≤. That represented 44% of Kitchen United's entire 18-unit footprint¬≤. The company then announced it would sell or close every remaining physical location and pivot to "software only"</span><sup>3</sup><span>.</span></p><p>Translation: We burned through $100 million and have nothing left to show for it.</p><p><span>CloudKitchens raised $850 million in November 2021 at a $15 billion valuation from investors including Microsoft</span><sup>4</sup><span>. By early 2023, the company's facilities were running at only 50% occupancy</span><sup>3</sup><span>. Internal data showed that 41 out of 71 restaurants at five CloudKitchens locations closed within one year</span><sup>3</sup><span>. That's a 58% failure rate.</span></p><p><span>The company responded with staff layoffs and location closures throughout 2023</span><sup>5</sup><span>.</span></p><p><span>Nextbite endured three rounds of layoffs within 14 months before selling to competitor Sam Nazarian</span><sup>4</sup><span>. Celebrity-backed brands like Hotbox by Wiz Khalifa and George Lopez Tacos generated terrible reviews and vanishing sales.</span></p><p><span>Reef lost its partnership with Wendy's after promising 700 delivery kitchen locations</span><sup>5</sup><span>. The deal that was supposed to define the industry's future collapsed completely.</span></p><p><strong>The Hidden Economics That Killed Profitability</strong></p><p><span>Ghost kitchens promised lower costs. The math never worked. Delivery apps charge restaurants up to 30% commission fees</span><sup>5</sup><span>. Ghost kitchen operators add rent plus percentage fees on top. Equipment repairs and maintenance create constant expenses. Marketing costs multiply when you have no storefront presence.</span></p><p>Layering these costs together, restaurants discovered a devastating truth: there wasn't enough money left for anyone to make a profit.</p><p>Quality control became impossible. Shared kitchen facilities meant that one staff member prepared food for multiple brands simultaneously. No ownership. No accountability. Just assembly-line cooking with zero connection to customers.</p><p>When food arrived cold or wrong, customers had no relationship with the brand to forgive mistakes. No loyal regulars. No servers to smooth over problems. Just angry reviews that destroyed virtual brands forever. No reason for repeat business.</p><p><strong>The Numbers Behind the Collapse</strong></p><p><span>The global ghost kitchen market was valued at $58.61 billion in 2022</span><sup>5</sup><span>. Industry projections show growth to $177.85 billion by 2032</span><sup>5</sup><span>. But these projections ignore the operational reality killing companies today.</span></p><p><span>Approximately 7,606 ghost kitchen operations remain active across the United States</span><sup>5</sup><span>. This sounds substantial until you realize how many have closed, pivoted, or failed in the past two years.</span></p><p><span>The highest-performing ghost kitchens report profit margins between 10-30%</span><sup>5</sup><span>. Traditional restaurants typically see margins of 3-5%</span><sup>5</sup><span>. But these numbers ignore the failure rates. When 58% of restaurants in your facility close within twelve months, your occupancy and revenue collapse.</span></p><p><strong>Quality Became the Fatal Flaw</strong></p><p>Food that travels well requires different recipes, different ingredients, different packaging. Most restaurants never figured this out. Ghost kitchens became synonymous with disappointing food experiences.</p><p><span>Virtual brands with celebrity names generated initial curiosity. But customers who ordered Packed Bowls by Wiz Khalifa once rarely reordered after experiencing cold food and small portions</span><sup>5</sup><span>. One Cincinnati operator threw away half his stock of Wiz Khalifa ingredients because customers wouldn't come back</span><sup>5</sup><span>.</span></p><p>The first lesson is that name recognition without quality execution equals business failure.</p><p><strong>There Is No Connection</strong></p><p>When you remove the human connection between restaurant and customer, you remove everything that makes people loyal to restaurants. When food travels twenty minutes in a bag, quality suffers. When customers have problems, there's no manager to smooth things over.</p><p>Ghost kitchens became digital fast food factories. Anonymous. Disposable. Forgettable.</p><p>The second lesson is that restaurants aren't just about food. They're about places. People. Experiences. Community.</p><p><strong>What Actually Works</strong></p><p>Focus on your core restaurant first. Make it profitable. Build loyal customers. Control your kitchen. Control your quality. Build a human connection.</p><p>If you want to expand, open a second location. Own or lease the space directly. Build your brand in the community. Skip the middleman operators. Skip the celebrity partnerships. Skip the virtual brands with made-up names.</p><p>The restaurant business has no shortcuts. It never did. It never will.</p><p>The $15 billion lesson is that real restaurants serve real customers in real locations, with real people. Everything else is just an expensive distraction.</p><p>Build something real instead.</p><p>#RestaurantBusiness #GhostKitchens #RestaurantStrategy #FoodDelivery #RestaurantManagement</p><p>Footnotes</p><p>1.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="preface">Preface<a href="#preface" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>This article is <em>NOT</em> served from a web server running on a disposable vape. If you want to see the real deal, click <a href="http://ewaste.fka.wtf/">here</a>. The content is otherwise identical.</p><h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>For a couple of years now, I have been collecting disposable vapes from friends and family. Initially, I only salvaged the batteries for ‚Äúfuture‚Äù projects (It‚Äôs not hoarding, I promise), but recently, disposable vapes have gotten more advanced. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be the lawyer who one day will have to argue how a device with USB C and a rechargeable battery can be classified as ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù. Thankfully, I don‚Äôt plan on pursuing law anytime soon.</p><p>Last year, I was tearing apart some of these fancier pacifiers for adults when I noticed something that caught my eye, instead of the expected black blob of goo hiding some ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) I see a little integrated circuit inscribed ‚ÄúPUYA‚Äù.
I don‚Äôt blame you if this name doesn‚Äôt excite you as much it does me, most people have never heard of them. They are most well known for their flash chips, but I first came across them after reading Jay Carlson‚Äôs blog post about <a href="https://jaycarlson.net/2023/02/04/the-cheapest-flash-microcontroller-you-can-buy-is-actually-an-arm-cortex-m0/">the cheapest flash microcontroller you can buy</a>. They are quite capable little ARM Cortex-M0+ micros.</p><p>Over the past year I have collected quite a few of these PY32 based vapes, all of them from different models of vape from the same manufacturer. It‚Äôs not my place to do free advertising for big tobacco, so I won‚Äôt mention the brand I got it from, but if anyone who worked on designing them reads this, thanks for labeling the debug pins!</p><h2 id="what-are-we-working-with">What are we working with<a href="#what-are-we-working-with" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The chip is marked <code>PUYA C642F15</code>, which wasn‚Äôt very helpful. I was pretty sure it was a <code>PY32F002A</code>, but after poking around with <a href="http://pyocd.io/">pyOCD</a>, I noticed that the flash was 24k and we have 3k of RAM. The extra flash meant that it was more likely a <code>PY32F002B</code>, which is actually a very different chip.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>So here are the specs of a microcontroller so <em>bad</em>, it‚Äôs basically disposable:</p><ul><li>24MHz Coretex M0+</li><li>24KiB of Flash Storage</li><li>3KiB of Static RAM</li><li>a few peripherals, none of which we will use.</li></ul><p>You may look at those specs and think that it‚Äôs not much to work with. I don‚Äôt blame you, a 10y old phone can barely load google, and this is about 100x slower. I on the other hand see a <em>blazingly</em> fast web server.</p><h2 id="getting-online">Getting online<a href="#getting-online" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The idea of hosting a web server on a vape didn‚Äôt come to me instantly. In fact, I have been playing around with them for a while, but after writing my post on <a href="https://bogdanthegeek.github.io/blog/insights/jlink-rtt-for-the-masses/">semihosting</a>, the penny dropped.</p><p>If you don‚Äôt feel like reading that article, semihosting is basically syscalls for embedded ARM microcontrollers. You throw some values/pointers into some registers and call a breakpoint instruction. An attached debugger interprets the values in the registers and performs certain actions. Most people just use this to get some logs printed from the microcontroller, but they are actually bi-directional.</p><p>If you are older than me, you might remember a time before Wi-Fi and Ethernet, the dark ages, when you had to use dial-up modems to get online. You might also know that the ghosts of those modems still linger all around us. Almost all USB serial devices actually emulate those modems: a 56k modem is just 57600 baud serial device. Data between some of these modems was transmitted using a protocol called SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>This may not come as a surprise, but Linux (and with some tweaking even macOS) supports SLIP. The <code>slattach</code> utility can make any <code>/dev/tty*</code> send and receive IP packets. All we have to do is put the data down the wire in the right format and provide a virtual tty.
This is actually easier than you might imagine, pyOCD can forward all semihosting though a telnet port. Then, we use <code>socat</code> to link that port to a virtual tty:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>pyocd gdb -S -O semihost_console_type<span>=</span>telnet -T <span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>PYOCDFLAGS<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>socat PTY,link<span>=</span><span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span>,raw,echo<span>=</span><span>0</span> TCP:localhost:<span>$(</span>PORT<span>)</span>,nodelay &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo slattach -L -p slip -s <span>115200</span> <span>$(</span>TTY<span>)</span> &amp;
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip addr add 192.168.190.1 peer 192.168.190.2/24 dev sl0
</span></span><span><span>sudo ip link set mtu <span>1500</span> up dev sl0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Ok, so we have a ‚Äúmodem‚Äù, but that‚Äôs hardly a web server. To actually talk TCP/IP, we need an IP stack. There are many choices, but I went with <a href="https://github.com/adamdunkels/uip/tree/uip-0-9">uIP</a> because it‚Äôs pretty small, doesn‚Äôt require an RTOS, and it‚Äôs easy to port to other platforms.
It also, helpfully, comes with a very minimal HTTP server example.</p><p>After porting the SLIP code to use semihosting, I had a working web server‚Ä¶half of the time.
As with most highly optimised libraries, uIP was designed for 8 and 16-bit machines, which rarely have memory alignment requirements. On ARM however, if you dereference a <code>u16 *</code>, you better hope that address is even, or you‚Äôll get an exception. The <code>uip_chksum</code> assumed <code>u16</code> alignment, but the script that creates the filesystem didn‚Äôt.
I actually decided to modify a bit the structure of the filesystem to make it a bit more portable.
This was my first time working with <code>perl</code> and I have to say, it‚Äôs quite well suited to this kind of task.</p><h2 id="blazingly-fast">Blazingly fast<a href="#blazingly-fast" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>So how fast is a web server running on a disposable microcontroller. Well, initially, not very fast. Pings took ~1.5s with 50% packet loss and a simple page took over 20s to load. That‚Äôs so bad, it‚Äôs actually funny, and I kind of wanted to leave it there.</p><p>However, the problem was actually between the seat and the steering wheel the whole time. The first implementation read and wrote a single character at a time, which had a massive overhead associated with it. I previously benchmarked semihosting on this device, and I was getting ~20KiB/s, but uIP‚Äôs SLIP implementation was designed for very low memory devices, so it was serialising the data byte by byte.
We have a whopping 3kiB of RAM to play with, so I added a ring buffer to cache reads from the host and feed them into the SLIP poll function. I also split writes in batches to allow for escaping.</p><p>Now this is what I call blazingly fast! Pings now take 20ms, no packet loss and a full page loads in about 160ms. This was using using almost all of the RAM, but I could also dial down the sizes of the buffer to have more than enough headroom to run other tasks. The project repo has everything set to a nice balance latency and RAM usage:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
           FLASH:        5116 B        24 KB     20.82%
             RAM:        1380 B         3 KB     44.92%
</code></pre><p>For this blog however, I paid for none of the RAM, so I‚Äôll use all of the RAM.</p><p>As you may have noticed, we have just under 20kiB (80%) of storage space. That may not be enough to ship all of React, but as you can see, it‚Äôs more than enough to host this entire blog post.
And this is not just a static page server, you can run any server-side code you want, if you know C that is.</p><p>Just for fun, I added a json api endpoint to get the number of requests to the main page (since the last crash) and the unique ID of the microcontroller.</p><h2 id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/BogdanTheGeek/semihost-ip">Code for this project</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/react-won-by-default/">https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/react-won-by-default/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45252715">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-dmqsi53g="">  <article data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk="">  <div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> 
<p>React is no longer winning by technical merit. Today it is winning by default. That default is now slowing innovation across the frontend ecosystem.</p>
<p>When teams need a new frontend, the conversation rarely starts with ‚ÄúWhat are the constraints and which tool best fits them?‚Äù It often starts with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs use React; everyone knows React.‚Äù That reflex creates a self-perpetuating cycle where network effects, rather than technical fit, decide architecture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, frameworks with real innovations struggle for adoption. Svelte compiles away framework overhead. Solid delivers fine-grained reactivity without virtual-DOM tax. Qwik achieves instant startup via resumability. These approaches can outperform React‚Äôs model in common scenarios, but they rarely get a fair evaluation because React is chosen by default.</p>
<p>React is excellent at many things. The problem isn‚Äôt React itself, it‚Äôs the React-by-default mindset.</p>
<h2 id="the-innovation-ceiling">The Innovation Ceiling</h2>
<p>React‚Äôs technical foundations explain some of today‚Äôs friction. The virtual DOM was a clever solution for 2013‚Äôs problems, but as Rich Harris outlined in <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead">‚ÄúVirtual DOM is pure overhead‚Äù</a>, it introduces work modern compilers can often avoid.</p>
<p>Hooks addressed class component pain but introduced new kinds of complexity: dependency arrays, stale closures, and misused effects. Even React‚Äôs own docs emphasize restraint: <a href="https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect">‚ÄúYou Might Not Need an Effect‚Äù</a>. Server Components improve time-to-first-byte, but add architectural complexity and new failure modes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler">React Compiler</a> is a smart solution that automates patterns like <code>useMemo</code>/<code>useCallback</code>. Its existence is also a signal: we‚Äôre optimizing around constraints baked into the model.</p>
<p>Contrast this with alternative approaches: Svelte 5‚Äôs <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/runes">Runes</a> simplify reactivity at compile time; Solid‚Äôs <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest#reactivity">fine-grained reactivity</a> updates exactly what changed; Qwik‚Äôs <a href="https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable/">resumability</a> eliminates traditional hydration. These aren‚Äôt incremental tweaks to React‚Äôs model‚Äîthey‚Äôre different models with different ceilings.</p>
<p>Innovation without adoption doesn‚Äôt change outcomes. Adoption can‚Äôt happen when the choice is made by reflex.</p>
<h2 id="the-technical-debt-were-all-carrying">The Technical Debt We‚Äôre All Carrying</h2>
<p>Defaulting to React often ships a runtime and reconciliation cost we no longer question. Even when it‚Äôs fast enough, the ceiling is lower than compile-time or fine-grained models. Developer time is spent managing re-renders, effect dependencies, and hydration boundaries instead of shipping value. The broader lesson from performance research is consistent: JavaScript is expensive on the critical path (<a href="https://medium.com/dev-channel/the-cost-of-javascript-84009f51e99e">The Cost of JavaScript</a>).</p>
<p>We‚Äôve centered mental models around ‚ÄúReact patterns‚Äù instead of web fundamentals, reducing portability of skills and making architectural inertia more likely.</p>
<p>The loss isn‚Äôt just performance, it‚Äôs opportunity cost when better-fit alternatives are never evaluated. For instance, benchmarks like the <a href="https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/">JS Framework Benchmark</a> show alternatives like Solid achieving up to 2-3x faster updates in reactivity-heavy scenarios compared to React.</p>
<h2 id="the-frameworks-being-suffocated">The Frameworks Being Suffocated</h2>
<h3 id="svelte-the-compiler-revolution">Svelte: The Compiler Revolution</h3>
<p>Svelte shifts work to compile time: no virtual DOM, minimal runtime. Components become targeted DOM operations. The mental model aligns with web fundamentals.</p>
<p>But ‚Äúnot enough jobs‚Äù keeps Svelte adoption artificially low despite its technical superiority for most use cases. Real-world examples, like The Guardian‚Äôs adoption of Svelte for their frontend, demonstrate measurable gains in performance and developer productivity, with reported reductions in bundle sizes and faster load times. For instance, as detailed in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/javascript-framework-puts-web-pages-diet/">Wired‚Äôs article on Svelte</a>, developer Shawn Wang (<a href="https://x.com/swyx">@swyx</a> on X/Twitter) reduced his site‚Äôs size from 187KB in React to just 9KB in Svelte by leveraging its compile-time optimizations, which shift framework overhead away from runtime. This leads to faster, more efficient apps especially on slow connections.</p>
<h3 id="solid-the-reactive-primitive-approach">Solid: The Reactive Primitive Approach</h3>
<p>Solid delivers fine-grained reactivity with JSX familiarity. Updates flow through signals directly to affected DOM nodes, bypassing reconciliation bottlenecks. Strong performance characteristics, limited mindshare. As outlined in Solid‚Äôs <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/guides/comparison">comparison guide</a>, this approach enables more efficient updates than React‚Äôs virtual DOM, with precise reactivity that minimizes unnecessary work and improves developer experience through simpler state management.</p>
<p>While prominent case studies are scarcer than for more established frameworks, this is largely due to Solid‚Äôs lower adoption. Yet anecdotal reports from early adopters suggest similar transformative gains in update efficiency and code simplicity, waiting to be scaled and shared as more teams experiment.</p>
<h3 id="qwik-the-resumability-innovation">Qwik: The Resumability Innovation</h3>
<p>Qwik uses resumability instead of hydration, enabling instant startup by loading only what the current interaction needs. Ideal for large sites, long sessions, or slow networks. According to Qwik‚Äôs <a href="https://qwik.dev/docs/concepts/think-qwik/">Think Qwik guide</a>, this is achieved through progressive loading and serializing both state and code. Apps can thus resume execution instantly without heavy client-side bootstrapping, resulting in superior scalability and reduced initial load times compared to traditional frameworks.</p>
<p>Success stories for Qwik may be less visible simply because fewer teams have broken from defaults to try it. But those who have report dramatic improvements in startup times and resource efficiency, indicating a wealth of untapped potential if adoption grows.</p>
<p>All three under-adopted not for lack of merit, but because the default choice blocks trying them out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, React‚Äôs API surface area is notably larger and more complex than its alternatives, encompassing concepts like hooks, context, reducers, and memoization patterns that require careful management to avoid pitfalls. This expansive API contributes to higher cognitive load for developers, often leading to bugs from misunderstood dependencies or over-engineering. For example, in Cloudflare‚Äôs <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-dive-into-cloudflares-sept-12-dashboard-and-api-outage/">September 12, 2025 outage</a>, a useEffect hook with a problematic dependency array triggered repeated API calls, overwhelming their Tenant Service and causing widespread failures. In contrast, frameworks like Svelte, Solid, and Qwik feature smaller, more focused APIs that emphasize simplicity and web fundamentals, reducing the mental overhead and making them easier to master and maintain.</p>
<h2 id="the-network-effect-prison">The Network Effect Prison</h2>
<p>React‚Äôs dominance creates self-reinforcing barriers. Job postings ask for ‚ÄúReact developers‚Äù rather than ‚Äúfrontend engineers,‚Äù limiting skill diversity. Component libraries and team muscle memory create institutional inertia.</p>
<p>Risk-averse leaders choose the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù option. Schools teach what jobs ask for. The cycle continues independent of technical merit.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not healthy competition; it‚Äôs ecosystem capture by default.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-the-network-effect">Breaking the Network Effect</h2>
<p>Escaping requires deliberate action at multiple levels. Technical leaders should choose based on constraints and merits, not momentum. Companies can allocate a small innovation budget to trying alternatives. Developers can upskill beyond a single mental model.</p>
<p>Educators can teach framework-agnostic concepts alongside specific tools. Open source contributors can help alternative ecosystems mature.</p>
<p>Change won‚Äôt happen automatically. It requires conscious choice.</p>
<h2 id="framework-evaluation-checklist">Framework Evaluation Checklist</h2>
<p>To make deliberate choices, use this simple checklist when starting a new project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess Performance Needs</strong>: Evaluate metrics like startup time, update efficiency, and bundle size. Prioritize frameworks with compile-time optimizations if speed is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Team Skills and Learning Curve</strong>: Consider existing expertise but factor in migration paths; many alternatives offer gentle ramps (e.g., Solid‚Äôs JSX compatibility with React).</li>
<li><strong>Scaling and Cost of Ownership</strong>: Calculate long-term costs, including maintenance, dependency management, and tech debt. Alternatives often reduce runtime overhead, lowering hosting costs and improving scalability.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem Fit</strong>: Balance maturity with innovation; pilot in non-critical areas to test migration feasibility and ROI.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-standard-counterarguments">The Standard Counter‚ÄëArguments</h2>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut ecosystem maturity!‚Äù</strong> Maturity is valuable, and can also entrench inertia. Age isn‚Äôt the same as fitness for today‚Äôs constraints.</p>
<p>Additionally, a mature ecosystem often means heavy reliance on third-party packages, which can introduce maintenance burdens like keeping dependencies up-to-date, dealing with security vulnerabilities, and bloating bundles with unused code. While essential in some cases, this flexibility can lead to over-dependence; custom solutions tailored to specific needs are often leaner and more maintainable in the long run. Smaller ecosystems in alternative frameworks encourage building from fundamentals, fostering deeper understanding and less technical debt. Moreover, with AI coding assistants now able to generate precise, custom functions on demand, the barrier to creating bespoke utilities has lowered dramatically. This makes it feasible to avoid generic libraries like lodash or date libraries like Moment or date-fns entirely in favor of lightweight, app-specific implementations.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut hiring!‚Äù</strong> Hiring follows demand. You can de‚Äërisk by piloting alternatives in non‚Äëcritical paths, then hiring for fundamentals plus on‚Äëthe‚Äëjob training.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut component libraries!‚Äù</strong> Framework‚Äëagnostic design systems and Web Components reduce lock-in while preserving velocity.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut stability!‚Äù</strong> React‚Äôs evolution from classes to hooks to Server Components demonstrates constant churn, not stability.
Alternative frameworks often provide more consistent APIs.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut proven at scale!‚Äù</strong> jQuery was proven at scale too. Past
success doesn‚Äôt guarantee future relevance.</p>
<h2 id="the-broader-ecosystem-harm">The Broader Ecosystem Harm</h2>
<p>Monoculture slows web evolution when one framework‚Äôs constraints become de facto limits. Talent spends cycles solving framework-specific issues rather than pushing the platform forward. Investment follows incumbents regardless of technical merit.</p>
<p>Curricula optimize for immediate employability over fundamentals, creating framework-specific rather than transferable skills. Platform improvements get delayed because ‚ÄúReact can handle it‚Äù becomes a default answer.</p>
<p>The entire ecosystem suffers when diversity disappears.</p>
<h2 id="the-garden-we-could-grow">The Garden We Could Grow</h2>
<p>Healthy ecosystems require diversity, not monocultures. Innovation emerges when different approaches compete and cross-pollinate. Developers grow by learning multiple mental models. The platform improves when several frameworks push different boundaries.</p>
<p>Betting everything on one model creates a single point of failure. What happens if it hits hard limits? What opportunities are we missing by not exploring alternatives?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs time to choose frameworks based on constraints and merit rather than momentum. Your next project deserves better than React-by-default. The ecosystem deserves the innovation only diversity can provide.</p>
<p>Stop planting the same seed by default. The garden we could cultivate through diverse framework exploration would be more resilient and more innovative than the monoculture we‚Äôve drifted into.</p>
<p>The choice is ours to make.</p> </div>  </article>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>After a pair of federal judges in Tennessee had cleared the way for <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/will-the-supreme-court-stop-donald-trump">Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a</a> to be released from pretrial detention, on August 22nd, so that he could spend a couple of days with his family before a scheduled check-in at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore, he was taken directly to a nearby hotel. The first thing he did was change into a new set of clothes that his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, had bought for him. Then he was given some flowers and ushered into a small room where Vasquez, their three children, other relatives, and supporters were waiting. He picked up his youngest son as people chanted, ‚Äú<em>¬°S√≠, se pudo!</em>‚Äù‚Äîsomething like ‚ÄúYes, we did!‚Äù</p><p>The child had been in a car with √Åbrego Garc√≠a when <em>ICE</em> arrested him, near their home in Maryland, on March 12th. The arrest occurred during the government‚Äôs scramble to fly hundreds of people‚Äî<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/15/enemies-of-the-state">mostly Venezuelans</a> it claimed were members of the Tren de Aragua gang‚Äîto be incarcerated in El Salvador‚Äôs notorious <em>CECOT</em> prison, under the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act. (A federal appeals court in New Orleans has since ruled that President <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> had improperly invoked the law.) Days later, √Åbrego Garc√≠a, a Salvadoran native, was sent to <em>CECOT</em> on a plane with some of them, beginning one of the highest-profile campaigns of retribution against an individual person of Trump‚Äôs second term.</p><p>On March 24th, lawyers for √Åbrego Garc√≠a and his family filed a civil lawsuit demanding his return, and the courts quickly ruled that he had been deported in error. His entanglement with <em>ICE</em> had begun six years earlier, in March, 2019, when the Prince George‚Äôs County police department, in Maryland, arrested him and three other day laborers outside a Home Depot. (More recently, he has been employed as a sheet-metal worker.) He sought asylum and the right to not be refouled, or forcibly returned to a place where one is subject to persecution‚Äîin his case, to El Salvador. An immigration judge in Baltimore denied him the asylum request but granted him the latter, in a ‚Äúwithholding of removal,‚Äù which allowed him to work in the U.S. without risk of being sent back to his home country. The judge found that he had a ‚Äúwell-founded fear‚Äù of persecution there, on account of official corruption and a history of extortionist demands and death threats from a local gang, against both him and his family, who ran a pupusa business.</p><p>Eduardo Zelaya, a Salvadoran organizer with <em>CASA</em>‚Äîone of the immigrants‚Äô-rights organizations that, alongside a team of immigration lawyers, has been advocating for √Åbrego Garc√≠a‚Äôs freedom since March‚Äîwas with him in Tennessee. ‚ÄúSeeing the family reunified felt like a victory,‚Äù he told me in Spanish. ‚ÄúBut, at the same time, it felt like the beginning of a battle.‚Äù</p><p>That battle had started during the effort to secure his release. √Åbrego Garc√≠a had finally been returned from El Salvador on June 6th‚Äîbut to Tennessee, not to Maryland, and only once the government had filed a new set of charges, in an indictment, accusing him of unlawfully transporting undocumented immigrants across state lines. The federal magistrate judge in Tennessee handling pretrial matters in the new case, Barbara Holmes, finding that he posed no risk of flight or danger to other people, had ordered him released on June 22nd to await trial. But that release was delayed for two months, as officials, in public and before judges in Maryland and Tennessee, offered shifting explanations as to the government‚Äôs intentions with the indictment. Did the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security want √Åbrego Garc√≠a to face, as Attorney General Pam Bondi has put it, ‚ÄúAmerican justice‚Äù? If so, he‚Äôs presumed innocent until proved otherwise, in a criminal court of law. Or did they want him to face the deportation system right away, and remove him to a country other than El Salvador under the immigration laws? If so, there would be a process for that in immigration court. What the government could not pursue is both courses at once.</p><p>Faced with this legal reality, on the night of Thursday, August 21st, hours before √Åbrego Garc√≠a was to be released, <em>ICE</em> devised a choice for him. He could agree to delay his release until the following Monday, and then be deported to Costa Rica, whose government had just committed to granting him refugee status or residency‚Äîin exchange for pleading guilty to the federal indictment in Tennessee. Or, he could be released as planned, decline the plea offer, report to his scheduled appointment at the <em>ICE</em> field office in Baltimore, and risk being deported this time, inexplicably, to Uganda, if he chose to await trial. His criminal-defense team in Tennessee, which is seeking to have the indictment thrown out as a ‚Äúvindictive and selective prosecution,‚Äù immediately brought this development to the attention of Waverly Crenshaw, the U.S. district judge overseeing the prosecution, stating, ‚ÄúThere can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat.‚Äù (The government has since said that it plans to deport him instead to Eswatini; on Thursday, Reuters reported that the African nation had no knowledge of this arrangement.)</p><p>√Åbrego Garc√≠a preferred to be released as scheduled, and, when he arrived for his <em>ICE</em> appointment in Baltimore, hundreds of supporters were waiting outside, including members of Congress, state and local officials, and faith leaders. ‚ÄúWhen he goes in that building, we‚Äôll be supporting him. We continue to fight. No matter what happens in there today, we got his back,‚Äù Representative Glenn Ivey, of Maryland, said. √Åbrego Garc√≠a read a prepared statement, in Spanish. ‚ÄúI want you to always remember that today I can say with pride that I am free and reunited with my family,‚Äù he said. Moments with his loved ones had given him the ‚Äústrength and hope to continue this fight.‚Äù Speaking of others who have been detained under the Trump Administration, he said, ‚ÄúGod is with us. He will never leave us. He will bring justice to all the injustice they‚Äôve done.‚Äù</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>√Åbrego Garc√≠a and Vasquez, his wife, entered the building. Less than an hour later, she emerged alone, and Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, √Åbrego Garc√≠a‚Äôs lead immigration lawyer, told the crowd that his client had been arrested again. The legal team shortly filed a petition for habeas corpus in Maryland. This was the fourth legal action between √Åbrego Garc√≠a and the U.S. government since 2019, but this new case is different, in that it challenges what supporters describe as the political nature of √Åbrego Garc√≠a‚Äôs rearrest. ‚ÄúThe fact that they‚Äôre holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they‚Äôre weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,‚Äù Sandoval-Moshenberg announced to the crowd. At a hearing later in the week, he stated that √Åbrego Garc√≠a would again seek asylum in the U.S. Paula Xinis, the U.S. district judge in Maryland who had been handling √Åbrego Garc√≠a‚Äôs earlier civil case, returning him from El Salvador, is also handling the new case, and she has prevented the government from taking any action against him until she rules in the dispute, after a hearing scheduled for October 6th.</p><p>Senator Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, who met with √Åbrego Garc√≠a in El Salvador in April, told me that ‚Äúhis case reflects a corruption of the legal process from start to finish.‚Äù The D.H.S. posted a short clip, on X, of √Åbrego Garc√≠a after his arrest at the <em>ICE</em> office, being led away in handcuffs and leg-irons. It was picked up by Fox News and other outlets, creating a viral moment of sorts, on account of two words that √Åbrego Garc√≠a had said, looking into the camera: ‚Äú<em>Gobierno corrupto.</em>‚Äù</p><p>√Åbrego Garc√≠a wasn‚Äôt previously on any of Donald Trump‚Äôs enemies‚Äô lists, but he landed there when he began winning his cases with the federal judiciary. Critical to those wins was the government‚Äôs admission of error in the civil suit he filed in March. Erez Reuveni, a veteran lawyer with the Justice Department‚Äôs Office of Immigration Litigation, was fired after stating during a hearing that √Åbrego Garc√≠a should not have been sent to El Salvador; he later <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/why-a-devoted-justice-department-lawyer-became-a-whistle-blower">became a whistle-blower</a>. Another government official, Robert Cerna, in a separate court filing, wrote that the wrongful refoulement was the result of an ‚Äúadministrative error.‚Äù</p><p>Based on that information, on April 4th, Judge Xinis ordered the government to take steps to return √Åbrego Garc√≠a to the U.S. The Administration challenged her ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld it. So did the Supreme Court, on April 10th, issuing a unanimous, unsigned order that ‚Äúproperly requires the Government to ‚Äòfacilitate‚Äô Abrego Garcia‚Äôs release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.‚Äù</p><p>The Administration, however, stonewalled. Four days after the Supreme Court ruling, at an Oval Office meeting between Trump and the Salvadoran President, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/nayib-bukeles-authoritarian-appeal">Nayib Bukele</a>, a reporter asked, ‚ÄúPresident Trump, do you plan to ask President Bukele to help return the man who your Administration says was mistakenly deported?‚Äù Attorney General Pam Bondi answered for Trump: ‚ÄúIf they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it‚Äîmeaning provide a plane.‚Äù The White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller soon suggested that the Supreme Court had actually ruled in the Administration‚Äôs favor. Then he added, ‚ÄúThat is the President of El Salvador. Your questions about it, per the Court, can only be directed to him.‚Äù A confused-looking Bukele replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the power to return him to the United States.‚Äù</p><p>Judge Xinis and the Fourth Circuit both expressed dismay at the Administration‚Äôs failure to comply. ‚ÄúDefendants appear to have done nothing,‚Äù she wrote in a follow-up order, which allowed √Åbrego Garc√≠a‚Äôs legal team to seek basic information about his status and whereabouts. The U.S. circuit judge J. Harvie Wilkinson, a Reagan appointee, noted Bukele‚Äôs and Trump‚Äôs denials of responsibility. ‚ÄúWe are told that <em>neither</em> government has the power to act,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThe result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.‚Äù</p><p>This months-long standoff has allowed the Administration to escalate its campaign against √Åbrego Garc√≠a in the press and on social media. The President displayed a digitally altered photo of tattoos that √Åbrego Garc√≠a has on one hand, with the characters ‚ÄúMS-13‚Äù superimposed on his knuckles. After his rearrest, Bondi said, ‚ÄúHe will no longer terrorize our country.‚Äù In August, √Åbrego Garc√≠a‚Äôs criminal-defense team asked Judge Crenshaw to issue a gag order against Bondi and Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security Secretary, stating that ‚Äúthe government‚Äôs ongoing barrage of prejudicial statements severely threaten‚Äîand perhaps have already irrevocably impaired‚Äîthe ability to try this case at all‚Äîin any venue.‚Äù</p><p>Members of the Administration have also attacked √Åbrego Garc√≠a based on allegations from various court records and his immigration file. The most sensitive‚Äîwhich they have made repeatedly‚Äîis that √Åbrego Garc√≠a is a ‚Äúwife beater.‚Äù In April, the D.H.S. released records from Prince George‚Äôs County showing that Vasquez had sought temporary court intervention, in 2020 and 2021, after accusing her husband of violence against her; she withdrew one request and didn‚Äôt pursue the other. (They married while he was in detention in 2019; she testified on his behalf while pregnant with their son.) In May, Vasquez, who is a U.S. citizen, said in a statement, ‚ÄúMy husband was traumatized from the time he spent in ICE detention and we were in the throes of COVID. Like many couples, we were caring for our children with barely enough to get by. All of those factors contributed to the actions which caused me to seek the protective order.‚Äù</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Vice-President <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/j-d-vance">J.&nbsp;D.

He was taking nine other passengers, all of whom were Hispanic men, to Maryland, but after a brief inspection he was let go without a traffic ticket. According to the indictment, he was acting in concert with six unnamed co-conspirators. Tennessee authorities have released <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kilmar-abrego-garcia-traffic-stop-tennessee-91bc2890768163671c71eb55420b59ee">video</a> of the traffic stop and confirmed that the federal government declined to take action then, and his lawyers have compiled a list of similar prosecutions in the same jurisdiction where prosecutors did not wait more than two years before bringing an indictment.</p><p>The effort to prepare the case, in fact, was conducted with Joint Task Force Vulcan, a special Justice Department unit formed during Trump‚Äôs first term to build criminal cases against MS-13. When the indictment was made public, Bondi personally thanked the unit, some of whose members, the <em>Times</em> <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/us/politics/trump-ms-13-abrego-garcia.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/us/politics/trump-ms-13-abrego-garcia.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/us/politics/trump-ms-13-abrego-garcia.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported</a>, had no idea who √Åbrego Garc√≠a was until they were enlisted to build the case against him, on April 28th. Among the witnesses the government hopes to put on the stand, and who offered grand-jury testimony, is a man who has been deported five times, and who, for his co√∂peration on the case, has been granted early release from federal prison, where he was serving a thirty-month sentence for human smuggling; he has also been promised deferred action on deportation in exchange for testimony against √Åbrego Garc√≠a, whom he claims to have worked with.</p><p>Around the time that √Åbrego Garc√≠a was indicted, according to <a data-offer-url="https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122&quot;}" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/mistakenly-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-back-us-face/story?id=121333122" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ABC News</a>, Ben Schrader, the head of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, resigned, reportedly because of the indictment‚Äôs politically motivated nature. Without addressing the circumstances of his resignation, Schrader <a data-offer-url="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7331142029277544448/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7331142029277544448/&quot;}" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7331142029277544448/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a> on LinkedIn that, at the Justice Department, ‚Äúthe only job description I‚Äôve ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.‚Äù</p><p>The case has been instructive because the judges handling it, Holmes and Crenshaw, have begun to test some of the evidence the government has gathered so far. They haven‚Äôt shied away from examining the domestic-violence incidents or the uncorroborated claims of gang ties. When weighing whether to release √Åbrego Garc√≠a ahead of trial, Judge Holmes acknowledged that his wife had twice sought orders of protection, but found that this alone did not make him a risk. ‚ÄúThere is no evidence of any similar occurrences since 2021,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúNor any evidence that Ms. Vasquez is anything other than fully supportive of Abrego.‚Äù Holmes likewise discredited the MS-13 accusation, for which prosecutors relied on the testimony of co√∂perating witnesses who either contradicted one another or were otherwise unreliable. In July, Crenshaw, in a second ruling endorsing her findings, was emphatic: ‚ÄúAt bottom, the Government fails to provide any evidence that there is something in Abrego‚Äôs history, or his exhibited characteristics, that warrants detention.‚Äù He did suggest that √Åbrego Garc√≠a will soon be afforded what the Trump Administration has denied him so far: a full and fair trial where he can subject the witnesses against him ‚Äúto a rigorous cross examination.‚Äù</p><p>This kind of scrutiny, which the Constitution demands, may be precisely why the government devised the Uganda option: by coercing √Åbrego Garc√≠a to plead guilty, it might have avoided the burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt, plus all the procedural safeguards that come with a public trial. That proof is what Senator Van Hollen wants to see from the Administration. ‚ÄúShut up on social media,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPut up your evidence in court.‚Äù&nbsp;‚ô¶</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/">https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45251690">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/cover.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I recently bought a cheap Tapo indoor camera to see what my dog gets up to when I am out of the house.</p>
<p>What actually followed? I ended up reverse-engineering onboarding flows, decompiling an APK, MITMing TLS sessions, and writing cryptographic scripts.</p>
<p>My main motivation for this project really stemmed from the fact that the camera annoyed me from day one. Setting the camera up in frigate was quite painful, no one really seemed to know how these cameras worked online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SIDENOTE: If you want 2 way audio to work in frigate you must use the <code>tapo://</code> go2rtc configuration for your main stream instead of the usual <code>rtsp://</code>. TP-Link are lazy and only implement 2 way audio on their own proprietary API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One undocumented behavior that tripped me up was that the device‚Äôs API is supposed to accept credentials <code>admin</code>:<code>&lt;your-tapo-cloud-password&gt;</code> after onboarding. However after banging my head against a wall for a few hours I later discovered that if you change your cloud password after onboarding, paired devices don‚Äôt get the memo üôÇ.</p>
<p>This implied a few things to me that started the cogs turning:</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be a call made during on-boarding that syncs the device password with the cloud password</li>
<li>The device must either allow unauthenticated calls before this step or have some sort of default password.</li>
</ul>
<p>So considering my onboarding woes and the fact that I was starting to recoil every time the tapo app tried to jam a ‚ÄúTapo Care‚Äù subscription down my throat, a cloudless onboarding solution for the device was beginning to look more and more desirable.</p>
<p>The first step to cracking this egg was to be be able to snoop on what the app and the camera are saying to each other during onboarding. E.g, establish a man in the middle.</p>
<h2 id="man-in-the-middle">Man in the middle</h2>
<p>To man in the middle a phone app, you must be able to route all http(s) traffic via a proxy server you control. Historically this has been quite simple to achieve, simply spin up a proxy on a computer, add the proxy‚Äôs self-signed certificate to the phone‚Äôs truststore, and configure the phone to point at the proxy.</p>
<p>However, modern phone apps can use a few nasty tricks to render this approach ineffective. Namely they will blatantly ignore proxies, throw the system truststore to the wind and make liberal use of certificate pinning.</p>
<p>The most full-proof technique for generically MITMing an app has therefore become dynamic instrumentation via tools like <code>frida</code>. What this allows us to do is force an app to use the proxies and certificates that we tell it to whilst batting aside it‚Äôs attempts to do things like certificate pinning.</p>
<p>So the setup ended up looking like this (full setup guide <a href="https://github.com/kennedn/tapo-onboarding?tab=readme-ov-file#capturing-onboarding-calls-from-tapo-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
):</p>

<p>After spinning up <code>mitmproxy</code>, injecting the <a href="https://github.com/httptoolkit/frida-interception-and-unpinning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frida scripts</a>
, and onboarding the camera, we finally see an initial login flow ‚Äî before the admin password ever gets changed:</p>

<p>However, subsequent requests look like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"method"</span><span>:</span> <span>"securePassthrough"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"params"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"request"</span><span>:</span> <span>"bAhdgihJ9j6PrrknnbXWATBohGTZK5llv3MEzRcmoAmcxexmlVNz3OUX2r0h9a9EG/3X0tBpPi654T2+BjqVEOn2D178kokBpf8RQj01AvBZLYD5S5sFeaCXWiRXA7MgQUppROV4AbrU4f+GOM37KgPqT59qgLVja2slw6CzrKjPzOrG4Ho6Mu6wBa1xepcj"</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And responses look like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"seq"</span><span>:</span> <span>584</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"result"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"response"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Gqz1wbXAig/3wL+kXzY2Ig3hq+JSYasYI7FXdMNZR5PyH8bpLX+GJqQbImUtby9IEj5HQDhxqcTa+dUqQjI0GaGCxuGHqmrgQ0FeyCTQjBiW5gslAPQG33wj44OOkAep"</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>},</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"error_code"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So from this initial dive we have learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tapo 100% has a default password due to the fact that it performs a full login before it knows anything about the cloud password.</li>
<li>Tapo has an encrypted <code>securePassthrough</code> channel for its API calls to prevent peeping toms such as myself from spilling the beans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-jadx-dive">The JADX dive</h2>
<p>The next logical step is to decompile the apk in JADX and start rummaging around for a default password.</p>
<p>The initial login call that we captured references an <code>admin</code> username:</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span><span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"method"</span><span>:</span> <span>"login"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>"params"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"cnonce"</span><span>:</span> <span>"AD0E189F6E1BA335"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"encrypt_type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"3"</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"username"</span><span>:</span> <span>"admin"</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Searching for <code>"admin"</code> in JADX gives us many hits but there are a few concentrated in a <code>CameraOnboardingViewModel</code> class that look interesting:</p>
<p><img src="https://kennedn.com/blog/posts/tapo/jadx1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The function <code>m98131y2</code> appears to be returning a password that is then passed to the <code>new Account()</code> call. Following this function up the chain, we hit gold:</p>

<p><a href="#loginrequest">We already know</a>
 that the device is using <code>encrypt_type: 3</code>, so that means our default password is:</p>
<p><code>TPL075526460603</code></p>
<h2 id="teaching-mitmproxy-new-tricks">Teaching mitmproxy new tricks</h2>
<p>With the default password now revealed, we have the cards in our hand to derive session keys and decode the <code>securePassthrough</code> messages.</p>
<p>The only thing that would help us further is if we had a reference implementation for the authentication flow. This is where <a href="https://github.com/JurajNyiri/pytapo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyTapo</a>
 really came in handy.</p>
<p>Using PyTapo as a reference, we could dump the session state and encrypted messages from mitmproxy and write a script to do some static analysis on the decrypted requests and responses, but a really cool feature of <code>mitmproxy</code> is that it supports scripting itself.</p>
<p>What this means is that we can pass a python script to mitmproxy, and have it directly decrypt request and response payloads inline whilst running a capture.</p>
<p>So I wrote <code>tapo_decrypt_pretty.py</code> which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watches for the login handshake (<code>cnonce</code>, <code>nonce</code>, <code>device_confirm</code>)</li>
<li>Derives <code>lsk</code>/<code>ivb</code> session keys from it</li>
<li>Transparently decrypts subsequent API calls</li>
<li>Pretty-prints them inline in mitmproxy‚Äôs UI in <code>request_decrypted</code> and <code>response_decrypted</code> fields</li>
<li>Dumps them to JSON files for later analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysing-the-results">Analysing the results</h2>
<p>The complete list of calls made by the Tapo app during onboarding were:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>getAppComponentList
</span></span><span><span>setLanguage
</span></span><span><span>scanApList
</span></span><span><span>bindToCloud
</span></span><span><span>changeAdminPassword
</span></span><span><span>setTimezone
</span></span><span><span>setRecordPlan
</span></span><span><span>setDeviceLocation
</span></span><span><span>connectAp
</span></span><span><span>getConnectStatus
</span></span><span><span>setAccountEnabled
</span></span><span><span>changeThirdAccount
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This boiled down to just four important calls:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>scanApList</code> ‚Äî list Wi-Fi access points</li>
<li><code>setAccountEnabled</code> + <code>changeThirdAccount</code> ‚Äî enable RTSP/ONVIF account</li>
<li><code>changeAdminPassword</code> ‚Äî change from default password to the cloud password</li>
<li><code>connectAp</code> ‚Äî join the selected Wi-Fi access point</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else was fluff: timezones, record plans, binding to cloud.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>In the end, the prize for all this nonsense was a scrappy little Bash script, <a href="https://github.com/kennedn/tapo-onboarding/blob/main/tapo_onboard.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>tapo_onboard.sh</code></a>
, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs in with the default admin password,</li>
<li>Scans and selects a Wifi access point</li>
<li>Switches off the obnoxious OSD logo on the camera feed,</li>
<li>Enables RTSP/ONVIF capabilities</li>
<li>Changes the admin password,</li>
<li>And finally joins the Wi-Fi.</li>
</ul>

<p>Peeling this onion left me with a few observations on Tapo‚Äôs firmware.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some endpoints use SHA-256 for hashing, while others cling to MD5 like it‚Äôs 2003.</li>
<li>There are <em>two</em> public keys used to send passwords to the device ‚Äî one that is shared with the client and another super secret one that‚Äôs hardcoded in the app. The easiest way to figure out which one to use is to flip a coin.</li>
<li>Password syncing between the app and its managed devices is strictly vibe-based.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole thing feels like it was cobbled together by a consortium of couch-cryptographers. But then again, it was the cheapest indoor camera on amazon, so what did I expect?</p>
<p>And with all this said I did finally manage to figure out what the dog does when I am away.</p>
<p>She sleeps. On the sofa. Sometimes even in her bed.</p>

<p>Next month, Microsoft will begin automatically installing the Microsoft 365 Copilot app on Windows devices outside of the EEA region that have the Microsoft 365 desktop client apps.</p>

<p>The Microsoft 365 Copilot app integrates the AI-powered Copilot assistant with Microsoft 365 suite apps, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as other features like Notebooks and AI agents.</p>

<ol data-border="0" data-indent="0" data-list-tree="true" data-stringify-type="ordered-list"></ol><p>Redmond also advised admins to notify their organizations' helpdesk teams and users before the app is forcibly installed on their devices "to reduce confusion and support requests."</p>

<p>The rollout will start in early October and be completed by mid-November; however,&nbsp;the Microsoft 365 Copilot app will not be installed on systems within the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

<p>"Starting in October 2025, Microsoft will begin automatically installing the Microsoft 365 Copilot app on Windows devices that have Microsoft 365 desktop client apps," the company said in a <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1152323" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft 365 message center update</a> on Friday.</p>

<p>"This app provides a centralized entry point for accessing Copilot experiences and AI-powered capabilities across Microsoft 365. This change simplifies access to Copilot and ensures users can easily discover and engage with productivity-enhancing features."</p>

<p>While the newly installed app will be added to the Windows Start Menu and enabled by default, IT administrators responsible for managing Microsoft 365 app deployments <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/deploy-microsoft-365-copilot-app#deploy-the-app-with-microsoft-365-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">will be able to opt out</a> in the Apps Admin Center:</p>

<ol data-border="0" data-indent="0" data-list-tree="true" data-stringify-type="ordered-list"><li>Sign in to the <a data-linktype="external" href="https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft 365 Apps admin center</a> with an admin account.</li>
	<li>Go to <em>Customization &gt; Device Configuration &gt; Modern App Settings</em>.</li>
	<li>Select <em>Microsoft 365 Copilot app</em>, then clear the <em>Enable automatic installation of Microsoft 365 Copilot app</em> check box.</li>
</ol><p>Although&nbsp;many users may notice a new&nbsp;Microsoft 365 Copilot app icon in the Start menu, the application may have already been installed, resulting in no apparent change.</p>

<p>Last month, as part of the same effort to make Copilot more easily available, Microsoft <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1073071" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that it will integrate Microsoft 365 Copilot agents into the Edge sidebar starting in late September 2025, allowing users to access them while using Copilot.</p>

<p>Weeks earlier, it <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1115982" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added a new setting</a> that allows Microsoft 365 admins to pin the Microsoft 365 Copilot app to the Windows taskbar.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://blog.asciinema.org/post/three-point-o/">3.0</a>
    <span>Published on 15 Sep 2025 by Marcin Kulik</span>
  </h2>
  <p>I‚Äôm happy to announce the release of asciinema CLI 3.0!</p>
<p>This is a complete rewrite of asciinema in Rust, upgrading the recording file
format, introducing terminal live streaming, and bringing numerous improvements
across the board.</p>
<p>In this post, I‚Äôll go over the highlights of the release. For a deeper overview
of new features and improvements, see the <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/releases/tag/v3.0.0">release
notes</a> and the
detailed
<a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>First, let‚Äôs get the Rust rewrite topic out of the way. I did it because I felt
like it. But seriously, I felt like it because I prefer working with Rust 100x
more than with Python these days. And this type of code, with syscalls and
concurrency, is way easier to deal with in Rust than in Python. That‚Äôs my
experience, YMMV. Anyway, in addition to making me enjoy working with this
component of asciinema again, the rewrite resulted in faster startup, easier
installation (a static binary), and made many new features possible by
integrating <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/avt">asciinema virtual terminal</a>
(also Rust) into the CLI.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at what‚Äôs cool and new now.</p>
<h2 id="asciicast-v3-file-format">asciicast v3 file format</h2>
<p>The new <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/asciicast/v3/">asciicast v3</a> file
format is an evolution of the good old asciicast v2. It addresses several
shortcomings of the previous format that were discovered over the years.</p>
<p>The major change in the new format is the use of intervals (deltas) for timing
session events. v2 used absolute timestamps (measured since session start),
which had its own pros and cons. One often-brought-up issue was the difficulty
of editing the recordings - timestamps of all following events had to be
adjusted when adding/removing/updating events.</p>
<p>Other than timing, the header has been restructured, grouping related things
together, e.g. all terminal-related metadata is now under <code>term</code>. There‚Äôs also
support for the new <code>"x"</code> (exit) event type, for storing the session exit
status. Finally, line comments are allowed by using the <code>#</code> character as the
first character on a line.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs an example of a short recording in asciicast v3 format:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="json"><span><span>{<span>"version"</span>: <span>3</span>, <span>"term"</span>: {<span>"cols"</span>: <span>80</span>, <span>"rows"</span>: <span>24</span>, <span>"type"</span>: <span>"xterm-256color"</span>}, <span>"timestamp"</span>: <span>1504467315</span>, <span>"title"</span>: <span>"Demo"</span>, <span>"env"</span>: {<span>"SHELL"</span>: <span>"/bin/zsh"</span>}}
</span></span><span><span># event stream follows the header
</span></span><span><span>[<span>0.248848</span>, <span>"o"</span>, <span>"Hey Dougal...\n"</span>]

server</a> and <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/">asciinema

<h2 id="live-terminal-streaming">Live terminal streaming</h2>
<p>The new CLI allows for live streaming of terminal sessions, and provides two
modes for doing so.</p>
<p>Local mode uses built-in HTTP server, allowing people to view the stream on
trusted networks (e.g. a LAN). In this mode no data is sent anywhere, except to
the viewers‚Äô browsers, which may require opening a firewall port. The CLI
bundles the latest version of asciinema player, and uses it to connect to the
stream from the page served by the built-in server.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ asciinema stream --local
::: asciinema session started
::: Live streaming at http://127.0.0.1:37881
::: Press &lt;ctrl+d&gt; or type 'exit' to end
$ _
</code></pre><p>Remote mode publishes the stream through an asciinema server (either
asciinema.org or a self-hosted one), which acts as a relay, delivering the
stream to the viewers at a shareable URL.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ asciinema stream --remote
::: asciinema session started
::: Live streaming at https://asciinema.org/s/TQGS82DwiBS1bYAY
::: Press &lt;ctrl+d&gt; or type 'exit' to end
$ _
</code></pre><p>The two modes can be used together as well.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a live stream of <code>btop</code> running on one of the asciinema.org servers:</p>

<p>You can also watch it directly on asciinema.org at
<a href="https://asciinema.org/s/olesiD03BIFH6Yz1">asciinema.org/s/olesiD03BIFH6Yz1</a>.</p>
<p>Read more about the streaming architecture and supported protocols
<a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/server/streaming/">here</a>.</p>
<p>asciinema player (seen above) supports all the described protocols. To make the
viewing experience smooth and glitch-free, it implements an adaptive buffering
mechanism. It measures network latency in real-time and adjusts the buffer size
constantly, aiming for a good balance between low latency and buffer-underrun
protection.</p>
<p>asciinema server can now record every live stream and turn it into a regular
recording. At the moment, asciinema server running at asciinema.org has stream
recording disabled and a concurrent live stream limit of 1, but you can
self-host the server where recording is enabled and there‚Äôs no concurrent
stream limit by default. The limits on asciinema.org may change. I‚Äôd like to
first see how the streaming feature affects resource usage (btw, shout-out to
<a href="https://www.brightbox.com/">Brightbox</a>, which provides cloud services for
asciinema.org).</p>
<h2 id="local-first">Local-first</h2>
<p>In the early versions of asciinema, <code>asciinema rec</code> didn‚Äôt support saving to a
file - the recording was saved to a tmp file, uploaded to asciinema.org, and
the tmp file was removed. Later on, the CLI got the ability to specify a
filename, which allowed you to save the result of a recording session to a file
in asciicast v1 format and decide whether you want to keep it local only or
publish.</p>
<p>Although optional, the filename argument had long been available. However,
many, many tutorials on the internet (probably including asciinema‚Äôs own docs)
showed examples of recording and publishing in one go with <code>asciinema rec</code>.
That was fine - many people loved this short path from recording to sharing.</p>
<p>Over the years, I started seeing two problems with this. The first one is that
lots of people still think you must upload to asciinema.org, which is not true.
You can save locally and nothing leaves your machine. The second one is that
the optionality of the filename made it possible to unintentionally publish a
recording, and potentially leak sensitive data. And it‚Äôs a completely valid
concern!</p>
<p>Because of that, on several occasions I‚Äôve seen negative comments saying
‚Äúasciinema is shady‚Äù /m\. It was never shady. It‚Äôs just a historical thing. I
just kept the original behavior for backward compatibility. asciinema.org is
not a commercial product - it‚Äôs <em>an</em> instance of asciinema server, which is
meant to give users an easy way to share, and to give a taste of what you get
when you self-host the server. In fact, I encourage everyone to self-host it,
as the recordings uploaded to asciinema.org are a liability for me (while being
a good promotion of the project :)).</p>
<p>I hope this clears up any confusion and suspicion.</p>
<p>Anyway, many things have changed since the original behavior of <code>asciinema rec</code> was implemented, including my approach to sharing my data with cloud
services. These days I self-host lots of services on a server at home, and I
try to avoid cloud services if I can (I‚Äôm pragmatic about it though).</p>
<p>The streaming feature was built from the ground up to support the local mode,
which came first, and the remote mode followed.</p>
<p>In asciinema CLI 2.4, released 2 years ago, I made the <code>upload</code> command show a
prompt where you have to explicitly make a decision on what to do with the
recording. It looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ asciinema rec
asciinema: recording asciicast to /tmp/tmpo8_612f8-ascii.cast
asciinema: press &lt;ctrl-d&gt; or type "exit" when you're done
$ echo hello
hello
$ exit 
asciinema: recording finished
(s)ave locally, (u)pload to asciinema.org, (d)iscard
[s,u,d]? _
</code></pre><p>It was a stopgap and a way to prepare users for further changes that are coming
now.</p>
<p>In 3.0, the filename is always required, and the <code>rec</code> command no longer has
upload capability. To publish a recording to asciinema.org or a self-hosted
asciinema server, use the explicit <code>asciinema upload &lt;filename&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="more-self-hosting-friendly">More self-hosting-friendly</h2>
<p>A related improvement introduced in this release is the new server URL prompt.</p>
<p>When using a command that integrates with asciinema server (<code>upload</code>, <code>stream</code>,
<code>auth</code>) for the first time, a prompt is shown, pre-filled with
<a href="https://asciinema.org/">https://asciinema.org</a> (for convenience). This lets you choose an asciinema
server instance explicitly and intentionally. The choice is saved for future
invocations.</p>
<p>It was always possible to <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/cli/configuration/">point the CLI to another asciinema
server</a> with a config
file or environment variable, but this new prompt should come in handy
especially when running the CLI in a non-workstation/non-laptop yet interactive
environment, such as a fresh VM or a dev container.</p>
<p>This change should make it easier to use the CLI with your own asciinema
server, and at the same time it doubles as an additional guard preventing
unintended data leaks (to asciinema.org).</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm really excited about this release. It‚Äôs been in the making for a while, but
it‚Äôs out now, and I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what new use-cases and
workflows people will discover with it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs going to take a moment until 3.0 shows up in package repositories for all
supported platforms/distros. Meanwhile, you can download prebuilt binaries for
GNU/Linux and macOS from the <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/releases/tag/v3.0.0">GitHub
release</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema#building">build
it from source</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading to this point!</p>

  <div><p>We are all moved by great movies, cinematography, and stories. Watching them is fun because you can imagine yourself resonating with a character. You are thrilled by the tension the story creates and curious how it will be resolved.</p>
<p>Many find software development a dull job where you have to write exactly what your PM or client asks for. It‚Äôs exciting at first, but it can become boring after a few iterations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever doesn‚Äôt excite you, change it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we, as developers, push ourselves to be protagonists, we discover many problems to solve ‚Äî a lot of tension to resolve. Here are a few good problems for everyday devs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your CI/CD takes a huge amount of time because you forgot to leverage caching.</li>
<li>You forgot to add connection pooling and your service bombarded the database, causing too many open connections.</li>
<li>You misconfigured the garbage collector and now you have a memory leak that keeps growing.</li>
<li>If it takes you more than 3 seconds to understand what you wrote last week, it‚Äôs poorly written.</li>
<li>Latency is high for your users in Mumbai because your servers are in Singapore.</li>
<li>The database becomes very slow when you start dumping data in batches.</li>
<li>You want consistent API responses for read operations for users in both Mumbai and Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not trivial problems; they happen every day. These are our villains ‚Äî irritating, unwanted, and surprising. We should eliminate them.</p>
<p>Pick your fight. This is one way to make your day exciting. If you can‚Äôt tackle these at work, do it in your personal projects.</p>
<p>If you chase the right tension, a story will follow.</p>

You can use just our primitives or combine with tools like Mastra, LangChain and Vercel AI SDK. You can self-host or use our cloud, where we take care of scaling for you. Here‚Äôs a quick demo: (<a href="https://youtu.be/kFCzKE89LD8" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/kFCzKE89LD8</a>).</p><p>We started in 2023 as a way to reliably run async background jobs/workflows in TypeScript (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686</a>). Initially we didn‚Äôt deploy your code, we just orchestrated it. But we found that most developers struggled to write reliable code with implicit determinism, found breaking their work into small ‚Äústeps‚Äù tricky, and they wanted to install any system packages they needed. Serverless timeouts made this even more painful.</p><p>We also wanted to allow you to wait for things to happen: on external events, other tasks finishing, or just time passing. Those waits can take minutes, hours, or forever in the case of events, so you can‚Äôt just keep a server running.</p><p>The solution was to build and operate our own serverless cloud infrastructure. The key breakthrough that enabled this was realizing we could snapshot the CPU and memory state. This allowed us to pause running code, store the snapshot, then restore it later on a different physical server. We currently use Checkpoint Restore In Userspace (CRIU) which Google has been using at scale inside Borg since 2018.</p><p>Since then, our adoption has really taken off especially because of AI agents/workflows. This has opened up a ton of new use cases like compute-heavy tasks such as generating videos using AI (Icon.com), real-time computer use (Scrapybara), AI enrichment pipelines (Pallet, Centralize), and vibe coding tools (Hero UI, Magic Patterns, Capy.ai).</p><p>You can get started with Trigger.dev cloud (<a href="https://cloud.trigger.dev/">https://cloud.trigger.dev</a>), self-hosting (<a href="https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/overview">https://trigger.dev/docs/self-hosting/overview</a>), or read the docs (<a href="https://trigger.dev/docs">https://trigger.dev/docs</a>).</p><p>Here‚Äôs a sneak peek at some upcoming changes: 1) warm starts for self-hosting 2) switching to MicroVMs for execution ‚Äì this will be open source, self-hostable, and will include checkpoint/restoring.</p><p>We‚Äôre excited to be sharing this with HN and are open to all feedback!</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p>A former <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta</a> product manager has claimed that the social network circumvented Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a> protections, as well as cheating advertisers, and fired him when he repeatedly raised the issue internally.</p>



<p>Meta is said to have found ways to identify Apple users even after they refused consent for app tracking, in order to avoid an estimated <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/01/apples-app-privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10 billion loss of revenue</a> ‚Ä¶</p>







<p>Meta relied heavily on selling personalized advertising, which required it to be able to target particular demographics and interest groups. This was achieved by tracking individual users across different apps.</p>



<p>Apple‚Äôs <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-tracking-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Tracking Transparency</a> (ATT) was introduced in 2021 and meant that companies required user permission in order to carry out this tracking. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of users declined.</p>



<p>It was estimated at the time that this would cost social media companies many billions of dollars, and Meta‚Äôs CFO warned investors that its own loss would be around $10B per year</p>







<p>It was quickly alleged that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/22/app-tracking-transparency-workaround/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta was using workarounds</a> to continue to track users who had denied permission, alongside <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/24/facebook-privacy-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other privacy violations</a>. A class action lawsuit followed.</p>



<p>A fired product manager at the company, Samujjal Purkayastha, has now taken his case to an employment tribunal claiming he was unlawfully dismissed for raising concerns about the practice, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be6a99d2-22de-48ec-9afa-1d2e2f709afc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Times</a></em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Meta secretly linked user data with other information to track users‚Äô activity on other websites without their permission ‚Äî despite Apple in 2021 introducing measures explicitly requiring consent, according to Purkayastha‚Äôs filings [‚Ä¶]</p>



<p>A ‚Äúclosed and secretive‚Äù team at Meta is alleged to have used ‚Äúdeterministic matching‚Äù ‚Äî gathering identifiable information that could then be used to connect data across multiple platforms in violation of Apple‚Äôs new privacy policies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also accuses Meta of inflating the value of sales achieved by advertising on its platforms.</p>



<p>Meta denies any wrongdoing, and claims that Purkayastha was dismissed for unrelated reasons. The tribunal was unable to rule immediately, and said a full hearing will be held later in the year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    

    <div>
        <p>I have an incredibly boring summer hobby: looking at the changelog for the <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">WebKit Github repo</a>. Why? Because I spend a chunk of my professional life working with webviews inside mobile apps and I like to get an early peek into what's coming in the next version of iOS. Since Tim Cook has yet to stand up at WWDC and announce "one more thing... Service Worker support in WKWebView, provided you add the correct entry to the <code>WKAppBoundDomains</code> array in your <code>Info.plist</code>" (and you know what, he <em>should</em>) manual research is the order of the day.</p><p>So I was really interested to see, the day after WWDC finished, a pull request named:</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/46754/files?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">[Materials] Rename "hosted blur" materials to reference "glass"</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/?ref=alastair.is" rel="noreferrer">Liquid Glass</a> was one of the big takeaways from 2025's WWDC. Probably the biggest change in iOS UI since iOS 7 ditched the skeuomorphic look of the past. But that's all native UI, what does any of that have to do with webviews?</p><p>A poke around the context of the PR revealed something really interesting: Apple has a custom CSS property named <code>-apple-visual-effect</code> . Not only does it allow the use of Liquid Glass in iOS 26 (via values like <code>-apple-system-glass-material</code>) but all versions support using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/materials?ref=alastair.is#Standard-materials" rel="noreferrer">standard materials</a> with values like <code>-apple-system-blur-material-thin</code>.</p><h3 id="yes-it-works-and-no-we-cant">Yes it works and no, we can't</h3><p>Before you, like me, fire up Safari and start editing some CSS, I have bad news: no, it doesn't work on the web. As well it shouldn't. But it <em>also</em> doesn't work by default in an app using WKWebView, you have to toggle a setting in WKPreferences called <code>useSystemAppearance</code>... and it's <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/613c42873c56e2b2073f91b2983eec825be6a791/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/WKPreferencesInternal.h?ref=alastair.is#L59" rel="noreferrer">private</a>. So if you use it, say goodbye to App Store approval.</p><p>I wanted to try it out all the same so I hacked around to set <code>useSystemAppearance</code> to true, set my CSS to:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
}</code></pre><p>lo and behold, it works!</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://alastair.is/content/media/2025/09/glass_with_ipad_new_frame_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

                <div>
                        <p>
                        
                        <span>0:00</span></p><p>
                            /<span>0:09</span>
                        </p>

        <img src="https://alastair.is/content/media/2025/09/glass_with_ipad_new_frame_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Whoever it was at Apple that decided to make this a CSS property is a genius because it makes it incredibly easy to provide different rules based on Liquid Glass support:</p><pre><code>.toolbar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 75px;
  width: 450px;
  background: rgba(204, 204, 204, 0.7);
}

@supports (-apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material) {
  background: transparent;
  -apple-visual-effect: -apple-system-glass-material
}</code></pre><h2 id="who-cares">Who cares?</h2><p>It's an interesting piece of trivia but no-one outside of Apple can use it. So what does it matter? It doesn't. Except for the implication for what I'll call Alastair's Grand Theory of In-App Webviews. Industry wide they don't have a great reputation. But my suggestion is this: <strong>the main reason webviews in apps have such a bad reputation is because you don't notice the webviews that are integrated seamlessly.</strong></p><p>It stands to reason that Apple wouldn't have developed this feature if they weren't using it. Where? We have no idea. But they must be using it <em>somewhere</em>. The fact that none of us have noticed exactly where suggests that we're interacting with webviews in our daily use of iOS without ever even realising it.</p><p>Food for thought!</p>

            <!-- TODO: fix line spacing -->
            A common place to get a web font is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Fonts</a><br>
            If you want to use a font from Google Fonts, you should not just paste the code they give you so you don't leak visitor IP adresses to google.<br>
            Instead, you should download the font files and put them on your webserver.<br>
            The Download button in Google Fonts gives TTF files and not WOFF2 files<br>
            If you want a font used it this website(like Noto Sans and Fira Code), copy the relevant files from here <a href="https://codeberg.org/Velocifyer/Blog-ifyer/src/branch/main/Assets/Fonts/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" ping="https://blog.velocifyer.com/clicked+link+to+codeberg+fonts">

        </a> and skip steps 0 and 1.<br>
        <strong>THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE</strong><br>
        <strong>I AM NOT YOUR LAWYER</strong>
        <ol start="-1">
            <li><strong>ENSURE THAT YOUR USE OF THE FONT WILL COMPLY WITH THE LICENSE</strong></li>
            <li>
                Download the font
                <ol start="0">
                    <li>
                        Go to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Fonts</a> and search for the font you want.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select "Get font".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select "Get embed code" (don't paste the code it gives you).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select which options you want included.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the HTML code it gives you, it should have something like <code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>.<br>
                        Download the file using the URL after the href (<code>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code&amp;display=swap</code> in this case).
                        Download each font referenced in the CSS file you just downloaded.<br>
                        Put all of the font you just downloaded in a folder, ideally with a something that will change each update and a long cache time (like /Assets/Fira/Code/2025-8-13/).<br>
                        Copy the CSS file into that folder.
                        Change the CSS to use relative links.<br> (eg change <code>src: url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/firacode/v26/uU9eCBsR6Z2vfE9aq3bL0fxyUs4tcw4W_D1sJVD7Ng.woff2) format('woff2');</code> into <code>src: url(uU9eCBsR6Z2vfE9aq3bL0fxyUs4tcw4W_D1sJVD7Ng.woff2) format('woff2');</code>)
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Paste the license of the font into a file. To find the license of a google font do:
                <ol start="0">
                    <li>Search for the font on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Google Fonts</a></li>
                    <li>Select the font</li>
                    <li>Select "License"</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add html to use the CSS like:
                <pre><code>&lt;link href="/Assets/Fonts/Fira/Code/2025-8-13/fira-code.css" rel="preload"&gt;
&lt;link href="/Assets/Fonts/Fira/Code/2025-8-13/fira-code.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add css to use the font like:
<pre><code>code {
    font-family: "Fira Code", monospace;
    font-optical-sizing: auto;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a link to the font LICENSE and <strong>ensure that your usage of the font follows the license of the font</strong>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        If you can't understand these steps, <a href="https://codeberg.org/Velocifyer/Blog-ifyer/src/branch/main/Assets/Fonts/Noto/Sans/2025-8-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" ping="https://blog.velocifyer.com/clicked+other+link+to+codeberg+fonts">
