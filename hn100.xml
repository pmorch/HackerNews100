            The discovery that other vertebrates have healthy, microbial brains is fueling the still controversial possibility that we might have them as well.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Bacteria are in, around and all over us. They thrive in almost every corner of the planet, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to high up in the clouds, to the crevices of your ears, mouth, nose and gut. But scientists have long assumed that bacteria can’t survive in the human brain. The powerful blood-brain barrier, the thinking goes, keeps the organ mostly free from outside invaders. But are we sure that a healthy human brain doesn’t have a microbiome of its own?</p>
<p>Over the last decade, initial studies have presented conflicting evidence. The idea has remained controversial, given the difficulty of obtaining healthy, uncontaminated human brain tissue that could be used to study possible microbial inhabitants.</p>
<p>Recently, a study published in <em>Science Advances</em> provided the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado0277">strongest evidence yet</a> that a brain microbiome can and does exist in healthy vertebrates — fish, specifically. Researchers at the University of New Mexico discovered communities of bacteria thriving in salmon and trout brains. Many of the microbial species have special adaptations that allow them to survive in brain tissue, as well as techniques to cross <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">the protective blood-brain barrier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/matthew-r-olm">Matthew Olm</a>, a physiologist who studies the human microbiome at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was not involved with the study, is “inherently skeptical” of the idea that populations of microbes could live in the brain, he said. But he found the new research convincing. “This is concrete evidence that brain microbiomes do exist in vertebrates,” he said. “And so the idea that humans have a brain microbiome is not outlandish.”</p>
<p>While fish physiology is, in many ways, similar to humans’, there are some key differences. Still, “it certainly puts another weight on the scale to think about whether this is relevant to mammals and us,” said <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/christopher-d-link">Christopher Link</a>, who studies the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was also not involved in the work.</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The human gut microbiome plays a critical role in the body, communicating with the brain and maintaining the immune system through <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-the-guts-second-brain-key-agents-of-health-emerge-20231121/">the gut-brain axis</a>. So it isn’t totally far-fetched to suggest that microbes could play an even larger role in our neurobiology.</p>
<h2><strong>Fishing for Microbes</strong></h2>
<p>For years, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/irenesalinasremiro/">Irene Salinas</a> has been fascinated by a simple physiological fact: The distance between the nose and the brain is quite small. The evolutionary immunologist, who works at the University of New Mexico, studies mucosal immune systems in fish to better understand how human versions of these systems, such as our intestinal lining and nasal cavity, work. The nose, she knows, is loaded with bacteria, and they’re “really, really close” to the brain — mere millimeters from the olfactory bulb, which processes smell. Salinas has always had a hunch that bacteria might be leaking from the nose into the olfactory bulb. After years of curiosity, she decided to confront her suspicion in her favorite model organisms: fish.</p>
<p>Salinas and her team started by extracting DNA from the olfactory bulbs of trout and salmon, some caught in the wild and some raised in her lab. They planned to look up the DNA sequences in a database to identify any microbial species.</p>
<p>These kinds of samples, however, are easily contaminated — by bacteria in the lab or from other parts of a fish’s body — which is why scientists have struggled to study this subject effectively. If they did find bacterial DNA in the olfactory bulb, they would have to convince themselves and other researchers that it truly originated in the brain.</p>

<p>To cover their bases, Salinas’ team studied the fishes’ whole-body microbiomes, too. They sampled the rest of the fishes’ brains, guts and blood; they even drained blood from the many capillaries of the brain to make sure that any bacteria they discovered resided in the brain tissue itself.</p>
<p>“We had to go back and redo [the experiments] many, many times just to be sure,” Salinas said. The project took five years — but even in the early days it was clear that the fish brains weren’t barren.</p>
<p>As Salinas expected, the olfactory bulb hosted some bacteria. But she was shocked to see that the rest of the brain had even more. “I thought the other parts of the brain wouldn’t have bacteria,” she said. “But it turned out that my hypothesis was wrong.” The fish brains hosted so much that it took only a few minutes to locate bacterial cells under a microscope. As an additional step, her team confirmed that the microbes were actively living in the brain; they weren’t dormant or dead.</p>
<p>Olm was impressed by their thorough approach. Salinas and her team circled “the same question, from all these different ways, using all these different methods — all of which produced convincing data that there actually are living microbes in the salmon brain,” he said.</p>
<p>But if there are, how did they get there?</p>
<h2><strong>Invading the Fortress</strong></h2>
<p>Researchers have long been skeptical that the brain could have a microbiome because all vertebrates, including fish, have <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">a blood-brain barrier</a>. These blood vessels and surrounding brain cells are fortified to serve as gatekeepers that allow only some molecules in and out of the brain and keep invaders, especially larger ones like bacteria, out. So Salinas naturally wondered how the brains in her study had been colonized.</p>

<p>By comparing microbial DNA from the brain to that collected from other organs, her lab found a subset of species that didn’t appear elsewhere in the body. Salinas hypothesized that these species may have colonized the fish brains early in their development, before their blood-brain barriers had fully formed. “Early on, anything can go in; it’s a free-for-all,” she said.</p>
<p>But many of the microbial species were also found throughout the body. She suspects that most bacteria in the fishes’ brain microbiomes originated in their blood and guts, and continuously leak into the brain.</p>
<p>“After that first wave of colonization,” she said, “you need to have specific features to go in and out.”</p>
<p>Salinas was able to identify features that let bacteria make the crossing. Some could produce molecules, known as polyamines, that can open and close junctions, which are like little doors in the barrier that allow molecules to pass through. Others could produce molecules that help them evade the body’s immune response or compete with other bacteria.</p>
<p>Salinas even caught a bacterium in the act. Looking under the microscope, she captured an image of a bacterium frozen in time within the blood-brain barrier. “We literally caught it right in the middle of crossing,” she said.</p>
<p>It is possible that the microbes don’t live freely in the brain tissue but are engulfed by immune cells. That would be the “most boring interpretation of this paper,” Olm said, and would suggest that the fish have adapted to bacterial inhabitants by containing them.</p>
<p>However, if the bacteria are free-living, they could be involved in the body’s processes beyond the brain. It’s possible that the microbes actively regulate aspects of the creatures’ physiology, Salinas suggested, the way human gut microbiomes help regulate the digestive and immune systems.</p>
<p>Fish, of course, are not humans, but they allow a fair comparison, Salinas said. And her work suggests that if fish have microbes living in their brains, it’s possible we have them, too.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <h2><strong>Impenetrable or Not?</strong></h2>
<p>Bacteria have been found living in just about every human organ system, but to many scientists the brain is a step too far. The blood-brain barrier has traditionally been seen as “impenetrable,” said <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/biotechnology/people/janosch-heller">Janosch Heller</a>, who studies the barrier at Dublin City University and was not involved in the new research. Plus, the brain has immune cells working overtime to zap any potentially harmful invaders. When microbes have been found in the human brain, they are are associated with active infections or typically linked to a breakdown in the barrier due to diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>This assumption was challenged in 2013, when scientists studying the neurological impacts of HIV/AIDS found genetic hints of bacteria in the brains of both sick and healthy people. The findings were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054673">the first to suggest</a> that maybe humans could have a brain microbiome in the absence of disease.</p>

<p>“No one believed it 10 years ago,” Heller said. Follow-up studies — there haven’t been many — have been inconclusive. “It is very easy to trick yourself into thinking microbes are present because microbial DNA is essentially everywhere,” Olm said. “So it would take a lot of evidence to convince me that it does exist.”</p>
<p>The fish experiment did convince him, and other researchers, that a human brain microbiome is not impossible. What is nearly impossible, however, is confirming that without harming healthy people. To build a case, Link suggested repeating the fish experiment in rodents. “This protocol should be able to be adapted really easily to mouse brains,” Salinas said — and indeed her team has started looking into it. They have found early hints that microbes exist in the olfactory bulbs of healthy mice and, to a lesser extent, throughout the brain.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason, if fish have them, that you wouldn’t have them, or that mice wouldn’t have them,” Link said. If microbes have adapted to cross the fish blood-brain barrier and survive in the fish brain, they could do the same in our bodies. It’s unlikely they would be present at the same levels as they are in fish, he added, “but that doesn’t mean there’s none.”</p>
        
        
<p>Even in small numbers, Link said, resident microbes could influence our brain metabolism and immune systems. If they are truly present, this would suggest an extra layer of neurological regulation that we didn’t know existed. We already know that microbes influence our neurobiology: Right now, microbes in your gut are <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-the-guts-second-brain-key-agents-of-health-emerge-20231121/">modulating your brain activity</a> through the gut-brain axis by producing metabolites that are sensed by enteric neurons winding through your digestive system.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating, though unproved, proposition that bacteria in the brain are directly impacting our physiology. However, thanks to research like Salinas’, more scientists are open to the idea that healthy human brains might also be home to microbes.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Heller said. “I’m not shocked anymore that they are there.” The more interesting question, he said, is: “Are they all there for a reason, or are they there by mistake?”</p>

<p>During one of his “yes or no” Instagram Q&amp;As, Scott Rao lamented the declining quality of Kenyan coffees over the last three years—a sentiment I’ve heard echoed by buyers across Europe, the US, and Australia. He kicked a different question over to me about whether cultivar or microclimate or process has the greatest cup impact, and I demurred, offering that the relationship is gestalt but that processing ultimately had the final say —invoking Kenya’s declining cup quality as an example.</p>



<p>In our DMs, I shared with Scott my theory about the cause of this phenomenon—and noted that it was connected to some of the challenges of working there as a coffee buyer. He suggested I write a blog about it—a suggestion that I got from more than a dozen of my followers later that night.</p>



<p>So here it is.</p>



<p>Kenyan coffee holds a special place in the hearts and minds of specialty coffee buyers and roasters. Coffees from Kenya are prized for their physical density, long shelf life, vibrant acidity, intense cup profile, and often, distinctive aromatics like currant (or tomato—depending who you ask).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve written about the most memorable coffee I’ve ever cupped—<a href="https://christopherferan.com/2020/02/18/so-a-coffee-walks-into-a-sauna/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the one that got away</a>. It was a Kenyan.</p>



<p>The most common theory explaining the apparent decline in quality of Kenyan coffees rests the blame with an increase in Ruiru 11 and Batian in the lots (and, concurrently, a decline in SL-28 and SL-34). I’ve <a href="https://christopherferan.com/2021/03/02/missing-the-forest-for-a-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written about that too</a> (about halfway through) and don’t buy that argument.</p>



<p>And besides—looking at the export lots available from many of the more famous estates and associations, as well as <a href="https://afca.coffee/african-taste-of-harvest/#kenya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">African Taste of Harvest</a> winners—it’s clear that many (if not most) contain at least some of these hybrids.</p>



<p>I don’t buy it.</p>



<hr>



<p>Kenya is a tricky place to work as a buyer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While in some origins, a smallholder would be able to grow and process their coffee as they please and then have a choice to either sell that parchment or dried cherry to any exporter in the country for immediate payment—or even secure their own export license and self-export—producers in Kenya are removed from the commercial market, their coffee passing through a Byzantine and colonial export system that centralizes sales through an auction system with exporters in the position of greatest power, sacrificing traceability and financial transparency along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means we can’t work directly—not really, anyway—and have to navigate through the labyrinth of the auction system to secure the coffees we want, all the while wondering where the $5 or $6 or $7 per pound we’re paying is really going.</p>



<p>Coffee wasn’t something that was native to Kenya or even traditionally grown there—even as Kenya shares a border with Uganda (home of robusta) and Ethiopia (the birthplace of Arabica). Though first introduced to Kenya in 1893 by John Paterson on behalf of the Scottish Mission from seeds obtained from the British East India Company, the completion of the Ugandan Railway and arrival of European settlers ultimately led to the introduction of plantation agriculture and large-scale cultivation of cash crops like tea, wheat, sisal—and coffee. As a colony of the British crown, the settlers were tasked with paying for construction of the railway and the export of coffee was expanded rapidly to settle the debt. </p>



<p>By 1912, Kiambu-Kikuyu boasted plantations several hundred acres in size.</p>



<p>Of the larger export companies still operating in Kenya, many have their roots in the colonial period, such as Dorman’s, which was founded in the 1950s, and Taylor Winch in the 1960s. I’ll never forget the first time I walked into the offices of these two companies and noted that the managers and people in charge were all white—either Europeans or white, Kenyan-born descendents of British settlers—and everyone cleaning up the cupping table when we were done was an indigenous Kenyan person (<em>one of the bosses of one of the companies—a white man, of course—was even wearing a khaki safari shirt. You just can’t make this shit up)</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within hours of arriving in Nairobi for the first time, it was clear to me that coffee in Kenya still largely operated as an extractive, neo-colonialist enterprise.</p>



<p>In Kenya, if a producer has less than 5 acres, they legally need a coop or society to process and market their coffees. Historically, around 30% of coffee in Kenya comes from estates, with the remainder coming from some 400+ cooperative societies—but in recent years that number has shifted to 45% from Kenya’s roughly 24,000 estates and the remainder from around 85,000 smallholders (according to the Kenya Coffee Traders Association’s <em>Kenya Coffee Directory</em>).</p>



<p>The best co-ops might have financing available to producers as well as traceability and receipt systems in place to maintain some transparency as coffee passes through the export system. The societies own and operate the washing stations (there called factories) where their members’ coffee is processed (according to the export standards in the country, all export coffee must be washed).</p>



<p>After coffee has been fermented, washed and dried, movement permits are pulled (a legal requirement to transport coffee anywhere in the country) and it’s sent to one of the country’s eight mills, which is paid to remove the husk and sort the coffee to prepare for sale through the auction or an exporter.</p>



<p>In Kenya, though, millers cannot export themselves; coffee must pass through a “marketing agent” to make the sale to an exporter — a <em>bonus</em> middleman special to Kenya’s system.</p>



<p>The miller selects and hires the marketing agent, which is, in practice, very often one and the same entity. This system is lubricated through bribery: marketing agents pay allowance to board members of societies to get them to agree to market their coffee through that agent, which in turn affiliates them with an exporter. (It’s likely illegal, and some marketing agents such as Coffee Management Services/Dorman’s <em>insist</em> they don’t engage in the practice).</p>



<p>From there, the marketing agent markets the coffee on behalf of the society and miller to exporters to earn their 1.76-3% commission. </p>



<p>In Kenya, though, the coffee remains the property of the society until its final sale through auction or export, with fees deducted along the way. The remainder is paid to the society, which in turn takes its own cut and pays out the farmers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In effect, this means that a farmer whose coffee was harvested and processed in October and exported in March would not get paid until March or April—some six months later, and well into the flowering period for main crop. Any nutrients, amendments, fertilizers, or pesticides the farmer needs—let alone the costs of food, housing and living for themselves or their families—would need to be financed for that 6 month period prior to final payment from the exporter to the society and from the society to the farmer.</p>



<p>Commercial financing rates for coffee producers in Kenya are higher than 20%, effectively making them agricultural payday loans. Co-ops often offer lower rates—but still higher than 10%. These financing costs compound the actual cost of production for smallholders and diminish their profits once that final sale is complete.</p>



<p>And if a miller isn’t honest or reputable, out turns from the mill may be low—80% is quite common—lowering yields and driving up costs to the grower even further—and creating an opportunity for the miller’s pocket to be lined (which is the most fucking colonial British thing ever—it sort of reminds me of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/elizabethan-executions.htm" target="_blank">Elizabethan England where you’d tip your executioner</a> to ensure they did good, clean work and removed your head in one swing).</p>



<p>In order to improve the speed of payment, a society <em>could</em> do its own milling (for example, if they’re larger or a union member with access to resources) by building a mill or reactivating an unused mill at which point a society could get a grower/marketing license (likely while paying absurdly high interest rates on the capital they invested to build the mill)—however, according to the <em>Kenya Coffee Directory</em>, only 9 of these licenses have been issued.</p>



<p>But even then—the society still can’t export; they just control their own milling and keep that process control and the fee that would otherwise pass to a third party.</p>



<p>Most of the coffee that flows through auction system comes from as few as eight marketing agents, four of which are vertically-integrated and owned by subsidiaries of the major export players (like CMS which is owned by Dorman’s, Tropical which is owned by Neumann Group, and SMS which is owned by ECOM).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In total, at the time of my last visit to Kenya in 2016 there were just 45 export licenses for coffee in the entire country. The amount of money passed between entities to establish blocks of power in otherwise competing businesses is otherwise pretty staggering—money passing from one hand to the other in a scheme that effectively fixes prices paid to producers across the country and limits the ability of producers to sell their coffee freely in a competitive market.</p>



<p>For example, Dorman’s, which was founded in 1950 and is the oldest exporter in Kenya, used to be a part of Taylor Winch and ED&amp;F Man. It’s now independent, or so it says—but ECOM is its shareholder and financier in spite of the fact that ECOM has its own export license and separate marketing agent pipeline.</p>



<p>No matter which demon you sell to, it all ends up in the devil’s pocket.</p>



<p>Dorman’s supplies coffee to many of the most famous third wave roasters in the world<em> (I once got kicked out of a Dorman’s cupping because a certain Scandinavian guest of honor arrived and wanted a chance to cup the coffees first</em>) and offers certain advantages to societies that hire CMS to market their coffees.</p>



<p>By selling cherry through Dorman’s, producers get access to loans and pre-financing below commercial rates, as well as training on good agricultural practices and assistance getting certifications. Dorman’s extends these benefits as a way to access producers directly rather than having them sell to societies, though roughly 30% of all coffee that Dorman’s exports comes through cooperatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dorman’s might pay a society something in the realm of 85 shillings per kilo of cherry, or around $0.75-0.80 USD per kg—significantly higher than the country average of 65 shillings per kilo ($0.57-0.60).</p>



<p>On the high end this translates, roughly, to the equivalent of around $1.85 per pound of green coffee—a pretty good price, to be sure—though it pales in comparison with the $5-7 per pound most roasters are used to paying for Kenyan coffee.</p>



<p>But the average price paid to producers for cherry translates roughly to $1.42 per pound.</p>



<p>The best coops, where premiums of 85 shillings per kg are paid, might retain 5% of the sale, but it’s extremely common for coops to retain roughly 20% from the sale, leaving, in the typical case, just $1.13 per pound to a producer—well below their costs of production, even before the marketing agent’s 3%, or milling fees (roughly $70 per metric ton), or out turns, or financing costs that float a producer between harvests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seriously: Why bother?</p>

<p>About 25 years ago, Kenya’s coffee production was about triple what it is today. Some of that has to do with politics—the second president of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi, took away the support system for coffee as a mechanism to suppress opposition—some has to do with competing exports (like tea) being more lucrative or liquid, but largely, urban sprawl consumed lands used for coffee cultivation as Nairobi exploded in population from just 850,000 in 1980 to nearly 5 million in 2021:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kenya’s acreage under coffee production has decreased by over 30 percent from about 170,000 hectares in early 1990s to about 119,000 hectare in 2020. The production of the cash crop has also decreased by a whopping 70 percent from a peak of 129,000 metric tons in 1983-84 coffee year to about 40,000 metric tons currently. </p>

<p>Why bother, indeed: why grow coffee when you can make a better living by selling your land?</p>



<p>But that’s a problem: declining production means declining efficiency, and most of the factories in Kenya were built to accommodate massive volume.</p>



<p>Until <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-07/06/c_1310044505.htm" target="_blank">recent reforms</a> in 2021, the style and process of coffee was dictated to producers, limiting their ability to refine processes as volumes fluctuated or account for new techniques, technologies, or the evolving tastes of buyers (as I understand it, it was illegal until recently to export natural processed Kenyan coffees for this reason).</p>



<p>At peak production, Kenyan factories faced issues and bottlenecks familiar to many coffee producers around the world—most often as it entered the phase of processing requiring the most space and time: drying. Even if conditions were right and if the coffee were dried in full sun, it could take 7-9 days for coffee to dry enough to move into storage. To break down pulp in a dry fermentation—as is the standard in Kenya—it might only take 12-20 hours.</p>



<p>This means that as cherry was received, it would pile up, awaiting drying. It’s kind of like when you’re try to do three loads of laundry in a side-by-side washer and drier: the wash cycle might only take 30-35 minutes but the drier might take an hour. You have to wait for the drier to finish before you can move your clothes over and begin the next cycle. But if you wait too long—the clothes (the cherry) will rot.</p>



<p>So what do you do?</p>



<p>You <em>could</em> build more space for drying—or you could engineer workarounds to elongate the first part of the process to synchronize when coffee exits drying and more coffee enters, in essence creating a buffer for drying space.</p>



<p>In Kenya, this meant the introduction of the “double washed” or “double fermented” style of coffee many buyers are familiar with. Coffee would be fermented dry for 12-24 hours, washed, and then sent to a holding tank where it would be soaked in clean, cool water for up to an additional 24 hours or longer (the so-called “secondary fermentation”). In some mills, after the initial 12-24 hour dry fermentation and washing, a second dry fermentation would occur before soaking. A single pass through the fermentation step, though — ferment, wash, soak — could theoretically extend the amount of time that coffee could hang out before drying by a day or two, enough time to delay sending the coffee to dry and allowing the factory to make space on drying tables.</p>



<p>One thing Lucia Solis and I have long disagreed about is the necessity or efficacy of the “second fermentation” in Kenyan style washed processes. Lucia argues that it’s inefficient, creating an additional step and prolonging the processing time and therefore unnecessarily increasing costs. She believes the same flavor profile could be generated using other techniques. </p>



<p>I counter that it was a technique that was, in fact, introduced to engineer a solution to capacity issues and therefore <em>is </em>efficient because it requires no additional infrastructure — merely idle time.&nbsp;Further, I believe there is merit to the notion that the soak functions as a “secondary fermentation” (though really it should be called a “sequential” fermentation process) producing a flavor profile that would be more difficult and riskier to achieve in a less time-intensive manner.</p>



<p>Coffee fermentations are, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://christopherferan.com/2020/05/04/sourdough-sour-coffee/" target="_blank">as I’ve discussed in the past</a>, mixed microbial fermentations involving “the activity of a wide range of microorganisms such as yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria (AAB), spore-forming bacteria, and molds.” (Masoud et al. 2004; Schwan and Wheals 2004; Nielsen et al. 2007, 2013). Typically, over the course of a coffee fermentation, the population dominant in the tank will modulate based on the environmental temperature, pH of the fermentation, availability of oxygen and nutrient, fermentable sugar concentration, and finally, ethanol content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While yeast is associated with degradation of the pectins in coffee mucilage, bacteria such as LAB and AAB are associated with the production of acids (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/%20fermentation7010009" target="_blank">Ruta,L.L.; Farcasanu,I.C. Coffee and Yeasts: From Flavor to Biotechnology. <em>Fermentation</em> 2021, 7, 9</a>). The specific fermentation kinetics dictate the microbial succession as different microbes will be better adapted for certain conditions at different times during the fermentation. At the onset of fermentation, lactic acid bacteria and yeast may grow in tandem, with LAB having a briefer (or no) lag phase and therefore producing metabolites before yeast has established. However, as a byproduct, in addition to lactic acid (which lowers the pH in the fermentation tank) LAB may produce—or enable production from other microorganisms—compounds that are toxic to LAB, leading the bacteria to die off or stagnate. Yeast, however, are more robust and would continue to ferment and replicate, and by virtue of their metabolism, continue to break down sugar and produce alcohol, carbon dioxide and (under ideal conditions) secondary metabolites.</p>



<p>This daisy chain of microbial activity creates a situation where the pH in the tank has dropped (probably to between 5-6), the moisture level has increased (as water is liberated from the disintegrating mucilage), there is quite a bit of ethanol (because of the yeast), and there is plenty of oxygen in the environment (because these fermentations are conducted uncovered and in ambient air). This is the most favorable set of conditions for the replication of AAB. Whether or not LAB continues its own metabolism, left unchecked, AAB will replicate and produce vinegar—rendering the resulting coffee defective.</p>



<p>But Kenyan processors introduced an extra step to interrupt this cycle halfway through—they washed the coffee (stripping away most of the food source for our fermenters, as well as the acids hanging out loose in the tank) and added fresh water (diluting the concentration of sugars thus inhibiting LAB and yeasts, decreasing availability of oxygen, and raising the pH). The temperature of the water is also cooler than that of the previous fermentation—and as we know from basic biology, lower temperatures result in slower metabolism of microorganisms (this is one of the main reasons that fridges help to stop spoilage).&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this means that Kenyan coffee producers were able to extend the time that coffee sat in the tank prior to drying without risking spoilage—solving the issue of needing to make the wash cycle last long enough to wait for the previous load of laundry to come out of the drier.</p>



<p>But there was an unexpected benefit: as the washed, previously-fermented coffee sat in the tank, it was still microbially charged. Yeast like <em>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</em>—a facultative anaerobe—would continue to replicate and produce alcohol underwater (though initially slower than before). With oxygen still readily available (whether dissolved in the water or through cellular oxygen), pH once again between 5-6 in the interstitial liquid, and with abundant ethanol from the previous and continuing fermentation, AAB once again kicked into gear and produced vinegar. Because it had to build population again, the initial rate of this production, though, would be low; and the water the coffee soaked in would mix with the vinegar produced by AAB and dilute it, meaning that the coffee would not spoil but would absorb just a small concentration of acetic acid from this production, while the other metabolites from the prior, dry fermentation redistributed and homogenized in the lot.</p>



<p>In low concentrations, humans perceive acetic acid as “fruity” or “floral” as well as quite sour. And in coffee, acetic acid is the only volatile organic acid present—helping to draw other volatile compounds in coffee toward the cupper and heightening the aromatic intensity of the coffee.</p>



<p>Much like the “signature” Kenyan profile.</p>



<p>But we’re not done: After the soak, the coffee would be put on raised beds in the sun in a thin layer to rapidly dry the surface water in a “pre dry” stage. This could very quickly—within a day or two—get the coffee down to ~45% moisture, accelerating the wet coffee through the most precarious stage of drying. The coffee would then be moved to the drying stage.</p>



<p>If there was not room on the drying beds, though, coffee that was partially dried—down to 20-24%—could be moved to a “holding pen” for up to several days—allowing the previous batch the opportunity to finish drying completely, and creating room on the skin drying tables for any incoming coffee exiting the soaking tanks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this “holding” of partially dried coffee would have <em>less</em> of an impact on quality<em> </em>per se (though microbial activity would continue at a lower level, and likely modulate toward filamentous fungi and yeasts) it would create an opportunity for intracellular moisture in the coffee—which was abundant due to soaking, but unevenly distributed due to the pre-drying step—to redistribute and homogenize before the coffee completed drying. The benefits of interrupted or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://repositorio.unesp.br/bitstream/handle/11449/130295/WOS000350408000016.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">intermittent drying</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scielo.br/j/cagro/a/rCJyTYJSrwvkPhkKWhjHbsG/?format=pdf&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">resting periods during drying</a> have been well established—and this additional rest would, additionally, help to preserve and protect the coffee from fade by helping the coffee dry more uniformly after resting.</p>



<hr>



<p>Over the last four years, I’ve noticed a change in the character of the coffees from the coops I bought from—coops of whose coffee I’ve been cupping since 2013 or 2014 and thought I knew quite well. The mix of cultivars hadn’t changed, and they were being processed at the same factories and mills and through the same marketing agents and exporters as before.</p>



<p>But a couple things had changed: their volume of exports had slowly decreased, and the premiums we’d paid toward improving the infrastructure at the factories, as far as we could tell, had not actually resulted in those improvements being made.</p>



<p>I noted that some changes were made to the way the coffee was processed. Because drying space was no longer in short supply—except perhaps for a short while at peak harvest—the holding pens weren’t in use anymore. The coffee went on the beds and stayed there. And of course, because in Kenya’s export system a coffee must first pass through a dry mill before auction and export, this means that unlike other countries—where coffee can be stored in parchment to homogenize or stabilize prior to final sale, it’s removed from its protective layer months before shipping and stored in warehouses without climate control dotting Nairobi. </p>



<p>If it doesn’t stabilize during drying—like in a holding pen—it would be more susceptible to fade, a phenomenon I have observed in the samples I’d tasted and Kenyan coffees I’d hoped to enjoy from other roasters.</p>



<p>And then there was the fermentation: the factories I bought from no longer practiced Kenya’s signature “secondary fermentation” or soak—and they insisted that they weren’t the only ones who’d given up the practice. I looked around, and—they were right.</p>



<p>All of those extra steps—an extra day or two in the tanks, an extra 4-5 days in drying—amount to extra costs.</p>



<p>And it’s not like the producers were getting paid more for the coffee, so—why bother?</p>



<p>At the dry mill, we faced similar volume-based conundrums. While lot sizes passing to auction might be anywhere from 1-100 bags, it was common for smaller lots to be aggregated into larger ones simply as a matter of cost efficiency. There’s “changeover” loss when mills switch between distinct lots—there’s coffee retained in the system as well as recalibrations that need to be performed. With larger mills—like those in Kenya and those that were endemic to Colombia until the last decade—the amount of loss was greater. This means that they perform more efficiently as larger lots pass through them.</p>



<p>Think of it like a coffee grinder: if your grinder retains or exchanges 2.3g of coffee every time you grind and your dose is 20g, every time you grind coffee you’re theoretically losing about 11% or adulterating the coffee you’re grinding with 11% of previous batches. But if you’re grinding 500g, loss or interjection of 2.3g is just 0.46%—hardly likely to have any significant impact on your cup, and acceptable levels of loss.</p>



<p>So if these mills need more coffee passing through them to create the Kenyan coffee we remember—and coffee production is in decline—what now?</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m pretty ambivalent about the notion of trying to buy coffee from any certain place, especially for something as increasingly available as quality. Every export system in the world functions with its own set of rules and challenges and possibilities. But Kenya’s challenges are decidedly in a class of their own.</p>



<p>I stopped working there not because I don’t love the coffee or think it’s too expensive—but because it’s too opaque, too indirect, too diffuse. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to develop an equitable relationship when it’s systematically, legally set up to be an extractive one.</p>



<p>Many of the quality challenges, I think, can be solved through appropriate economic and fiduciary mechanisms and policies. Further, small scale mills and micro mills like those in Colombia and those we’re starting to see in Ethiopia would help producers differentiate their own products as well as establish a level of traceability and separation not accessible through the current system. And liberalization efforts, like the proposed Coffee Bill 2021 under consideration by the parliament would reform many of the most egregious oversights that de facto legalize systemic corruption and the exploitation of producers today.</p>



<p>Ultimately, unless we can find ways to put more money in the hands of individual smallholders—by paying producers when an exporter takes custody, for example, and implementing financing mechanisms for producers at sustainably low interest rates, the question I asked at the outset still remains.</p>



<p>Why bother?</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 05 Jan 2022]</strong></p>



<p>A few days after I published this post, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/phil.magowao/" target="_blank">Philip Magowan</a>, a PhD candidate at University of Cambridge reached out. His research focus is on the coffee production in Kenya during the colonial period, and reading through his (unpublished) dissertation, the historical record establishes that the inequity in Kenya’s coffee production and export system is calculated, intentional, systemic and institutional in nature.</p>



<p>I look forward to linking to the dissertation when it’s published, but for now will leave you with a few paragraphs from his email:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you may well know – British settlers sought to exclude Kenyan farmers from coffee production (and until the 1950s, they had largely succeeded in doing so). My MPhil thesis research investigated the role of quality in Kenya’s coffee production. I looked at how settlers used European ideas of quality-oriented coffee production to sustain the exclusion of Kenyans from coffee farming. The settlers established exclusionary coffee research facilities, credit services and even ensured that new railroads only serviced settler areas of coffee production.</p>



<p>In particular relation to your blog, when in the 1940s, the colonial government were discussing how the first Kenyan-produced coffee crops should be processed and marketed – the settler farmers proposed that coffee from the Kenyan smallholders should be processed together in larger consignments that ignored any distinction between individual farmers’ lots. In comparison, each settler estate was marketed in sacks marked with the name of the estate, and was processed as an individual lot. This process negated any value of an individual Kenyan smallholder’s efforts, and further disincentivised farmers from working to increase the quality of their coffee. As you have highlighted for the similar issue arising today –&nbsp;<em>why bother?</em></p>



<p>Indeed, one of Kenya’s agricultural officials at the time, trying to explain to the Kenya govt why these rules were unjust, noted ‘By pooling the lots into one consignment, the quality of the greatest farmer’s coffee is rendered no better than that of the worst; like a fleet of ships, progress of the whole is tied to the slowest vessel.’ It is interesting that a similar issue arises today, where to save money lots are processed together, though at the ultimate expense of quality.</p>



<p>When writing my thesis, some of the conclusions that you came to in your blog were also apparent to me. The institutional legacy of the coffee marketing structure in the colonial period has chronically pervaded the prevailing structures today. I have never felt like I understood the contemporary industry well enough to comment, but a rewrite of these institutions from a government level does seem to be the only solution. Businesses like ACR are doing a fantastic job but the co-ops are now too significant a social/welfare role to vanish completely from the lives of coffee farmers.</p>

                                        <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec. 2, 2024 – Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) today announced that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired from the company after a distinguished 40-plus-year career and has stepped down from the board of directors, effective Dec. 1, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Intel has named two senior leaders, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-david-zinsner.html">David Zinsner</a> and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-michelle-johnston-holthaus.html">Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus</a>, as interim co-chief executive officers while the board of directors conducts a search for a new CEO. Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, a group that encompasses the company’s Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) and Network and Edge Group (NEX). Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel, will become interim executive chair during the period of transition. Intel Foundry leadership structure remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The board has formed a search committee and will work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.</p>

<p>Yeary said, “On behalf of the board, I want to thank Pat for his many years of service and dedication to Intel across a long career in technology leadership. Pat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021. As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.”</p>

<p>Yeary continued, “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence. As a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at the center of all we do. Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them. With MJ’s permanent elevation to CEO of Intel Products along with her interim co-CEO role of Intel, we are ensuring the product group will have the resources needed to deliver for our customers. Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeary concluded, “With Dave and MJ’s leadership, we will continue to act with urgency on our priorities: simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and advancing our manufacturing and foundry capabilities while optimizing our operating expenses and capital. We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.”</p>

<p>Gelsinger said, “Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime – this group of people is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I’m honored to call each and every one a colleague. Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together.&nbsp;It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel across a variety of roles, he has driven significant innovation and advanced not only the business but the broader global technology industry. A highly respected leader and skilled technologist, he has played an instrumental role in focusing on innovation while also creating a sense of urgency throughout the organization. Gelsinger began his career in 1979 at Intel, growing at the company to eventually become its first chief technology officer.</p>

<p>Zinsner and Holthaus said, “We are grateful for Pat’s commitment to Intel over these many years as well as his leadership. We will redouble our commitment to Intel Products and meeting customer needs. With our product and process leadership progressing, we will be focused on driving returns on foundry investments.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zinsner has more than 25 years of financial and operational experience in semiconductors, manufacturing and the technology industry. He joined Intel in January 2022 from Micron Technology Inc., where he was executive vice president and CFO. Zinsner served in a variety of other leadership roles earlier in his career, including president and chief operating officer at Affirmed Networks and senior vice president of finance and CFO at Analog Devices.</p>

<p>Holthaus is a proven general manager and leader who began her career with Intel nearly three decades ago. Prior to being named CEO of Intel Products, she was executive vice president and general manager of CCG. Holthaus has held a variety of management and leadership roles at Intel, including chief revenue officer and general manager of the Sales and Marketing Group, and lead of global CCG sales.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the journalist Tom Webb, who specialises in data protection, for alerting me to <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill</a>, currently going through the House of Lords.</p>



<p>It concerns the legal presumption that “mechanical instruments” (which seems to be taken to include computer networks) are working properly if they look to the user like they’re working properly. This has come in for quite a kicking in recent years. I was <a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2013/08/post-office-2nd-sight-report-into.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first alerted to it in 2013</a> by the barrister Stephen Mason. </p>



<p>Mason has spent longer than a decade telling anyone who will listen it is a deeply flawed legal presumption. <a href="https://read.uolpress.co.uk/read/3a219939-14d3-45c9-9fe0-9b42298ac587/section/0f113452-78ad-4c82-b28f-08cff1877036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here he sets out his reasoning</a>. Mason has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/12/update-law-on-computer-evidence-to-avoid-horizon-repeat-ministers-urged" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won some influential supporters</a> along the way, including Lord (James) Arbuthnot who has also spent longer than a decade campaigning on behalf of Subpostmasters affected by the Post Office scandal.</p>



<p>Although the “mechanical instruments” presumption has never, to the best of my knowledge, been quoted in any civil or criminal proceedings involving a Subpostmaster, it has been said to effectively reverse the burden of proof on anyone who might be convicted using digital evidence. </p>



<p>The logic being if the courts are going to assume a computer was working fine at the time an offence allegedly occurred because it looked like it was working fine, it is then down to the defendant to prove that it was <em>not</em> working fine. This can be extremely difficult to do (per the Seema Misra/Lee Castleton cases).  </p>



<p><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the amendment proposed</a> by Lord Arbuthnot and others. I am grateful to Tom for bringing it to my attention. It says:</p>



<p>After Clause 132, insert the following new Clause – </p>



<p>“<strong>Reliability of computer-based evidence</strong></p>



<p>(1) Electronic evidence produced by or derived from a computer, device or computer system (separately or together “system”) is admissible as evidence in any proceedings –</p>



<p>(a) where that electronic evidence and the reliability of the system that produced it or from which it is derived are not challenged;<br>(b) where the court is satisfied that the reliability of the system cannot reasonably be challenged;<br>(c) where the court is satisfied that the electronic evidence is derived from a reliable system.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="498" src="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-2048x996.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>James Arbuthnot</figcaption></figure>



<p>(2) Rules of Court must provide that electronic evidence sought to be relied upon by a party in any proceedings may be challenged by another party as to its admissibility.</p>



<p>(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), Rules of Court must provide for the circumstances in which the Court may be satisfied that the admissibility of electronic evidence cannot reasonably be challenged.</p>



<p>(4) When determining whether a system is reliable for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) the matters that may be taken into account include –</p>



<p>(a) any instructions or rules of the system that apply to its operation;<br>(b) any measures taken to secure the integrity of data held on the system;<br>(c) any measures taken to prevent unauthorised access to and use of the system;<br>(d) the security of the hardware and software used by the system;<br>(e) any measures taken to monitor and assess the reliability of the system by the system controller or operator including steps taken to fix errors or address unexpected outcomes including the regularity of and extent of any audit of the system by an independent body;<br>(f) any assessment of the reliability of the system made by a body with supervisory or regulatory functions;<br>(g) the provisions of any scheme or industry standard that apply in relation<br>to the system.</p>



<p>(5) For the purposes of this section – </p>



<p>“<em>computer</em>” means any device capable of performing mathematical or logical instructions;<br>“<em>device</em>” means any apparatus or tool operating alone or connected to other apparatus or tools, that processes information or data in electronic form;<br>“<em>electronic evidence</em>” means evidence derived from data contained in or produced by any device the functioning of which depends on a software program or from data stored on a computer, device or computer system or communicated over a networked computer system.”</p>



<p><em><strong>Member’s explanatory statement</strong><br>This amendment overturns the current legal assumption that evidence from computers is always reliable which has contributed to miscarriages of justice including the Horizon Scandal. It enables courts to ask questions of those submitting computer evidence about its reliability.</em></p>

languages, you’ll learn that Lispy languages have a special property:
they are <span>homoiconic</span>. This property is vested with mystical
powers that both enrich Lisps and debase its competitors.</p><p>I have programmed in, and built, Lisps since the late 1980s. My blog
is called “parenthetically speaking”. And yet I’m here to tell you
that this term is mostly nonsense. However, there <span>is</span> something
special—<wbr>something far less mystical, but also very powerful and
useful—<wbr>about Lisps. It’s worth understanding what that is and
transporting its essence to other languages.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part.__.Weak__.Homoiconicity)"></a>(Weak) Homoiconicity<span><a href="#(part.__.Weak__.Homoiconicity)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>What, supposedly, is homoiconicity? You will hear things like: the
property that “a property of some programming languages that allows
programs to be represented as data within the language”, or with
“represented” substituted by “manipulated”, or more simply as
“code as data”.</p><p>Let’s tease these apart a bit. Consider the following Python code:
</p><p>This is clearly a program. But can I <span>represent</span> this as a datum
within the language? Sure:
</p><p>is a perfectly good representation. (Well, it may be <span>good</span> but
it’s not <span>great</span>; we’ll return to that!) Can I <span>manipulate</span>
it? Sure, I can concatenate strings to create it:
</p><p>will produce that program, and
</p><p>will take it apart into constituent pieces.</p><p>Does that make Python homoiconic?</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing special about Python here. We can use
JavaScript to represent and manipulate JavaScript programs, C to do
the same to C programs, and so on. Essentially, any programming
language with a string datatype seems to be homoiconic. Heck, we
didn’t even need strings: we could just as well have represented the
programs as numbers (e.g., using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering">Gödel numbering</a>).</p><p>One of the traits of a good definition is that it be non-trivial: it
must capture some things but it must also exclude some things. It’s
not clear that this notion of homoiconicity excludes much of anything.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part.__.Strong__.Homoiconicity)"></a>(Strong) Homoiconicity<span><a href="#(part.__.Strong__.Homoiconicity)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>But there’s a reasonable objection to what we wrote above. All that
we’ve done is written, combined, and taken apart <span>strings</span>. But
strings are not necessarily <span>programs</span>; strings are just strings,
a form of data. Data are data, but programs—<wbr>entities
that we can <span>run</span>—<wbr>seem to be a separate thing.</p><p>How do we turn data into programs? We do need some language support
for that. We need something that will take some agreed-upon data
<span>representation</span> of a program and <span>treat it like a program</span>,
i.e., do whatever the program would have done. Typically, this is a
function called <span>eval</span><span></span>: it evaluates the datum, performing the
effects described in the datum, just as if it were a program. (Note
that <span>eval</span><span></span> really treats “data as code”, not “code as
data”.)</p><p>So maybe <span>eval</span><span></span> is the real characteristic of homoiconic
languages? Maybe. It’s certainly true that <span>eval</span><span></span> is a
distinctive feature, and some languages have it while others don’t:
that is, it non-trivially distinguishes between languages. But it’s
worth noting:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Many languages, including Python and JavaScript, have an
<span>eval</span><span></span>. If they’re all homoiconic, then clearly this isn’t a
particularly Lispy trait.</p></li><li><p><span>eval</span><span></span> interacts poorly with its lexical environment,
thereby making it hard to even program with effectively.
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">We showed</a> that JavaScript’s
<span>eval</span><span></span> is not one but four operations and there are eight
contexts that determine which of the four to use. This kind of
complexity is overwhelming.</p></li><li><p>The complexity might be worth it if <span>eval</span><span></span> were a good
idea, but it’s often a bad idea in programs! It makes code statically
invisible, making every other aspect of program management—<wbr>static
analysis, compilation, security checking, and more—<wbr>much, much harder
(or, for some important and useful kinds of analysis, impossible).</p></li></ul></div><p>This seems like a disappointing way to end: homoiconic languages are
ones that have a complex, excessively-powerful feature that we
probably shouldn’t use but is anyway found in many languages that are
not Lispy at all…which certainly doesn’t seem to be a good way to
describe what makes Lispy languages distinctive.</p><p>But this just shows why we shouldn’t be talking about homoiconicity at
all. Let’s talk about what’s actually interesting instead.</p><h3>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.The_.Parsing_.Pipeline)"></a>The Parsing Pipeline<span><a href="#(part._.The_.Parsing_.Pipeline)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>Let’s talk briefly about the classical parsing pipeline. For decades,
we’ve been taught to think of parsing a program as having two phases:
tokenization (sometimes colloquially called “lexing”) followed by
parsing (<span>not</span> colloquially called “yaccing”), and more. What do
they do?</p><p>A program is a list, or stream, of characters. A language
implementation needs to first understand what a program is saying
before it can make the program do what it says. That is, it has to
understand the meaning of a program. This process of determining
meaning is usually done in several stages, which make sense once we
understand them in terms of their expressiveness.</p><p>A typical dataflow in the front-end of a language implementation looks
like this:</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>Just as you don’t read this article at the level of individual
letters, given a program like <span>hello = 1</span>, we don’t want to deal
with it at the level of each <span>letter</span>: <span>h</span>, <span>e</span>, <span>l</span>, …
either.  Instead, we’d like to start by thinking of it as having three
<span>tokens</span>: <span>hello</span>, <span>=</span>, and <span>1</span>. Note that in the
process, we can ignore whether or not the <span>=</span> was surrounded by
spaces (which Python does not require, but some languages
do).<span><span><span>We’ll return to the elided spaces later!</span></span></span> This is the job
of the <span>scanner</span>.</p><p>So the input list or stream of characters gets transformed, by the
scanner, into an output list or stream of tokens. But as a reader, you
still don’t really read the program at the level of tokens; instead,
you assign <span>meaning</span>. That is, you presumably read the above as
“assign <span>hello</span> to <span>1</span>”.<span><span><span>The actual meaning of <span>=</span> in
Python is much more messy.</span></span></span> This is the job of the <span>parser</span>: to
create a data structure representing the high-level semantics of the
language. In this case, it might create an abstract syntax tree of a
“variable assignment”-type node with two children, one the variable being
assigned (here, <span>hello</span>) and one the value expression (here, just
<span>1</span>). If the actual expression were more complicated—<wbr>say the
program were <span>hello = 1 + 2</span>—<wbr>then there would be a more
complicated tree representing addition with two children.<span><span><span>This
being Python, of course the actual meaning of <span>+</span> is also messy.</span></span></span></p><p>The exact mechanisms by which this form of parsing happens is somewhat
outside scope here. For many languages, grammars are ambiguous and
top-down parsing strategies—<wbr>the ones you might first think
of—<wbr>don’t work, and parsing must instead happen bottom-up. This
process is complicated, algorithmically fascinating, and often bad at
giving good errors. There are very interesting trade-offs here that we
often don’t pay enough attention to.</p><p>Not every language implementation follows the above pipeline. People have,
for instance, experimented with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scannerless_parsing">parsing
without using a scanner</a>. Both conceptually and practically, it is
still useful to have this separation:
</p><div><ul><li><p>The scanner usually sits at the lowest level of the Chomsky
hierarchy: it is regular. It is therefore quick and efficient and its
rules are easy to reason about in depth.</p></li><li><p>The parser, in contrast, is usually context-free or worse,
making it a much more complicated beast.</p></li></ul></div><p>We should want to take advantage of complexity theory in building our
tools! This also represents a good separation-of-concerns, whereby we
could imagine building multiple parsers—<wbr>for instance, trading off
speed or space (or both) for better error messages—<wbr>while reusing the
same scanner.</p><p>In what follows, therefore, I will take the scanner as a
given. Thus, the traditional pipeline then has just one stage:
the parser. I therefore call this the <span>unicameral</span> pipeline.</p><h3>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.The_.Bicameral_.Analogy)"></a>The Bicameral Analogy<span><a href="#(part._.The_.Bicameral_.Analogy)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>Many countries have what is called a <span>bicameral</span> legislature:
“bi” meaning two, “camera” meaning room. That is, there are two
houses of parliament. India, for instance, has the Lok Sabha and Rajya
Sabha; England has the House of Commons and House of Lords; the USA
has the House of Representatives and Senate. In all cases, there is a
“lower” house and “upper” house.</p><p>My goal here is not to endorse various class-related associations or
to delve into the actual practices, but rather to employ this as a
useful, rough analogy. A theory of bicamerality is this. The lower
house is a bit more rowdy and boisterous. It filters out some of the
more absurd legislations, but it allows through many that are perhaps
not entirely wise. The upper house is more calm and deliberative; in
legislatures, its members are either appointed or serve longer terms,
so they do not need to bend to every populist will. Therefore, the
upper house usefully serves as a filter.</p><p>So: we have two houses. The lower house filters out dreck, but lets
through several bills, some of which are unwise. The upper house
passes judgment on these bills, allowing only the ones it considers
wise. Enough political science, back to computer science.</p><h3>5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Bicameral_.Syntax)"></a>Bicameral Syntax<span><a href="#(part._.Bicameral_.Syntax)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>As I’ve alluded above, having just a parser gives you a unicameral
syntax. What Lispy languages give you is a <span>bicameral</span>
syntax. But they are not unique in this; other notations, such as XML
and JSON, are also bicameral. To make my point, I will use these other
notations.</p><p>First of all, all these notations have to get through a scanner. In
XML, you can’t write <span>&lt;title</span> <span>without</span> a closing <span>&gt;</span>;
that’s just not even a valid opening tag. In JSON, you can’t write
<span>"hi</span> without a closing <span>"</span>; that’s just not a valid string. We
can think of these as basic tokenization failures. So let’s assume our
input passes the scanner and we get a list or stream of tokens.</p><p>Even once you’ve written proper tokens, there are still things you
cannot do in XML or JSON. For instance, the following full document is
not legal in XML:
</p><div><p><span>&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;This is my bar&lt;/bar&gt;</span></p></div><p>because we didn’t “close” <span>&lt;foo&gt;</span> with a <span>&lt;/foo&gt;</span>; this
isn’t legal either,
</p><div><p><span>&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;This is my bar&lt;/foo&gt;&lt;/bar&gt;</span></p></div><p>because we didn’t preserve the nesting structure (we should close
<span>bar</span> befor we close <span>foo</span>). The same is true in JSON: we can’t
open a structure without closing it (or vice versa); similarly, we
have to close braces and brackets in the opposite order of how we
opened them.</p><p>Observe that we can make these judgments <span>without knowing what
the datum represents</span>. There’s a reason I used names like <span>foo</span> and
<span>bar</span> instead of something meaningful. That’s because it doesn’t
matter: these XML and JSON data are wrong at a <span>basic</span> level. We
say that they fail to be <span>well-formed</span>. This is our lower house.</p><p>However, there may be more complicated rules at play. It may be that
a <span>bar</span> really should not reside within a <span>foo</span>; it may be that
every <span>baz</span> requires one or more <span>quux</span>es. If you’ve ever worked
with an XML or JSON format, you know that there are all kinds of rules
like this (that may or may not have been documented well!) that you
need to follow. For instance, when you read the documentation of a Web
API, it might tell you that a certain kind of request needs to provide
certain fields, but must also <span>not</span> provide certain other
keys. All these are called rules of <span>validity</span>. They build on top
of—<wbr>indeed, leave unstated—<wbr>the well-formedness rules, and focus on
what wasn’t checked there. This is the upper house.</p><p>This leads to a new pipeline, one where some tool performs an
intermediate check for well-formedness, and another for validity. The
last stage—<wbr>the one that checks validity and, having confirmed it,
produces terms tagged with their “parts of speech”—<wbr>is still the
parser. But now there’s one more tool in the middle. I don’t believe
there’s a standard name for it, but there should be; following Lisp
tradition, I call it the <span>reader</span>:
</p><div><p><span>Scaner --&gt; Reader --&gt; Parser</span></p></div><p>Now, as written, it’s not clear what the output of the reader is. It
could be that the reader just <span>checks</span> the tokens, and then
passes on the same token list or stream to the parser, just as in the
previous pipeline. But this would be a loss! The reader has the
ability to construct an extremely useful intermediate data
structure. The main property the reader looks for is that
“things match up and nest properly”. In other words, the reader is
confirming that the input is a <span>tree</span>. Thus, instead of passing
on a dumb, flat list of tokens to the parser, it constructs trees.</p><p>This greatly simplifies the job of the parser for two reasons. At a
more basic level, some of the checking that the parser previously had
to do is already done. More interestingly, tokens are very low-level;
trees are high-level. It’s much easier to write a recursive function
that checks for validity and produces abstract syntax trees when
already given well-formed trees as an input!<span><span><span>For this reason,
<a href="https://plai.org/">PLAI</a> calls this the “Primus Inter
Parsers”, a joke that seems lost on most.</span></span></span></p><p>Again, complexity theory is a useful guide, and what we have done is
steadily ratchet up the complexity:
</p><div><ul><li><p>The scanner is still regular, with all the attendant benefits
and weaknesses.</p></li><li><p>The reader is context-free. It does not need to do more
than that.</p></li><li><p>The parser is now freed of basic context-free checks, and can
focus on other context-free and, in particular,
context-<span>sensitive</span> checks.</p></li></ul></div><p>And once again, we can exploit this separation of concerns to swap out
other implementations if we need to.</p><p>This, then, is a <span>bicameral syntax</span>. The reader is the “lower
house”; it rejects basic mistakes, but still lets through some
invalid things. But it also presents them wrapped up in a cleaner,
simpler structure to work with. The parser is the “upper house”; it
receives this clean structure and can look for deeper flaws in it,
only allowing those things that pass its more exacting scrutiny.</p><p>The advantages to a bicameral syntax are many:
</p><div><ul><li><p>We get a greater separation of concerns, making it easier to
both understand and to swap out components.</p></li><li><p>We get to more gradually walk up the complexity hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>The reader sits at a key intermediate level, turning tokens into
trees, thereby greatly simplifying the parser’s task while itself
being quite easy to write.</p></li></ul></div><p>This simplicity of (correct!) implementation matters! It doesn’t
matter as much when you have only one implementation of a
language. However, a lot of our traffic in computing is best
represented as trees: they are much more powerful than strings, but
also simple enough to write and read. It is therefore no surprise that
bicameral syntaxes like JSON have become ubiquitous. <span>Every</span>
language now needs a reader for them, and these readers have to
implement the same language, so simplicity of specification and of
implementation are a virtue. In turn, many systems need to separately
validate a JSON input; again, the simplicity of writing this kind of
(tree-consuming) parser is a big win.</p><p>This additional level also has other tooling advantages. It’s not only
language implementations that need to support syntax; so do
editors. It’s a lot easier to support matching, indentation, coloring,
and so on at the well-formedness level. And it’s <span>easy</span> to indent
trees! It’s also easy to traverse them: there are meaningful
<span>generic</span> tree-level operations (“go to the opening”, “go to
the closing”, “go up a level”, “go down a level”, etc.) that can
be applied to all languages with the same well-formedness
characteristic (e.g., JSON).  And again, we have lots of editors, and
they each need to support the same syntaxes; bicameral languages, by
providing the intermediate notion of well-formedness, let tools hit
the trifecta of: correct, useful, and relatively easy.</p><p>These advantages are offset by one drawback: some people just don’t
<span>like</span> them. It feels constraining to some to always write
programs in terms of trees, rather than more free-form syntax. Even in
this bicameral space, there are trade-offs: XML requires you to repeat
tags at closing, which improves error-checking and catches errors in
refactoring, but makes authoring painful; Lisps don’t require tag
repetition but, traditionally, use only one kind of parenthesis,
making structure harder to see; JSON mixes delimiters while avoiding
closing tags, which seems to be some kind of sweet-spot (because it
still provides some checking against editing errors). Still, what
people are willing to embrace for writing data seems to irk them when
writing programs, leading to the long-standing hatred for Lispy
syntaxes.</p><h3>6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Back_to_.Lisps)"></a>Back to Lisps<span><a href="#(part._.Back_to_.Lisps)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>We started with Lisp, so let’s go back there. What is Lisp? Lisp is a
feeling, an emotion, a sentiment; Lisp is a vibe; Lisp is the dew on
morning grass, it’s the scent of pine wafting on a breeze, it’s the
sound of a cricket ball on a bat, it’s the…oh, wait, where was
I. Sorry.</p><p>Okay, seriously. Note that I keep writing “Lispy languages”: both
the “y” and “[language]s” should have stood out by now. What do I
mean by this?</p><p>I’m not referring to a particular language: Common Lisp, say. I’m
referring to a family of languages, which includes Common Lisp but
also Scheme and Racket and Clojure and many others. This family is
bound by some cultural antecedents, but the individual languages can
be wildly different. What they share is a <span>philosophy of
syntax</span>. And now that we’ve fleshed out that philosophy, if we are
being generous, we could allow that <span>any</span> bicameral language is
at its essence “Lispy”.</p><p>The power of this philosophy is that the language platform can
implement its bicameral syntax once, and well, and lots of languages
can inherit it. We noted above that there are many (data) languages
built atop JSON, each of which has its own validity rules. We can
likewise build many data and programming languages atop any bicameral
syntax; they will share some familial traits but differ quite a bit in
the details.</p><p>The bicamerality of Lisps, however, leads to some
misconceptions:
</p><div><ol><li><p>It does not dictate a particular implementation strategy. For
instance, the argument in Lisp sometimes goes, “code is data because
code is represented using s-expressions, which are also Lisp data”. A
full tutorial of what these terms means is beyond what I want to get
into here. What I will just say is that there are Lispy languages
where this is not true at all.</p><p>The one I know best is Racket, because I originally built some of
these parts of it. In Racket, code is not represented using
s-expressions. This is because “code” requires many more things: it
needs, for instance, to record the source locations so that it can use
it to report errors;<span><span><span>Remember those whitespaces we said we could
ignore? We can’t if we want to report errors!</span></span></span>
it needs hygiene information to avoid inadvertent
capture; and more. Therefore, Racket has a notion of
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/stxops.html"><span>syntax</span> object</a>
(which, yes, is a datum) that captures this much richer notion of
“program source”. Syntax is a separate type that happens to parallel
(and enrich) s-expressions and can be interconverted with them, but it
is not an s-expression. So, while there is a large family of functions
that operate on (say) lists, and s-expressions include lists, none of
those functions will apply to syntax.</p></li><li><p>People will sometimes say that the <span>read</span><span></span> primitive
“parses”. It does not: it reads. It “parses” inasmuch as it
confirms that the input is well-formed, but it is not the parser of
convention—<wbr>one that determines validity according to
context-sensitive rules, and identifies “parts of speech”—<wbr>so it is
false to say that Lisps ship with a parser.</p><p>To make this concrete, here is a well-formed Lispy term that
<span>read</span><span></span> has no problem with: <span>(</span><span>lambda</span><span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span></span>. That is, however,
a <span>syntax</span> error in most Lisps: a determination made by the
parser, not the reader. Of course, nothing prevents us from creating a
new language where that term has some meaning. That language’s parser
would be responsible for making sense out of the pieces.</p></li><li><p>People sometimes believe you can only have macros if you have a
bicameral syntax. This isn’t true: all you need is a way to represent
code, because macros transform code to code. But as more languages
have realized the benefits of having macros, some have added
<span>procedural</span> macros (an idea that dates back decades in Lisp
lore). Bicameral syntaxes just provide a gateway to gloriously rich
macro systems, because we’ve learned that the well-formedness layer is
an especially good layer atop which to build macros.</p></li></ol></div><h3>7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.What_.About_.Other_.Languages_)"></a>What About Other Languages?<span><a href="#(part._.What_.About_.Other_.Languages_)" title="Link to here">🔗</a><span> </span></span></h3><p>I want to end with some forward-looking comments.</p><p>One of my frequent sources of amusement—<wbr>and frustration—<wbr>is to
search for people asking “How do I build a programming language?”
and reading the advice they get. These conversations invariably get
mired in syntax issues. But by the time the novice gets through
building all the knick-knacks of syntax and learning to build parsers,
they’ve usually exhausted their complexity, cognitive, and time
budget. The resulting language either never gets done or is a semantic
mess.</p><p>I would like to suggest another path forward: start with a bicameral
syntax. Quickly get to the point where you can think about
<span>semantics</span>. What does your language <span>do</span>? How does one
reason about programs? How does one run them? Do all the hard and
interesting and important parts first.</p><p>But, you argue, “Now I have a bicameral syntax! Nobody will want to
program in it!” And that may be true. But I want you to consider the
following perspective:</p><blockquote><p>Syntax is a view.</p></blockquote><p>One of the enduring lessons we’ve learned from software design is the
model-view separation: that is, there are often many useful ways to
view the same thing, some of which we haven’t even dreamt up yet, so
it’s wise to separate an object from how we view it (and coordinate
the different views). This principle seems to virtually never be
applied to programs, but it should! We should view the <span>abstract</span>
syntax as the model—<wbr>the “one true program”—<wbr>and <span>every</span>
syntax as a view on it.</p><p>So what you should really do is define an abstract syntax, and layer a
light bicameral concrete syntax on top of it. Then build all the other
parts. And then, think about what views you want to provide. Some
people may be happy with the bicameral syntax. Others may want a more
traditional infix syntax. Some may want braces, some may want
significant whitespace. Some users may even want to use blocks—<wbr>the
ultimate bicameral syntax. You can (and should) view syntaxes as the fun
desserts that you get to design and deploy once the hard work is
done.<span><span><span>This is not to say syntax is not hard; it’s actually
harder than most people think, because it requires a delicate
interplay between mathematics and human factors.</span></span></span>
Both
<a href="https://www.hashcollision.org/brainfudge/">F*dging up a Racket</a> and, in much more depth,
<a href="https://beautifulracket.com/">Beautiful Racket</a>
illustrate this principle practically and beautifully.</p><p>This perspective also gives you a useful artifact: a bicameral syntax
that is a very nice target for programs that need to generate programs
in your language. This is no longer a new idea, so you don’t have to
feel radical: formats like SMT-LIB and WebAssembly text format are
s-expressions for a reason. Our <a href="https://forge-fm.org/">Forge</a> tool supports both an
syntax based on <a href="https://alloytools.org/">Alloy</a> and one in s-expressions, the former
for (most) people to use, the latter a target to tools that use Forge
as a back-end.</p><p>In short, I hope this inspires a new vision of syntax
design. Bicamerality is the best intermediate language we’ve come up
with; it’s driven by both theoretical elegance and practical
experience. For some, the bicameral syntax is also a lovely source
language, but it should be just one of many views onto the core
abstract syntax. Tools will become more reusable, and at the same
time, the syntax wars can end. We can find peace, joy, and
happiness. It is not a coincidence that a pair of parentheses looks
like an embrace.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Following a public vote in which more than 37,000 people had their say, we’re pleased to announce that the Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is ‘brain rot’.</p>
<p>Our language experts created a shortlist of six words to reflect the moods and conversations that have helped shape the past year. After two weeks of public voting and widespread conversation, our experts came together to consider the public’s input, voting results, and our language data, before declaring ‘brain rot’ as the definitive Word of the Year for 2024.</p>

<div data-aos="fade-up" id="block_4c972f2c674656b1ba770666f7af4238">
                <div data-aos="fade-up">
            <h3><strong>Why ‘brain rot’?</strong></h3>
<p>‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration”.</p>
<p>Our experts noticed that ‘brain rot’ gained new prominence this year as a term used to capture concerns about the impact of consuming excessive amounts of low-quality online content, especially on social media. The term increased in usage frequency by 230% between 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>The first recorded use of ‘brain rot’ was found in 1854 in Henry David Thoreau’s book <em>Walden</em>, which reports his experiences of living a simple lifestyle in the natural world. As part of his conclusions, Thoreau criticizes society’s tendency to devalue complex ideas, or those that can be interpreted in multiple ways, in favour of simple ones, and sees this as indicative of a general decline in mental and intellectual effort: <em>“While England endeavours to cure the potato rot, will not any endeavour to cure the brain-rot – which prevails so much more widely and fatally?”</em></p>

        </div>                
                <p><img src="https://corp.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/OxfordWOTY_brainrot_graph.png" alt="A trend graph that depicts usage of " brain="" rot'="" in="" 2024.'="">
                                    </p>
            </div>







<p>The term has taken on new significance in the digital age, especially over the past 12 months. Initially gaining traction on social media platform—particularly on TikTok among Gen Z and Gen Alpha communities—’brain rot’ is now seeing more widespread use, such as in mainstream journalism, amidst societal concerns about the negative impact of overconsuming online content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, ‘brain rot’ is used to describe both the cause and effect of this, referring to low-quality, low-value content found on social media and the internet, as well as the subsequent negative impact that consuming this type of content is perceived to have on an individual or society.</p>



<p>It has also been used more specifically and consistently in reference to online culture. Often used in a humorous or self-deprecating manner by online communities, it is strongly associated with certain types of content—including creator Alexey Gerasimov’s viral <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> video series, featuring humanoid toilets, and user-generated ‘only in Ohio’ memes, which reference bizarre incidents in the state. This content has given rise to emerging ‘brain rot language’—such as ‘skibidi’, meaning something nonsensical, and ‘Ohio’, meaning something embarrassing or weird—which reflects a growing trend of words originating in viral online culture before spreading offline into the ‘real world’.</p>



<p>Now also gaining momentum is a broader, more serious conversation about the potential negative impact that excessively consuming this content might have on mental health, particularly in children and young people. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/co-occurring-disorders/brain-rot/#:~:text=Brain%20rot%20is%20a%20condition,negative%20and%20distressing%20news%20online." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mental health centre</a> in the US even published advice online about how to recognize and avoid ‘brain rot’.</p>



<p>Speaking about this year’s selection process and the 2024 winner, Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, said:</p>



<p><em>“It’s been insightful and deeply moving to see language lovers all over the world participate and help us select the Oxford Word of the Year 2024.</em></p>



<p><em>“Looking back at the Oxford Word of the Year over the past two decades, you can see society’s growing preoccupation with how our virtual lives are evolving, the way internet culture is permeating so much of who we are and what we talk about. Last year’s winning word, ‘rizz’, was an interesting example of how language is increasingly formed, shaped, and shared within online communities. ‘Brain rot’ speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time. It feels like a rightful next chapter in the cultural conversation about humanity and technology. It’s not surprising that so many voters embraced the term, endorsing it as our choice this year.</em></p>



<p><em>“I find it fascinating that the term ‘brain rot’ has been adopted by Gen Z and Gen Alpha, those communities largely responsible for the use and creation of the digital content the term refers to. These communities have amplified the expression through social media channels, the very place said to cause ‘brain rot’. It demonstrates a somewhat cheeky self-awareness in the younger generations about the harmful impact of social media that they’ve inherited.”</em></p>

    <p>Throughout my career, I have found git submodules to be a pain. Because I did not understand them, I kept getting myself into frustrating situations.</p>

<p>So, I finally sat down and learned how git tracks submodules. Turns out, it’s not complex at all. It’s just different from how git tracks regular files. It’s just one more thing you have to learn.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll explain exactly what I needed to know in order to work with submodules without inflicting self-damage.</p>

<p>(This article doesn’t discuss whether submodules are good/bad, or if you should use them or not – a valid discussion, but out of scope.)</p>

<h2 id="the-lay-of-the-land">The lay of the land</h2>
<p>This article will make more sense if we use concrete examples.</p>

<p>Allow me to describe a toy webapp we’re building. Call this repo <code>webapp</code>. Here are the contents of the repo.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] ls

.git/
README.md
tests/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Say you want to import some library. It lives in its own repo, <code>library</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/library] ls

.git/

</code></pre></div>

<p>Shortly, I’ll explain how submodules work. But, first, let me dramatically re-enact something that has happened to me multiple times. This is what it looks like to use submodules without understanding them.</p>

<p>Ah, 2012. What a time to be a “full-stack engineer”! I wonder what contributions await me on the main branch!</p>

<p>(For the sake of readability, in this article, instead of using real commit SHAs, I’m going to use fake descriptive ones.)</p>

<p>Let’s pull to make sure I’m up-to-date with the remote.</p>

<p>After I pull, I like to confirm that my working tree is clean.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

<p>What’s this? I’ve made modifications to <code>library</code>? I never touch that directory.</p>

<p>It’s weird that I’ve modified a <em>directory</em>. Usually git just says I’ve modified a specific <em>file</em>.</p>

<p>Well, what does <code>git diff</code> have to say?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git diff

<p>Apparently, I deleted <code>Subproject commit library_new_commit_sha</code> and added <code>Subproject commit library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>Surely I didn’t do that. That’s weird, let me do a hard reset.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git reset --hard origin/main

HEAD is now at webapp_new_commit_sha point submodule to newest commit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Did it make the git diff go away?</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
 M library
</code></pre></div>

<p>It did not! I am really confused now!</p>

<p>Well, the usual way I make local modifications go away is <code>git reset --hard</code>, and that didn’t work. The other way is to commit the changes.</p>

<p>(Sometimes, people don’t even notice the diff above, and accidentally do this.)</p>

<p><strong>My future self</strong>: <em>Don’t do it! If you <code>git add</code> that change, you’ll be rolling back a change someone else made!</em></p>

<p>What’s going on, of course, is that <code>library</code> is a submodule, and you have to do special stuff to deal with them.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into submodules.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-submodule">What’s a submodule?</h2>
<p>A git submodule is a full repo that’s been nested inside another repo. Any repo can be a submodule of another.</p>

<p>So, <code>library</code> is a full repo that has been nested inside <code>webapp</code> as a submodule.</p>

<p>That doesn’t seem so confusing, does it? However, there are two important, and tricky, facts about submodules. These facts are why so many people trip up on submodules.</p>

<h3 id="1-a-submodule-is-always-pinned-to-a-specific-commit">1. A submodule is always pinned to a specific commit</h3>
<p>You know how package managers let you be  fuzzy when specifying a package version (“get me any version of <code>requests</code> so long as it’s 2.x.x”), or to pin an exact version (“use <code>requests</code> 2.31.0 exactly”)?</p>

<p>Submodules can <em>only</em> be pinned to a specific commit. This is because a submodule isn’t a package; it’s code that you have embedded in another repo, and git wants you to be precise.</p>

<p>We’ll see exactly how this pinning works shortly.</p>

<h3 id="2-git-does-not-automatically-download-or-update-submodules">2. git does not automatically download or update submodules</h3>
<p>If you clone <code>webapp</code> afresh, git <em>will not</em> automatically download <code>library</code> for you (unless you clone using <code>git clone --recursive</code>)</p>

<p>Similarly, if a collaborator pins <code>webapp</code> to a new commit of <code>library</code>, and you <code>git pull</code> <code>webapp</code>, git <em>will not</em> automatically update <code>library</code> for you.</p>

<p>This is actually what’s happening in the dramatic re-enactment above. Let me rewind a little bit to show what happened.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-someone-updates-a-submodule">What happens when someone updates a submodule?</h2>
<p>In the beginning, <code>webapp</code> pointed to <code>webapp_old_commit_sha</code>, which pinned <code>library</code> to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules1.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram of two git repositories, webapp and library. It shows that the old_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the old_sha commit of the library repo. The old_sha commit of the webapp repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. The old_sha commit of the library repo also has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'."></p>

<p>(Think of <code>HEAD</code> as “current commit”.)</p>

<p>Then, my collaborator made changes to <code>library</code>. Remember, <code>library</code> is a full repo, so after they did their work, they did what you always do after you make changes: they committed and pushed the new commit, <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>They weren’t done, though. <code>webapp</code> must point to a specific commit of <code>library</code>, so in order to use <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, my collaborator then pushed a new commit to <code>webpapp</code>, <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>, which points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing, though! <em>git does not automatically update submodules</em>, so <code>library</code> still points to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules2.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram of two git repositories, webapp and library. It shows that the old_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the old_sha commit of the library repo. The new_sha commit of the webapp repo points to the new_sha of the library repo. The new_sha commit of the webapp repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. The old_sha commit of the library repo has a purple border around it, saying 'HEAD'. A red arrow points to the purple border around old_sha in the library repo. The red arrow is linked to a speech bubble which says, 'library still points at old_sha!'"></p>

<p>I think this will be a lot less confusing if we look at exactly how git tracks submodules.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-git-pin-a-submodule-to-a-specific-commit">How does git pin a submodule to a specific commit?</h3>
<p>The latest commit of <code>webapp</code> is <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>. Let’s inspect that commit.</p>

<p>A commit is just a file on disk. However, it’s optimized/compressed, so we use a built-in utility to view it. Here’s what the commit stores.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git cat-file -p `webapp_new_commit_sha`

tree 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4
parent webapp_old_commit_sha

committer Dmitry Mazin &lt;dm@cyberdemon.org&gt; 1708717288 +0000

point submodule to newest commit
</code></pre></div>

<p>What we care about is <code>tree 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4</code>. The <em>tree</em> object represents the directory listing of your repo. When you think trees, think directories.</p>

<p>Let’s inspect the tree object.</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git cat-file -p 92018fc6ac6e71ea3dfb57e2fab9d3fe23b6fdf4

100644 blob     6feaf03c7a9c805ff734a90a245a417e6a6c099b    .gitmodules

160000 commit   library_new_commit_sha                      library
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note how <code>tests</code> is a <code>tree</code> (just like directories can hold directories, trees can point to trees).</p>

<p>But <code>library</code> is a… commit?!</p>

<div><pre><code>160000 commit   library_new_commit_sha                      library
</code></pre></div>

<p>That weirdness, right there, is precisely how git knows <code>library</code> points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>In other words, the way git implements submodules is by doing a weird trick where a tree points to a <em>commit</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyberdemon.org/assets/submodules3.png" alt="Hand-drawn diagram showing the text 'webapp_new_commit_sha' connected, via arrow, to 'tree a425' which is itself connected, via arrow, to 'library_new_commit_sha'"></p>

<p>Let’s use this knowledge to understand the <code>git diff</code> from earlier.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-git-diff">Understanding git diff</h2>
<p>Here’s the diff again.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git diff

diff --git a/library b/library
index library_old_commit_sha..library_new_commit_sha 160000
--- a/library
+++ b/library
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Subproject commit library_new_commit_sha
+Subproject commit library_old_commit_sha
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s confusing that it’s saying that <strong>I</strong> modified <code>library</code>. I didn’t modify it, someone else did!</p>

<p>Usually, I think of <code>git diff</code> as “here are the changes I have made”. But this isn’t exactly correct.</p>

<p>When you invoke <code>git diff</code>, you’re asking git to tell you the difference between your working tree (that is, your unstaged, uncommitted local changes) and the most recent commit of your branch (<code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>).</p>

<p>When you look at it that way, the above git diff starts to make sense. In <code>webapp_new_commit_sha</code>, <code>library</code> points to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, but in our working tree, <code>library</code> still points to <code>library_old_commit_sha</code>.</p>

<p>git has no idea which change happened first. It only knows that your working tree is different from the commit. And, so it tells you: <code>library_new_commit_sha</code> is saying that library should point to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>, but it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Understanding the above took the pain out of submodules for me. However, I still haven’t told you how to update a submodule.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-update-a-submodule">How to update a submodule</h2>
<p>We now understand that we need to point <code>library</code> to <code>library_new_commit_sha</code>. How?</p>

<p>Because <code>library</code> is a full repo, I could just <code>cd</code> into it and literally check out that commit:</p>
<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] cd library

$ [/library] git checkout library_new_commit_sha

Previous HEAD position was library_old_commit_sha README
HEAD is now at library_new_commit_sha add some cool functions
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we go back into <code>webapp</code>, we’ll see that <code>git st</code>/<code>git diff</code> finally look clean.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] git st

## main...origin/main
# (no output)

$ [/webapp] git diff

# (no output)
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, you don’t actually need to do the above.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-really-update-a-submodule">How to really update a submodule</h2>
<p>From <code>webapp</code>, we can invoke <code>git submodule update</code>. This updates <em>all</em> of a repo’s submodules.</p>

<p>People often use certain flags with <code>git submodule update</code>, so let’s understand them.</p>

<h3 id="initialize-a-submodule-git-submodule-update---init">Initialize a submodule: <code>git submodule update --init</code></h3>
<p>Remember how I said that if you <code>git clone webapp</code>, git won’t actually download the contents of <code>library</code>?</p>

<p>What you’re supposed to do is, after cloning webapp:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run <code>git submodule init</code> to initialize the submodules. This doesn’t actually download them, though 🙃️.</li>
  <li>Run <code>git submodule update</code> to actually pull the submodules.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is kind of a silly dance, so git lets you just do <code>git submodule update --init</code>. This initializes any submodules and updates them in one step. I <em>always</em> pass <code>--init</code> because there is no harm in doing so.</p>

<p>You can skip <code>--init</code> by cloning with <code>--recursive</code>: that is, you could have done <code>git clone webapp --recursive</code>. I never remember to do this, though. Plus, you end up having to do <code>git update submodule</code> anyway.</p>

<h3 id="update-submodules-of-submodules-git-submodule-update---recursive">Update submodules of submodules: <code>git submodule update --recursive</code></h3>
<p>Submodules can nest other submodules. Yeah.</p>

<p>So, to take care of updating submodules <em>all the way down</em>, pretty much just always pass <code>--recursive</code> to <code>git submodule update</code>.</p>

<p><strong>So, the command I always end up using is <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code>.</strong></p>

<h3 id="make-git-automatically-update-submodules-git-config-submodulerecurse-true">Make git automatically update submodules: <code>git config submodule.recurse true</code></h3>
<p><code>submodule.recurse true</code> makes submodules automatically update when you <code>git pull</code>, <code>git checkout</code>, etc. In other words, it makes submodules automatically point to whatever they are supposed to point to. It’s only available in git 2.14 and newer.</p>

<p>That makes running <code>git submodule update</code> unnecessary.</p>

<p>I don’t use this setting, because I’m not sure if there are drawbacks or not. Plus, I work on submodules enough that I think it could cause conflicts. Let me know if you’re aware of shortcomings, or if you’ve been using this setting forever without issue!</p>

<p>This setting definitely does <em>not</em> apply to <code>git clone</code>. So you still need to do <code>git clone --recursive</code> or init/update submodules using the commands above.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>I think I can summarize submodules pretty simply.</p>

<p>It’s possible to embed a repo within another repo. This is called a submodule.</p>

<p>Each commit of the outer repo always specifies an <em>exact</em> commit that submodule. This is done by the <code>outer commit -&gt; tree -&gt; submodule commit</code> link.</p>

<p>When you check out commits, git doesn’t automatically update submodules for you. You have to do that using <code>git submodule update</code>.</p>

<p>And there we have it!</p>

<h2 id="further-topics-in-submodules">Further topics in submodules</h2>
<p>The above is enough to hopefully take the confusion out of submodules. However, there are more common commands and configs that I’d like to explain.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-add-a-submodule-git-submodule-add">How to add a submodule: <code>git submodule add</code></h3>
<p>Let’s say that I start <code>webapp</code> fresh, and I have not added <code>library</code> to it yet.</p>

<p>To add <code>library</code>, I’d do <code>git submodule add https://github.com/dmazin/library.git library</code>.</p>

<p>This will add (or update) the <code>.gitmodules</code> file of <code>webapp</code>, download <code>library</code>, and point <code>webapp</code> at the latest commit of <code>library</code>.</p>

<p>Remember, this actually modifies <code>webapp</code>, so you need to commit after that. But you thankfully don’t need to do <code>git submodule update</code> after doing <code>git submodule add</code> or anything.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-do-after-ive-modified-a-submodule">What do I do after I’ve modified a submodule?</h3>
<p>Remember that <code>library</code> is a full repo, so if you want to make changes to it, you can. Just make changes and commit them to the main branch.</p>

<p>But how do you make <code>webapp</code> point at the new commit? There are a couple ways.</p>

<h4 id="without-a-command">Without a command</h4>
<p>You can go into <code>webapp</code>, then <code>cd library</code>, and just do <code>git pull</code> in there. When you <code>cd</code> back into <code>webapp</code>, if you <code>git diff</code> you’ll see that <code>webapp</code> points to the newest branch of <code>library</code>. You can commit that.</p>

<h4 id="using-git-submodule-update---remote----library">Using <code>git submodule update --remote -- library</code></h4>
<p>This tells git “make the submodule point to the latest remote commit”. Since you have pushed the latest commit of library to library’s remote, this will make <code>webapp</code> point to that commit.</p>

<p>But note that <code>git submodule update --remote</code> will do this to <em>all</em> your submodules. You likely do not want that.</p>

<p>For that reason, you have to do <code>git submodule update --remote -- library</code> to limit this to library only. (If you’re thrown off by the fact that you have to do <code>-- library</code> – yeah, it’s kind of weird.)</p>

<p>Because <code>--remote</code> might accidentally update all the submodules, honestly I usually do the “without a command” method.</p>

<h3 id="the-gitmodules-file">The .gitmodules file</h3>
<p>How does git know where to download <code>library</code> from?
git uses a file called <code>.gitmodules</code> to track the basic facts of a submodule, like the repo URL.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ [/webapp] cat .gitmodules

[submodule "library"]
        path = library
        url = https://github.com/dmazin/library.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>The nice thing about <code>.gitmodules</code> is that it’s a regular file, tracked the regular way in git. That makes it not confusing.</p>

<p>(What I don’t understand is, why git didn’t just put the submodule commit right in .gitmodules? The commits of <code>webapp</code> would <em>still</em> be able to specify exact commits of <code>library</code> to use. What am I missing?)</p>

<h3 id="making-submodules-use-branches-other-than-main">Making submodules use branches other than main</h3>
<p>If you want to, you can make <code>library</code> track whatever branch you want. Otherwise, it defaults to whatever the “main” branch is.</p>

<div><pre><code>[submodule "library"]
        path = library
        url = https://github.com/dmazin/library.git
        branch = staging
</code></pre></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The message appears in <code>sudo</code>’s revision control (in its current guise) <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/c101e9572d7f" rel="noreferrer">in June 1993</a>, in the University of Colorado version of <code>sudo</code>, in a slightly shorter form:</p>

<pre><code>We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local Systems
Administrator. It usually boils down to these two things:

        #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
</code></pre>

<p>This initial commit also introduced <code>sudo</code>’s <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/" rel="noreferrer">other famous message</a>, “This incident will be reported.”</p>

<p>The author of the commit is Todd C. Miller, the maintainer of CU <code>sudo</code> (now plain <code>sudo</code>, still maintained by Todd), but the source code predates the commit; and while the source mentions Jeff Nieusma, the messages <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-message-that-comes-up-when-you-use-sudo-for-the-first-time/answer/Brian-Bi" rel="noreferrer">predate his involvement too</a> and their author is presumably either Bob Coggeshall or Evi Nemeth (see also “<a href="https://www.sudo.ws/history.html" rel="noreferrer">A Brief History of Sudo</a>”). The source history doesn’t suggest any particular background to the change. The message is typical of warning messages which were displayed when logging in to academic systems at the time.</p>

<p><code>sudo</code> was published in the <em>UNIX System Administration Handbook</em>, written by  Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, and Scott Seebass; <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_0139334416/page/468" rel="noreferrer">the version published in the first edition</a> doesn’t include a warning in the program itself, but the authors mention that users who were granted <code>sudo</code> access were sent a (lengthy) email reminding them of the responsibilities associated with that privilege.</p>

<p>The third item was <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/repos/sudo/rev/ebd5a76ccd7e" rel="noreferrer">added in January 2004</a>, with a more interesting commit message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add Stan Lee / Uncle Ben quote to the lecture from RedHat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Said quote (which, as <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/users/4147/tommy">Tommy</a> <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/12521/when-was-the-famous-sudo-warning-introduced-under-what-background-by-whom#comment39312_12522">points out</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility" rel="noreferrer">wasn’t coined by Stan Lee</a>) was added to Red Hat’s <code>sudo</code> package as a patch on top of version 1.6.6, in June 2002.</p>

All I ask is that you let us know your financial needs and their general purpose so that we can maximize the number of people we can help.</p><p>To be clear, while the original intent was to provide dinner expenses for the holidays, this need not be the only reason you ask for funds.</p><p>Reasonable requests include:</p><p>- Holiday housing</p><p>- Toys/gifts for family members</p><p>- Food</p><p>- Travel assistance</p><p>- Medical expenses</p><p>- Entertainment for the family</p><p>I understand that it can be tough to ask for help. The majority of those who request assistance do so over email and I assure you that I will keep your request and information private and between us. I humbly request you don't share my personal information.</p><p>I am happy to use this thread for any questions the community and potential beneficiaries may have.</p><p>e: hoarder dot edition0u at icloud dot com</p><p>[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38492378</p><p>[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40508725</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Recently some posts I’ve made on Reddit and Hacker News have garnered some interest. Usually, I’m posting something about the Actor Model or some form of state management. Several users have messaged me with, “I’m interested in what you wrote, did you write any blog about it?” and “I would like to understand more how it works”.</p><p>In this series of blog posts I’m going to talk about “Thinking in Actors”. The techniques are not anything novel, they’re just a mashup of old techniques found in Domain Driven Design and Object-Oriented Programming (utilizing Finite-state machines).</p><ul><li><p>Part 1 - Challenging your software modelling techniques to be simpler</p></li><li><p><a href="https://jeremycarterau.substack.com/p/thinking-in-actors-part-2" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Part 2 - Welcome to a world of ordered thinking</a></p></li></ul><p>Architectural patterns always evolve, reflecting the technological constraints and business demands of their time. Currently the File → New Web Application has become a distributed microservice architectural mashup of stateless applications that are independent, yet dependant - somewhat paradoxical. But when you simplify it a modern web application is made up of layers.</p><p>Now I’m no expert on the history of any of this, but every software developer has probably been exposed to some kind of layered architecture. We tend to categorize components into layers of best fit and then debate it with our peers when they disagree - but ultimately everything can be categorized.</p><p><span>So, you use the current “best practice” and create a simple web application. It might employ a controller, service and repository layer, and you’ll connect it to your SQL database and you’re set! You’ve got a table called </span><code>order</code><span> and </span><code>order_item</code><span>. You write a controller </span><code>OrderController</code><span> it will talk to the </span><code>OrderService </code><span>and then it will use the </span><code>OrderRepository</code><span>. You connect up the system to some kind of cache and pump out some more features.</span></p><p><span>For most applications something like this works well. That is until you need to distribute it (because it’s in the File → New Web Application mandate). So again, you look around and see what “best practice” is. You put in some form of load balancing, place an API gateway in front of it, add more caching. Standing 10ft back you look at your system, and you observe a whole new set of </span><strong>challenges</strong><span>: network latency, concurrency, data consistency, contention, database performance, fault tolerance, and observability. </span></p><p>So, are all of the prescribed layers necessary? Are each of these challenges independent or do they have an underlying root cause?</p><p>At first glance you could assume that our new challenges are all independent and can be solved in some kind of layered fashion. </p><p>Putting APIs directly in front of the database seems like a straightforward solution: expose endpoints that perform CRUD operations, and let the database do the heavy lifting. It seems perfect because the web is stateless, and each request is its own operation. Sadly, this approach oversimplifies the complexities of actual real-world applications. </p><p>The problem starts with our data model and how we interact with it. Here's why:</p><p><span>An </span><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">anemic data model</a><span> is easy to spot. There are domain objects everywhere, simply reduced to DTO’s without encapsulating any behaviour or business logic. Instead of rich, meaningful and well modelled objects, we see properties that are modified by business logic scattered in layers such as the controller or service.</span></p><p>When you have a lack of encapsulation you see a disjointed system, making it harder to understand the complete logic flow.</p><p>Here’s an example of an anemic data model:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png" width="1456" height="1930" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1930,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1461827,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0f11511-520f-4428-a82e-7b07ba81050d_3944x5228.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Business rules and domain logic rarely relate 1:1 with a database operation. Because most of us are taught to think in terms of relational databases we tend to think in rows and tables. </p><p><span>For example, it's tempting to think of operations like "place an order" or "add an item to an order" as simple </span><code>INSERT</code><span> or </span><code>UPDATE</code><span> statements on </span><code>order</code><span> or </span><code>order_item </code><span>tables. However, unless you’re writing a Hello World application for your university assignment these operations are </span><strong>never</strong><span> that simple. Typically, they involve multiple steps, such as validation, communication with other systems, state transitions, or complex business rules.</span></p><p><span>RESTful API patterns, whilst commonly used and beneficial in many scenarios, have inadvertently reinforced the notion of thinking in terms of </span><strong>entities</strong><span> instead of </span><strong>business operations</strong><span>. Endpoints like </span><code>POST /orders</code><span> or </span><code>PUT /orders/{id}</code><span> encourage developers to see APIs as direct mappings to database tables, where each request corresponds to a CRUD operation or some kind of database mutation.</span></p><p><span>When you expose an API chances are you are actually exposing a </span><strong>process</strong><span> or </span><strong>workflow</strong><span>. Somehow we've exposed the entities via API to our customers and not the actual operations they want to do. So why do we do that?</span></p><p>If all you have is a hammer, you treat everything as a nail.</p><p><span>As developers, it’s tempting to approach software challenges as purely technical problems. Often, we’re tasked to “fix the problem” and so we focus on patching symptoms. When we are in this mindset it’s easy to Google the problems individually: Concurrency? Put in some distributed locking mechanism. Database performance? Add more cache. Fault tolerance? Add retry mechanism and </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">idempotency</a><span>. While these solutions may work in isolation, they fail to address the underlying cause: the misalignment between the software and the business domain it serves.</span></p><p><span>They say all problems are a communication problem. Coincidentally in this case the root cause of our problem lies with how we’ve modelled our </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">domain</a><span> - we've miscommunicated our domain model to our code. Could it be that we didn’t quite understand the business domain at the start? Could it be that we skipped applying domain driven design techniques? Could it be that we modelled our software as if they were tightly coupled to the data models and paradigms of our database? Did we focus on database schemas and the code rather than the customers problem?</span></p><p>Modelling your domain is more than creating data structures, it’s about capturing business processes, behaviours and interactions. The end goal is a model that is rich enough that it truly reflects the real-world.</p><p>When you have an anemic data model we see objects in our system that are just data containers - without meaningful behaviour. A more domain driven approach would have us encapsulate business logic, state and behaviour inside the domain object itself.</p><p>When modelling we need to consider:</p><ul><li><p>The critical problems, people and parties</p></li><li><p>The naive operation the user wants to do, and what they want to achieve</p></li><li><p>The state and behavior (operations, workflows, processes)</p></li><li><p>The context and boundaries</p></li><li><p>Real world rules, constraints and exceptions</p></li></ul><p><span>Amy Fu recently </span><a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/09/write-change-resilient-code-with-domain.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">blogged</a><span> and I quote:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>if we write code that matches the fundamental ideas of the product, it will be more likely to survive future product changes</strong><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>It’s actually so simple - model the system based on the ideas first, behaviours and state second. Why does this matter?</p><p>State is a fundamental concept in software development - it represents the system’s knowledge of the world and drives behavior. It’s considered a double edge sword. On one hand almost every application will have some form of state, and on the other hand managing it is complex, especially when the system is distributed, concurrent or needs to be fault tolerant.</p><p>When replicating a bug, you are in essence attempting to get the system in the defective state and reason against its values. If every operation and interaction is considered a potential state change, then why don’t we design and model our state in such a way that it can be isolated and interrogated?</p><p>When we distribute a system, the management of state becomes a key challenge. Here's why:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Concurrency</strong><span>: Multiple components or users may interact with the same piece of state simultaneously. Without proper handling, this leads to race conditions, stale data, or corruption.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Consistency</strong><span>: In distributed systems, maintaining a consistent view of state across nodes is notoriously difficult. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong><span>: State can become a bottleneck when multiple components need to access or modify it. Some systems partition/aggregate state but this can be complex.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fault Tolerance</strong><span>: Distributed systems must recover from failures. Ensuring state consistency during node crashes, network partitioning, retries and deployments requires additional design. When something retries will it be in the same state?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Observability</strong><span>: Debugging issues across many components or services can be difficult. What state was available to the component at the time the request was made?</span></p></li></ol><p>Given these challenges, many modern systems lean toward stateless architectures wherever possible. In a simple Controller-Service-Repository web application where exactly is our state?</p><p>If we’ve already modelled our domain in a rich real-world manner, how can we bring it to life? Can we make it stateful? If so, what would that look like?</p><p>What do we need to better manage our state? In an ideal world, this is kind of what we want:</p><ol><li><p>I don’t want to write everything in controllers, services and repositories. There are rich parts of my domain where state and behaviour need to be properly managed.</p></li><li><p>Business rules, processes and workflows should live within the domain objects, ensuring that the logic is cohesive and centralized.</p></li><li><p><span>I want to be able to express the domain logic clearly and succinctly so that everything the </span><code>Order </code><span>manages is encapsulated in the one place.</span></p></li><li><p>I want to be able to define state machines and transitions so that the system is well guarded against incorrect states.</p></li><li><p>Domain objects should scale naturally with the system, supporting partitioning and sharding without additional complexity.</p></li><li><p>I don’t want to have to build locking mechanisms to handle concurrency.</p></li><li><p>I don’t want to have to build queuing mechanisms for out of order messages.</p></li><li><p>The system should natively support and enforce valid state transitions, reducing the risk of invalid or inconsistent states.</p></li><li><p>State persistence should be seamless, in a way that is transparent to the developer.</p></li><li><p>I want to be able to easily debug the state of things, I want to be able to easily inject the exact state so I can replicate the bug.</p></li><li><p>The domain model should support emitting and reacting to domain events, enabling easy integration with other systems and workflows.</p></li><li><p>I don’t want to bake in custom retry and fault tolerance mechanisms.</p></li><li><p>The system should support both horizontal and vertical scaling without any additional complexity.</p></li><li><p>I want to be able to test the integration of domain objects without any additional complexity.</p></li></ol><p>The Actor Model offers a structured approach to reasoning about state. Actor systems act as runtimes for small, independent objects called actors, which encapsulate both state and behaviour. A system has:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Encapsulation:</strong><span> Each actor owns its state and exposes it through well-defined messages or methods. External components or other actors cannot access the internal state directly, which keeps things pure and prevents corruption. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Behaviour:</strong><span> Typically, actors react to incoming messages, whereby they can change state, producing a response, or creating further messages. Actors can talk to other actors.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Isolation:</strong><span> Since actors process messages they receive sequentially, there are no concurrency issues within an actor. This simplifies reasoning about state mutation and transitions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Distributed by Design:</strong><span> Actors can be distributed across nodes, with state partitioned naturally. This enables horizontal scalability without shared locks, complex transactions or coordinators.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong><span> State can be persisted (e.g., to storage, database or event log) between messages. If an actor crashes, it can recover its state on another node and resume processing.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Systems such as </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/overview" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Microsoft Orleans</a><span>, </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Service Fabric</a><span> and </span><a href="https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/actors/actors-overview" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Dapr </a><span>offer the virtual actor pattern. The </span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/grains/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">virtual actor</a><span> pattern introduces some abstractions to simplify development. You can think of a virtual actor as a distributed OOP object in memory (kind of like an old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Enterprise_Beans" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">EJB</a><span>). The object has methods on it such as </span><code>AddToOrder </code><span>and its lifecycle is managed by the system. The object can be invoked externally (from your API or an event).</span></p><p>There are 5 core features of a virtual actor:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Unique identity:</strong><span> Each virtual actor is uniquely identified by an ID and its type. For example </span><code>OrderActor/28afcc20-913b-4415-964b-2dcf465902e3</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Activated on demand:</strong><span> Virtual actors are instantiated (activated) automatically when needed. They are deactivated when idle for a certain period of time.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Stateful by design:</strong><span> Virtual actors encapsulate their own state. The state is persisted transparently to a backend store (e.g., databases, blob storage) and is restored upon reactivation.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Concurrently safe:</strong><span> Each actor processes messages sequentially, one at a time, ensuring thread safety. Prevents race conditions and deadlocks without additional effort. Encourages modular design, where each actor operates independently and focuses solely on its own state and behavior.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Fault Tolerance and Reliable:</strong><span> If an actor's host node fails, the runtime can restart or reallocate the actor on another node, preserving its state and availability.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Now that we know the features of a virtual actor, how do we make them? Sometimes its difficult to get started, because we have to learn to think in actors. In my </span><a href="https://jeremycarterau.substack.com/p/thinking-in-actors-part-2" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">next post</a><span> I will be discussing 5 modelling techniques to help you unlock your inner actor modelling brain.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Database modelling is for later</strong><span> — It’s easy to design systems from the database first. Instead ignore the data modelling, be naive and focus only on the real-world model.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Anemic data models hinder maintainability</strong><span> — Encapsulation of state and behavior is crucial. Anemic models lead to scattered business logic, making systems harder to maintain and extend.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rethink state with Domain-Driven Design</strong><span> — A rich real-world model that contains state, behaviors, and transitions, aligns better with business needs and simplifies reasoning about state in distributed systems.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>The Actor Model solves stateful challenges</strong><span> — Actors encapsulate state and behavior, process messages sequentially, and scale naturally, addressing concurrency, persistence, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Virtual Actors simplify distributed systems —</strong><span> The Virtual Actor pattern popularized by Microsoft Orleans provide a way for us to model and run our real-world model at scale.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>If we model the fundamental ideas of the product first, the system is easier to reason against, making it resilient to future changes.</strong></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

	<li><strong>Xi’an Scout Unlocked</strong>! The Khartu is the light attack craft of the Xi’An military. Contrary to Human ship design, the Khartu doesn’t have a traditional main thruster, instead featuring an array of maneuvering thrusters on articulated rigs. This design allows for incredible agility, making them the bane of <span>UEE</span> pilots, who bestowed the nickname ‘Quark’ because when all of the thrusters are firing, the ship looks like a spark flying through space. The Xi’an Aopoa corporation also manufactures an export model, the Khartu-al, for sale to human civilians as a dedicated scout/explorer. The export model features the same Xi’an maneuvering rig, but control surfaces modified for human use and a more limited armament. (Designer: Aopoa)</li>

	<li><strong>Enhanced Alpha</strong> – We will use additional funding to build a wider alpha test than we had originally intended for the first phase of Star Citizen’s launch. The initial plan was to first launch servers in North America and then expand to areas such as Europe and Australia to decrease latency in these areas, perfecting the game as we improve the experience around the world. This funding will allow us to invest in a wider infrastructure for our early testing, spinning up remote servers earlier. Hitting this goal will also allow us to increase the number of remaining alpha slots. Extra alpha slots not only means more Star Citizens will travel the ‘verse at launch, but that we will receive more feedback and more stress testing. This in turn will allow us to better balance and enhance the Star Citizen experience!</li>

	<li><strong>Cano System</strong> is home to a G-Type Main Sequence Star that’s almost identical to Earth’s. Of the four planets in the system, only one is inhabited: Carteyna. Located on the edge of habitable zone, Carteyna is a classic waterworld. Fortunately, its planetary axis constantly keeps the northern hemisphere away from the sun, which allowed for the water to freeze into the landmasses used as the initial landing zones in 2587. Multiple attempts have been made to try to convert the thick atmosphere into something breathable, but the process never seemed to stick. In fact, over the years, every time there’s a new technological development in geo-engineering, they test it out here on Carteyna only to yield the same result. Almost fifty years ago, scientists discovered microscopic organisms in the very early phases of life in the depths of the oceans. This caused a massive uproar throughout the <span>UEE</span> at the prospect that they had been attempting to terraform a developing world. Carteyna was immediately placed under the Fair Chance Act. Unfortunately, Humans had been living here for almost over three hundred years and the families that had been here for generations felt that they had earned rights as residents. After years of debate in the political and scientific community, the population was allowed to stay, but only under certain conditions: future terraforming attempts have been outlawed and the Human population has been consolidated to a single arcology to minimize their impact on their environment and the development of whatever species is growing in the deep.</li>

The object, once thought to be a single massive star, is actually a trinary star consisting of two white dwarfs and an active pulsar orbiting one another. Because of the complex gravitic factors at work, it is now believed that a jump point leading to the system likely exists in or near explored human space.

Even the most jaded NavJumpers can’t help entertaining the possibilities for scientific understanding or new species or even a new home that could await them on the other side of a new jump point. The discovery of Kabal was certainly something new. By all outward appearances, the system seemed empty. It was only during when a <span>UEE</span> Surveying team began to assess Kabal <span>III</span>, did they find something disturbing; old uninhabited Tevarin cities. How could an entire Tevarin system escape detection all these years? Did the Tevarin that were assimilated into the <span>UEE</span> know about it? How was it kept a secret? The questions multiplied when a detachment of Marines, sent to secure the planet ended up discovering a cache of old Tevarin war machines.

	<li><strong>Oretani System</strong> – Oretani was just one of many systems that were being discovered during the rapid Expansion era of the 25th century. The surveyors noticed nothing in the system’s six worlds of immediate importance. Only one planet seemed to be a viable candidate for terraforming. The terraforming Corp that won the bid sent a mid-level team (and their families) into the system to start processing when the only jump point into the system collapsed. Scientists scrambled to figure out a solution, but it was the first time an incident like this had occurred. As years stretched into decades, people studied the area around the former jump point, hoping for a sign that it had reopened, but after time they gave up. After all this time, Oretani is only ever debated among select number of historians. Most believe that without support, the initial terraformers probably died out, but no one really knows what to expect on the other side if that jump point ever reopens.</li>

	<li><strong>Updated Scanning Software</strong> – Chimera Communications unveiled the latest version of their SBit scanning software, also announcing a one-time free upgrade for their current and long-standing customers. The new SBit upgrade offers advanced scanning capabilities for prospecting asteroids above and beyond their baseline systems. SBit is a <span>FIB</span>-based system that floods the scan-zone with energy then processes the frequency of the energy reflected back, providing the operator with a composite sketch of potential ore deposits. With the new version, Chimera included an updated library of searchable frequencies as well as variable scan sizes, allowing smaller surface, higher-resolution scans. The general public will be able to purchase the update when SBit is officially released.</li>

	<li><strong>Anvil Aerospace Crucible</strong> – A so-called “flying toolbox,” the Crucible is the ship you want on your side when you suffer an asteroid collision or survive a pirate attack! Structurally, the Crucible consists of a cockpit, drive unit and workshop. The Crucible’s workshop is versatile: it can be used as a base for conducting <span>EVA</span> repairs (complete with requisite tool storage) or it can use magnetic grapplers to attach directly to a ship hull. In this situation, the workshop actually opens to space and allows a repair crew direct access to a damaged ship. The workshop can either maintain artificial gravity or allow for zero-g repair operations, depending on the needs of the mission. The Crucible’s cockpit is also outfitted with an array of repair tools, including dual purpose mounts that can exchange weapons for tractor beams and remote manipulator arms. The Crucible is also part of a larger planned repair system. For larger project, independent sections of support struts and drive units, called the Miller <span>ERS</span> (External Repair Structure), can be locked together to form a sort of scaffolding around a damaged starship, the next best thing to an orbital drydock. A standard <span>ERS</span> unit includes a small drive, thrusters, magnetic attach points and modular hardpoints for mounting tractor beams, repair tools or weapons. <span>ERS</span> segments each have a code defining their shape (P1 = Straight section, P2= Left turn, P3 = Right turn, etc.) with the multiple layouts allowing extensive zero-gravity construction as necessary. In the case of damaged capital ships, like the Navy’s Bengal carriers, hundreds of <span>ERS</span> units might be formed into a latticework serviced by a dozen or more Crucibles.</li>

	<li><strong>Aegis Vanguard-class Twin-Engine Deep Space Fighter</strong> – Strike hard from a distance! The Vanguard, a recent design from Aegis, has quickly become Earth’s premier deep space fighter. Deep space fighters are typically used to pursue engagements in outlying areas when support from a carrier is not available. Vanguards are usually flown by ground- and station-based naval forces, and are widely used by militia squadrons. Specifically designed to operate from planetary bases and engage targets up to a star system’s distance, the fighter trades some maneuverability for an extended supply of fuel and munitions as well as basic survival accommodations for a pilot and radar operator. The Vanguard’s <span>RIO</span> operates a turret, the ship’s missile loadout (optionally) and its highly advanced sensor suite. This distinct scanning array gives the ‘Dog a particular advantage when fighting in and around an obstacle such as an asteroid field or nebula! Finally, the Vanguard is known to be an extraordinarily sturdy spacecraft, with multiple backup systems not commonly found in single-seat ships; stories of Vanguards limping back to base with a single engine and half their fuselage exposed to vacuum have become common as the battle against the Vanduul has heated up.</li>

	<li><strong>Enhanced Ship Modularity</strong> – So you have the ship of your dreams, but really wish that it could be customized to suit your needs a bit more than the off-the-shelf models? This new goal, a massive undertaking, is going to be of interest. We are looking to overhaul any suitable ships (including the Cutlass, Avenger, Retaliator and Redeemer) to allow many modular components to be available as swap-outs. For example: if you have purchased a Redeemer, then using the new system you would have a variety of new modules available to refit the ship, internal and external, to suit your play requirements. If you wanted to make it a Bounty Hunter ship, you could buy a “Stasis Chamber module” for the lower deck and you would be able to capture and store fugitives to be delivered for their bounties at your leisure. You could configure the upper deck to be outfitted with a “long range communication suite” allowing you to keep in touch with your “Infoagent” even when in deep space. Fed up of Bounty hunting? Swap in a larger cargo module in the lower deck to make that profitable run you have been planning for a while, or add the Explorer Module with deployable vehicle for some planetside recon. Manufacturers will still be offering pre-configured variants, but should you be looking to adapt a hull to suit a certain task then your ship has come in (and is now ready for modification!)</li>

<h2>
<a name="differences"></a>How is college mathematics different from high
school math?</h2>
In high school mathematics much of your time was spent learning algorithms
and manipulative techniques which you were expected to be able to apply
in certain well-defined situations. This limitation of material and expectations
for your performance has probably led you to develop study habits which
were appropriate for high school mathematics but may be insufficient for
college mathematics. This can be a source of much frustration for you and
for your instructors. My object in writing this essay is to help ease this
frustration by describing some study strategies which may help you channel
your abilities and energies in a productive direction.
<p>The first major difference between high school mathematics and college
mathematics is the amount of emphasis on what the student would call theory---the
precise statement of definitions and theorems and the logical processes
by which those theorems are established. To the mathematician this material,
together with examples showing why the definitions chosen are the correct
ones and how the theorems can be put to practical use, is the essence of
mathematics. A course description using the term ``rigorous'' indicates
that considerable care will be taken in the statement of definitions and
theorems and that proofs will be given for the theorems rather than just
plausibility arguments. If your approach is to go straight to the problems
with only cursory reading of the ``theory'' this aspect of college math
will cause difficulties for you.
</p><p>The second difference between college mathematics and high school mathematics
comes in the approach to technique and application problems. In high school
you studied one technique at a time---a problem set or unit might deal,
for instance, with solution of quadratic equations by factoring or by use
of the quadratic formula, but it wouldn't teach both and ask you to decide
which was the better approach for particular problems. To be sure, you
learn individual techniques well in this approach, but you are unlikely
to learn how to attack a problem for which you are not told what technique
to use or which is not exactly like other applications you have seen. College
mathematics will offer many techniques which can be applied for a particular
type of problem---individual problems may have many possible approaches,
some of which work better than others. Part of the task of working such
a problem lies in choosing the appropriate technique. This requires study
habits which develop judgment as well as technical competence.
</p><p>We will take up the problem of how to study mathematics by considering
specific aspects individually. First we will consider definitions---first
because they form the foundation for any part of mathematics and are essential
for understanding theorems. Then we'll take up theorems, lemmas, propositions,
and corollaries and how to study the way the subject fits together. The
subject of proofs, how to decipher them and why we need them, comes next.
And finally, we will discuss development of judgment in problem solving.
<br><a href="#top">To contents</a>
</p><h2>
<a name="definitions"></a>What should you do with a definition?</h2>
A definition in mathematics is a precise statement delineating and naming
a concept by relating it to previously defined concepts or such undefined
concepts as ``number'' or ``set.'' Careful definitions are necessary so
that we know exactly what we are talking about. Unfortunately, for many
of the concepts in undergraduate mathematics the definition is rather difficult
to understand, so often at low levels an intuitive feeling for the meaning
of a term is all that is given or required. This intuitive feeling, while
necessary, is not sufficient at the college level. This means that you
need to grapple with and master the formal statement of definitions and
their meanings. How do you do it?
<h3>
Step 1. Make sure you understand what the definition says.</h3>
This sounds obvious, but it can cause some difficulties, particularly for
definitions with complicated logical structure (like the definition of
the limit of a function at a point in its domain). Definitions are not
a good place to practice your speed reading. In general there are no wasted
words or extraneous symbols in established definitions and the easily overlooked
small words like <i>and, or, if ... then, for all,</i> and <i>there is</i>
are your clues to the logical structure of the definition.
<p>First determine what general class of things is being talked about:
the definition of a polynomial describes a particular kind of algebraic
expression; the definition of a continuous function specifies a kind of
function; the definition of a basis for a vector space specifies a kind
of set of vectors.
</p><p>Next decipher the logical structure of the definition. What do you have
to do to show that a member of your general class of things satisfies the
definition: what do you have to do to show that an expression is a polynomial,
or a function is continuous, or a set of vectors is a basis.
</p><h3>
Step 2. Determine the scope of the definition with examples.</h3>
Most definitions have standard examples that go with them. While these
are useful, they may lead you to expect that all examples look like the
standard example. To understand a definition you should make up your own
examples: find three examples that do satisfy the definition but which
are as different as possible from each other; find two examples of items
in the general class described by the definition which do not satisfy it.
Prove that your five examples do what you think they do---such proofs are
usually short, follow the structure of the definition quite closely, and
help immensely in understanding the definition. These examples should be
neatly written up so that you can refer to them later. Your own examples
will have more meaning for you than mine or the book's when it comes time
to review.
<h3>
Step 3. Memorize the exact wording of the definition.</h3>
This step may sound petty, but the use of definitions demands knowledge
of exactly what they say. For this reason you can count on being asked
for the statement of any definition on an exam. The importance of precise
wording should have been made clear by your examples in step 2 and it certainly
is essential in the proof of theorems.
<p>Solid knowledge of definitions is more than a third of the battle. Time
spent gaining such knowledge is not wasted.
<br><a href="#top">To contents</a>
</p><h2>
<a name="theorems"></a>Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas, and Corollaries</h2>
Occasionally definitions are useful in and of themselves, but usually we
need to relate them to each other and to general problems before they can
be made to work for us. This is the role of theory.
<p>The relative importance and the intended use of statements which are
then proved is hinted at by the names they are given. Theorems are usually
important results which show how to make concepts solve problems or give
major insights into the workings of the subject. They often have involved
and deep proofs. Propositions give smaller results, often relating different
definitions to each other or giving alternate forms of the definition.
Proofs of propositions are usually less complex than the proofs of theorems.
Lemmas are technical results used in the proofs of theorems. Often it is
found that the same trick is used several times in one proof or in the
proof of several theorems. When this happens the trick is isolated in a
lemma so that its proof will not have to be repeated every time it is used.
This often makes the proofs of theorems shorter and, one hopes, more lucid.
Corollaries are immediate consequences of theorems either giving special
cases or highlighting the interest and importance of the theorem. If the
author or instructor has been careful (not all authors and instructors
are) with the use of these labels, they will help you figure out what is
important in the subject.
</p><p>The steps to understanding and mastering a theorem follow the same lines
as the steps to understanding a definition.
</p><h3>
Step 1. Make sure you understand what the theorem says.</h3>
Part of this is a vocabulary problem. Theorems use terms which have been
given precise meanings by definitions. So you may need to review the definitions
to understand the words in a theorem.
<p>Next you need to understand the logical structure of the theorem: what
are the hypotheses and what are the conclusions? If you have several hypotheses,
must they all be satisfied (that is, do they have an&nbsp; <b><i>and</i></b>
between them) or will it suffice to have only some of them (an&nbsp; <b><i>or</i></b>
between them)? In most cases theorems require that all of their hypotheses
be satisfied. A theorem tells you nothing about a situation which does
not satisfy the hypothesis. The hypothesis tells you what you must show
in order for the theorem to apply to a particular case. The conclusions
tell you what the theorem tells you about each case.
</p><h3>
Step 2. Determine how the theorem is used.</h3>
This involves finding examples of problems for which the theorem gives
a technique for finding the answer. Make up your own problems and show
how the theorem helps with them. Again writing this down will help solidify
the theorem in your mind and make it easier to review.
<h3>
Step 3. Find out what the hypotheses are doing there.</h3>
This is a little tricky and is probably more important in advanced courses
than in beginning courses. What you do is find examples (either your own
or someone else's) to show that if individual hypotheses are omitted the
conclusion can be false. For instance, in calculus many theorems have a
hypothesis that the functions involved be continuous; why does the theorem
fail if this hypothesis is left out? Usually an example will make this
clearer than an examination of how the hypothesis was used in the proof
will. A catalog of such examples can be very useful. See for instance the
books Counterexamples in Analysis and Counterexamples in Topology.
<p>In some cases a hypothesis is included just because it makes an otherwise
complicated proof easy. This means that you may not be able to find examples
which illustrate that each hypothesis is essential.
</p><h3>
Step 4. Memorize the statement of the theorem.</h3>
If you are going to use a theorem you need to know exactly what it says.
Pay particular attention to hypotheses. We will take up proofs later, but
for now let me note that it is not a good idea to try to memorize the proof
of a theorem. What you want to do is understand the proof well enough that
you can prove the theorem yourself.

<h2>
<a name="fit"></a>Fitting the subject together</h2>
Mathematics is not a collection of miscellaneous techniques but rather
a way of thinking---a unified subject. Part of the task of studying mathematics
is getting the various definitions and theorems properly related to each
other. This is particularly important at the end of a course, but it will
help you make sense of the content and organization of a subject if you
keep the overall organization in mind as you go along. There are two techniques
I know of which help with this process: working backwards and definition-theorem
outlines.
<h3>
Step 1. Working backwards</h3>
In general there is very little difficulty recognizing a major result when
you get to it. A good way of seeing how a subject works is to examine the
proof of a major result and see what previous results were used in it.
Then trace these results back to earlier results used to prove them. Eventually
you will work your way back to definitions (unless there are theorems given
without proof---in calculus, for instance, the proof of the intermediate
value theorem is often omitted because it requires a deeper understanding
of the real numbers than is usually available at the beginning of calculus
1). This information can be put into a sort of genealogy chart for results
which helps you see at a glance how the results fit together. It helps
to have descriptive names for your theorems and lemmas. Such a chart might
look sort of like this:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Mean Value Theorem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolle's Theorem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candidate Lemma
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning of the sign of the derivative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of derivative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of max and min
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; max&nbsp; and&nbsp; min&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; continuous&nbsp; functions&nbsp; on [a, b]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of max and min
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of closed interval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Least upper bound axiom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition of continuity</pre>
With such a road map through the theory you should be able to tell how
you got where you are, if not where you are headed.
<h3>
Step 2. Make a definition-theorem outline.</h3>
After you have worked backwards to the definitions for each of your major
theorems in a section you should have a good idea of which results are
needed before others can be proved. Some definitions will not make sense
until certain theorems are proved (dimension of a vector space is an example:
you can't give a number a name until you know you are talking about a unique
number, and that requires a theorem). A definition theorem outline is an
arrangement of the results in an order so that each result is introduced
before it is needed in a proof. It should contain the precise statements
of all definitions and theorems and a sketch of the proof of each theorem.
A sketch of a proof will show which earlier results were used and how they
were combined. It will usually omit calculations simplifying forms of expressions
and routine checks that hypotheses are satisfied. This outline is both
a good way to start a review and a useful thing to have to refer to.
<br><a href="#top">To contents</a>
<h2>
<a name="proofs"></a>How to make sense of a proof</h2>
College level mathematics demands that the student work through (or at
least sit through) many proofs. This is often unpopular, I think largely
because it is hard work to follow a proof, hard work of an unfamiliar kind.
Proof is largely absent or at most optional in high school math; it is
neither absent nor optional in college mathematics.
<h3>
Step 1. Make sure you know what the theorem says.</h3>
If you have the hypotheses mixed up with the conclusions you will not know
what assumptions may be made nor will you know what conclusion you are
trying to reach.
<h3>
Step 2. Make a general outline of the proof.</h3>
This is what you would do in a definition theorem outline. See what the
previous results used are and find out what the basic strategy of the proof
is. On this pass through omit the details, else you miss the direction
of the road by too close examination of the bricks in the pavement.
<p>Most theorems have the form of implications: if the hypotheses are true,
then the conclusion follows. The easiest structure for a proof to use is
to assume the hypotheses and combine them, using previous results, to reach
the conclusion through a chain of implications. Some proofs use other strategies:
contrapositive argument, reductio ad absurdum, mathematical induction,
perhaps even Zorn's lemma (a form of the axiom of choice). The more complicated
kinds of proofs will need to be discussed in class.
</p><h3>
Step 3. Fill in all of the details.</h3>
Once you understand the strategy of the proof concentrate on its tactics.
Almost all expositions of proofs in undergraduate mathematics textbooks
(and all expositions at higher levels) leave out many routine steps. An
expression will be simplified without showing exactly how to get from one
line to the next. Fill in these details. A theorem will be quoted and applied
without explicitly checking all of its hypotheses. Check them. Some parts
of the proof will be outlined with the details left to the reader. Put
in those details. When you finish you should know why each step follows
from what came before. You may not see how anyone could have thought to
do the proof that way, but you should be able to see that it is correct.
<h4>
Why bother with proofs at all?</h4>
For the mathematics major this question is easy to answer---a large portion
of mathematics consists of proofs. The mathematician enjoys the logical
puzzle which must be solved to find a proof and obtains aesthetic satisfaction
from elegance in proofs. The student who wants to major in mathematics
should do so because of ability in deciphering and producing proofs and
enjoyment derived from proof well done. The major should also have skill
in solving problems and finding applications as well.
<p>But many of you will say ``I'm not a math major; I want applications
so that I can use tools from mathematics in my field'' or ``I'm just taking
this course because it's a requirement in my major and I sort of liked
math in high school.'' Why should you learn about proof?
</p><p>The applications you meet in other fields are not likely to look exactly
like the math textbook applications, which are chosen for their appeal
to a traditional audience (largely engineers) and for their representative
character. Other applications work similarly, though not exactly the same
way. This means that you need to learn how to apply the concepts in your
math courses to situations not discussed in those courses. (There is no
way that a course could discuss every possible known application: about
500 papers appear every two weeks with applications, and those are just
the applications published in the ``mathematical'' literature!) To do so
you need the best possible understanding of the mathematics you want to
apply. Certainly this means that you need to know the hypotheses of theorems
so that you don't apply them where they won't work. It is helpful to know
the proof so that you can see how to circumvent the failed hypothesis if
necessary. One of the major pitfalls of applied mathematics, particularly
as practiced by nonmathematicians, is the danger of conveniently overlooking
the assumptions of a mathematical model. (Mathematicians trying to do applied
mathematics are more likely to fall into the trap of making models which
have no relationship to reality.)
</p><p>Many applications consist of recognizing the definition of a mathematical
concept phrased in the terms of another discipline---the more familiar
you are with the definition, the more likely you are to be able to recognize
the disguised version elsewhere. The nuances of definitions are made most
clear in the proofs of propositions relating definitions and pointing out
unexpected equivalent variants, some of which may look more like a situation
in another discipline than the precise form used in your math class.
</p><p>Arguments for theory as an aid to application rest on an obvious premise:
it is much easier to apply something you understand thoroughly. This is,
however, a better argument for care in learning the statements of theorems
than it is for spending time understanding proofs. The best justification
for the inclusion of proof in math classes is more philosophical:
</p><p><b><span color="#FF0000"><span size="+2">Proof is the ultimate test of
validity in mathematics.</span></span></b><span color="#FF0000"><span size="+2"></span></span>
</p><p>Once one accepts the logical processes involved in a proof no further
observation or change in fashion will change the validity of a mathematical
result. No other discipline has such an immutable criterion for validity.
</p><p>The major benefit derived from an education is the ability to think
clearly and make considered judgment. Each discipline should teach a body
of material, appropriate modes of thought in dealing with that material,
and a means for determining the validity of the conclusions reached. A
chemistry curriculum with no lab work would be seriously deficient since
experiment is the test of validity in science. Similarly mathematics without
proof is severely deficient, indeed it is not mathematics.

<a name="technique"></a>Developing technique</h2>
About a third to a half of any math course deals with technique---the process
of making theorems work for you in specific situations rather than in the
general setting in which they are usually stated. Sometimes this is fairly
easy: many proofs give explicit constructions which you follow for the
special case. In these situations the only problems are with algebraic
and trigonometric manipulations and keeping track of where you are in the
process. In other situations (technique of integration is a good example)
there are lots of approaches which might apply to a given problem and several
tricks which might be used to make the problem more tractable. For these
you need to develop judgment.
<h3>
Step 1. Read through the theorems and examples.</h3>
Some students make the whole process of learning how to do problems more
difficult by acting like it had no connection with the other material in
the course. Often problems follow a pattern which is given explicitly in
the proof of the major theorem they follow. Knowing the general pattern
in advance is easier than trying to find it by trial and error.
<h3>
Step 2. Work enough problems to master the technique.</h3>
At this stage you should work enough problems so that the single technique
which the problems illustrate is firmly in your mind. Since you have ultimate
responsibility for your education, you should take the initiative to work
enough problems for your own practice needs. This may well be more problems
than are assigned to be turned in.
<h3>
Step 3. Work a few problems in as many different ways as possible.</h3>
Too often the practice obtained in step 2 leads the student to think that
there is only one approach to each problem. Sometimes one approach is easy
and another is complicated, but often several different attacks will work
equally well. Complicated approaches give the student practice in solving
problems which take more than one step and more than one technique.
<h3>
Step 4. Make yourself a set of randomly chosen problems.</h3>
One difficulty with learning many techniques to solve a particular kind
of problem is that you have to figure out which technique to use before
you can get to work on a solution. This is exacerbated by the tendency
for problems to be grouped so that the appropriate technique to use is
the one which immediately preceded the problem set. Putting two or three
problems from each of the problem sets in a chapter on technique on 3 by
5 cards and then shuffling the cards will give you a set of problems on
which to practice deciding which technique to use.

<h2>
<a name="final"></a>A few final suggestions</h2>
Mathematical prose has a very low redundancy rate and mathematics is a
very cumulative subject. Pay close attention as you read---once introduced,
a concept is rarely repeated and it will be assumed later. Allow yourself
adequate time to read the book before starting the problems.
<p>Few students write fast enough to get complete and readable notes in
class. For this reason it is useful to go back over your class notes shortly
after each class and make a complete, clean copy with all of the definitions
and theorems clearly stated. This practice will also help you identify
parts you don't understand so you can ask your professor about them in
a timely fashion.
</p><p>Do not let yourself fall behind. Mathematics requires precision, habits
of clear thought, and practice. Cramming for an exam will not only fail
to produce the desired result on the exam, it will also reinforce a bad
habit---that of trying to do mathematics by memorization rather than understanding.
A good night's sleep and a clear head will serve you better than last minute
memorization.
