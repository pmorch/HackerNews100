<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><header><p> <h2>State mass surveillance</h2></p> <p>Under the slogan ‘Think of the children’, the European Commission tried to introduce total surveillance of all EU citizens. When the scandal was revealed, it turned out that American tech companies and security services had been involved in the bill, generally known as ‘Chat Control’ – and that the whole thing had been directed by completely different interests. Now comes the next attempt. New battering rams have been brought out with the ‘Going Dark’ initiative. But the ambition is the same: to install state spyware on every European cell phone and computers.</p></header> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-t1esob"><img src="https://mullvad.net/images/previous-term.jpg" alt="A satirical cartoon of a man sitting in front of a computer, symbolizing mass surveillance in the EU."></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1i3n5uv">On May 11, 2022, EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson presented a legislative
proposal under the official name ”<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN" rel="nofollow">Regulation of the European Parliament
and of the Council laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual
abuse</a>.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-34ak2p">Ylva Johansson made a point of this being her bill: it was she who had
devised it – no one else – and if it had not been for her, Europe’s
justice system would “go blind” in the hunt to track sexual abuse of
children. In Ylva’s world, the EU would “turn into a pedophiles’
paradise” if she didn’t get her way. It was easy to marvel at how, on
almost every occasion, Ylva Johansson was keen to point out that this
was her proposal. A touch of narcissism? Maybe. But perhaps there was
something else behind this self-centered proclamation. Because it would
eventually emerge that in fact Ylva Johansson was not alone behind the
scenes. Right from the start, there were others involved – actors who
would benefit from the bill being passed, but who preferred it not to be
known that they were involved in designing it.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-hu60su">The rhetoric was clear from day one: it was all about the children, and
when it comes to children, there’s nothing we can’t imagine doing to
keep them safe. So Ylva Johansson put forward a proposal that meant
total surveillance of all EU citizens and as soon as someone opposed it,
she pulled out the think-of-the-children card. But those who could see
through the bluff quickly gave the proposal (those parts of the bill
that dealt with internet surveillance) a shorter and more appropriate
name: Chat Control.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1wqsbbm">In brief, Chat Control essentially meant that the communications of
every EU citizen would be monitored. Every call, every message and every
chat, all the emails, photos, and videos saved in cloud services – all
of it would be filtered in real time via artificial intelligence and
then checked in a newly established EU center, in close cooperation with
Europol.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-lj4ut6">Since the bill was in violation of the European Convention on Human
Rights, the EU Charter and the UN Declaration of Human Rights, Chat
Control was rejected by one legislative body after another. Both <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/st08787.en23-leak.pdf" rel="nofollow">the
Council of
Ministers</a>
and the <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/220128_Opinion-II-HOME-Child-Sexual-Abuse-annotated-fin.pdf" rel="nofollow">European Commission’s own legal
service</a>
warned against the proposal, as did <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2022-07/22-07-28_edpb-edps-joint-opinion-csam_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">the European Parliament’s Data
Protection
Board</a>.
The UN Human Rights Council described Chat Control as incompatible with
fundamental human rights and stated that the proposal would lead to
<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/un-human-rights-commissioner-warns-against-chat-control/" rel="nofollow">mass surveillance and
self-censorship</a>.
Former judges at the European Court of Justice said that <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf" rel="nofollow">the proposal
was in breach of the EU Charter of
Rights</a>
and 465 researchers joined forces to <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Open-Letter-CSA-Scientific-community.pdf" rel="nofollow">warn of the
consequences</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1mcqafc">Faced with massive criticism, Ylva Johansson defended herself. According
to her, everyone else had misunderstood the bill. Chat Control was
certainly not about mass surveillance and everyone making that claim was
simply out to discredit her.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-4aqjfz">Chat Control – total monitoring of all EU citizens.</h3> <p>Chat Control is sometimes also called Chat Control 2.0, since existing
legislation already makes it possible for tech companies such as Google
and Meta to scan their users’ accounts for child pornography material.
The fact that there was already a law that allowed tech companies to
scan for illegal content – if they chose to – was something Ylva
Johansson was not slow to mention. She explained that her draft bill was
nothing but an extension of the <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/the-european-commission-does-not-understand-what-is-written-in-its-own-chat-control-bill">scanning that had already been going on
for ten
years</a>.
She also referred to the existing legislation when she said that the EU
would become a free zone for pedophiles unless her bill went through –
as that legislation would expire in the summer of 2024.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1s6fzw2">Time and time again Ylva Johansson was proven wrong by journalists and
experts. In fact, nothing prevented the EU from extending the existing
law, rather than introducing a new one. And above all: Ylva’s bill was
anything but an extension. The differences between the current law and
the proposed legislation were extreme. In Ylva Johansson’s EU, scanning
would not be voluntary. All messaging services (including encrypted
services such as Signal) would be covered by the law and would be forced
to scan their users’ images, videos and conversations. That would be a
big concern for all those who don’t use Meta or Google to converse
because they are in need of secure communication methods. In other
words, political opponents, whistleblowers, journalists and their
sources, vulnerable people living under secret identities and others,
not to mention people with trade secrets, and those in possession of
sensitive information important for national security. For example, the
European Commission itself uses Signal. Demanding government
transparency (either through so-called backdoors or scanning on the
computer or phone) would open a Pandora’s box to countries with
authoritarian inclinations (and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pegasus-use-5-eu-countries-nso-group-admit/" rel="nofollow">five EU countries have already been
caught</a>
using spyware to monitor political opponents) and would leave the door
wide open for criminals to exploit. But it was not only this that
separated the existing legislation from the draft bill that the European
Commission wanted to introduce.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-cr1ja7">The previous legislation had only allowed scanning for material that had
previously been stamped and registered as child pornography material.
Now, AI would be used to find ‘new material’ and would also look for
grooming attempts. Quite obviously, Chat Control would therefore send
every other citizen of the EU straight into the filtering system.
Holiday photos from the beach, nude photos sent between partners, dirty
text messages – all the things that no AI system can distinguish
between would risk getting caught in a filter that would inevitably
drown any new EU center with endless digital heaps of evidence to
review. Is this a holiday photo of a child or child pornography? Are
these skimpily dressed youngsters 18 or 14? Is this a dirty text message
from a wife to a husband or a grooming attempt? But above all, Chat
Control would mean a tool that could be used to scan for completely
different things.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-j80wc0">When Ylva Johansson was asked whether it would be possible to
communicate safely even after her bill was introduced, she answered
“Yes.” And a whole world of experts asked “How?” Ylva replied that she
had something nobody else had. A digital sniffer dog that could smell
encrypted communication without looking at the content. A sniffer dog
that only reacted to child pornography content – never anything else.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-185mkhq">A group of experts tried to hammer the message home: either encrypted
communication is encrypted (so-called end-to-end encryption, which only
the sender and the recipient can see) or it’s not encrypted. There’s no
‘seeing the content’ without reading it. But Ylva stood by her claim.
She came back to the same argument over and over again. She avoided
answering the questions (she obviously didn’t understand how the
technology worked) but instead turned the direction of the discussion,
saying, for example, that a court order would be required to carry out
scanning, which in itself was deliberately misleading. Firstly, her
scanning would not require an order from a court – it could be one from
another judicial body. And secondly, the key issue was that judicial
body making a decision that would force messaging services to monitor
all their users. So in other words, when Ylva proclaimed “it requires a
court order,” she wasn’t talking about courts and their decisions to
monitor people such as suspected pedophiles. She was talking about how a
service would be forced to permit surveillance. What was required for a
service to be subject to surveillance? Merely that there was a
possibility to use the service to spread child pornography or to groom
children. Which of course means every messaging service on the planet.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-q0uosi">As soon as Ylva Johansson was shown to be in the wrong, she shifted her
focus. But in the end, she always came back to the final refuge: it’s
all about the children. She related anecdotes and referred to figures
that pointed to an exponential increase in child pornography material on
Facebook, for example – even though Facebook itself stated that <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/preventing-child-exploitation-on-our-apps/" rel="nofollow">90
percent of all reports come from material previously
distributed</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ajxwrs">The European Commission, led by Ylva Johansson, received criticism from
all directions. Police chiefs pointed out that most of the material they
receive today involves <a href="https://www.fokus.se/veckans-fokus/chat-control-sa-ska-techjattarna-skanna-allt-du-skickar/" rel="nofollow">teenagers sending pictures to each
other</a>
and that such reports risk leading the police in the wrong direction.
Scanning tests carried out by European police on existing material
showed that <a href="https://2021.fedpol.report/de/fedpol-in-zahlen/kampf-gegen-padokriminalitat/" rel="nofollow">80-90 percent of all hits were false
positives</a>.
Now, moreover, ‘new material’ would be scanned – which would obviously
mean an impossible administrative burden merely to distinguish between
illegal images and holiday pictures from family days on the beach. The
error rate would clearly be approaching 100 percent. For a European
<a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/European-Commission-must-uphold-privacy-security-and-free-expression-by-withdrawing-new-law.pdf" rel="nofollow">justice system that even today is unable to follow up all the
tips</a>
it receives, this would be devastating. And criminals would, of course,
turn to illegal messaging services. No children would be helped. At the
same time, every EU citizen would have spyware installed on their
phones.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-uesdev">How did Ylva Johansson deal with this information? Not at all. Instead,
like a scratched record, she continued urging everyone to “think of the
children.” She also ordered a survey that said 80 percent of the EU
population supports Chat Control. The problem? The European Commission
used its Eurobarometer series of public opinion surveys in way that
opened it to accusations of blurring the line between research and
propaganda. When asked to comment on the Chat Control survey, the Max
Planck Institute for the Study of Societies concluded that it had a
<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/manipulative-eu-opinion-poll-no-justification-for-indiscriminate-chat-control/" rel="nofollow">political agenda and consisted of questions that were
biased</a>
to support the Commission’s plans.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1fle1l8">Ylva Johansson was employing blatant deception. She used incorrect
figures and biased surveys. In interviews, she was populist and evasive.
But she was forced to resort to these methods. Because it was never
about the children.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1rjbvqn">American tech companies and security services behind the draft bill</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-msqxs2">In September 2023, a major investigative article was published by three
journalists: Giacomo Zandonini, Apostolis Fotiadis, and Luděk Stavinoha.
After seven months of trying to get the European Commission to release
public documents, they finally obtained a piece of material that allowed
them to start putting together the puzzle. The puzzle that <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" rel="nofollow">revealed the
true stakes behind Chat
Control</a>.
The article, which was published in several European newspapers,
included a letter in which Ylva Johansson wrote to Julie Cordua, CEO of
the American company Thorn: “We have shared many moments on the journey
to this proposal. Now I am looking to you to help make sure that this
launch is a successful one.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13zlmxr">Thorn is an American company, formed by actor Ashton Kutcher, which
develops tools that scan for child pornography material. Thorn had sold
software worth millions of dollars to the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security. Ashton Kutcher himself had held video conferences with
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and had given
lectures in the EU on how new technologies can scan encrypted content
without looking at it. The picture of Ylva Johansson’s digital sniffer
dog suddenly became clear.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ltneaj">For several years Kutcher lobbied the European Commission (until he was
forced to resign as chairman of Thorn’s board after defending his
acting colleague Danny Masterson when he was convicted of rape). He held
meetings with others at the European Commission and had an extra close
relationship with the Commission’s Eva Kaili (until she <a href="https://www.politico.eu/european-parliament-qatargate-corruption-scandal-updates/" rel="nofollow">was convicted
of
bribery</a>).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1y1yu4z">So here was an American company in direct contact with the European
Commission. An American company that just happened to sell the
technology that could be used if Chat Control was introduced. In
addition, it was all based on a false premise. The technology Kutcher
and Johansson talked about did not exist. Expert after expert <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/03/23/remarks-on-chat-control/" rel="nofollow">condemned
their talk of sniffer
dogs</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-154r4qk">And here’s yet another seedy aspect to this scandal: in the EU
transparency register, Thorn was registered as a charitable organization
– despite selling the technology they were lecturing about in the EU.
The trick of disguising organizations and corporations as charities
would turn out to be a recurring motif.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14b9drm">Since the draft Chat Control bill was presented, Ylva Johansson has
constantly referred to children’s rights organizations that support her
proposal. She has worked with them in a PR context, as a way to show how
Chat Control has the support of independent, nonprofit organizations
that care about children. A central organization in this work has been
the WeProtect Global Alliance. When Zandonini, Fotiadis, and Stavinoha
published their article, it turned out that the European Commission had
been involved in founding this organization, and that it included
representatives from both tech companies and security services in
different countries. Ylva Johansson’s colleague in the European
Commission, Labrador Jimenez, was on the Board of Directors of
WeProtect, together with Thorn’s CEO Julie Cordua, representatives of
Interpol, and government officials from the US and the UK (the latter
simultaneously pursuing its own monitoring legislation, also using
children as the battering ram). Thorn had put a great deal of money into
WeProtect. The European Commission had contributed one million euros. In
other words, it wasn’t children’s rights organizations that were
supporting Ylva Johansson. It was lobbying organizations set up by the
European Commission to get the bill through.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3weqe2">The Board of Directors of WeProtect also included representatives from
the Oak Foundation, who, in addition to their involvement in WeProtect,
had also been involved in setting up ECLAG (another charity that
supported the Chat Control proposal). ECLAG was launched just a few
weeks after Ylva Johansson’s draft bill was presented, and Thorn was
also represented on this organization’s board. And there was still
another organization: the Brave Movement, an organization formed a month
before the proposed Chat Control bill was introduced. Brave was launched
with $10 million from the Oak Foundation and a strategy paper
discovered by the journalists stated that “once the EU Survivors
taskforce is established and we are clear on the mobilized survivors, we
will establish a list pairing responsible survivors with Members of the
European Parliament – we will ‘divide and conquer’ the MEPs by
deploying in priority survivors from MEPs’ countries of origin.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-blzgs8">The Oak Foundation also appeared in a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/01/apple-encryption-iphone-heat-initiative/" rel="nofollow">article carried out by the
Intercept</a>.
In 2023, an American organization called the Heat Initiative was formed.
On paper, they were a “new child safety group” and the first thing they
did was campaign for Apple to “detect, report, and remove” child
pornography material from iCloud. Apple responded that this would be
something that criminals would be able to exploit and that it could also
lead to a “potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences.
Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk
surveillance.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1iezc36">The Heat Initiative did not like this answer and fought back with
anti-Apple propaganda on large advertising billboards in American cities
under the theme of ‘think of the children.’ But who was behind the Heat
Initiative, besides the Oak Foundation? Heat was led by a former vice
president at Thorn. The Intercept article also referred to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-31-sex-lies-and-surveillance-fosta-privacy.html" rel="nofollow">the
fact</a>
that Thorn was working with Palantir, the big-data company that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/how-peter-thiels-palantir-helped-the-nsa-spy-on-the-whole-world/" rel="nofollow">helped
the NSA mass-monitor the whole
world</a>
and was involved in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/cambridge-analytica-palantir.html" rel="nofollow">Cambridge Analytica scandal where Facebook
users’ private messages and
data</a>
were used to influence the presidential election on behalf of Donald
Trump in 2016.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-zfl98n">In other words, the European Commission was involved in funding and
starting up charities with the aim of exploiting existing victims to
emotionally influence EU parliamentarians. In close cooperation with the
tech company providing the technology that would be used in the
implementation of the monitoring. Together with representatives of
non-European security services. As part of a larger apparatus, where the
same tactics were used to influence developments in the United States.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-n7pf3i">At the same time, the real organizations working to counter sexual
crimes against children were wondering why the European Commission was
refusing to talk to them. In <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" rel="nofollow">the same investigative
report</a>,
Offlimits, Europe’s oldest hotline for vulnerable children, tells how
Ylva Johansson would rather go to Silicon Valley to meet companies
interested in making huge profits than talk to them.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gns2le">The same is true of the technical experts. Matthew Green, Professor of
Cryptography at John Hopkins University, said: “In the first impact
assessment of the EU Commission there was almost no outside scientific
input and that’s really amazing since Europe has a terrific scientific
infrastructure, with the top researchers in cryptography and computer
security all over the world.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-p16k3a">However, Europol was involved in drafting the law, <a href="https://netzpolitik-org.translate.goog/2023/geheime-liste-wie-der-sicherheitsapparat-die-chatkontrolle-praegt/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=sv&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" rel="nofollow">together with
security services from other
countries</a>.
In July 2022, Europol wrote that it wanted to be able to use scanning
and surveillance for purposes other than sexual offenses against
children. <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/" rel="nofollow">The European Commission
responded</a>
that it understood the wish but that it had “to be realistic in terms of
what could be expected, given the many sensitivities around the
proposal.” Thorn was also <a href="https://netzpolitik-org.translate.goog/2024/verschluesselung-thorn-brachte-chatkontrolle-auch-fuer-andere-themen-ins-spiel/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=sv&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" rel="nofollow">clear in understanding that the scanning
could later be used for other
purposes</a>:
“When considering regulation or legislation on encryption it should not
be done solely focusing on CSAM. Solutions for detection in encrypted
environments are much broader than one single crime,” <a href="https://www.ftm.eu/articles/ashton-kutcher-s-anti-childabuse-software-below-par" rel="nofollow">the company wrote
in one
document</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-go1tsn">It was later revealed that Europol was looking for <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/29/europol-sought-unlimited-data-access-in-online-child-sexual-abuse-regulation/" rel="nofollow">unfiltered access to
the scanned
material</a>:
“All data is useful and should be passed on to law enforcement. There
should be no filtering by the [EU] Centre because even an innocent
image might contain information that could at some point be useful to
law enforcement.”</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-ksnt3d">European Parliament: “the commission wanted mass surveillance.”</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-g9fw7s">So here was the European Commission, working on legislative proposals
together with a Europol that wanted access to all surveillance,
regardless of whether it contained something illegal or not – simply
because it could be useful to have. In other words, it really wasn’t
about the children.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ozl4kz">When articles were published about the EU Commission’s horrifyingly
undemocratic approach, Ylva Johansson’s office at the European
Commission responded by advertising on the platform X (formerly
Twitter). They targeted advertisements (pro Chat Control) so that
decision-makers in different countries would see them, but also so that
they would not be seen by people suspected to be strongly against the
proposal. The advertising was also targeted on the basis of religious
and political affiliation and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/csar-chat-scan-proposal-european-commission-ads/" rel="nofollow">thus violated the EU’s own laws
regarding
micro-targeting</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1qh87xe">Officials at the highest EU level thus used data collected by big tech
to try to create illegal filter bubbles designed to push through a mass
surveillance proposal. The whole thing ended with Ylva Johansson being
summoned to a hearing in the European Parliament. An almost united
European Parliament was massively critical of Ylva Johansson and her
approach. She was grilled about Thorn’s interference and about the
targeted ads and the EU Ombudsman denounced the European Commission’s
unwillingness to share public documents regarding the relationship with
Thorn (the European Commission had assumed these would be classified
because they risked undermining commercial interests …) Ylva
Johansson’s answer? “Think of the children.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pqryii">In November 2023, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2023-0364_EN.html" rel="nofollow">European Parliament’s final judgment was
delivered</a>.
In an almost historic consensus, all the groups in the Parliament stood
together and said “No” to the bill. At the <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2023/10/26/eu-chat-control-csam-encryption-privacy-european-commission-parliament-johansson-breyer-zarzalejos-ernst/" rel="nofollow">press conference,
representatives from the Parliament
said</a>:
“This is a slap in the face of the Commission, what we’ve tabled. The
Commission wasn’t focusing on protecting children but wanted mass
surveillance.” Patrick Breyer, who has been the most active opponent in
the EU Parliament, called it a victory for the children, adding “They
deserve an effective response and a rights-respecting response that will
hold up in court.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1bpb699">Breyer was referring to the fact that Chat Control would most likely not
hold up in court if the bill had been passed. Just a few months later, a
<a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/?i=001-230854" rel="nofollow">ruling from the European Court of
Justice</a>
ruled that authorities do not have the right to demand access to
end-to-end encrypted communications.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fxcimz">But the Chat Control proposal wasn’t completely buried just because the
European Parliament had taken a clear stance against it. In the EU, two
bodies are involved in the adoption of legislative proposals made by the
European Commission: the European Parliament and the Council of
Ministers. But while the European Parliament was extremely clear and
unified in its stance, the Council of Ministers was hopelessly unable to
reach an agreement. When new EU elections approached in summer 2024,
they had not yet managed to come to a consensus. However, the Council of
Ministers also began to hesitate about the technology. Ultimately, it
had become evident to most people that Ylva’s digital sniffer dog
didn’t exist. There was no technology that could scan communication
without looking at it. Parts of <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/eu-officials-dodge-their-own-surveillance-law" rel="nofollow">the Council of Ministers therefore
proposed</a>
that scanning should be excluded for politicians, the police and
intelligence services, as well as anything classified as ‘professional
secrets.’ Obviously, there were politicians who were afraid that their
secrets would leak, but who had nothing against mass surveillance of the
broader population. Patrick Breyer was clear in his response: “these
people are aware that Chat Control involves unreliable and dangerous
snooping algorithms – and yet they are ready to unleash them on us
citizens.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-pxyeh5">Even Ylva Johansson finally realized that she was defeated. Did she then
go public and announce that Europe would now be blind in the hunt for
pedophiles? Of course not. She quickly and easily did what she had
previously been completely unable to do: she extended the previous
legislation.</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-1xt5fg6">New attempt at mass surveillance via the Going Dark initiative</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1g9zhsh">The fact that the European Parliament rejected Chat Control didn’t mean
that attempts to introduce mass surveillance were over. During Sweden’s
EU Presidency in spring 2023, a project called Going Dark was initiated.
The idea from the Swedish Presidency was initially that a so-called High
Level Expert Group would be launched. The task of putting together the
group went to the European Commission, which immediately removed the
‘Expert’ label. Instead of a High Level Expert Group, a High Level Group
was formed. As <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2023/eu-beraet-ueber-going-dark-hinter-verschlossenen-tueren/" rel="nofollow">the Netzpolitik
newspaper</a>
put it: “Removing the word ‘expert’ is no small detail: special rules
apply to Expert groups, for example when it comes to transparency. Rules
that do not apply to High Level Groups.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rbtxom">Once again, the European Commission chose to start the preparatory work
linked to mass surveillance without allowing experts to play a serious
part in the process. When the group met for the first time, it stated
that <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8281-2023-INIT/en/pdf" rel="nofollow">the group’s purpose was to discuss
methods</a>
to achieve “access to data for effective law enforcement, based on and
guided by the inputs from the EU Member States.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-50kpr6">Some <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8281-2023-INIT/en/pdf" rel="nofollow">challenges were identified as particularly
pressing</a>:
access to encrypted material (both stored data and communication), data
storage, location data, and anonymization (including VPNs and Darknets).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-160puu6">Once the group was united, <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/high-level-group-hlg-access-data-effective-law-enforcement_en#meetings" rel="nofollow">it was divided into three working
groups</a>:
the first would work with access to data on users’ devices (computer and
mobile), the second group would focus on access to data in the services’
systems (messaging apps, for example), and the third group would discuss
access to data in transit.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5dnx7i">According to the minutes of the meeting of the Swedish Parliament’s
Committee on European Union Affairs, the group worked <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/eu-namndens-uppteckningar/fredagen-den-1-december_hb0a16/html/" rel="nofollow">“to present
effective recommendations for the accession of the new Commission in
2024 and for those recommendations to be
implemented.”</a></p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-h9po41">Future legislative proposals from the European Commission could thus be
assumed to be about providing access to data on users’ devices and in
the messaging services’ systems, and to data in transit. Patrick Breyer,
who had worked hard to counter Chat Control, said the group was just an
extension of past offensives and that Going Dark was working to
<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/leak-data-retention-and-encryption-eu-governments-going-dark-program-to-attack-citizens-rights-with-pr/" rel="nofollow">introduce illegal mass
surveillance</a>.
When he requested documents from the group’s meetings and a list of the
attendees, <a href="https://fragdenstaat.de/anfrage/june-and-november-meetings-of-the-hleg-on-access-to-data-for-effective-law-enforcement/848493/anhang/document17-participantlistfirstplenary.pdf" rel="nofollow">he received a document with the information blacked out as
if
classified</a>.
The European Commission had thus put together a working group aiming to
achieve mass surveillance of the broader population while not being
transparent about who was part of the group. It was like a scratched
record. Gone was the old excuse “think of the children”, but the goal
was the same.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1bp1ogo">However, some transparency was obtained through the Swedish Ministry of
Justice, which at Mullvad VPN’s request provided both meeting notes and
information about the Swedish representatives present at the meetings.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5ugd8h">The first Going Dark meeting was led by two people. One was Olivier
Onidi, who is Deputy Director General directly under Ylva Johansson in
the European Commission. Onidi has expressed that the “valuable” thing
about Chat Control is <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2021/eu-commission-why-chat-control-is-so-dangerous/" rel="nofollow">“to cover all forms of communication, including
private
communication”</a>,
and he <a href="https://www.svd.se/a/15yzLQ/expertkritik-mot-omstritt-natforslag-i-eu" rel="nofollow">defended Ylva Johansson and Chat Control when he
said</a>:
“I think it’s totally unfair to point this out as a mandatory inspection
of all private communications. That’s not what you have in front of you.
This proposal is a huge improvement over the current situation.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-18pbg5h">Onidi has also been questioned for <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/2020.06.10-Letter-to-Commission-Palantir.pdf" rel="nofollow">his meetings with the American
company
Palantir</a>
(notorious for its involvement in US authorities’ illegal mass
surveillance).</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13jylfg">The second person who led the first Going Dark meeting was Anna-Carin
Svensson, international chief negotiator at the Swedish Justice
Department, who, according to WikiLeaks documents in 2010, allegedly
urged the US State Department and the FBI to continue with the current
informal exchange of information between the countries instead of
signing formal agreements. According to the American representatives at
the meeting, it was about <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/m65Oqp/morkade-allt-for-riksdagen" rel="nofollow">withholding information from the Swedish
Parliament</a>:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-c39wdw">“She believed that, given the Swedish Constitution’s requirement to
present matters of importance to the nation to the Swedish Parliament,
and in light of the ongoing controversy over the newly decided FRA law
[FRA, Försvarets radioanstalt, the Swedish National Defence Radio
Establishment, is a Swedish government signals agency], it will be
politically impossible for the Minister of Justice not to let the
Parliament review any data exchange agreements with the United States.
In her opinion, the publication of this could also jeopardize the
informal exchange of information,” the leaked documents said.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gq4qsx">According to the documents, Anna-Carin Svensson asked the FBI if they
could not continue to make use of the strong but informal arrangements.
When the documents leaked, Svensson denied everything and stated: “I
cannot be held responsible for how Americans express themselves.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1d1qeq2">From the Swedish side, the Ministry of Justice was represented at the
Going Dark meetings, but so was the Swedish Security Service (Säpo) and
the Swedish Police Authority. Together with representatives from the
other Member States, they used the High Level Group meetings to discuss
how, through legislation, encrypted services could be required to
provide data in readable format. Several Member States argued that “the
working groups needed to look at solutions that involved ‘legal access
through design’.” This was something that pleased American
representatives.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15688qj">At the Going Dark meeting on November 21, 2023, a former FBI employee
was also present, who said that “solutions for legal access (to data on
device) should be prioritized” and that “companies needed to have a
responsibility and follow the same rules.” As a former FBI employee, he
also expressed “his gratitude for the fact that the issue was being
pursued within the EU.”</p> <h3 data-svelte-h="svelte-11oputi">European police chiefs: we cannot accept criminals using secure communications.</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ge3kom">The Going Dark meetings resulted in an outcry from the assembled police
chiefs of Europe. In April 2024 <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/european-police-chiefs-call-for-industry-and-governments-to-take-action-against-end-to-end-encryption-roll-out" rel="nofollow">Europol published the
challenge</a>
“European Police Chiefs call for industry and governments to take action
against end-to-end encryption roll-out.” The declaration was a <a href="https://polisen.se/aktuellt/nyheter/nationell/2024/april/europas-polischefer-gar-samman-mot-grov-brottslighet-i-en-digital-varld/" rel="nofollow">“direct
extension of the Going Dark
initiative”</a>
and, together, the European police authorities were clear that although
encryption is “a means of strengthening the cyber security and privacy
of citizens … we do not accept that there need be a binary choice
between cyber security or privacy on the one hand and public safety on
the other. Absolutism on either side is not helpful.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-drlmm9">It was as if Ylva Johansson’s sniffer dog had caught the scent again. In
the absence of expertise, the Going Dark initiative tried to magic away
the fact that end-to-end encryption is absolute – either you have
secure communication or you don’t.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15pvrfa">The assembled police chiefs claimed there were <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/EDOC-%231384205-v1-Joint_Declaration_of_the_European_Police_Chiefs.PDF" rel="nofollow">two key factors for
achieving online
security</a>
– which turned out to be direct repetitions of the reasoning in the
Going Dark discussions. Number 1: so-called legal access to the tech
companies’ stored data. Number 2: real-time scanning of illegal activity
in tech companies’ services. Naturally, they said, all this would be
done under strong protection and supervision.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ko89e9">Stefan Hector, a representative of the Swedish Police Authority, said
that <a href="https://polisen.se/aktuellt/nyheter/nationell/2024/april/europas-polischefer-gar-samman-mot-grov-brottslighet-i-en-digital-varld/" rel="nofollow">“a society cannot accept that criminals today have a space to
communicate safely in order to commit serious
crimes.”</a>
A week later, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.svd.se/a/8qwGbx/granskning-poliser-lacker-till-gangen" rel="nofollow">the Swedish police had been
infiltrated and were leaking information to
criminals</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-mnpnic">Although <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/civicspace/resources/civic_space_protection_encryption_brief.pdf" rel="nofollow">the UN classifies encryption as a human
right</a>,
the Going Dark initiative and the European police force are fighting to
smash end-to-end encryption. Their first move came as a reaction to
<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/european-police-chiefs-call-for-industry-and-governments-to-take-action-against-end-to-end-encryption-roll-out" rel="nofollow">Meta rolling out exactly such
encryption</a>.
The echoes from the Chat Control debate are clear. But it is also an
echo of an older battle.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fchcvw">The Going Dark initiative is really just an extension of the so-called
crypto war (the war against encryption) that US authorities have been
involved in since the internet began. As Signal’s CEO <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pdfs/ndss-keynote.pdf" rel="nofollow">Meredith
Whittaker said in a keynote
speech</a>:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1wyi685">“Encryption was essential for the commercial internet. But law
enforcement and security services saw any network resistant to
government surveillance as a threat and a problem.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1mez9xt">The US authorities have already tested the backdoors that the European
Going Dark initiative is now seeking. Edward Snowden revealed that <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html" rel="nofollow">the
NSA spent $250 million a
year</a>
getting tech companies to install backdoors in their services, which
also exposed the risks of backdoors. In 2010, Chinese hackers managed
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/23/schneier.google.hacking/index.html" rel="nofollow">to use a Google
backdoor</a>
to get into Gmail. The same thing happened in 2005, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-athens-affair" rel="nofollow">when state
surveillance of Vodafone was
exploited</a> by outside
actors to bug the Greek Prime Minister, his Foreign Minister, Justice
Minister, and a hundred other government officials.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5waapy">And when it comes to client-side scanning, it’s also doomed to fail.
Apple, one of the world’s most technologically advanced and wealthy
companies, has poured incredible resources into figuring out if it can
be done in a secure and private way. But when Apple made its effort
public, it took hackers just two weeks to break in. Apple abandoned the
attempt and continue to say no to anyone who asks them to try this again
– <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/03/23/remarks-on-chat-control/" rel="nofollow">simply because it’s too easy to hack systems where client-side
scanning is
involved</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-186vxxe">Snowden’s revelations changed the internet in many respects. Encrypted
websites (https) became standard. End-to-end encrypted messaging
services like Signal saw a widespread increase in popularity. Apple
started using strong encryption in its operating systems. From having
virtually free access to people’s internet traffic (if they didn’t use a
trustworthy VPN, that is) and from having been able to read people’s
messages in plain text, the internet now became more difficult for US
authorities to mass monitor.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-4s3l6u">In her <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pdfs/ndss-keynote.pdf" rel="nofollow">lecture</a>,
Meredith Whittaker points to an important point: “Strong encryption was
an important win. But the result of this win was not privacy. Indeed,
the legacy of the crypto wars was to trade privacy for encryption – and
to usher in an age of mass corporate surveillance. Because the power to
enable – or violate – privacy was left in the hands of companies, not
those who relied on their services. Companies that were incentivized to
implement surveillance in service of advertising and commerce.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-q6flu7">For more than twenty years, so-called commercial mass surveillance has
created some of the richest companies in the world. The fact that Meta
is rolling out end-to-end encryption doesn’t mean they have abandoned
their business model. But it was still sufficient for the European
police chiefs, cheered on by the US authorities, to make a joint
declaration demanding legal access to the content in secure and private
communications. Meredith Whittaker again:</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-wzc8j2">“In my view, the ferocity of the current attack on end-to-end
encryption, and other privacy-preserving technologies, is very much
related to a desire by some in government to return to the less fettered
access to surveillance that they see as having lost post-Snowden.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-3ttgl1">We can see the attack coming in Europe right now. But the movement is
based in the United States. Back in 2014, just a year after Snowden’s
revelations, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course?ref=tailored-access.com" rel="nofollow">FBI Director James Comey
spoke</a>
of how “the challenges of real-time interception threaten to leave us in
the dark, encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.”</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bca7cd">The US authorities, which in 2014 had recently been caught spying on the
entire world, used a particular expression when they began lobbying to
regain access to easily controlling everything and everyone. FBI
Director Comey talked about “Going Dark.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The Erlang/OTP documentation before Erlang/OTP 27 was authored in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, from which the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/docs/26/apps/erl_docgen/">Erl_Docgen</a>
application could generate HTML web pages, PDFs, or Unix man pages.
The reason for generating PDFs is that the documentation used to be
printed as
<a href="https://erlangforums.com/t/old-printed-otp-documentation-cover/1989/2">actual paper books</a>.
The last time the books were printed were for Erlang/OTP R7 released in 2000.</p>

<p>As an example, here is the XML code for
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/docs/26/man/lists#duplicate-2"><code>lists:duplicate/2</code></a>
from Erlang/OTP 26:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;func&gt;
      &lt;name name="duplicate" arity="2" since=""/&gt;
      &lt;fsummary&gt;Make &lt;c&gt;N&lt;/c&gt; copies of element.&lt;/fsummary&gt;
      &lt;desc&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Returns a list containing &lt;c&gt;&lt;anno&gt;N&lt;/anno&gt;&lt;/c&gt; copies of term
          &lt;c&gt;&lt;anno&gt;Elem&lt;/anno&gt;&lt;/c&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;
&gt; &lt;input&gt;lists:duplicate(5, xx).&lt;/input&gt;
[xx,xx,xx,xx,xx]&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;/func&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The XML code was stored in separate files, not in the source
code. When building the documentation, the function specs from the
source code would be combined with the text from the documentation
file. It was the responsibility of the writer to ensure that variables
mentioned in the documentation body matched the names in the function
spec.</p>

<p>One thing never said about Erl_Docgen and the old documentation system
was that it made writing documentation enjoyable and effortless. That
was one thing we wanted to change with the new documentation system.
We wanted to make it fun to write documentation, or at least to
require less attention to tedious details such as using XML tags
correctly.</p>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 27, the documentation is written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and is placed in
the source code before the function spec and implementation. Here is
the documentation and implementation of
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/lists#duplicate/2"><code>lists:duplicate/2</code></a>
in Erlang/OTP 27:</p>

<pre><code>-doc """
Returns a list containing `N` copies of term `Elem`.

_Example:_

```erlang
&gt; lists:duplicate(5, xx).
[xx,xx,xx,xx,xx]
```
""".

-spec duplicate(N, Elem) -&gt; List when
      N :: non_neg_integer(),
      Elem :: T,
      List :: [T],
      T :: term().

duplicate(N, X) when is_integer(N), N &gt;= 0 -&gt; duplicate(N, X, []).

duplicate(0, _, L) -&gt; L;
duplicate(N, X, L) -&gt; duplicate(N-1, X, [X|L]).
```
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation is placed in a
<a href="#triple-quoted-strings">triple-quoted string</a>
following
the <a href="https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0059"><code>-doc</code> attribute</a>.</p>

<p>Having the documentation near the spec makes its easy to ensure that
the text refers to variables defined in the function spec.</p>

<p>Another goal we had was to replace Erl_Docgen with a tool more widely
used so that we wouldn’t have to carry the entire burden for
maintaining it. We did that by using
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ex_doc/readme.html">ExDoc</a>, which is also used by
the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> language and most, if not all,
Elixir projects.</p>

<p>An issue that arose is whether it’s advisable to include user
documentation within the source code. Wouldn’t this make it much harder
to maintain the code?</p>

<p>I don’t claim to have a universal response to that concern, but in the
case of Erlang/OTP, most actively developed code exists within modules
lacking documentation. Typically, OTP applications consist of one or
a few modules containing the documented API, while the bulk of the
implementation is found in other modules.</p>

<p>For example, the interface to the Erlang compiler is found in the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/compile">compile</a> module, while most
of the code being executed resides in one of the other 59 modules
of the Compiler application. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/ssl">SSL
application</a> comprises 76 modules,
of which merely four contain documentation.</p>

<p>Another application that is frequently updated is
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts">ERTS</a>. However, most of ERTS is
implemented in C (and some C++), while much of the actual
Erlang code within ERTS is located in modules without documentation.</p>

<p>There are, of course, some exceptions to how applications are
structured, for example the STDLIB application, where most modules are
documented. However, STDLIB is a mature application that is updated
relatively infrequently.</p>
      <h2 id="triple-quoted-strings">
        
        
          Triple-Quoted strings <a href="#triple-quoted-strings">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>To facilitate writing documentation attributes containing many lines
of text, triple-quoted strings as described in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0064">EEP
64</a> have been
implemented. Triple-quoted strings come in handy whenever one needs
to include multiple line of text in Erlang source code. For example,
assume that we want to define a function that outputs some
quotations:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; t:quotes().
"I always have a quotation for everything -
it saves original thinking." - Dorothy L. Sayers

"Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time."
- Terry Pratchett
ok
</code></pre>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 26, there are several different ways to do that, but of none
of them are particularly satisfying. For example, the text can be put into a
single string:</p>

<pre><code>quotes() -&gt;
    S = "\"I always have a quotation for everything -
it saves original thinking.\" - Dorothy L. Sayers

\"Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.\"
- Terry Pratchett\n",
    io:put_chars(S).
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but is ugly. We must also remember to escape every quote
character.</p>

<p>A cleaner way is to use multiple strings, one for each line, letting
the compiler combine them:</p>

<pre><code>quotes() -&gt;
    S = "\"I always have a quotation for everything -\n"
        "it saves original thinking.\" - Dorothy L. Sayers\n"
        "\n"
        "\"Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.\"\n"
        "- Terry Pratchett\n",
    io:put_chars(S).
</code></pre>

<p>That is a little bit nicer, but we’ll need to type more quote characters
and we must not forget to add <code>\n</code> at the end of each string. To
make sure that we don’t forget to insert the newlines, we could delegate
that mundane chore to the computer:</p>

<pre><code>quotes() -&gt;
    S = ["\"I always have a quotation for everything -",
         "it saves original thinking.\" - Dorothy L. Sayers",
         "",
         "\"Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.\"",
         "- Terry Pratchett"],
    io:put_chars(lists:join("\n", S)),
    io:nl().
</code></pre>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 27, we can use a triple-quoted string:</p>

<pre><code>quotes() -&gt;
    S = """
        "I always have a quotation for everything -
        it saves original thinking." - Dorothy L. Sayers

        "Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time."
        - Terry Pratchett
        """,
    io:put_chars(S),
    io:nl().
</code></pre>

<p>The ending <code>"""</code> determines how much each line in the string should be
indented. The same characters that precede <code>"""</code> are deleted from all
lines between the beginning and terminating delimiters. For this
particular example, all space characters are removed since all have
the same indentation as the terminating <code>"""</code>.  Neither quote
characters nor backslashes are special in the lines enclosed by the
triple-quotes, so there is no need to escape anything.</p>

<p>Here is another example to show the versatility of triple-quoted
strings:</p>

<pre><code>effect_warning() -&gt;
    """
    f() -&gt;
        %% Test that the compiler warns for useless tuple building.
        {a,b,c},
        ok.
    """.
</code></pre>

<p>The function returns a string containing a short Erlang function.</p>

<p>Assuming that <code>effect_warning/0</code> is defined in module <code>t</code>, it can be
called like so:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; io:format("~ts\n", [t:effect_warning()]).
f() -&gt;
    %% Test that the compiler warns for useless tuple building.
    {a,b,c},
    ok.
</code></pre>

<p>Note that indentation of the Erlang code for function <code>f/0</code> is retained.</p>

<p>For more information, see section <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/data_types#string">String</a>
in the Reference Manual.</p>
      <h2 id="sigils">
        
        
          Sigils <a href="#sigils">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Sigils for string literals as described in <a href="https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0066">EEP 66</a>
have been implemented.</p>

<p>Continuing with the theme of quotes, let’s explore why sigils were
introduced into Erlang, drawing inspiration from the wisdom of ancient
Greek philosophers:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; t:greek_quote().
"Know thyself" (Greek: Γνῶθι σαυτόν)
ok
</code></pre>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 26, this can be implemented as follows:</p>

<pre><code>greek_quote() -&gt;
    S = "\"Know thyself\" (Greek: Γνῶθι σαυτόν)",
    io:format("~ts\n", [S]).
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, we get some customer feedback indicating that the
modules containing all the quotes are consuming an excessive amount of
memory. Each character in a string consumes 16 bytes of memory (on a
64-bit computer). That could be reduced to one byte for each character
if a binary were to be used instead of a string.  (Actually, one byte
for each US ASCII character and two bytes for each Greek letter.)</p>

<p>That change should be really easy. Let’s try:</p>

<pre><code>greek_quote() -&gt;
    S = &lt;&lt;"\"Know thyself\" (Greek: Γνῶθι σαυτόν)"&gt;&gt;,
    io:format("~ts\n", [S]).
</code></pre>

<p>That works for the English text, but not for the Greek characters:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; t:greek_quote().
"Know thyself" (Greek: ½ö¸¹ Ã±ÅÄÌ½)
</code></pre>

<p>What’s wrong?</p>

<p>Strings in binary expression are by default assumed to be a sequence
of byte-size characters. Therefore, this expression:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; &lt;&lt;"Γνῶθι"&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;147,189,246,184,185&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a> for:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; &lt;&lt;$Γ:8, $ν:8, $ῶ:8, $θ:8, $ι:8&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;147,189,246,184,185&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It is necessary to specify that the characters are to be encoded as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>
encoded characters by appending an <code>/utf8</code> suffix:</p>

<pre><code>greek_quote() -&gt;
    S = &lt;&lt;"\"Know thyself\" (Greek: Γνῶθι σαυτόν)"/utf8&gt;&gt;,
    io:format("~ts\n", [S]).
</code></pre>

<p>That works because <code>&lt;&lt;"Γνῶθι"/utf8&gt;&gt;</code> is syntactic sugar for
<code>&lt;&lt;$Γ/utf8, $ν/utf8, $ῶ/utf8, $θ/utf8, $ι/utf8&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Enter sigils.</p>

<pre><code>greek_quote() -&gt;
    S = ~B["Know thyself" (Greek: Γνῶθι σαυτόν)],
    io:format("~ts\n", [S]).
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>~</code> character begins a sigil. It is usually followed by a letter that
indicates how the characters in the string should be interpreted or encoded.</p>

<p>In this case the character <code>B</code> means that the characters should be put into a binary in UTF-8 encoding,
and also that that no escape characters are allowed.</p>

<p>After <code>B</code> follows the start delimiter, in this case <code>[</code>.  Since no escape characters
are allowed, it is necessary to choose delimiters that don’t occur in the string
contents. After the contents follows the end delimiter, in this case <code>]</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>B</code> sigil is the default sigil that is used if the letter following
<code>~</code> is omitted. Thus we get the same binary and the same output if we omit the <code>B</code>:</p>

<pre><code>greek_quote() -&gt;
    S = ~["Know thyself" (Greek: Γνῶθι σαυτόν)],
    io:format("~ts\n", [S]).
</code></pre>

<p>Sigils can also be used to begin a triple-quoted string. Returning to
the quotations example from the previous section, a binary literal can
be created by inserting <code>~</code> before the leading <code>"""</code>:</p>

<pre><code>quotes() -&gt;
    S = ~"""
         "I always have a quotation for everything -
         it saves original thinking." - Dorothy L. Sayers

         "Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time."
         - Terry Pratchett
         """,
    io:put_chars(S),
    io:nl().
</code></pre>

<p>Here follows a few quick examples to show the other sigils.</p>

<p><code>~b</code> creates a binary in the same way as <code>~B</code>, except that backslashes
will be interpreted as an escape character. This can be useful if one
want to insert control characters such as TAB (<code>\t</code>) into a string:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; ~b"abc\txyz".
&lt;&lt;"abc\txyz"&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here we used the <code>"</code> character as delimiters as it is not used within
the string.</p>

<p><code>~s</code> creates a string in the usual way. The only useful way it differs
from a plain quoted string is that the delimiters can be switched. That
way, one can avoid the hassle of escaping quote characters and still
get to use control characters such as TAB:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; ~s{"abc\txyz"}.
"\"abc\txyz\""
</code></pre>

<p><code>~S</code> creates a string, but does not support escaping of characters
within the string, similar to <code>~B</code>.</p>

          No need to enable feature <code>maybe</code> <a href="#no-need-to-enable-feature-maybe">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions#maybe">maybe expression</a>
was introduced as a <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/features.html">feature</a>
in Erlang/OTP 25. In that release, it was necessary to enable it both in
the compiler and the runtime system.</p>

<p>Erlang/OTP 26 lifted the necessity to enable <code>maybe</code> in the runtime system.</p>

<p>Now in Erlang/OTP 27, <code>maybe</code> is enabled by default in the compiler.
In the example from
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/blog/otp-26-highlights/#no-need-to-enable-feature-maybe-in-the-runtime-system">last year’s blog post</a>,
the line <code>-feature(maybe_expr, enable).</code> can now be removed:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat t.erl
-module(t).
-export([listen_port/2]).
listen_port(Port, Options) -&gt;
    maybe
        {ok, ListenSocket} ?= inet_tcp:listen(Port, Options),
        {ok, Address} ?= inet:sockname(ListenSocket),
        {ok, {ListenSocket, Address}}
    end.
$ erlc t.erl
$ erl
Erlang/OTP 27 . . .

Eshell V15.0  (abort with ^G)
1&gt; t:listen_port(50000, []).
{ok,{#Port&lt;0.5&gt;,{{0,0,0,0},50000}}}
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>maybe</code> is used as an atom, it need to be quoted. For example:</p>

<pre><code>will_succeed(. . .) -&gt; yes;
will_succeed(. . .) -&gt; no;
   .
   .
   .
will_succeed(_) -&gt; 'maybe'.
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, it is still possible to disable the <code>maybe_expr</code> feature. With
the feature disabled, <code>maybe</code> can be used as an atom without quotes.</p>

<p>One way to disable <code>maybe</code> is to use the <code>-disable-feature</code> option when compiling.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>erlc -disable-feature maybe_expr *.erl
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to disable <code>maybe</code> is to add the following directive to
the source code:</p>

<pre><code>-feature(maybe_expr, disable).

          The new <code>json</code> module <a href="#the-new-json-module">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>There is a new module <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/json"><code>json</code></a> in
STDLIB for generating and parsing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a>.</p>

<p>It is implemented by <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala">Michał
Muskała</a> who has also implemented
the <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason"><code>Jason</code></a> library for
Elixir. <code>Jason</code> is known for being faster than other pure Erlang or
Elixir JSON libraries. The <code>json</code> module is not a pure translation of
the Elixir code for Jason, but a re-implementation with even better
performance than <code>Jason</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, imagine that we have this file <code>quotes.json</code> with
quotes from the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_and_the_Argonauts_(1963_film)">Jason and the
Argonauts</a>:</p>

<pre><code>[
    {"quote": "The gods are best served by those who need their help the least.",
     "attribution": "Zeus",
     "verified": true},
    {"quote": "Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin.",
     "attribution": "Jason",
     "verified": true}
]
</code></pre>

<p>The JSON contents of the file can be be decoded by calling
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/json#decode/1">json:decode/1</a>:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; {ok,JSON} = file:read_file("quotes.json").
{ok,&lt;&lt;"[\n   {\"quote\": \"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least.\",\n    \"attribution\": \"Zeus\""...&gt;&gt;}
2&gt; json:decode(JSON).
[#{&lt;&lt;"attribution"&gt;&gt; =&gt; &lt;&lt;"Zeus"&gt;&gt;,
   &lt;&lt;"quote"&gt;&gt; =&gt;
       &lt;&lt;"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least."&gt;&gt;,
   &lt;&lt;"verified"&gt;&gt; =&gt; true},
 #{&lt;&lt;"attribution"&gt;&gt; =&gt; &lt;&lt;"Jason"&gt;&gt;,
   &lt;&lt;"quote"&gt;&gt; =&gt;
       &lt;&lt;"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin."&gt;&gt;,
   &lt;&lt;"verified"&gt;&gt; =&gt; true}]
</code></pre>

<p>By default, for safety, the keys for objects are translated to binaries. Using atoms
could open up for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attacks</a>
if a malicious JSON object would define millions of unique keys.</p>

<p>For convenience, it is still possible to convert keys to atoms in
a safe way by using a <em>decoder callback</em>. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; Push = fun(Key, Value, Acc) -&gt; [{binary_to_existing_atom(Key), Value} | Acc] end.
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.40.39164016&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This fun converts the key for a JSON object to an <strong>existing</strong> atom,
or raises an exception if no such atom exists.</p>

<p>Since this example is run from the shell, we’ll need to make sure that all possible keys
are known atoms:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; {quote,attribution,verified}.
{quote,attribution,verified}
</code></pre>

<p>This would normally not be necessary when JSON decoding is done in an Erlang module,
because the atoms to be used as keys would presumably be defined naturally by being used
when processing the decoded JSON objects.</p>

<p>With this preparation done, the JSON decoder can be called using the <code>Push</code> fun
as an <code>object_push</code> decoder callback:</p>

<pre><code>3&gt; {Qs,_,&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;} = json:decode(JSON, [], #{object_push =&gt; Push}), Qs.
[#{quote =&gt;
       &lt;&lt;"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least."&gt;&gt;,
   attribution =&gt; &lt;&lt;"Zeus"&gt;&gt;,verified =&gt; true},
 #{quote =&gt;
       &lt;&lt;"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin."&gt;&gt;,
   attribution =&gt; &lt;&lt;"Jason"&gt;&gt;,verified =&gt; true}]
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/json#encode/1">json:encode/1</a> function encodes
an Erlang term to JSON:</p>

<pre><code>4&gt; io:format("~ts\n", [json:encode(Qs)]).
[{"quote":"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least.","attribution":"Zeus","verified":true},{"quote":"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin.","attribution":"Jason","verified":true}]
ok
</code></pre>

<p>The encoder accepts binaries, atoms, and integer as keys for objects,
so there is no need to customize encoding for this particular example.</p>

<p>However, when necessary, it is possible to customize the encoding. For
example, assume that we want to store each quotation in a three-tuple
instead of in a map:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; Q = [{~"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least.",
~"Zeus",true},
{~"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin.",
~"Jason",true}].
[{&lt;&lt;"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least."&gt;&gt;,
  &lt;&lt;"Zeus"&gt;&gt;,true},
 {&lt;&lt;"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin."&gt;&gt;,
  &lt;&lt;"Jason"&gt;&gt;,true}]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>json:encode/1</code> function does not handle that format by default, but it can be
handled by defining an <em>encoder function</em>:</p>

<pre><code>quote_encoder({Q, A, V}, Encode)
  when is_binary(Q), is_binary(A), is_boolean(V) -&gt;
    json:encode_map(#{quote =&gt; Q,
                      attribution =&gt; A,
                      verified =&gt; V},
                    Encode);
quote_encoder(Other, Encode) -&gt;
    json:encode_value(Other, Encode).
</code></pre>

<p>The first clause matches a tuple of size three that looks like a
quotation. If it matches, it is converted to the map representation
for a JSON object, which is then converted by the utility function
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/json#encode_map/2">json:encode_map/1</a>
to JSON.</p>

<p>The second clause handles all other Erlang terms by calling the
default encoding function
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/json#encode_value/2">json:encode_value/2</a>
for converting a term to JSON.</p>

<p>Assuming that this function is defined in module <code>t</code>, the conversion to JSON
is invoked as follows:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; io:format("~ts\n", [json:encode(Q, fun t:quote_encoder/2)]).
[{"quote":"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least.","attribution":"Zeus","verified":true},{"quote":"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin.","attribution":"Jason","verified":true}]
</code></pre>

<p>The JSON encoder will call the callback recursively for given term. That can
be clearly seen if we modify the second clause of <code>quote_encoder/2</code> to also
print the value of <code>Other</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3&gt; json:encode(Q, fun t:quote_encoder/2), ok.
-- [{&lt;&lt;"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least."&gt;&gt;,
     &lt;&lt;"Zeus"&gt;&gt;,true},
    {&lt;&lt;"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin."&gt;&gt;,
     &lt;&lt;"Jason"&gt;&gt;,true}]
-- &lt;&lt;"quote"&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"The gods are best served by those who need their help the least."&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"attribution"&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"Zeus"&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"verified"&gt;&gt;
-- true
-- &lt;&lt;"quote"&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"Now the voyage is over, I don't want any trouble to begin."&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"attribution"&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"Jason"&gt;&gt;
-- &lt;&lt;"verified"&gt;&gt;
-- true

<p>The three sets modules in STDLIB —
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sets"><code>sets</code></a>,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gb_sets"><code>gb_sets</code></a>, and
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ordsets"><code>ordsets</code></a> —
have new functions <code>is_equal/2</code>, <code>map/2</code>, and <code>filtermap/2</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>is_equal/2</code> function is useful when one needs to find out whether two
sets contain the same elements. Comparing with <code>==</code> or <code>=:=</code> is not always
reliable. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; Seq = lists:seq(1, 20, 2).
[1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]
2&gt; gb_sets:from_list(Seq) == gb_sets:delete(10, gb_sets:from_list([10|Seq])).
false
3&gt; gb_sets:is_equal(gb_sets:from_list(Seq), gb_sets:delete(10, gb_sets:from_list([10|Seq]))).
true
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>map/2</code> maps the element of a set, producing a new set:</p>

<pre><code>4&gt; Seq = lists:seq(1, 20, 2).
[1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.42.39164016&gt;
5&gt; ordsets:to_list(ordsets:map(fun(N) -&gt; N div 4 end, ordsets:from_list(Seq))).
[0,1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>filtermap/2</code> function can map and filter at the same time. Here is an example
showing how to multiply each integer in a set by 100 and remove non-integers:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; Mixed = [1,2,3,a,b,c].
[1,2,3,a,b,c]
2&gt; F = fun(N) when is_integer(N) -&gt; {true,N * 100};
   (_) -&gt; false
   end.
#Fun&lt;erl_eval.42.39164016&gt;
3&gt; sets:to_list(sets:filtermap(F, sets:from_list(Mixed))).

      </h2>
    

<p>In Erlang/OTP 26, the functions in the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/timer"><code>timer</code></a> module don’t accept funs.
It is certainly possibly to pass in a fun in the argument for
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang#apply/2"><code>erlang:apply/2</code></a>,
but if one makes a mistake it will be only be noticed when the
timer expires:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; timer:apply_after(10, erlang, apply, [fun() -&gt; io:put_chars("now!\n") end]).
{ok,{once,#Ref&lt;0.2380540714.1485570051.86513&gt;}}

Error in process &lt;0.109.0&gt; with exit value:
{undef,[{erlang,apply,[#Fun&lt;erl_eval.43.105768164&gt;],[]}]}
</code></pre>

<p>Here the empty argument list for the fun was forgotten. It should have been:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; timer:apply_after(10, erlang, apply, [fun() -&gt; io:put_chars("now!\n") end, []]).
{ok,{once,#Ref&lt;0.2380540714.1485570051.86522&gt;}}
now!
</code></pre>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 27, using a fun is much easier:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; timer:apply_after(10, fun() -&gt; io:put_chars("now!\n") end).
{ok,{once,#Ref&lt;0.3845681669.1215561736.51634&gt;}}
now!
</code></pre>

<p>In systems that use hot code updating, using a local fun for a long-running
timer is not ideal. The code that defines the fun could have been replaced,
and when the timer finally expires the call will fail. Therefore, it is also
possible to pass a fun as well as its arguments, making it possible to use
use a remote fun that will survive hot code updating:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; timer:apply_after(10, fun io:put_chars/1, ["now\n"]).
{ok,{once,#Ref&lt;0.3845681669.1215561736.51650&gt;}}
now
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>apply_interval/*</code> and <code>apply_repeatedly/*</code> functions now also accept
funs.</p>

6&gt; {K4,_} = ets:next_lookup(T, K3).

</code></pre>

<p>Similarly,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets#last_lookup/1"><code>ets:last_lookup/1</code></a>
and
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets#prev_lookup/2"><code>ets:prev_lookup/2</code></a>
can be used to traverse a table in reverse order.</p>

<p>The new function
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets#update_element/4"><code>ets:update_element/4</code></a>
is similar to
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets#update_element/3"><code>ets:update_element/3</code></a>,
but makes it possible to supply a default object when there is no existing
object with the given key:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; T = ets:new(example, []).
#Ref&lt;0.878413430.1983512583.205850&gt;
2&gt; ets:update_element(T, a, {2, true}, {a, true}).
true
3&gt; ets:lookup(T, a).

          New SSL client-side stapling support <a href="#new-ssl-client-side-stapling-support">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>A new feature in the SSL client in Erlang/OTP 27 is support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP
stapling</a> for easier and
faster verification of the revocation status of server
certificates.</p>

<p>With OCSP stapling, the SSL client can streamline the validation of
revocation status. Normally the client would have to query the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">CA (Certificate
Authority)</a> using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP (Online Certificate Status
Protocol)</a>
to ensure that the server’s certificate has not been
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation">revoked</a>.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind OCSP stapling is that the server itself will
proactively query the CA regarding the revocation status for its own
certificate and “staple” the time-stamped OCSP response from the CA to
the certificate. When a client connects, the server passes along
its OCSP-stapled certificate to the client. To verify the revocation
status, the client only needs to check that the OCSP response was
signed by the CA.</p>

<p>Here follows an example showing how OCSP stapling can be enabled in the
SSL client:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; ssl:start().
ok
2&gt; {ok, Socket} = ssl:connect("duckduckgo.com", 443,
                              [{cacerts, public_key:cacerts_get()},
                               {stapling, staple}]).
{ok,{sslsocket,{gen_tcp,#Port&lt;0.5&gt;,tls_connection,undefined},
               [&lt;0.122.0&gt;,&lt;0.121.0&gt;]}}
</code></pre>
      
    

<p>In Erlang/OTP 27, the new profiling tool
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/tprof"><code>tprof</code></a>
joins the existing profiling tools
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/cprof"><code>cprof</code></a>,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/eprof"><code>eprof</code></a>,
and <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/fprof"><code>fprof</code></a>.</p>

<p>Why introduce a new profiling tool?</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>cprof</code> and <code>eprof</code> perform similar profiling
tasks, but the naming of the API functions are different. It is quite
easy to mix up the names when running one tool after the other, and
running them after each other is not uncommon.  For example, when
trying to find a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck_(software)">bottleneck</a> in a
complex running Erlang system, one approcach is to first use
<code>cprof</code> to get a rough idea of the general part of the system where a
bottleneck could be located. After that, <code>eprof</code> is run on a limited
part of the system trying to narrow it down. Directly running <code>eprof</code>
on a large Erlang application could overload it and bring it down.</p>

<p>Using <code>tprof</code>, the same function is used for both counting calls and
measuring the time for each call. Here is how to count calls when
<code>lists:seq(1, 1000)</code> is called:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; tprof:profile(lists, seq, [1, 1000], #{type =&gt; call_count}).
FUNCTION          CALLS  [    %]
lists:seq/2           1  [ 0.40]
lists:seq_loop/3    251  [99.60]
                         [100.0]
ok
</code></pre>

<p>Note that call counting is always done for all processes.</p>

<p>The bulk of the work for <code>lists:seq/2</code> is done in <code>lists:seq_loop/3</code>,
which was called 251 times. Since we asked for 1000 integers, we
reach the conclusion that each tail-recursive call to <code>seq_loop/3</code>
creates four list elements at once. That can be confirmed by
looking at the
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/ca50a5d73703f74e2eae1ca40bbe6c4f027f9f98/lib/stdlib/src/lists.erl#L409-L416">source code</a>.</p>

<p>To measure the time for each call, we only need to replace
<code>call_count</code> with <code>call_time</code>:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; tprof:profile(lists, seq, [1, 1000], #{type =&gt; call_time}).

****** Process &lt;0.94.0&gt;  --  100.00% of total ***
FUNCTION          CALLS  TIME (μs)  PER CALL  [     %]
lists:seq/2           1          0      0.00  [  0.00]
lists:seq_loop/3    251         50      0.20  [100.00]
                                50            [ 100.0]
ok
</code></pre>

<p>Call time is only measured the process that called
<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/tprof#profile/4"><code>tprof:profile/4</code></a>
and any process spawned by that process.</p>

<p>By replacing <code>call_time</code> with <code>call_memory</code> the amount of memory consumed
by each call will be measured:</p>

<pre><code>3&gt; tprof:profile(lists, seq, [1, 1000], #{type =&gt; call_memory}).

****** Process &lt;0.97.0&gt;  --  100.00% of total ***
FUNCTION          CALLS  WORDS  PER CALL  [     %]
lists:seq_loop/3    251   2000      7.97  [100.00]
                          2000            [ 100.0]
ok
</code></pre>

<p>The total number of words created is 2000, which make sense since each
list element needs 2 words. The number of words consumed per call is
<code>2000 / 251</code>, which is approximately 7.97 or almost 8. That also makes
sense since each tail-recursive call creates 4 list elements, or 8
words, and there are 250 such calls. The remaining call creates the final
empty list (<code>[]</code>).</p>

<p><code>call_memory</code> tracing was introduced in the runtime system in
Erlang/OTP 26, but was not exposed in any existing profiling tool
because it didn’t really fit in any of them. It made more sense to enable
support for it in a new tool.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>Tracing makes it possible to observe, debug, analyse, and measure the
performance of a running Erlang system. Over the year, numerous tools
using tracing has been developed. In Erlang/OTP alone, several tools
leverage tracing for different purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dbg"><code>dbg</code></a>, <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ttb"><code>ttb</code></a> -
general tracing tools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/etop"><code>etop</code></a> - similar to <code>top</code> in Unix</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/eprof"><code>eprof</code></a>,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/cprof"><code>cprof</code></a>,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/fprof"><code>fprof</code></a>,
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/tprof"><code>tprof</code></a> - profiling tools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/et"><code>et</code></a> - event tracer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/debugger"><code>debugger</code></a> - uses tracing
internally when evaluating <code>receive</code> expressions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 26 and earlier tracing had some limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There could only be a single tracer per traced process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The configuration for which processes and functions to trace were
global within the runtime system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Those limitations meant that different tracing tools could easily step
on each other’s toes. The treacherous part was that using multiple tracing
tools at the same time would seem to work for a while… until it didn’t.</p>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 27, multiple trace sessions can be created. Each trace
session has its own tracer process and configuration for which
processes and functions to trace.</p>

<p>To create a trace session and set up tracing, there is the new
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/trace"><code>trace</code></a> module in the Kernel
application. Tools that set up tracing using that module will no longer
interfere with each other. Tools that use the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang#trace/3">old API</a>
will share a single global trace session.</p>

<p>In the initial Erlang/OTP 27 release, some of the tools using tracing
have been updated to use trace sessions. Other tools will be updated in
upcoming maintenance releases.</p>

<p>We have tried to design the new API in a way to make it relatively
easy for maintainers of external tools to migrate their code.  Apart
from the names of the functions and the first argument (the session
argument), the other arguments and their semantics are almost entirely
identical to the old API.</p>
      <h2 id="quick-trace-session-example">
        
        
          Quick trace session example <a href="#quick-trace-session-example">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>Here is an example to show how the new API is used. First we’ll need
a tracer process that prints all trace messages it receives:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; Tracer = spawn(fun F() -&gt; receive M -&gt; io:format("== ~p ==\n", [M]), F() end end).
&lt;0.90.0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Having a tracer process, we can create a trace session:</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; Session = trace:session_create(my_session, Tracer, []).
{#Ref&lt;0.179442114.3923902468.103849&gt;,{my_session,0}}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we turn on call tracing on the current process:</p>

<pre><code>3&gt; trace:process(Session, self(), true, [call]).
1
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that module <code>array</code> is loaded and trace all calls in it:</p>

<pre><code>4&gt; l(array).
{module,array}
5&gt; trace:function(Session, {array,'_','_'}, [], [local]).
89
</code></pre>

<p>Next create a new array:</p>

<pre><code>6&gt; array:new(10).
== {trace,&lt;0.88.0&gt;,call,{array,new,"\n"}} ==
{array,10,0,undefined,10}
== {trace,&lt;0.88.0&gt;,call,{array,new_0,[10,0,false]}} ==
== {trace,&lt;0.88.0&gt;,call,{array,new_1,["\n",0,false,undefined]}} ==
== {trace,&lt;0.88.0&gt;,call,{array,new_1,[[],10,true,undefined]}} ==
== {trace,&lt;0.88.0&gt;,call,{array,new,[10,true,undefined]}} ==
== {trace,&lt;0.88.0&gt;,call,{array,find_max,"\t\n"}} ==
</code></pre>

<p>Note that trace messages are randomly intermingled with the return value
of the call.</p>

<p>When we are done, we can destroy the session:</p>

<pre><code>7&gt; trace:session_destroy(Session).
</code></pre>

<p>If we don’t destroy the session, it will be automatically destroyed when
the last reference to it goes away.</p>

          Native coverage support <a href="#native-coverage-support">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/cover">Cover</a> tool for determining
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a> has long been
part of Erlang/OTP.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Cover collected its coverage metrics without the
help of any specialized functionality in the runtime system. To count how
many times each line in a module was executed, Cover
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(computer_programming)">instrumented</a>
abstract code for the module by inserting calls to
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets#update_counter/3"><code>ets:update_counter/3</code></a>
on each executable line.</p>

<p>That worked, but the cover-instrumented Erlang code would always run
slower. How much slower depended on the nature of the code being
tested.</p>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 27, runtime systems supporting the
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-first-look-at-the-jit/">JIT (just-in-time compiler)</a>
can now collect coverage metrics in the runtime system with minimal
performance overhead.</p>

<p>The Cover tool has been updated to automatically take advantage of
native coverage support if supported by the runtime system. When
running the test suites for most OTP applications, there is no
noticeable difference in execution time running with and without
Cover.</p>

<p>The native coverage support can also be used directly for performing
measurements that Cover cannot accomplish, such as collecting metrics
for code that is executed while the Erlang runtime system is starting.</p>

<p>Here is a quick example showing how we can collect coverage metrics
for <code>init</code>, which is the first module executed when starting up the
runtime system. First we need to instruct the runtime system to
instrument all functions in all modules with extra code to count the
number of times each function is called:</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/erl +JPcover function_counters
</code></pre>

<p>The runtime system starts normally. We can now read out the counters
for the <code>init</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>1&gt; lists:reverse(lists:keysort(2, code:get_coverage(function, init))).
[{{archive_extension,0},392},
 {{get_argument1,2},198},
 {{objfile_extension,0},101},
 {{boot_loop,2},64},
 {{request,1},55},
 {{to_strings,1},44},
 {{do_handle_msg,2},38},
 {{handle_msg,2},38},
 {{b2s,1},38},
 {{get_argument,2},33},
 {{get_argument,1},31},
 {{'-load_modules/2-lc$^0/1-0-',1},30},
 {{'-load_modules/2-lc$^1/1-2-',1},30},
 {{'-load_modules/2-lc$^2/1-3-',1},30},
 {{'-load_modules/2-lc$^3/1-4-',1},30},
 {{extract_var,2},30},
 {{'-prepare_loading_fun/0-fun-0-',3},29},
 {{eval_script,2},23},
 {{append,1},18},
 {{get_arguments,1},18},
 {{reverse,1},17},
 {{check,2},17},
 {{ensure_loaded,2},16},
 {{ensure_loaded,1},16},
 {{do_load_module,2},14},
 {{do_ensure_loaded,2},14},
 {{get_flag_args,...},12},
 {{...},...},
 {...}|...]
</code></pre>

<p>The returned list of counter values for each function is sorted in
descending order on the number of time each function was executed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/code#module-loading-of-code-from-archive-files">Archives</a>
is experimental functionality that has existed in Erlang/OTP for a
long time. Part of the support for archives is deprecated in Erlang/OTP 27.</p>

<p>The reason is that the performance of code loading from archives has
never been great. Even worse is that the very existence of the archive
functionality degrades the performance of code loading even when no
archives are used, and complicates or prevents optimizations aimed at
reducing startup time.</p>

<p>In Erlang/OTP 27, the following functionality is deprecated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using archives for packaging a single application or parts of a single application
into an archive file that is included in the code path. This functionality will
likely be removed in Erlang/OTP 28.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/code#lib_dir/2"><code>code:lib_dir/2</code></a>
function. This function was introduced to allow reading files
inside archives. In Erlang/OTP 28, the function itself will not be
removed, but it will most likely no longer support looking into
archives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All functionality to handle archives in module
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl_prim_loader"><code>erl_prim_loader</code></a>.
That same functionality is likely to be removed in Erlang/OTP 28.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>-code_path_choice</code> flag for <code>erl</code>. In Erlang/OTP 27, the default
has changed from <code>relaxed</code> to <code>strict</code>. This flag is likely to be removed
in Erlang/OTP 28.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In order to use archives in Erlang/OTP 27, it is necessary to use the flag
<code>-code_path_choice relaxed</code>.</p>

<p>An archive can still be used to hold all files needed by an
<a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/escript_cmd">Escript</a>.
However, to access files in the archive (for example, to read templates or other

<h2>SHIPBREAKING</h2><p><strong><em>Artist's Statement</em></strong></p><p>“The original idea for the shipbreaking started a long time ago. About four years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill I heard a radio program where they were talking about the danger of single-hulled ships. The insurance companies were refusing to cover them after 2004, which would force all these ships to be decommissioned. Only double-hulled ships would be allowed on the open sea to prevent that kind of catastrophe from happening again.</p><p>What went off in my mind was, wouldn’t it be interesting to see where these massive vessels will be taken apart. It would be a study of humanity and the skill it takes to dismantle these things. I looked upon the shipbreaking as the ultimate in recycling, in this case of the largest vessels ever made. It turned out that most of the dismantling was happening in India and Bangladesh so that's where I went.” — Edward Burtynsky</p>

<p>Burtynsky's <em>Shipbreaking</em>&nbsp;photographs, like all his works, appear to us as images of the end of time. The abandoned mines and quarries, the piles of discarded tires, the endless fields of oil derricks, and the huge monoliths of retired tankers show how our attempts at industrial "progress" often leave a residue of destruction. Nevertheless there is something uncannily beautiful and breathtaking in the very expansiveness of these images―it is as if the vastness of their perspective somehow opens onto the longer view of things. For Burtynsky, nature itself, over time, can reclaim even the most ambitious of human incursions into the land. As long as human needs and desires change, so too will the landscape.</p>

Like many others, I&nbsp;found myself spending&nbsp;over 12 hours a day in front of a computer or digital screen. My days&nbsp;were filled&nbsp;with&nbsp;supporting students, attending meetings, reading documentation, learning, and programming. By the end of the day, my eyes felt strained, and I was tired and distracted.</p><p>I realized that the digital tools we depend on for our day-to-day activities could be improved. They should be more beneficial to our health, less demanding of our attention, and better suited to our needs. I wanted to create a space free from distractions and eyestrain where I could focus on reading, writing, and thinking—a productive environment conducive to my health. This realization led me to reimagine personal computing and build calm, intentional technology.</p><h3>Shared Challenges</h3><p>As I shared my vision with others, I found that many people faced similar challenges: writers, authors, journalists, programmers, students, teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, makers, digital minimalists, people with visual impairments, those with health issues and many more.</p><p>We all struggled with the same problems—headaches, eyestrain, and distractions caused by our reliance on digital screens. This shared experience fueled my desire to create technology that respects our time, attention, and well-being.</p><h3>Open-Hardware and Open-Source</h3><p>As an open-hardware and open-source company, we strive to create an environment where experimentation, learning, and creativity can flourish. For those who wish to delve deeper, <a href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider">our README on GitHub</a> provides a comprehensive primer on e-ink technology. </p><p>We believe that open-source and open-hardware are crucial to envisioning and building a different reality—one where technology supports our well-being and fosters a healthier relationship with our digital lives.</p><p>We invite you to <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/modos-tech/modos-paper-monitor">sign up on Crowd Supply</a> to stay informed about the latest news and updates on our project.<br></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We present Chameleon, a family of early-fusion token-based mixed-modal models capable of understanding and generating images and text in any arbitrary sequence. We outline a stable training approach from inception, an alignment recipe, and an architectural parameterization tailored for the early-fusion, token-based, mixed-modal setting. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive range of tasks, including visual question answering, image captioning, text generation, image generation, and long-form mixed modal generation. Chameleon demonstrates broad and general capabilities, including state-of-the-art performance in image captioning tasks, outperforms Llama-2 in text-only tasks while being competitive with models such as Mixtral 8x7B and Gemini-Pro, and performs non-trivial image generation, all in a single model. It also matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including Gemini Pro and GPT-4V, according to human judgments on a new long-form mixed-modal generation evaluation, where either the prompt or outputs contain mixed sequences of both images and text. Chameleon marks a significant step forward in a unified modeling of full multimodal documents.

<section>
<p>As programmers, we interact with software tools daily.
Most of them can barely get the job done.
But once in a white, we discover a piece of software that transcends mere utility.
These tools capture our imagination, open new possibilities, and affect how we design our own systems.
I call such software <em>enlightenmentware</em>.</p><p>The most common source of enlightenment for programmers is the programming language they use at work or learn as a hobby.
I experienced many jolts of enlightenment from fiddling with programming languages, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Macro_Assembler"><span>masm</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> and <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a>.
I won’t focus on languages, however, since the effects of language learning on mind expansion is old news<label for="sn-norvig"></label><span>
  See, for example, Peter Norvig’s <q><a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</a></q>.
</span>.</p><p>In this article, I praise the software that contributed the most to my enlightenment.</p></section><section><h2 id="unix"><a href="#unix">UNIX</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  <span>unix</span> is user-friendly—it’s just choosy about who its friends are.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I started looking for my first real programming job around 2008, while studying at university in my hometown of Nizhny Novgorod.
Almost all the open positions required knowledge of mysterious things called <span>unix</span> and <em>sockets</em>.
My curriculum didn’t offer a course on <span>unix</span> or operating systems in general, so I decided to get a textbook and master the topic myself. </p><p><q><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22066650-unix">The <span>unix</span> Operating System</a></q> by Andrey Robachevsky et al., also known as the <em>turtle book</em> in Russia because of its cover, introduced me to the magical world of <span>unix</span>-like operating systems.
<span>unix</span> became something I could understand, explore, and programmatically interact with.
All pieces of the puzzle—the filesystem interface, the process model with environments and permissions, forking, sockets, and signals—fell into place and revealed a coherent, beautiful picture.</p><p>A search for a working <span>unix</span> installation led me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux">Mandriva Linux</a>.
It was like discovering a parallel universe where you don’t have to pirate software or spend forty minutes installing an <span>ide</span> to compile a <span>c</span> program.
Here, people developed software for fun and shared it freely.
I couldn’t fathom why anyone would use Windows<label for="sn-windows"></label><span>
  I became significantly more tolerant since my early university years.
  Windows (specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT">NT family</a>) is a great operating system.
  I even have it installed on my gaming <span>pc</span> so that I can buy games I never play.
</span>.</p><p>From that moment on, <span>unix</span> followed me through all stages of my life:
the toddler phase of keeping up with the cutting-edge <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> releases,
the rebellious teens of compiling custom kernels for my <a href="https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T61p">Thinkpad T61p</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Emerge">emerging</a> the <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/World_set_(Portage)"><code>@world</code></a> on <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>,
the maturity of returning to Ubuntu <span>lts</span> and delaying upgrades until the first dot one release,
and to the overwhelmed parent stage of becoming a happy macOS user.</p><p><span>unix</span> also became an essential building block in my profession.
Most of the software I wrote operates in a <span>unix</span> environment, and I still occasionally consult my copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/603263.Advanced_Programming_in_the_UNIX_Environment">Advanced Programming in the <span>unix</span> Environment</a>.</p></section><section><h2 id="git"><a href="#git">Git</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  It is easy to shoot your foot off with git, but also easy to revert to a previous foot and merge it with your current leg.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I encountered version control systems in early 2009; the company I worked for used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_ClearCase">Rational ClearCase</a> to manage their code.
The system versioned each file separately and relied on large configuration files—<em>config specs</em>—to construct a consistent snapshot of the source tree.
The tool was utterly confusing and intimidating, so I avoided dealing with it beyond the minimal requirements of my job.</p><p>About a year later, I joined a shop that used <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>.
This time, I invested in learning upfront and swallowed the entire <a href="https://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a> before making my first commit.
Subversion was easy to understand and use; I couldn’t imagine how to improve on it.
Still, I perceived it as a tool that you use at work.
There was enough friction in setting up a repository to hinder its use for small personal projects.
At the time, Google offered hosting on <a href="https://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>, but I didn’t feel comfortable sharing my experiments with the world back then.</p><p>And then I discovered <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p><p>Git was nothing like Subversion.
It had a steep learning curve and confused everyone to no end<label for="sn-git-random-man"></label><span>
  Way before we all got used to ChatGPT,
  <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog">Kim Ødegaard</a> created a <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">service</a> that generates random man pages mocking Git’s dense documentation style.
</span>.
Still, the confusion was qualitatively different from what I experienced with ClearCase.
ClearCase is confusing like a Russian novel: All the characters have strange names, the plot is complex, and it doesn’t end well.
Git is confusing like math: It slowly melts your brain and molds it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract">tesseract</a>, giving access to higher dimensions.</p><p>Git removed the friction from using version control; there was no excuse not to version anything of value anymore.
Merging branches with Git didn’t cause anxiety disorders.
The staging area—confusingly named <em>index</em>—became essential to my workflows.
But my favorite feature was the breathtaking beauty of Git’s design, the elegant mix of distributed systems, acyclic graphs, and content-addressed storage.</p><p>Learning about Git’s internals was so much fun that I became interested in the bits and bolts of other version control systems.
I travelled through time from <a href="https://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> to <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>, <a href="https://www.bitkeeper.org/">BitKeeper</a>, and the ultimate origin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System">SCCS</a>.
I also built a toy one-file version control system while learning Rust.</p><p>Will Git ever be replaced with something better?
Just as it was hard to imagine an improvement over Subversion before Git came along, it’s hard to imagine a significant improvement over Git now.
For me, Git’s primary disadvantage is its snapshot-oriented approach that makes merges hard to reason about.
Git, Mercurial, and most other tools make it challenging to separate original code from the decisions that the person merging files had to make<label for="sn-janestreet-patch-vs-diff"></label><span>
  Jane Street’s tech staff reports similar concerns.

  While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I edited my first programs in a friendly blue window of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal 7.0</a>.
The environment had little friction: no project or build configuration, no noticeable build time; you type your code and run it.
That was a perfect tool for learning.</p><p>My university used Pascal for introductory programming classes, so I also used Turbo Pascal for my assignments.
Later courses introduced C++ and Java, for which we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio#6.0_(1998)">Visual Studio 6.0</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBuilder">JBuilder</a>.
Although we learned to invoke compilers from the command line, <span>ide</span>s dominated my early code-editing experience.</p><p>At my first programming job, I worked on a remote Solaris workstation over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrix_Systems">Citrix</a> connection.
Almost everyone in our group used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEdit">NEdit</a> to edit the code.
One day, I noticed a person whose editor looked markedly different from everyone else’s; the background was dark, and the code glowed with bright colors.
To me, that was a sign of their superior technical knowledge.
I <em>needed</em> to learn how to tweak my editor.</p><p>The quest for customization led me to <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (the workstation had Vim 6 installed out of the box).
After all, if the goal is to stand out from the crowd, why stop at the color scheme?
I went through the Vim tutorial, and it clicked with me immediately.
It felt like playing a musical instrument: challenging but fun.
It turned a mundane job of fixing bugs into an exercise in skill.</p><p>I don’t remember exactly when and why I got interested in Emacs<label for="sn-wolfram-notes"></label><span>
  Daly journaling is one of the things I wish I started doing earlier.
  I’m nowhere near <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/#archiving-and-searching">Stephen Wolfram’s level</a>, but I enjoy going back and seeing what I was up to a few years ago.
</span>.
Most likely, it was a result of my obsession with Lisp after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> and looking for a Lisp to interact with.
I remember reading <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html">An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</a> around 2010 and having a great time.</p><p>I became interested in the editor internals.
Using <a href="https://www.finseth.com/craft/">The Craft of Text Editing</a> by Craig A. Finseth as a guide, I explored the source code of various editors to see how they worked: which the data structures they used to represent text buffers, how they interacted with extensions and implemented the undo mechanism.
I found Vim’s source code somewhat messy, inconsistent, and hard to understand.
Emacs’s source was spotless, well-organized, and well-documented.</p><p>A dive into Emacs internals also revealed the inherent beauty of its architecture.
Emacs is a Lisp machine that provides text editing and window management capabilities.
It is a powerful, convenient, and friendly development environment for building dynamic text-driven applications in Emacs Lisp.</p><p>Almost everything in Emacs is a Lisp object you can inspect, interact with, and access its documentation.
That makes Emacs’ documentation system unparalleled once you master it.
Emacs’ dynamism makes extending it much easier than any other editor.
The feedback loop is airtight: you can immediately try out your code in the context of the editor you use to write it.</p><p>Although I’m writing these words in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, I always have my Emacs open<label for="sn-vim"></label><span>
  I also have a <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> session with multiple <a href="https://neovim.io/">nvim</a> instances running.
  I use these when my pinky gets tired of holding down the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.
</span>.
Many things are easier in Emacs; I don’t think any software will ever completely replace it for me.
It’s also my editor of choice if I need to implement an extension.
Programming Emacs Lisp is a joy, especially compared to writing Vimscript.</p></section><section><h2 id="boost-graph"><a href="#boost-graph">Boost.Graph</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  I also must confess to a strong bias against the fashion for reusable code.
  To me, <q>re-editable code</q> is much, much better than an untouchable black box or toolkit.
</p></blockquote></div><p>The evening of 2013 New Year’s Eve didn’t go as planned.
I was on a cruise ship crossing the stormy Baltic Sea and couldn’t stay on my feet because of the seasickness.
Instead of consuming tasty treats with the rest of the passengers, I was lying in bed and reading a book I took for the trip: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1705806.The_Boost_Graph_Library">The Boost Graph Library</a> by Jeremy G. Siek et al.</p><p>Most algorithm libraries require you to commit to a specific data representation, making integrating them into an existing project prohibitively expensive.
That’s especially true for graph algorithms: The vertices and edges are usually implicitly defined and deeply embedded into other data structures, so it’s easier to re-implement the algorithm than to use a generic library.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.boost.io/libraries/graph/">Boost.Graph</a> library solves this problem elegantly using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov">Alex Stepanov</a>’s ideas on generic programming.
It uses a bag of tricks (type traits, property maps, visitors) to implement graph algorithms that can work with any graph representation you throw at them, given that you provide an adapter telling the library how to view your data structures as a graph.</p><p>Even though I never had a chance to use the library in practice<label for="sn-boost-graph-use"></label><span>
  Given that I share Donald Knuth’s attitude opening this section, I would probably not use the library even if I had a chance.
  I’d rather write one page of interesting code traversing a graph than two pages of boring adapters required to invoke the algorithm.
</span>, its design helped me deepen my understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library"><span>stl</span></a> design and generic programming in general.
It also helped me understand the motivation for advanced type-level programming features in other programming languages, such as <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type_families">type families</a> in Haskell.
Overall, Boost.Graph is one of the most enlightening pieces of software that I’ve never used.</p></section><section><h2 id="bazel"><a href="#bazel">Bazel</a></h2><div><blockquote><p>
  If make doesn’t do what you expect it to, it’s a good chance the makefile is wrong.
</p></blockquote></div><p>I wrote my first <code>Makefile</code> around 2009 while working on a research project in computational mathematics for my degree.
I already used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)"><code>make</code></a> at work, but I didn’t need to understand how it worked.
This time, I had to compile a <span>fortran</span> program mixing sources adhering to different language standards: from venerable <span>fortran</span> 77 to hip Fortran 2003.
To get a deeper understanding of the tool, I referred to <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-projects-with/0596006101/">Managing Projects with GNU Make</a> by Robert Mecklenburg.</p><p>Most books on technology excite me: I become enthusiastic about the subject and want to try it out in practice. 
The book on <code>make</code> had the opposite effect.
The complexity required to make builds correct and ergonomic made me earn for a better tool<label for="sn-modern-cpp-design"></label><span>
  One book that made me feel the same way was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/871669.Modern_C_Design">Modern C++ Design</a> by Andrei Alexandrescu.
  The book is deep and beautifully written, but the terrifyingly clever and ugly tricks in the second chapter made me question the choice of the programming language.
  Another one is <a href="https://nostarch.com/autotools2e">Autotools</a> by John Calcote.
</span>.</p><p>After my deep dive into <code>make</code>, I often fiddled with build systems at work:
I introduced <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> to my first C++ project to replace complex and scarily incorrect <code>Makefile</code> files and
replaced an inflexible <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>-based build system in a 500 <span>kloc</span> Java project with <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> scripts that everyone on the team could contribute to.
But all of the tools I tried, including <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>, <a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, <a href="https://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html">autotools</a> left me deeply unsatisfied.
They were clanky, awkward, and hard to extend and compose.</p><p>In 2016, I joined Google in Zurich.
I heard about Google’s internal build tool, <code>blaze</code>, and couldn’t wait to lay my hands on it.
Surprisingly, I didn’t need to fiddle with <code>blaze</code>, nor did I have to understand how it worked.
I could copy some build targets and edit the dependency list, and the build worked as expected.
<code>blaze</code> made correct and fast builds not just easy, but <em>boring</em> in the good sense.
Only a few years later, when I attempted to use <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>—the open-source version of <code>blaze</code>—for a toy personal project, did I have to understand the underlying model.</p><p>Bazel was the final piece of the puzzle, together with Haskell’s typeclasses, <a href="https://research.google/pubs/flumejava-easy-efficient-data-parallel-pipelines/">Flume pipelines</a> interface,  and the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> 1.0 execution model, that made me understand the ubiquitous plan-execute pattern<label for="sn-build-systems-a-la-carte"></label><span>
  The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf">Build Systems à la Carte</a> article by Andrey Mokhov, Neil Mitchell, and Simon Peyton Jones explains how various build system designs map to Haskell typeclasses.
  Thomas Leonard’s <a href="https://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2019/11/14/cicd-pipelines">CI/CD pipelines: Monad, Arrow or Dart?</a> blog post is also a great read on this topic.
</span>.
Bazel build file is a program that constructs a slice of the build artifact graph.
Bazel rules don’t <em>run</em> the build commands; they <em>declare</em> how to transform inputs into outputs, and the Bazel engine figures out the rest.</p><p>My relationship with the tool reached true intimacy when I helped <a href="https://mmapped.blog/posts/17-scaling-rust-builds-with-bazel">transition <span>dfinity</span>’s build system to Bazel</a>.
Despite all the challenges I faced on the way, Bazel is still my favorite build system.
It’s fast, correct, easy to use, and language-agnostic.</p><p>Paraphrasing <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/quotes.html">Bjarne Stroustup</a>, I think a smaller, simpler, cleaner build system is struggling to get out within Bazel.
I hope this core will someday reveal itself to the world and become the standard tool for building all software.</p></section><section><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>After presenting my cases, I find it tempting to look for a common theme.

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>This blog series explains how modern terminals and command-line tools work. The
primary goal here is to learn by <strong>experimenting</strong>. I’ll provide Linux tools to
debug every component mentioned in the discussion. Our focus is to discover
<strong>how</strong> things work. For the explanation of <strong>why</strong> things work in a certain
way, I encourage the reader to read excellent articles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/">The TTY demystified</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/2009/12/a-brief-introduction-to-termios/">A Brief Introduction to termios</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and to visit a computer history museum:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S81GyMKH7zw">Teletype ASR 33 Part 10: ASR 33 demo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFQ3sajIdaM">The IBM 1401 compiles and runs FORTRAN II</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that I talk solely about Linux (because that is what I use), but
many discussed concepts should apply to other Unix-like systems.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen the “learn by experimenting” approach because that’s how I’ve
learned about command-line tools. In my case, there was no single “click” moment
after which I’ve understood all the things. Instead, I’ve learned through a
never-ending process of building mental models, proving them to be wrong, and
then adjusting those models to reflect new knowledge.</p>

<p>Target audience are people who want to start working on command-line tools.</p>

<p>The series consists of 4 parts. The first two parts discuss how xterm work.
Parts 3 and 4 talk about different features of tty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 1: Xterm, user input;</li>
  <li>Part 2: Xterm, CLI tool output;</li>
  <li>Part 3: pty, stty;</li>
  <li>Part 4: pty, sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Let’s start the discussion with an <strong>inaccurate</strong> diagram that shows a general
use case for working with a command-line shell:</p>

<div><pre><code>           (1)   (2)   (3)
user &lt;---&gt; xterm &lt;---&gt; bash 

</code></pre></div>

<p>The user interacts with bash using a terminal emulator xterm. xterm is a GUI app
that receives “key pressed” events and writes corresponding characters into a
bidirectional filehandle (2). Bash reads those characters from (2) does
something and sends the output back to xterm, using the same filehandle (2).
Xterm reads, bash outputs from (2) and renders them on the screen. (2) is “just
a file” and this communication scheme looks pretty simple.</p>

<p>If the user asks bash to execute a command, let’s say <code>cat log.txt</code> then bash
spawns <code>cat</code> which uses the same filehandle to send its output to xterm:</p>

<div><pre><code>                       bash
           (1)   (2)     (4)
user &lt;---&gt; xterm &lt;---&gt;   cat

</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, pretty simple. In this unrealistic model (2) is “just a file” xterm and
cat exchange plain text.</p>

<p>In reality, things are slightly more complicated. Evolution extended the simple
scheme of “using a bidirectional filehandle to exchange plain text” to implement
additional features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>TUI interfaces. The terminal can draw characters at an arbitrary part of the
screen; command-line tools can ask capabilities of the terminal and can
handle window resize;</li>
  <li>job control. Shell organizes processes into logical groups which can be
paused/resumed or stopped altogether;</li>
  <li>access control for the filehandle (2). Bash has a feature to spawn background
processes. This might lead to a situation when two processes are writing
their output into the same filehandle (2) at the same time; there should be
some access control mechanism;</li>
  <li>“fixing” stupid tools which believe that the terminal is just a file with
plain text; so that those tools look and feel better.</li>
</ol>



<p>Requirement above and 50 years of history led us to this scheme:</p>

<div><pre><code>           (1)         (2)       (3)
user &lt;---&gt; xterm &lt;---&gt; tty &lt;---&gt; bash

</code></pre></div>

<p>The first thing to notice is a “middle man” <strong>tty</strong> between xterm and bash. We
will discuss tty in parts 3 and 4. For now, we will just say that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tty sits between xterm and bash and passes data from one to the other in both
directions;</li>
  <li>depending on its configuration, tty changes data it receives from one side
before passing to the other;</li>
  <li>there is command <code>stty raw -echo -isig</code> which configures tty to pass data “as
is without modification”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using <code>stty raw -echo -isig</code> to disable most effects of tty is our primary
strategy to explore how xterm works. Until the part 3, we will ignore the
existence of tty and will concentrate on exploring xterm’s behavior.</p>

<p>Let’s start by discussing a bi-directional link between a user and xterm.
Converting scancodes that come from a keyboard into GUI events happens in two
steps. First, Linux handles hardware events and turns them into keycodes that
can be read by userland (using device descriptors like
<code>/dev/input/by-id/usb-2.4G_2.4G_Wireless_Device-event-kbd</code>). Second, Windows
system (X or Wayland) reads Linux keycodes and converts them into its own
keycodes, and also assigns a keysym (i.e. a Unicode character). To check how it
works, one can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sudo showkey</code> to explore Linux keycodes <em>(visit <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-14.html">this page</a> for more info)</em>;</li>
  <li><code>xev</code> (or <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/wev"><code>wev</code></a> for Wayland users) to explore GUI events.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, when I press the <code>q</code> button on my keyboard, depending on my keyboard layout I see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>showkey: keycode 16</li>
  <li>xev: keycode 24 (keysym 0x71, q)</li>
  <li>xev: keycode 24 (keysym 0x6ca, Cyrillic_shorti)</li>
</ul>

<p>xterm receives keypress events and writes data into tty(2):</p>
<ul>
  <li>it encodes printable characters using configured encoding (most probably UTF-8);</li>
  <li>on receiving some key combinations, it executes actions such as copy-paste from clipboard;</li>
  <li>it encodes other key combinations and non-printable characters (such as arrow
keys) using ANSI escape sequences (see post #2 for more details about ANSI
sequences).</li>
</ul>

<p>So converting key presses into data written into tty(2) happens in 3 steps, two
involving kernel and one in xterm. Now let’s figure out what xterm sends into
tty after all those 3 steps. There are two strategies we can use to accomplish
this task:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>strace</code>: trace system calls <em>(we will trace <code>write</code> and <code>read</code> calls, but be aware that there are also
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio</a> API)</em>;</li>
  <li>run a command-line tool that will
    <ul>
      <li>disable tty’s input/output processing using <code>stty raw -echo -isig</code></li>
      <li>log its inputs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strace">strace</h3>

<p>Let’s start with <code>strace</code> because it’s quite a practical approach. In your daily
life, if you’ll get stuck with misbehaving command-line tools, you can attach to
a running process and observe what your terminal is writing into filehandles and
what your shell reads. You don’t need to restart running programs to figure out
what is going on.</p>

<p>First, here is a little helper to find out PID of a terminal by clicking it with a computer mouse (for users of XWindows system):</p>

<div><pre><code>xprop | grep '_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL)' | awk '{print $3}'
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then let’s observe what xterm writes and reads into/from filehandles (please
replace <code>-p 22853</code> with an appropriate PID):</p>

<div><pre><code>sudo strace -f -e 'trace=write,read' -e write=all -e read=all -p 22853 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -v EAGAIN
</code></pre></div>

<p>For testing, I’ve entered <code>qwe</code> sequence and strace gave me:</p>

<div><pre><code>write(4, "q", 1)                        = 1
 | 00000  71                                                q                |
read(4, "q", 4096)                      = 1
 | 00000  71                                                q                |
write(4, "w", 1)                        = 1
 | 00000  77                                                w                |
read(4, "w", 4096)                      = 1
 | 00000  77                                                w                |
write(4, "e", 1)                        = 1
 | 00000  65                                                e                |
read(4, "e", 4096)                      = 1
 | 00000  65
</code></pre></div>

<p>That makes sense. xterm sends (writes) <code>q</code>. tty+bash echoes back <code>q</code> to display
it so that the user can see what he/she entered. Then a sequence <code>we</code> follows
the same pattern. Now, I’ll try arrow keys: the left arrow and then the right
arrow:</p>

<div><pre><code>write(4, "\33[D", 3)                    = 3
 | 00000  1b 5b 44                                          .[D              |
read(4, "\10", 4096)                    = 1
 | 00000  08                                                .                |
write(4, "\33[C", 3)                    = 3
 | 00000  1b 5b 43                                          .[C              |

</code></pre></div>

<p>For left arrow key, xterm sends <code>\33[D</code> and receives back <code>\10</code>. <code>man ascii</code>
tells us that <code>33</code> Oct is the same <code>1b</code> Hex and it’s a <code>\ESC</code> (escape) ASCII
control character. <code>10</code> Oct is <code>08</code> Hex and its <code>BS</code> backspace control character
(commonly abbreviated as <code>\b</code> thanks to C programming language). We will discuss
ANSI escape sequences and ASCII control characters soon, for now, we can confirm
that using strace helps to observe what xterm is actually doing: it sends
<code>qwe\ESC[D\ESC[C</code> and receives <code>qwe\b\ESC[C</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s use strace to observe what bash is doing.</p>



<p>Entering the sequence <code>qwe&lt;left&gt;&lt;right&gt;</code> gives me symmetrical result from the
bash side: It receives <code>qwe\ESC[D\ESC[C</code> and sends <code>qwe\b\ESC[C</code> back.</p>

<div><pre><code>read(0, "\33", 1)                       = 1
 | 00000  1b                                                .                |
read(0, "[", 1)                         = 1
 | 00000  5b                                                [                |
read(0, "D", 1)                         = 1
 | 00000  44                                                D                |
write(2, "\10", 1)                      = 1
 | 00000  08
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve promised to ignore tty for a while, but just to show why it might be useful
to strace both a terminal and bash, let’s experiment. Let’s execute <code>cat -</code>
command and observe in real-time what xterm is sending to tty and what <code>cat</code>
receives.</p>

<p>First, let’s get the PID of a shell and then execute <code>cat</code></p>

<div><pre><code>echo $$

10519
sh-4.4$ cat -
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then in the other terminal window, let’s find out the PID of <code>cat</code> using “parent
PID” option of ps:</p>

<div><pre><code>ps --ppid 10519

  PID TTY          TIME CMD
10560 pts/5    00:00:00 cat
</code></pre></div>

<p>In my system, experiment shows that xterm writes characters one by one
immediately after I’ve pressed a keyboard button. Yet <code>cat</code> receives the entire
line only after I’ve pressed Enter. I can use the Backspace key to erase
previously entered characters, which is relatively complicated logic. This logic
is part of what tty is capable of.</p>

<div><pre><code>read(0, "qwe\33[D\33[C\n", 131072)      = 10
 | 00000  71 77 65 1b 5b 44 1b 5b  43 0a                    qwe.[D.[C.       |
</code></pre></div>

<p>We will discuss tty in the 2nd part. For now, let’s just enjoy the success of
our debugging approach: we’ve just observed what <em>exactly</em> xterm and bash send
to each other and how tty (which sits in the middle) can alter data before
sending it to a consumer. The big limitation of such an approach is that reading
sequences like <code>\33[D\33[C\n</code> require a certain patience and might be quite hard
if applications output a lot of data ¯_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<h3 id="printing-non-printable">Printing non-printable</h3>

<p>While playing with strace we’ve encountered sequences like this <code>\33[D\33[C</code>
which I’ve later written like this: <code>\ESC[D\ESC[C</code>. In my daily life, I
sometimes encounter different notations, for example <code>\u001b[D\u001b[C</code>,
<code>\x1b[D\x1b[C</code>, or something else. Different software uses different conventions
for visualizing non-printable characters. Also, many programming languages have
a way to embed non-printable characters into string literals using a sequence of
printable characters. But again, conventions for representing non-printable
characters using printable ones differ between programming languages.</p>

<p>Let’s discover how different software visualizes the ESC (escape) ASCII character:</p>



<ul>
  <li>vi, emacs: <code>^[</code></li>
  <li>less: <code>ESC</code></li>
  <li>code, gedit : on my systems render some nonsense</li>
  <li>hexdump: <code>1b</code> (hexdump supports many output formats)</li>
  <li>od -a : <code>esc</code> (od supports many output formats)</li>
  <li>strace: <code>\33</code> and <code>1b</code></li>
  <li>python: <code>\x1b</code>
    <div><pre><code>open("/tmp/data.txt", "r").read()
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>Haskell: <code>\ESC</code>
    <div><pre><code>import qualified Data.ByteString as BS
BS.readFile "/tmp/data.txt" &gt;&gt;= print
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>nodejs: <code>\u001b</code>
    <div><pre><code>const fs = require('fs')
console.dir( fs.readFileSync('/tmp/data.txt', 'utf8') )
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To make things more confusing, some popular programming languages support syntax
for embedding non-printable characters into string literals, but don’t provide
easily accessible function to convert a string into the same notation. For
example, using the C programming language, I can easily make a string containing
ESC character:</p>



<p>But the easiest way I know to visualize it using printable characters is to write code like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int main() {
    FILE* f = fopen("/tmp/data.txt", "r");
    int c = fgetc(f);
    while (!feof(f)) {
        if (isprint(c))
            printf("%c", c);
        else
            printf("\\x%x", c);
        c = fgetc(f);
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The moral here is that different tools visualize non-printable characters
differently. To make things less confusing it’s helpful to train your eye to
recognize magic strings <code>^[</code>, <code>\ESC</code>, <code>ESC</code>, <code>esc</code>, <code>1b</code>, <code>\x1b</code>, <code>0x1b</code>,
<code>\u001b</code>, <code>33</code>, <code>27</code>. Also, it’s helpful to choose tools you can understand even
under stress.</p>

<h3 id="stty-raw--echo--isig">stty raw -echo -isig</h3>

<p>We’ve traced xterm using <code>strace</code> to check what it sends to bash. We can
accomplish a similar task without using a tracing tool. The most fool-proof way
to do so is to disable the effects of tty and to dump binary data which comes
from tty into a file. Then we can explore the content of a file using our
favorite tool of choice:</p>

<div><pre><code>stty raw -echo -isig; dd bs=1 of=/tmp/data.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>I prefer to use vi or od:</p>

<div><pre><code>vi /tmp/data.txt
od -ac /tmp/data.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>It might be cool to visualize the same data in real-time. One can use this bash
one-liner:</p>

<div><pre><code>stty sane -isig -echo -icanon; while true; do od -N 1 -ax -; done
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or convert <code>man ascii</code> into a <a href="https://kevroletin.github.io/assets/how-terminal-works/display_ascii.c">small c
program</a>. It executes <code>stty raw
-echo</code> on startup, so that tty doesn’t change terminal output and hence the tool
shows what terminal sends into tty.</p>

<p>Pressing a sequence of <code>a</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>Ctrl+d</code>, <code>Ctrl+l</code> gives:</p>

<div><pre><code>a
1
EOT (end of transmission)
FF  '\f' (form feed)
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>Alt+d</code> gives 2 characters:</p>



<p><code>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+d</code> gives:</p>

<div><pre><code>ESC (escape)
EOT (end of transmission)
</code></pre></div>

<p>which is the same as <code>Ctrl+Alt+d</code>, Shift is just ignored.</p>

<p>That behavior of xterm is <strong>not</strong> set in stone and it is configurable in a
terminal-dependent way. Depending on its configuration, xterm might send
different things in response to <code>Ctrl+Alt+Shift</code> combination. Here is the
discussion about xterm <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/modified-keys.html">modified
keys</a>.</p>

<h3 id="utf-8">UTF-8</h3>

<p>Utf8 has a few nice features which I didn’t appreciate enough until recently:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Utf8 is a self-synchronizing code. If you take any Utf8-encoded string and
randomly chop off the beginning so that you end up in the middle of
multi-byte character, then:
    <ul>
      <li>you’ll be able to detect an error: an attempt to decode an invalid character;</li>
      <li>you’ll be able to recover from the error by discarding bytes of a broken
character and figure out the beginning of the next valid character.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ASCII characters (including control character) are valid one-byte Utf8 encoded characters.</li>
</ol>

<p>Combined (1) and (2) give us a nice property that control characters will never
appear as part of multi-byte characters. I.e. python code below is correct for
any string comprising multi-byte Utf8 characters:</p>



<p>Let’s understand why this is the case. <code>编程很有趣</code> is encoded using 15 bytes;
below I’ve represented bytes using decimal numbers:</p>

<div><pre><code>编            程             很            有            趣
231 188 150 | 231 168 139 | 229 190 136 | 230 156 137 | 232 182 163
</code></pre></div>

<p>All these numbers are greater than 127 Dec. But all ASCII characters (including
control characters) are lesser or equal to 127 Dec. So it’s safe to search for
single-byte ASCII characters in Utf8 strings without decoding them because all
bytes of every valid multi-byte character is guaranteed to be greater than 127
Dec.</p>

<p>Error recovery is possible, and it works surprisingly simple. In binary
notation, all ASCII characters start with leading <code>0</code>, all bytes of multi-byte
characters start with <code>1</code>. In addition, for multi-byte characters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>only the first byte of a character can start with <code>11</code>;</li>
  <li>all continuation bytes (bytes 2, 3, 4) start with <code>10</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can easily observe these properties in action:</p>

<div><pre><code>编
11100111
10111100
10010110
程
11100111
10101000
10001011
很
11100101
10111110
10001000
有
11100110
10011100
10001001
趣
11101000
10110110
10100011
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each byte starts with <code>1</code> indicating that it’s a part of a multi-byte character.
Also, each byte contains an indication if it’s the first byte or a continuation
byte.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using strace and by disabling tty features, we’ve explored how keyboard input
from users reaches command-line tools. We also saw that xterm might send
non-printable characters and different tools visualize non-printable characters
differently. Also, we’ve improved our mental resilience by getting accustomed to
different notations and by trying different tools for visualizing control
characters. Finally, we said a few words about Utf8 encoding, which is the most
widely used Unicode encoding nowadays.</p>

<p>In this blog, post we’ve discussed how xterm handles user input. Next post will
discuss how xterm visualizes the output of CLI tools.</p>

<p>Stay tuned :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The idea of using <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/postgres-for-everything/"><u>PostgreSQL for Everything</u></a> isn't <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/?ref=timescale.com"><u>new</u></a>, but it's <a href="https://leaddev.com/tech/postgresql-database-quietly-ate-world?ref=timescale.com"><u>steadily</u></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/1cfpyv7/what_does_postgresql_for_everything_mean_to_you/?ref=timescale.com"><u>gaining</u></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEWXmdjzIpQ&amp;ref=timescale.com"><u>attention</u></a>, especially as Postgres keeps <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/?ref=timescale.com#section-most-popular-technologies-databases"><u>increasing in popularity</u></a>. As someone who’s spent most of their career deploying all sorts of databases, here’s what it means to me and how you can apply it to get some simplicity back into your world.</p><h2 id="how-technical-sprawl-creeps-in">How Technical Sprawl Creeps In</h2><p>Imagine you're starting on a new product or feature. Early on, your team lists out technical problems you need to tackle. Some solutions you'll develop in-house (your secret sauce), and others you'll address with existing technologies, probably including at least one database.</p><p>Unless you're in the business of building databases, it’s usually unwise to develop your own; it's complex, risky, and requires a very specialized skill set. So, you might end up adopting various existing databases: Postgres for transactional data, Elastic for full-text search, Influx for time series, Pinecone for vector operations, and maybe ClickHouse for analytics. Suddenly, your tech stack is sprawling.</p>

<h2 id="why-stack-sprawl-is-a-problem">Why Stack Sprawl Is a Problem</h2><p>Each new database you add brings its own set of challenges: different languages to learn, consistency models to understand, and operational nuances that can’t be ignored. Not only does this add complexity, but it also introduces what I call “dotted line” complexity, the additional overhead that comes from each pair of systems which data flows between. The more databases and the more dotted lines you have, the harder it is to reason about the state of your system as a whole.</p><p>You’ve got more databases, and because of that, you’ve got more problems.</p><figure><img src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/Postgres-for-Everything_Biggie.gif" alt="A Biggie gif: mo' databases, mo' problems" loading="lazy" width="512" height="512"></figure><h2 id="the-case-for-collapsing-your-stack">The Case for Collapsing Your Stack</h2><p>So what’s the alternative? In my mind, it’s collapsing your stack. If you solve more problems with one database, you’re removing multiple complex pieces of software and the dotted line complexity between them. It’s much easier to keep a mental model of your data flow in your head, as well as reason about the consistency of data at different times. You get time back, which would have been spent on operating these new databases, and you can spend that time building features.</p><figure><img src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png" alt="Several problems leading to a single Postgres solution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="701" srcset="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png 600w, https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png 1000w, https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/Collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-eveything-3.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>PostgreSQL excels at stack collapsing because it’s simultaneously general-purpose and specialized. As well as being an amazing relational database, it supports a wide range of extra use cases through its advanced extension framework. PostgreSQL can easily handle workloads like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-intro.html?ref=timescale.com"><u>full-text search</u></a>, <a href="https://www.timescale.com/?ref=timescale.com"><u>time-series data,</u></a> <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?ref=timescale.com"><u>vectors for AI</u></a>, and analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>PostgreSQL isn’t just versatile, it's also robust and mature. People have been running PostgreSQL in production for over 20 years, and with adoption speeding up, PostgreSQL shows no sign of slowing down. Edge cases are well known, deployment patterns, recovery strategies, and high availability are well defined, and there are many, many companies and champions who can help you along the way.</p><p>Because of this, I encourage you to use PostgreSQL to solve as many problems as you can, collapsing your stack, reducing your complexity, and giving you time back to focus on building.</p><p>There’s a well-known argument that you should pick the "best tool for the job," which sometimes gets turned on its head as, “If you’ve only got a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” I don’t see the principle of "PostgreSQL for Everything" contradicting these, as long as you make sure you look at the big picture.</p><p>How do you define "The Best Database for the Job"? Is it the fastest? The easiest to use? The most fault-tolerant? Or is it the one that integrates most seamlessly into your existing infrastructure and you know how to use—perhaps one that’s already in place? The best choice usually falls somewhere in between these criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/05/collapse-your-stack-postgres-for-everything-4.png" alt="The phrase: &quot;Let's just attach x to y and send the data to z.&quot; by someone who has no experience supporting x, y, or z.

If good old PostgreSQL does what you need now—with battle-tested effectiveness—and can scale further (perhaps up to 10x your current needs), then I think you should start with the known quantity. Only consider adding other databases when PostgreSQL lacks critical features, weighing the benefits against the added complexity of managing multiple systems. Or, to put it in a slightly different way, <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology?ref=timescale.com"><u>Choose Boring Technology</u></a> (sorry Postgres, I promise I still think you’re exciting).</p><p>Let’s consider two possible scenarios:</p><ol><li><strong>PostgreSQL for Everything works</strong>: After years, your workload outgrows the original system capabilities. PostgreSQL struggles in some areas, but this is a “good problem”—a sign of success and a cue to evolve your architecture.</li><li><strong>Overengineered with multiple databases</strong>: You're set up to handle immense scale, but the system is fragile, full of edge cases, and difficult to maintain. This isn't just challenging; it's a threat to your operation's stability.</li></ol><p>Given these scenarios, I’d argue that the theoretical future challenges of a PostgreSQL-centric system are preferable to today’s complexities of opting into a multi-database architecture too early.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a-final-word">A Final Word</h2><p>"PostgreSQL for Everything" isn't about never using other databases. Honestly, it’s not even about using PostgreSQL for everything. It's a maxim against overengineering your solutions prematurely and an advocate for the benefits of simplicity. Just remember, there are a lot of companies and applications in the world, and with the help of companies like Timescale, PostgreSQL will scale to meet most of their demands.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to expand your PostgreSQL database, try Timescale. <a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup?ref=timescale.com" rel="noreferrer">Create a free account today</a> and start simplifying your data stack.</p>

That’s more than 3 in 5.”</strong></p></blockquote><p id="a309"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/resources/infographics/future.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Looking Ahead: Improving Our Vision for the Future” CDC</em></a></p><p id="a5f1">To illustrate, consider how the Airbnb homepage might appear to someone who has experienced a significant loss of visual acuity. As shown below, the text becomes extremely impossible to read comfortably.</p></div><div><h2 id="da8c">Browser Zoom</h2><p id="0e15">To better understand the accessibility challenge, let us explore how browser zoom functionality works. You may already be familiar with this feature, using keyboard shortcuts like Command / Ctrl + or Command / Ctrl — to scale all content within a window. When you increase the zoom level beyond 100%, the viewport’s height and width proportionally decrease, while the content is blown up to fit the larger window.</p><p id="fb4a">As part of our accessibility testing strategy, we were using browser zoom to test the usability of our pages both on desktop and mobile sizes. Desktop testing showed that our pages did relatively well at the 200% zoom level with our responsive web approach across the site. We saw fewer issues in the overall user experience when compared to mobile web.</p><p id="40ad">This works well on desktop, where we serve a smaller breakpoint (e.g., wide to compact) and the viewport is relatively spacious. However, the limitations of browser zoom become more pronounced on mobile web, where the viewport is smaller. If we were to scale the content in a mobile viewport, it would have to fit into a viewport that is half the width and half the height of the original. This can result in significant accessibility issues, as the text and UI elements become extremely difficult to read and interact with. As shown in the image on the right, the ability to view even a single listing within a screen’s worth of space is not possible without scrolling, leading to a frustrating experience.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Airbnb’s homepage shown at browser zoom 100% on the left, and the same screen shown at 200% showing the search and categories are cut off entirely and not able to even see the first listing.</em></figcaption></figure><h2 id="acb6">Font Scaling</h2><p id="e8ad">Font scaling is the term we’ll use to describe the ability to adjust text size independently of overall page zoom. Unlike browser zoom, which scales all content proportionally, Font Scaling applies only to the text elements on the page. This allows users to customize the font size to their preferred reading size without affecting much of layout or responsiveness of the rest of the content.</p><p id="3b00">Font Scaling, is also the term we will use for scaling the font based on a user’s preferred size. Unlike zoom, this setting will be applied to all sites. Below is an example of how the font scaling applies to just the text on the screen, showing that the only scale of the text increases, instead of all the content.</p><figure></figure><p id="69aa">Video Description:<em> Airbnb text is scaled by setting the font size on arc browser, showing the scaling from 16px to 32xp.</em></p><p id="fc49">This concept of independent font scaling is similar to the Dynamic Type feature on iOS, as we discussed in our blog post <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/tagged/dynamic-type" rel="noopener">“Supporting Dynamic Type at Airbnb”</a>. Dynamic Type allows users to set a preferred system-wide text size, which then automatically adjusts the font size across all compatible apps.</p><p id="5e25">Considering our existing strategies for accessibility on iOS, incorporating font scaling (vs zoom scaling) into our web accessibility approach was a natural next step to help add parity in approaches across our platforms.</p><h2 id="16c7">Understanding px, em vs rem</h2><p id="553f">Now that we understand why font scaling is so powerful for mobile web, we should focus on why we might choose one CSS length unit over another for supporting font scaling. In this blog post we are only going to focus on px, em and rem but there are other units as well. CSS length units are connected to font scaling because they determine how text and other elements are sized on a web page. Some length units are fixed, meaning they don’t change based on the user’s font size settings, while others are relative, meaning they scale proportionally with the font size.</p><p id="8b19">Let’s take a deep look at 3 CSS length units and how they relate to font scaling:</p><ul><li id="d527">px units are the most commonly used on the web, theoretically they should represent one pixel on the screen. They are a fixed unit meaning the rendered value does not change.</li><li id="23e9">em units however are a relative unit that are based on the parent element’s font size. The name ‘em’ comes from the width of the capital letter ‘M’ in a given typeface, which was traditionally used as the reference point for font sizes. 1 em unit is equal to the height of the current font size, roughly 16px at the default value. em units scale proportionally, so they can be affected by their parent’s font sizes</li><li id="5320">rem units, short for “root em”, are similar to em units in that they are proportional to font size, but they only use the root element (the html element) to calculate their font size. This means that rem units offer font scaling, but are not affected by their parent’s font size.</li></ul><p id="dedd">The choice between em and rem units often comes down to the level of control and predictability required for font scaling. While em units can be used, they can lead to cascading font size changes that may be difficult to manage, especially in complex layouts. In contrast, rem units provide a more consistent and predictable approach to font scaling, as they are always relative to the root element’s font size.</p><p id="84a6">This is illustrated in the CodePen example, where the different font scaling behaviors of px, em, and rem units are demonstrated. In situations where font scaling is a critical requirement, such as the Airbnb example mentioned, the use of rem units can be a more reliable choice to ensure a consistent and maintainable font scaling solution.</p><figure></figure><p id="21aa">Relative units like rem can be used anywhere a fixed unit like px can be used. However, indiscriminate use of rem units across all properties can lead to unwanted scaling behavior and increased complexity.</p><p id="9e4c">In the case of Airbnb, the team decided to prioritize the use of rem units specifically for font scaling, rather than scaling all elements proportionally. This targeted approach provided the key benefit of consistent text scaling, without the potential downsides of scaling every aspect of the layout.</p><p id="4981">The rationale behind this decision was twofold:</p><ol><li id="54e3">Scaling <em>everything</em> using rem units would have been similar to Browser Zoom and potentially introduced unintended layout issues,</li><li id="8316">The primary focus was on providing a mobile-friendly font scaling solution. By targeting font sizes with rem units, the team could ensure that the most important content — the text — scaled appropriately.</li></ol><h2 id="ff20">Enabling a Seamless Transition for Designers and Developers</h2><p id="2724">Moving from pixel-based values to rem units as a company-wide change in CSS practice can be a significant challenge, especially when working across multiple teams. The time and effort required to educate designers and frontend developers on the new approach, and to have them convert their existing pixel-based values to rem units, can be a significant barrier to adoption. To address this, the Airbnb team decided to focus on automating the unit conversion process as much as possible, enabling a more seamless transition to the new rem-based system.</p><h2 id="18c6">Reducing Friction in Design Iterations</h2><p id="d9b0">Instead of requiring designers to have to think of new units or introduce some conversion for web only, we decided to continue to author our CSS in px units. This reduced the amount of training required for teams to start using rem units out the gate.</p><p id="f0dd">One area we did focus on with our design teams was starting to test their designs using font scaling by leveraging the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/892114953056389734/text-resizer-accessibility-checker" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Text Resizer — Accessibility Checker</a> to help simulate what a design might look like at 2X the font size. This tool helped us spot problems earlier into the design process.</p><h2 id="f7eb">Addressing the Complexity of Two CSS-in-JS Systems</h2><p id="f837">Airbnb is in the process of transitioning from <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/react-with-styles" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">React-with-Styles</a> to a newer approach using <a href="https://linaria.dev/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linaria</a>. While the adoption of Linaria was progressing quickly, we recognized the need to support both styling systems for a consistent experience. Managing the conversion across these two different CSS-in-JS systems posed an additional challenge.</p><h2 id="754f">Linaria</h2><p id="bcb1">By leveraging Linaria’s support for CSS custom properties, the team was able to create new typography theme values that automatically converted the existing pixel-based values to their rem equivalents. This approach allowed the team to introduce the new rem-based theme values in a centralized manner, making them available to child elements. This gave the team the ability to override the rem values on a per-page basis, providing the necessary flexibility during the transition process.</p><pre><span id="658e">import { typography } from './site-theme';<p>// Loops through the CSS Vars we use for typography and converts them<br>// from px to rem units.<br>const theme: css`<br> ${getCssVariables({ typography: replacePxWithREMs(typography) })}<br> // Changes from:<br> // - body-font-size: 16px;<br> // To<br>// - body-font-size: 1rem; <br>`;<br>// Use the class name generated from linaria to override the theme <br>// variables for the children of this component.<br>const RemThemeLocalProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) =&gt; {<br> const cx = useCx();<br> return &lt;div className={linariaClassNames.theme)}&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;;<br>};ty</p></span></pre><p id="4868">Although this approach helped us convert most of the font scaling properties, there were many places in our code that we used pxbased values outside the theme. Linaria’s support for post-CSS plugins made solving these areas relatively easy. We leveraged <a href="https://github.com/cuth/postcss-pxtorem#readme" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">postcss-pxtorem</a> to help target those values more easily. We started by using an allow list, so that we could carefully apply this change to a smaller set of early adopting pages.</p><p id="6fd1">It was important that we provided an escape hatch when there was some reason for front-end engineers needing to use px units. Luckily we were able to provide this by using a different casing for the px value like shown below.</p><pre><span id="b9c0">/* `px` is converted to `rem` */<br>.convert {<br>  font-size: 16px; /* converted to 1rem */<br>}<br>/* `Px` or `PX` is ignored by `postcss-pxtorem` <br>   but still accepted by browsers */<br>.ignore {<br>  font-size: 200Px;<br>  font-size: clamp(16Px, 2rem, 32Px);<br>}</span></pre><h2 id="1e0d">React with Styles</h2><p id="feb2">A good amount of our frontend code still uses react-with-styles, so we had to find another way to support these cases with an easy conversion. Through this we created a simple Higher-Order component that made the conversion pretty straightforward. First we created a wrapper for the withStyles function like below, and gave the ability to avoid conversion as well.</p><pre><span id="9ba1">export const withRemStyles = (<br>  styleFn?: Nullable&lt;(theme: Theme) =&gt; Styles&gt;,<br>  options?: WithStylesOptions &amp; { disableConvertToRemUnits?: boolean },<br>) =&gt; {<br>  const disableConvertToRemUnits = getDisableConvertToRemUnits(options);<br>   // If conversion is disabled, just return the original withStyles function<br>   if (disableConvertToRemUnits) {<br>     return _withStyles(styleFn, options);<br>    }<br>   // Otherwise, wrap the original style function with a new function <br>   // that converts px to rem<br>   return _withStyles((theme: Theme) =&gt; {<br>     if (styleFn) {<br>     const styles = styleFn(theme);<br>     const remStyles = convertToRem(styles);<br>     return remStyles;<br>   }<br>   return {};<br> }, options);<br>};</span></pre><p id="98f3">Then the convertToRem will look through the keys and values and map a converted value for any of the font sizing attributes. This allowed us to automate the conversion process in a more straightforward way.</p><h2 id="6519">Improvements for Testing Components</h2><p id="7f48">With these two challenges out of the way, we can start testing our components to verify if there are any major issues we might need to resolve before rolling out. In our component documentation and tooling, we built an internal plugin to allow for easier testing by setting the font-size on the html element directly to test with font scaling.</p><p id="965a">Screenshot testing has helped our teams catch visual regressions. Adding support to allow for setting additional screenshots at different root font sizes has helped our product teams review what the component looks like at different font scales. To do this, we allow for adding additional font sizes to be set when capturing the screenshots so you don’t have to create new component variations just for font scaling.</p><h2 id="0d96">Font Scaling on Mobile Safari</h2><p id="9b30">Supporting font scaling for Mobile Safari was more difficult. Unlike other browsers, there is not a font size preference available in Mobile Safari. However, they have released support for their own font: -apple-system-body but there are some important considerations.</p><p id="6596">Since macOS High Sierra (10.13), desktop Safari also supports the font preference, but there is not an easy “font size” configuration available in MacOS. Because there can be unexpected behavior on desktop Safari, so we used a @supports statement to prevent this. The code below will only target Mobile Safari.</p><pre><span id="a035">// Apple's Dynamic Type requires this font family to be used<br>// Only target iOS/iPadOS<br>@supports (font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-touch-callout: default) {<br>  :root {<br>    font: -apple-system-body;<br>  }<br>}</span></pre><p id="3a02">Another consideration is that the “100%” default font size selected does not equal the standard font size of 16px, but rather 17px. This is a very subtle difference, but it is critical for the design quality bar we aim to achieve at Airbnb. So to resolve this issue, we ended up using an inline head script to normalize the value, by placing it early into the page execution we avoided seeing a change in font size.</p><pre><span id="6531">(() =&gt; {<br>  // don't do anything if the browser doesn't match the supports statement<br>  if (!CSS.supports('(font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-touch-callout: default)')) return;<br>  // Must create an element since the root element styles are not yet parsed.<br>  const div = document.createElement('div');<br>  div.setAttribute('style', 'font: -apple-system-body');<br>  // Body is not available yet so this has to be added to the root element<br>  documentElement.appendChild(div);<br>  const style = getComputedStyle(div);<br>  if (style.fontSize === '17px') {<br>    documentElement.style.setProperty('font-size', '16px');<br>  }<br>  documentElement.removeChild(div);<br>})();</span></pre><p id="e4b7">Then when the page loads we use a resize observer to detect if the value changes again to unset or set the font-size property on the html element. This helps us still support scalable fonts, but not have a significant impact on the default font size (100%).</p><h2 id="8cee">Impact</h2><p id="d1f5">Supporting scalable fonts is an investment that should make a dramatic difference for our Hosts and guests with low vision and anyone who benefits from larger font sizes and control over their browsing experience. Below are two examples of the home page showing how the default font size (16px) appears to someone who has blurry vision and what it looks like by doubling the font size (32px). The second image is far more legible and usable.</p></div><div><p id="43f5">Choosing font scaling as the product accessibility strategy brought about a range of significant benefits that notably enhanced our platform’s overall user experience. Making that change using automation to convert to rem units made this transition easier. When looking at our overall issues count after these changes were site wide, more than 80% of our existing Resize Text issues were resolved. Moreover, we are seeing fewer new issues since then.</p><p id="1262">To conclude, our journey to enhance Resize Text on the web has been filled with valuable, practical lessons. From how we strategically apply rem units, to the role of tooling and automation, each lesson has been a vital step forward in elevating our user experience on Airbnb. We hope that by sharing our journey, we can help others navigate this transition more seamlessly. Our work is ongoing, and we are committed to continuously advancing Airbnb’s accessibility.

<p>We introduced an all-new system architecture to bring the power of the CPU, GPU, and now a new high performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU) together. Connected to and enhanced by the large language models (LLMs) running in our Azure Cloud in concert with small language models (SLMs), Copilot+ PCs can now achieve a level of performance never seen before. They are up to 20x more powerful<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and up to 100x as efficient<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> for running AI workloads and deliver industry-leading AI acceleration. They outperform Apple’s MacBook Air 15” by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, all while delivering all-day battery life.&nbsp; With incredible efficiency, Copilot+ PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> That is up to 20% more battery in local video playback than the MacBook Air 15”.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Windows now has the best implementation of apps on the fastest chip, starting with Qualcomm. We now offer more native Arm64 experiences than ever before, including our fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive and OneNote. Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, DaVinci Resolve and many more now run​ natively on Arm to give you great performance with additional apps, like Slack, releasing later this year. In fact, 87% of the total app minutes people spend in apps today have native Arm versions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[6]</a> With a powerful new emulator, Prism, your apps run great, whether native or emulated.</p>
<p>Every Copilot+ PC comes secured out of the box. The Microsoft Pluton Security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs and we have introduced a number of new features, updates and defaults to Windows 11 that make it easy for users to stay secure. And, we’ve built in personalized privacy controls to help you protect what’s important to you. You can read more about how we are making Windows more secure <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=134243">here</a>.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we encounter daily – finding something we know we have seen before on our PC. Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored in, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails trying to find it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory. Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do – based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences. This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[7]</a></p>
<p>You can scroll across time to find the content you need in your timeline across any application, website, document, or more. Interact intuitively using snapshots with screenray to help you take the next step using suggested actions based on object recognition. And get back to where you were, whether to a specific email in Outlook or the right chat in Teams.</p>
<p>Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust and delete ranges of time in Settings, or pause at any point right from the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar. You can also filter apps and websites from ever being saved. You are always in control with privacy you can trust.</p>

<p><strong>Cocreate with AI-powered image creation and editing, built into Windows</strong></p>
<p>Since the launch of Image Creator, almost 10 billion images have been generated, helping more people bring their ideas to life easily by using natural language to describe what they want to create. Yet, today’s cloud offerings may limit the number of images you can create, keep you waiting while the artwork processes or even present privacy concerns. By using the Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and powerful local small language models, we are bringing innovative new experiences to your favorite creative applications like Paint and Photos.</p>
<p>Combine your ink strokes with text prompts to generate new images in nearly real time with Cocreator. As you iterate, so does the artwork, helping you more easily refine, edit and evolve your ideas. Powerful diffusion-based algorithms optimize for the highest quality output over minimum steps to make it feel like you are creating alongside AI.

I agree to temporarily take the post down, </span><a href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/updates-on-lumina-probiotic" rel="">post an update to my readers</a><span>, and ask for a meeting to ask scientific questions. Aaron refuses my request to record the meeting, so I take notes instead and email them to him afterwards. As my last post indicates, Aaron mostly deferred scientific questions to his advisor, Justin Merritt, and his employee, Rob Williams. I send emails to both of them.</span></p><p><span>4. In the few hours after publishing my updates on Lumina, I get 4 comments on my post, one supportive, three negative. The supportive one is from Will Manidis, who’s been reading my blog for a while. One critical comment is from Aaron, and contains multiple factual inaccuracies, which I address below</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144809924" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about#footnote-2-144809924" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. Note that I was unable to refute them directly because he directly references the post that he requested I take down.</span></p><p>The other two critical comments are from people who I’ve never heard from before. On further research, one of them is from someone who subscribed to my Substack directly before commenting. They follow Lumina on Twitter. The other is from someone who doesn’t subscribe to my Substack, which is suspicious, because I didn’t share this post anywhere except to my subscribers.</p><p><span>5. Rob Williams writes me a long response to my email in which he dodges my main questions. I ask follow-up questions to get clarifications. He asks me “how I’d like to be served” and threatens me with “spending years in and out of a California courtroom” (full email printed below)</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-144809924" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about#footnote-3-144809924" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>.</span></p><p>6.

I think Aaron and Lumina would rather their product claims be not submitted to scrutiny by anyone, and are willing to intimidate and lie in order to do so.</p><p>I believe (note the libel-friendly phrasing) that:</p><p>1. Lumina’s manufacturing process follows legally mandated GMP protocols, if not the probiotic trade association’s voluntary best practices.</p><p>2. It is weird to be secretive about your manufacturing until pressed on it, especially when you have made a point of trying to evade regulations. See Zbiotics for a great example of how to behave responsibly and communicate openly when selling genetically modified bacteria for human health issues. It’s especially weird to threaten lawsuits when people ask follow-up questions about your manufacturing.</p><p>3. Lumina’s product is a drug, not a cosmetic product.&nbsp; And, regardless of whether it is a cosmetic product, it has the potential to cause great harm. This means it needs extensive human safety testing. This can be under the FDA or not.</p><p>4. There are scientific reasons to believe that Lumina’s product can be unsafe and ineffective in humans, based on the reasoning in my previous posts. This uncertainty can and should be resolved by careful, well-designed human trials, not by releasing the product into the wild.</p><p>5. It was wrong for Lumina to take money for the product, like they did in Honduras and in pre-orders, without doing proper testing.</p><p>6. Threats of lawsuits have no place in open scientific debate.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Share this post if you value open scientific debate.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/luminas-legal-threats-and-my-about?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pg-timeseries">https://tembo.io/blog/pg-timeseries</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40417347">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>We are excited to launch <code>pg_timeseries</code>: a PostgreSQL extension focused on creating a cohesive user experience around the creation, maintenance, and use of time-series tables. You can now use pg_timeseries to create time-series tables, configure the compression and retention of older data, monitor time-series partitions, and run complex time-series analytics functions with a user-friendly syntax. pg_timeseries is <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries">open-sourced</a> under the PostgreSQL license and can be added to your existing PostgreSQL installation or tried as a part of the <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/analytical/timeseries">Timeseries Stack</a> on <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/">Tembo Cloud</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-time-series-data">What is time-series data?</h2>
<p>Put simply, time-series data is a collection of data points, each with a timestamp attached. These could be stock prices recorded throughout a trading day, temperature and availability data returned from devices and sensors, or web traffic on a website. Time-series workloads typically include queries filtering by time (generally for some degree of recency) and aggregation queries to summarize the data for analytics.</p>
<p><img src="https://tembo.io/_astro/ts-wiki.6MOvJoCu_ZGpQ8A.webp" alt="time-series" title="time-series" width="601" height="447" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="using-postgresql-for-time-series-workloads">Using PostgreSQL for Time-series workloads</h2>
<p>We believe that PostgreSQL can be used to <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/tembo-manifesto">power any data workload</a> thanks to its extensions and ecosystem tools. Therefore, at Tembo, we aim to make it easy for users to <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/ga">use the entire PostgreSQL ecosystem</a> to reduce the complexity of the modern data stack.</p>
<p>In the last year, we’ve built several <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/intro-to-stacks">stacks</a> and extensions that help you run <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/analytical/data-warehouse">analytics</a>, <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/ai/vectordb">AI</a>, and <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/product/stacks/transactional/oltp">operational</a> workloads on PostgreSQL. However, our customers’ most requested stack has been one able to store and act upon their time-series data. That way, they can store all of their data with a single PostgreSQL provider who can meet all their needs.</p>
<p>You may already be asking: “why not just power the stack using <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb">TimescaleDB</a>?” The Timescale License would restrict our use of features such as compression, incremental materialized views, and bottomless storage. With these missing, we felt that what remained would not provide an adequate basis for our customers’ time-series needs. Therefore, we decided to build our own PostgreSQL-licensed extension.</p>
<h2 id="building-blocks-for-pg_timeseries">Building blocks for pg_timeseries</h2>
<p>To efficiently store and query time-series data, there are a few requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily manage time-series data</li>
<li>Deal with high-throughput ingest</li>
<li>Answer range queries fast</li>
<li>Efficiently store large amounts of data</li>
<li>Run complex analytics functions</li>
</ul>
<p>PostgreSQL has several features that provide the right building blocks to solve these requirements. Features such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html">native partitioning</a>, variety of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes.html">indexes</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html">materialized views</a>, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html">window / analytics functions</a> provide the main functionality. Several extensions add additional features to PostgreSQL to make it even better: <a href="https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman">pg_partman</a> for partition management, <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron">pg_cron</a> for scheduling jobs, <a href="https://github.com/hydradatabase/hydra/tree/main/columnar">columnar</a> for compression, <a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm">pg_ivm</a> for incremental materialized views, and <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_tier">pg_tier</a> for long-term offloading of older partitions.</p>
<p>Making all of these components work together cohesively is a tall order, and is hard for most users. pg_timeseries aims to solve this problem.</p>
<h2 id="pg_timeseries-the-simplest-way-to-manage-your-time-series-data-in-postgresql">pg_timeseries: The simplest way to manage your time-series data in PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>pg_timeseries combines the functionality of extensions such as pg_partman, pg_cron, and Hydra’s columnar in order to provide a unified and intuitive interface for managing and querying time-series tables. The PostgreSQL ecosystem has contained many approaches to various aspects of time-series workloads for years and pg_timeseries does the work of making sure all PostgreSQL users experience how these tools work together to make time-series workloads a cinch.</p>
<p>All pg_timeseries requires to get started is a table with a time-like column, partitioned on that column. After that, simply call <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#enable_ts_table">enable_ts_table</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    CREATE TABLE measurements (</span></span>
<span><span>      metric_name text,</span></span>
<span><span>      metric_value numeric,</span></span>
<span><span>      metric_time timestamptz NOT NULL</span></span>
<span><span>    ) PARTITION BY RANGE (metric_time);</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>    SELECT enable_ts_table('measurements');</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The extension includes various views such as <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#ts_table_info">ts_table_info</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#ts_part_info">ts_part_info</a> to surface important information about your tables and partitions:</p>

<p>As partitions “age out” of your time-series tables, you can choose whether to have them compressed using columnar storage, deleted entirely, or both. For example, the following will cause partitions to be compressed if their data is older than 90 days, and will drop them entirely after one year:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    SELECT set_ts_compression_policy('measurements', '90 days');</span></span>
<span><span>    SELECT set_ts_retention_policy('measurements', '365 days');</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Finally, pg_timeseries includes additional functions like <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#locf">locf</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#firstlast">last</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/blob/main/doc/reference.md#date_bin_table">date_bin_table</a> to make writing time-series queries easier. We know SQL can sometimes be hard to wrangle into doing what you want with time-series data, so these functions were written to enhance query maintainability. For instance, the following will bin data in the specified range by hour and fill any missing hours with the previous reading. It also includes the name of the metric in each hour with the highest reading:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    SELECT</span></span>
<span><span>      locf(avg(metric_value)) OVER (ORDER BY metric_time) avg_val,</span></span>

<h2 id="were-just-getting-started">We’re just getting started</h2>
<p>We know building a full-featured time-series extension for PostgreSQL requires a lot of pieces. However, we’re committed to building them in the open, with the community. The current roadmap includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offloading older partitions to cold storage such as S3</li>
<li>Approximate functions for efficient analytics</li>
<li>Incremental materialized views</li>
<li>Roll-up and roll-off of older partitions</li>
<li>Additional analytics helper functions</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire planned roadmap is present on the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_timeseries/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap">GitHub README</a> and features will be prioritized based on demand from users. Our next addition is going to be plugging in <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_tier">pg_tier</a> with pg_timeseries to allow offloading older tables to cold storage such as S3.</p>
<p>The simplest way to try out pg_timeseries is spinning up a free instance of the Timeseries stack on Tembo Cloud. We look forward to your feedback!</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Over the last decade, few platforms have declined quite as rapidly and visibly as Facebook and Instagram. What used to be apps for catching up with your friends and family are now algorithmic nightmares that constantly interrupt you with suggested content and advertisements that consistently outweigh the content of people that you choose to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, those running Facebook groups routinely find that their content <em>isn’t even being shown</em> to those who choose to follow them thanks to Meta’s outright abusive approach to social media where the customer is not only <em>wrong</em>, but should ideally have little control over what they see.</p><p>Over the next two newsletters, I’m going to walk you through the decline of Facebook and Instagram, starting with the events that led to its decay and those I believe are responsible for turning the world’s most popular consumer apps into skinner boxes for advertising agencies.</p><p>In the case of Facebook, the decline is either reflected in — or directly facilitated by — two specific features: People You May Know and the News Feed. It’s my belief that these products, piloted by deeply insidious people led by Mark Zuckerberg himself, are central to the darkness inside this company.</p><p>And I want to dispel a notion that many people have: Facebook has, from the very beginning, been a rotten, manipulative company, one that acted with little regard for users, even at times when it pretended to do so. The goal has always been more — not just more <em>money</em>, but more engagement, more time on the app, more visits to the website, and perpetual growth, all mandated by Mark Zuckerberg and a rogue’s gallery of rot economists.</p><p>We start our story in 2004, a few months after the company was founded, when Peter Thiel became Facebook’s first investor, putting $500,000 into the company in return for a 10.2% stake. As depicted in the 2010 Aaron Sorkin film The Social Network, Thiel was introduced to Zuckerberg by Sean Parker, the co-founder of Napster, his wounds fresh from a brutal beating by Lars Ulrich and Metallica.&nbsp;</p><p>What was significant about this event wasn’t the people involved or the amount of money invested, but the terms of the deal — terms that would permanently and inextricably ruin Facebook. Parker, ever the advocate for founders, negotiated with Peter Thiel to allow Mark Zuckerberg to retain two of Facebook’s five board seats. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/technology/from-earliest-days-zuckerberg-focused-on-controlling-facebook.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>When Parker resigned in 2005, he insisted that Zuckerberg be given his seat</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While this may have seemed a noble, even ideal situation for a founder in these early days, this single move has allowed Zuckerberg to wield complete power over Facebook, and was the first step along a road that has made him impossible to fire, ultimately dooming the company to whatever miserable death march Harvard’s most quirked-up white boy would deem fit.</p><blockquote>As an aside: Zuckerberg’s invulnerability also comes from Meta’s dual-class share structure. Essentially, there are two kinds of Meta stock: Class A shares, which are widely traded and represent one vote, and Class B shares, which each represent ten votes.&nbsp;<p>Zuckerberg </p><a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/19/18099011/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-stock-nyt-wsj?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>owns an estimated 60% of all Class B shares</u></a>, with a significant chunk of the remainder largely held by insiders and other sycophants. This means that despite only owning roughly 13% of Facebook shares, his power is virtually absolute. While there are relatively fewer Class B shares than Class A shares, it doesn’t really matter, given the disproportionate power they wield. In essence, this makes Zuckerberg invulnerable to a stockholder revolt, or the arrival of an activist investor (like, for example, Bill Ackman).&nbsp;<p>This isn’t a particularly unusual structure. It’s common within technology companies, particularly those founded over the past few decades. Google has a three-tier stock structure, with Class B shares (those with the most voting power) held by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and former CEO Eric Schmidt, in essence giving them a majority despite collectively only owning a relatively small percentage of the company. Class C shares, which </p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/facebook-fb-decides-against-the-creation-of-class-c-shares-2017-09-25?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20during%20its%20first,A%20and%20Class%20B%20shares."><u>Facebook has tried (and failed) to issue</u></a>, carry no voting rights. </blockquote><p>I cannot express how important this moment was. This was when the mistake was made, albeit innocently, that kept Zuckerberg in power. I would be kind and suggest that Sean Parker didn’t know what Mark Zuckerberg was like at this point other than the fact that he absolutely did, and he should have known better.&nbsp;</p><p>A few years later in April 2006, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-mark-zuckerberg-retain-26-equity-facebook-after-sramana-mitra/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Zuckerberg</u></a> was once again able to negotiate terms that kept him at the top, in part thanks to Facebook’s strong revenue — $6 million a year, an impressive sum at the time, especially for company in the new and ill-defined social networking space — and the fact that he owned three out of five board seats and could do whatever the hell he wanted. Venture capitalists desperate to avoid missing out on a company with rocketship growth had little leverage against a man with the keys to the most important company in tech.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/05/new-facebook-redesign-more-than-just-aesthetics/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In September 2006</u></a>, Facebook would launch the News Feed — a relatively unsophisticated chronological feed of your friends’ status that is, on some level, one of the most important launches in modern software history, and a great example of a good product that got destroyed by executives that realized a focal point for their users is a great place to torture them with advertising.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. It had a rough start. The feed, which Facebook product manager Ruchi Sanghvi described as “quite unlike anything you can find on the web,” led to an immediate revolt within Facebook’s 9.5 million users, as it effectively showed a stream of <em>literally every action you took on the platform,</em> which users found “creepy” and “stalker-esque” according to a group made at the time called Students Against Facebook News Feed.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who weren’t around when it launched, or didn’t use Facebook, this bit is hard to grasp. It would show you literally every activity you and your friends did. If you joined or left a group, or made a new connection, it would appear for all to see. It was almost like a panopticon — one where you are simultaneously the jailer and the prisoner.&nbsp;</p><p>A few days later, Zuckerberg would apologize, saying that Facebook “<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/facebooks-zuckerberg-we-really-messed-this-one-up/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>really messed this one up</u></a>,” and that Facebook spent two days coding non-stop to add a privacy page that allowed users to choose which types of stories went into their News Feed. While this feature was actually released, it’s important to know that while the rest of the world might not have known what you were doing afterwards, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook absolutely did.</p><p>This was the same year that Facebook opened to the general public, turned down a billion-dollar acquisition offer from Yahoo, and signed a three-year advertising deal with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Facebook’s rot began in earnest in 2008, when a former McKinsey analyst, now the Vice President of Global Online Sales &amp; Operations at Google, would be made Chief Operating Officer of Facebook. Her name was Sheryl Sandberg, and she would be the force that would grow Facebook into a truly evil company.</p><hr><p><a href="https://marker.medium.com/the-untold-history-of-facebooks-most-controversial-growth-tool-2ea3bfeaaa66?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>According to an excerpt from Steven Levy’s “Facebook: The Inside Story,”</u></a> sometime in 2008, Facebook’s growth had stalled somewhere around 90 million users, with Zuckerberg telling Levy in an interview that the company had “hit a wall.”&nbsp;</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya, a former venture capitalist who was at the time Facebook’s VP of Platform &amp; Monetization, came to Zuckerberg with an idea — that Facebook should focus on a new metric, monthly active users. This metric, which is now a cornerstone of most tech companies’ growth metrics, would be a measure of whether users were sticking on the platform, and boosting this number would mean that users were engaged with the product.&nbsp;</p><p>In a meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg, Palihapitiya was asked to name it, and it came up with MAUs. Sandberg responded that they should “just call it growth.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the next board meeting, Palihapitiya would present what Levy would call “aggressive growth techniques” that would double or triple Facebook’s user base, and then “use the platform itself as an engine for growth.”&nbsp;</p><p>After a tepid response at the meeting, Palihapitiya was given license to build a new growth team from both within and outside Facebook, one that would eventually become a rogue’s gallery of rot economists, including Facebook Head of Product Naomi Gleit, and Alex Schultz, who would go on to become Meta’s Chief marketing Officer and VP of Analytics, along with fellow teammate Javier Olivan, who replaced Sandberg as Chief Operating Officer in 2022.</p><p>Gleit, Olivan and Schultz are at the epicenter of almost every single choice that Meta has made to put growth above the user experience. Palihapitiya wanted their team — which also included early Facebook data scientist Danny Ferrante and Blake Ross, who previously co-created the Firefox Web Browser — to become “the Growth Circle,” what Levy refers to as “a power center in the company with special status and a distinctive subculture.”&nbsp;</p><p>He succeeded. In 2008, Facebook would launch a feature called “People You May Know,” a seemingly-innocent feature that would, as the name suggests, suggest people that you might know on Facebook. Yet this innocent seemed to be a little too good at its job, with reporter Kashmir Hill — <a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-you-may-know-a-controversial-facebook-features-1827981959?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>who spent over a year investigating the feature for Gizmodo</u></a> from 2016 to 2017 —&nbsp; saying it “mined information users don’t have control over to make connections they may not want to make,” such as suggesting patients friend their psychiatrist, or outing a sex worker’s real identity to her clients.</p><p>Despite doggedly researching People You May Know, Hill never got Facebook to explain how it worked. Nevertheless, Steven Levy was able to get Palihapitiya to reveal one horrifying detail — that Facebook’s growth team would take out google ads on people’s names, targeting those who hadn’t joined Facebook with “dark profiles,” fake links that would suggest that somebody had already taken their name.&nbsp;</p><p>While many might consider People You May Know a well-meaning feature, the algorithm behind the service is extremely powerful and sinister, capable of dragging up distant relationships, honed by both the data you knowingly give Facebook (the connections you’ve made, for example), and other unknown sources.</p><p>I do, however, believe there’s another person responsible — a man named Lars Backstrom, a relatively-unknown yet powerful figure in Facebook’s history.&nbsp;</p><p>Backstrom’s LinkedIn notes that he “built PYMK (People You May Know)’s backend infrastructure and machine learning system” starting from September 2009 through February 2012. In 2013, Backstrom published a paper in tandem with computer scientist Jon Kleinberg called “Romantic Partnerships and the Dispersion of Social Ties: A Network Analysis of Relationship Status on Facebook.” <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/spotting-romantic-relationships-on-facebook/?_r=1&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>The paper</u></a> focuses on an algorithm that was able to independently identify someone’s spouse, according to the Times’ Steven Lohr, 60 percent of the time, and even able to calculate when a couple might break up.&nbsp;</p><p>The paper hinged on the idea that mutual friends isn’t an indicator of a couple’s relationship status, but rather the “dispersion” of those mutual friends — the amount of mutual friends <em>that are also mutual friends with each other.</em> This is a seemingly sensible idea that, when framed as an algorithm made by the engineer who made Facebook’s extremely successful growth tool, feels far more creepy.</p><p>Backstrom, in a 2010 talk relayed by Steven Levy, said that People You May Know “accounted for a significant chunk of all friending on Facebook,” and that friends-of-friends are the most powerful part of the tool. People You May Know’s power wasn’t just that it found people that you knew well, but people you sort-of knew, offering you the tantalizing idea of getting close to them, and when you friended them, Facebook’s News Feed would make their content more prevalent in your feed, forcing an intimacy that may not have existed by making a new connection — no matter how tangential it may be — feel more immediate in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>This subtle feature is responsible for much of Facebook’s growth, and was deliberately engineered by rot economists like Schultz, Gleit and Olivan to do so at any cost, even if it endangered the lives of children.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://wsj.com/tech/encryption-instagram-facebook-messages-a89ebe07?mod=hp_lead_pos2&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>According to the Wall Street Journal</u></a>, in 2018 an engineer in charge of one of Facebook’s community integrity teams, David Erb, found that “the most frequent way adults found children to prey upon” was People You May Know. The Journal also reported that a few days later, Erb found that Meta was planning to add encryption to Facebook messages, something that would prevent the company from fixing the problem, threatening to resign in protest. He was placed on leave not long after, eventually leaving.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook introduced encryption to its messages, despite Erb’s stark warning that millions of pedophiles were targeting tens of millions of children.<em> </em>People You May Know was — and is — a dangerous tool, created, maintained and proliferated by people that now effectively run Meta.&nbsp;</p><p>Once Palihapitiya left Facebook in 2011 to start a venture capital firm, his team — Schultz, Gleit, and Olivan — continued to accumulate power. I believe these people, along with Lars Backstrom, are responsible for making People You May Know into a reckless, dangerous and scurrilous growth machine for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2012, Facebook’s true rot would set in, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/sponsored-stories-news-feed/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>with the launch of sponsored stories in Facebook’s News Feed</u></a>, which Josh Constine, in a moment that should bring him deep shame, claimed he’d “rather see [Facebook]…inform [him] about the activity of friends than traditional ads that can be much less relevant,” a statement that frames exactly how little the tech media criticized this company. He also added one interesting tidbit — that Facebook had tested letting advertisers pay for sponsored content in the News Feed in 2006, but discontinued doing so in 2008, deciding that advertisers shouldn’t be able to show content in the News Feed unless it could appear there naturally, a statement that Constine wrote without a single hint of alarm.</p><p>In February, Lars Backstrom, the architect of People You May Know, would move over to manage News Feed ranking, and a few months later, Facebook would acquire Instagram for $1 billion dollars. In May, Facebook would have what would be considered a disastrous IPO, with Wall Street concerned about its lack of growth on mobile devices. After its first day of trading, the share price was barely above its debut, and by September, it had shed more than half its value.&nbsp;</p><p>Something had to change, and sometime in 2012, Facebook would promote product manager Adam Mosseri to the head of Facebook’s News Feed division. It was during this period when it started recommending content in the News Feed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/01/facebook-letter-mark-zuckerberg-text?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In Mark Zuckerberg’s statement of intent to potential investors in Facebook’s IPO</u></a>, he declared that there was a “huge need and huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected,” or what I like to know as Phase 1 of Facebook’s decline.&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the curtain, Zuckerberg’s vision wasn’t to “get everyone in the world connected,” but to get everyone in the world connected to Facebook, and by the end of 2012 the site had a billion users, or a seventh of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He also made one very bizarre statement: that Facebook didn’t build services to make money, but made money to build services.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing could have been further from the truth.</p><hr><p>For over a decade, Facebook has deliberately made itself worse to make more money, thanks Mark Zuckerberg and the Growth Team perpetuating a culture that manipulates and tortures users to make company metrics improve.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data?ref=wheresyoured.at#.upw3jdyR8"><u>In a 2016 memo leaked to Buzzfeed several years ago</u></a>, then-Vice President Andrew “Boz” Bosworth — now Facebook’s Chief Technology Officer — wrote a horrifying screed that romanticized Facebook’s growth-at-all-costs culture. Boz noted that connecting people on Facebook “may cost a life by exposing someone to bullies,” and that “maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack” coordinated using Facebook’s tools, and that because Facebook’s mission was to “connect people,” “all the work [Facebook does] in growth is justified.”&nbsp;</p><p>Boz makes it clear that this is a moral judgment by adding that “all questionable contact importing practices, all the subtle language that helps people stay searchable friends, all the work we do to bring more communication in” was justified in the pursuit of growth.&nbsp;</p><p>This man — this horrible, nasty man — is the Chief Technology Officer of Meta, and the mastermind behind both Meta’s Metaverse and Artificial Intelligence goals.</p><p>And as I’ll explain, Facebook is culturally a growth-at-all-costs company, and will make any changes it needs to make to its products to make a number go up.</p><p>In December 2020, a Facebook engineer published a document they wrote in 2019 called “When User-Engagement ≠ User-Value,” shared with me by a source that tells me they’re available through Harvard.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3mh97DITsxmyUcpzUWmMKEoQhnrb7ZENUa49MGuF0awYXfJP_ifIWV2fjm9uIgmEjMc7RVdQ-29AN5D2mHdKmKS_lcmyKtbfkwfLwtrDQiiriZMJAToNHNPQhYKdttk8v3keVhaAV5zUpFALGK9cwuc" alt="" loading="lazy" width="760" height="596"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “When User-Engagement ≠ User-Value,” written in 2019, published in December 2020.</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>This remarkable document, shared with Facebook’s staff, makes a stark warning that Facebook’s brutal focus on user engagement and “time spent” damages the user experience, first explaining the historical context using the analogue of Cable TV versus Broadcast TV, and how Cable TV needs to maximize overall value for their fixed-free offerings, and Broadcast TV needs to maximize engagement with their channels, something the engineer explains some networks do by having constant recaps, padding scenes and adding cliffhangers.</p><p>The engineer then explains the several ways that Facebook makes its products worse to maximize engagement.

The engineer referred to this as a “clear value-engagement tradeoff.”</li><li>Facebook deliberately stopped sending out emails telling people what happened on their feed so that they’d have to check the site.</li><li>Facebook, by maximizing for time spent on the site, incentivizes “bad ranking,” I imagine because when you’re incentivizing to keep people on the site, you’re not actually trying to provide a service.</li><li>Headlines on the Facebook feed say misleading things and “subtly exaggerate” to get people to click links “all the time,” and the solution to deal with it was “very crude.”</li></ul><p>This piece is a dire warning to Facebook’s internal staff, and includes numerous worrying warnings about how the company keeps users engaged, layered with evidence from the news and academia.</p><p>The engineer warns:</p><ol><li>Higher Facebook use is correlated with worse psychological states.</li><li>An experiment found that a 1-month break from Facebook improved self-reported well-being.</li><li>A large fraction of Facebook users struggle with their Facebook/Instagram use.</li><li>A significant minority of Facebook users (3.1%) report serious problems with sleep, work or relationships that they attribute to Facebook AND concerns or preoccupations with how they use Facebook.”</li></ol><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/zXIoDWwYPRVvHHEd-yqTYPFvfAVWKv_VprfWTvq-FL61CzFYylDXsCEwzxrENHkNWWXLs2YGHqkQyVCJix_AebsdAFy4gABNmF04_BGDTPeH40lEqkWMm94UFtp6m9hmSzV-sHvH3Tplb6_8oppTq_A" alt="" loading="lazy" width="716" height="428"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “When User-Engagement ≠ User-Value,” written in 2019, published in December 2020.</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In their suggested solutions, the engineer notes that “over the last couple of years News Feed slowly switched from maximizing time-spent towards maximizing sessions” — meaning that Facebook had now changed to focus less on how long a user was on the platform and more toward maximizing how many times someone visited the platform, which the engineer noted was “a strong predictor of problematic use.”</p><p>This document — again, written in 2019 and published in 2020 — frames both how craven Facebook was about twisting its users’ habits, and how intimately aware it was of these problems. One commenter added, in a larger thought about addiction, that they “worried that driving sessions incentivized Facebook to make [its] products more addictive, without providing much more value.”</p><p>And that's exactly what Facebook has become: a gratuitous social experiment where the customer is manipulated to match metrics handed on from on high.&nbsp;</p><p>For over a decade, Facebook has knowingly and repeatedly taken steps to maximize activities on the website at the cost of the user experience, making countless tweaks to the product to increase internal metrics obsessed over by Mark Zuckerberg, Alex Schultz and Javier Olivan.&nbsp;</p><p>In another document provided to me by the same source, one engineer explained in October 2020 an internal channel why the Facebook App Took on sessions as a “Top-Line Metric” for 2019. The piece centered around Facebook’s app strategy of building “socially powered services” that were focused on the “possibilities of what people could do” with Facebook, largely because Facebook had no easy way to measure how it “satisfied user needs.”&nbsp;</p><p>This document is important, because it reveals some very specific details about the company — such as that in 2014, Mark Zuckerberg unilaterally decided that time spent on Facebook was a “top level company Engagement goal,” and forced it upon the News Feed team despite their protests that it was “too easy to game.”</p><p>To be clear, when someone at Facebook says something is “too easy to game,” it means that they are warning that people building products inside Facebook will try and game the system by making it worse to hit metrics — such as, in the case of Time Spent on the app, making the product more convoluted to use, meaning that people use the app more because it takes more effort to do a given thing.</p><blockquote>Hey, this reminds me of something. <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/#:~:text=A%20day%20later,to%20come%20back.%E2%80%9D"><u>When Prabhakar Raghavan led a coup to take over Google Search from Ben Gomes, his specific obsession was with “queries,” or how many searches people made on Google</u></a>. Mark Zuckerberg effectively did the same thing, demanding in 2014 that Facebook increase two metrics — Daily Active People and Time Spent on Facebook — <em>perpetually increase 10% year-over-year</em>. It didn’t matter if these things made the product worse, or didn’t actually show their users were happy. All that mattered was if the number went up.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YKzoBBe5GQj1R5gJtBMF1SNxMYfwTrBA8pJjJUO6ZuJXkl-3CXw-Jm5lpfNGHNVwVMFhhxmIETLODp28EWGKx-rcYDNyuEQlSukK4laHLJVWggq6ov_XkaynEGLtQvNS2RL3ZsROSQ7A8-qzVVvQap4" alt="" loading="lazy" width="778" height="202"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “Why FB App Took on Sessions as a Top-Line Metric for 2019,” posted October 2020, where “Zuck…declared the goal was a perpetual 10%T y/y growth in Family TS (Time Spent)/DAP (Daily Active People).”&nbsp;</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In 2017, the document notes that engagement metrics started to dive, but the company’s focus on “Time Spent” meant that nobody noticed because the number that Mark Zuckerberg cared about went up, until the alarm was sound and Facebook moved to “Sessions.”</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HJhTiuaNu7z5UUMlxE6h5bH220AZBYDS1wvN0B3EXwmd1l_bNxoMHzr-T6LkWUTx7RrYmzTFhArvAu_1IyLVOU-rrKYEK8mShejwA0NBTQVvjXw9sZDZlpafEKbyxQXgFXS9Y81aN9WznjfbLmBc75U" alt="" loading="lazy" width="613" height="157"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: A section of “Why FB App Took on Sessions as a Top-Line Metric for 2019,” posted October 2020, discussing how Facebook “was no longer focused on your friends,” leading them to pivoting to “meaningful interactions.”&nbsp;</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In this document, they discuss the term “meaningful interactions,” the underlying metric which (allegedly) guides Facebook today. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together"><u>In January 2018</u></a>, Adam Mosseri, then Head of News Feed, would post that an update to the News Feed would now “prioritize posts that spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people,” which may explain the chaos (and rot) in the News Feed thereafter.</p><p>To be clear, metrics around time spent hung around at the company, especially with regard to video, and Facebook has repeatedly and intentionally made changes to manipulate its users to satisfy them. In his book “<a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwiFs7y30_yFAxV3NIcDHX1HC_sYABAGGgJqZg&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwouexBhAuEiwAtW_Zx9F-yiJ_A_Y7p8BzVE_bnnJ7dDV5IFeYjXbY4xNq2s789d262XrtpxoC8_IQAvD_BwE&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESVuD2Gu4n3KsjSA9z6zNL3bdKhcsNS2Une4IrZvBduby8OnpLcdUvEhyyVP0GjjHONNYBETcmHb9CnqUB1bQP7C3INdwv2KQc0x9SzK6UBi_FDDPPtiIa&amp;sig=AOD64_0vi5bM7EoF7SkYMuhhiguibdGLsw&amp;ctype=5&amp;q=&amp;nis=6&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjy_rW30_yFAxW7LUQIHfh6CocQ9aACKAB6BAgFECE&amp;adurl=&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Broken Code</u></a>,” Jeff Horwitz notes that Facebook “changed its News Feed design to encourage people to click on the reshare button or follow a page when they viewed a post,” with “engineers altering the Facebook algorithm to increase how often users saw content reshared from people they didn’t know.”&nbsp;</p><p>Horwitz also notes that Facebook began hunting for “friction…anything that was slowing users down or limiting their activity—with the goal of eliminating it,” something that manifested in Facebook allowing users to create an unlimited number of pages and cross-post the same material to multiple groups at once, and even a change to People You May Know that prioritized recommending accounts that were likely to accept a friend request.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, this led to negative incentives. In an internal document from 2018 called “The Friending 1%: Inequality in Friending,” an unnamed internal Facebook worker noted that Facebook’s aggressive optimization to make people send friend requests had created a situation where 0.5% percent of Facebook accounts were responsible for 50 percent of friend requests.&nbsp;</p><p>Worse still, accounts that were less than 15-days-old now made up 20 percent of all outgoing friend requests, and<em> more than half of friend</em> requests were sent by somebody who was making more than 50 of them a day, heavily suggesting that Facebook was growing its platform’s “connections” through spam.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PCeiyQMPXGrLDYu-KytdBbnPu4_SUYmYsDLP1FKK0ePCAJUI0khrBk1NFhoCXM9aloSHV4S2Nh7T8241IjVKHvUZNCUW2CB8xWyLmanD9tRoTWa1ht-jY0qNRZFVCxZzV4dsUjrsUPg9J4eWxTRNpQQ" alt="" loading="lazy" width="845" height="561"><figcaption><b><strong>Caption: An excerpt of “The Friending 1%: Inequality in Friending, posted November 2018.</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>In a later document published in mid-2019, another engineer proposes limiting the amount of invites that Facebook users can send to groups, specifically noting that “a larger proportion of invites into bad groups come from a small subset” of “whale inviters” that sent massive amounts of invites in a small amount of time, specifically noting this effect in vaccine misinformation groups, which posed an “integrity and product relevance risk” to the company.</p><p>A few years ago, I'm told that Zuckerberg begrudgingly established <em>some</em> limits on invites, but it’s unclear what those limits are.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>For Facebook — and Meta at large — anything that might limit growth is a non-starter. Sometime in 2020, another document that is apparently available through Harvard proposes limiting the distribution (as in the recommendation) of groups before they’re proven to be trustworthy. The problem, as the unnamed engineer describes, is “that “unproven” movements” were able to get traction on Facebook way before community standards could review them, some gaining over a million followers in a single day, and that the groups began to violate community standards way <em>after</em> they gained traction. As you’ve likely guessed, no such limitation was ever implemented on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>In Broken Code, Horwitz notes that “even when the safety benefits were high and the business risks were low…” Facebook would choose <em>not</em> to use its emergency “break the glass” playbooks to take action, and even when it did, it was quick to roll them back.&nbsp;</p><p>Horwitz gives an example of the runup to Myanmar’s 2020 election, where the company rolled out Break The Glass measures, “[limiting] the spread of reshared content and [replacing] it with more content from users’ friends.” The countermeasures “produced an impressive 25% reduction in viral inflammatory posts and a 49% reduction in viral hoax photos” at a meager two percent loss in “meaningful social interactions,” Facebook’s favorite metric. Horwitz notes that despite this small change in engagement, an internal team chose to roll these changes back a few months later.</p><p>One particularly gruesome story is that of Project Daisy, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a pilot program that would remove likes from Instagram to reduce the anxiety and negative feelings that teenagers felt using the app</u></a> that was retired after Adam Mosseri, now head of Instagram, claimed it had “very little impact and the result was neutral,” relegating it to an opt-in feature. <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Less-redacted%20complaint%20-%20released.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Yet a complaint</u></a> filed by several US states including California, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania in May 2023 quoted a meta researcher saying that Project Daisy was “one of the clearest things (supported by research that [Meta could] do to positively impact social comparison and well being on IG and we should ship it,” with another researcher saying that “Daisy is such a rare case where a product intervention can improve well-being for almost everyone that uses our products.” Chillingly, one Meta employee said that if Meta refused to implement Daisy despite the research, they were “doubtful” that Meta would implement “any broad product changes with the purpose of improving user well-being,” which I think we can all agree is accurate.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit is labyrinthine, and specifically makes one allegation that aligns with the current state of both Facebook and Instagram — that “Meta’s algorithm alters users’ experience on the Platform and draws unwitting users into rabbit holes of algorithmically curated material.”&nbsp;</p><p>And as I’ve mentioned before, the people involved from the very beginning are those perpetuating the same outright abuse of their users. An email thread from late 2017 and early 2018 cited on page 54 of the aforementioned complaint between Adam Mosseri and other executives discussed “significant declines in U.S. engagement metrics,” naming how reducing notifications was associated with reduced engagement, with an unnamed employee stating that there would be a tradeoff between making a better notification experience for users and recovering flailing numbers in Facebook’s “Daily Active People” metric.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same thread, Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said that if the team believed that a filtered notification experience was better, they shouldn’t make changes because a metric was down, adding that Meta needed to “get better at making the harder decisions” when the main decision criteria was experience rather than one particular metric. The then-VP of Analytics and now Chief Marketing Officer responded that he “fundamentally believed that [Meta] abused the notifications channel as a company.” Though the suit doesn’t quote the rest of the thread, it notes that Director of Growth Andrew Bocking ended the discussion by saying that Meta would “prioritize engagement over reducing notifications,” and that he “just got clear input from Naomi [Gleit] that US DAP [Daily Active People] is a bigger concern for [Mark Zuckerberg] right now than user experience.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/" rel="noreferrer">When I wrote about Prabhakar Raghavan’s destruction of Google Search</a>, it was much harder to find real, tangible proof of his actions — though one could easily chart a path of intent in how he wanted to increase queries and revenue in Google Search at any cost. In Meta’s case, things are much easier.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is personally responsible for the state of Facebook and Instagram today, and has assembled a cadre of growth fiends that will — at times happily and other times begrudgingly — make the user experience worse to increase engagement. And this isn’t a new phenomenon. From the very early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has acted without remorse, tricking and scheming and screwing others over in pursuit of digital dominance and financial gain in a way that I find absolutely stomach churning.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Zuckerberg could not perpetuate these disgusting acts without the help of people like Chief Marketing Officer Alex Schultz, who saw to it that Meta shut down CrowdTangle, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-kills-crucial-transparency-tool-worst-possible-time/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>a public insights tool from Meta that allowed researchers to easily analyze what was happening on Facebook</u></a>. Horwitz reports in Broken Code that Facebook — led by Alex Schultz — killed CrowdTangle because reporter Kevin Roose kept posting a list of Facebook’s most-engaged-with content, and that Facebook was dominated with right wing lunacy and misinformation like “Plandemic,” a COVID conspiracy film that Joel Kaplan, head of Meta’s public policy team, initially blocked the health team from removing until Roose reported that it was Facebook’s number one post.</p><p>Just to be <em>abundantly</em> clear, the Head of Public Policy at Facebook deliberately allowed the spread of COVID conspiracies, and would have continued to do so if a reporter hadn’t used a Facebook tool to show how popular they were, which resulted in Facebook choosing to <em>kill the tool that allowed the reporter to find out.</em></p><p>Every single terrible thing you see on Facebook — be it some sort of horrible right wing nonsense or a confusing and annoying product decision — is made in pursuit of growth. Every bit of damage that Meta has caused to the world has been either an act of ignorance or deliberate harm, at many times tweaking the product to make it harder or more annoying to use so that you will log onto Facebook or Instagram multiple times a day and spend as much time on there as possible.</p><p>This should explain why both Instagram and Facebook are so utterly abysmal to use. Meta’s company culture is one of sycophancy and user abuse, and both of these apps are deliberately engineered to get in the way of what you want to do as a means of increasing your engagement, even if said engagement is won because the thing you’re engaging with is actively fighting you.</p><p>And the rot begins at the top, with these horrifying choices perpetuated by Mark Zuckerberg, with his enforcer Naomi Gleit making demands of engineers desperate to appease the almighty Zuck, having to (to quote Horwitz) “be careful to not frame decisions in terms of right and wrong.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>This</em> is the petty king of the tech industry — a multi-billionaire that can never be fired, that has billions of people on websites that he has deliberately engineered to boost engagement rather than provide a service.&nbsp;</p><p>I won’t mince words. Mark Zuckerberg is a scumbag that hurts his users for profit. The entire tech industry should know who he is, the culture he has created, and the ways in which he has brutalized his company into finding ways to increase numbers at the cost of his users’ happiness.</p><p>As I’ll discuss in the next newsletter, this shameless and fundamentally anti-social approach is ultimately self-destructive, and Facebook’s dominant position is looking increasingly tenuous. Next week, I’ll show you how his disgusting attitude toward running a company is tearing Facebook and Instagram to the ground, and how Meta is trying to obfuscate its decline with Enron-style metric-cooking tactics.</p><hr><p>Thanks for reading Where's Your Ed At! </p><p>If you enjoyed this newsletter, please listen to my podcast <a href="http://www.betteroffline.com/?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">Better Offline</a>, the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/betteroffline?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">Better Offline Reddit</a>, or join me on the <a href="http://chat.wheresyoured.at/?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">WYEA Discord chat</a>. </p>

      Of the 51 patients completing the study, 26 (51%) were treated with duct tape, and 25 (49%) were treated with cryotherapy. Twenty-two patients (85%) in the duct tape arm vs 15 patients (60%) enrolled in the cryotherapy arm had complete resolution of their warts (P =.05 by chi(2) analysis). The majority of warts that responded to either therapy did so within the first month of treatment.

        <strong>
          Conclusion:
        </strong>
      
      Duct tape occlusion therapy was significantly more effective than cryotherapy for treatment of the common wart.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Huge memory consumption has been a major bottleneck for deploying high-throughput large language models in real-world applications. In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26$\times$ higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

<p>Hello size coding fans. Today, I have something amazing to share: A tiny raycasting engine and city generator that fits in a standalone 256 byte html file.</p>



<p>In this post I will share all the secrets about how this magical program works. Here’s my tweet that contains the code and a video of the output…</p>

<p>You may have already seen this post on my twitter timeline. After I originally released it about 2 years ago it ended up being one of my most popular tweets ever. Thank you for supporting this strange obsession of mine. Keep reading and I will try my best to explain how and why it works the way it does…</p>



<p>This amazing program uses many different concepts in a very small space, understanding it is kind of like solving a puzzle. There are several main pieces including the html code, frame update loop, rendering system, raycasting engine, and the city itself.</p>



<center><canvas id="c"><svg onload="t=9;c.height=60;setInterval('for(c.width=w=99,++t,i=6e3;i--;c.getContext`2d`.fillRect(i%w,i/w|0,1-d*Z/w+s,1))for(a=i%w/50-1,s=b=1-i/4e3,X=t,Y=Z=d=1;++Z<w&amp;(Y<6-(32<Z&amp;27<X%w&amp;&amp;X/9^Z/8)*8%46||d|(s=(X&amp;Y&amp;Z)%3/Z,a=b=1,d=Z/w));Y-=b)X+=a',t=16)">
</svg></canvas></center>



<p>You might think that it would require some advanced math to unravel this mystery, but actually no, the code is fairly simple and only uses basic algebra, not even any trig functions are used. Though there are a few tricks that allow everything to come together with an impressive result.</p>



<h2>All Of The Code</h2>



<p>First we can take a quick look at all the code before we dive in. This is not just a JavaScript snippet but an entire valid HTML program.</p>



<pre><code>&lt;canvas style=width:99% id=c onclick=setInterval('for(c.width=w=99,++t,i=6e3;i--;c.getContext`2d`.fillRect(i%w,i/w|0,1-d*Z/w+s,1))for(a=i%w/50-1,s=b=1-i/4e3,X=t,Y=Z=d=1;++Z&lt;w&amp;(Y&lt;6-(32&lt;Z&amp;27&lt;X%w&amp;&amp;X/9^Z/8)*8%46||d|(s=(X&amp;Y&amp;Z)%3/Z,a=b=1,d=Z/w));Y-=b)X+=a',t=9)&gt;</code></pre>



<p>This is a crazy tight 256 byte block of minified code so it will take some work to make it readable.</p>



<h2>The HTML Code</h2>



<p>Let’s look at the HTML part of the code before we move onto the JavaScript. Here is just the HTML by itself…</p>



<pre><code>&lt;canvas style=width:99% id=c onclick=setInterval('',t=9)&gt;</code></pre>



<p>It is just a canvas element with an onclick event. I splurged by setting the CSS width to 99%, though it still works fine without so there is some extra space to play around with for future remixes. The canvas id is set to c which gives us a way to access it from JavaScript.</p>



<p>The onclick event is what starts the program. The setInterval call is a bit of JavaScript that creates the update loop. The interval time is 9 milliseconds which is a little faster than 60 but close enough that it doesn’t matter. The time variable t is also initialized to 9 here to save space.</p>



<p>There is a slight bug that will occur if the canvas is clicked multiple times, the interval will also run multiple times causing it to slow down. It’s not much of an issue here but something to be aware of. There are several other ways to craft the HTML part of this code, each with their own tradeoffs. A normal script block works fine too, that would just require a little more space.</p>



<h2>The JavaScript Code</h2>



<p>Next up we have the 199 byte payload of JavaScript that runs when the canvas is clicked…</p>



<pre><code>for(c.width=w=99,++t,i=6e3;i--;c.getContext`2d`.fillRect(i%w,i/w|0,1-d*Z/w+s,1))for(a=i%w/50-1,s=b=1-i/4e3,X=t,Y=Z=d=1;++Z&lt;w&amp;(Y&lt;6-(32&lt;Z&amp;27&lt;X%w&amp;&amp;X/9^Z/8)*8%46||d|(s=(X&amp;Y&amp;Z)%3/Z,a=b=1,d=Z/w));Y-=b)X+=a</code></pre>



<h2>Breaking up the JavaScript</h2>

<p>The first thing we’ll do is break up this code to make it easier to read. Whitespace is mostly ignored by JavaScript so we can rearrange things and add some extra space. Semicolons are usually not required to end a statement, so they are only used inside the for loop structure.</p>



<pre><code>c.width = w = 99
++t
for (i = 6e3; i--;)
{
  a = i%w/50 - 1
  s = b = 1 - i/4e3
  X = t
  Y = Z = d = 1
  for(; ++Z&lt;w &amp;
    (Y &lt; 6 - (32&lt;Z &amp; 27&lt;X%w &amp;&amp; X/9^Z/8)*8%46 ||
    d | (s = (X&amp;Y&amp;Z)%3/Z, a = b = 1, d = Z/w));)
  {
    X += a
    Y -= b
  }
  c.getContext`2d`.fillRect(i%w, i/w|0, 1 - d*Z/w + s, 1)
}</code></pre>



<h2>Stepping Through the Code</h2>



<p>Ok, let’s walk through the code one line at a time…</p>



<pre><code>c.width = w = 99 </code></pre>



<p>First we clear the canvas, set it’s width to 99 pixels and store 99 in w. This number will be reused many times. The default canvas height is 150 which works fine here, anything below what we draw just be left blank.</p>



<pre><code>++t</code></pre>



<p>We must increment the time variable once each frame to animate the scene.</p>



<pre><code>for (i = 6e3; i--;)</code></pre>



<p>This loop will iterate using the loop variable i and ultimately determine the brightness of each individual pixel.</p>



<p>To do that we will fire a ray from the camera using the position of this pixel to control the angle of the ray. Then if something is hit, it will send the ray towards the sun to check if it is in shadow. It sounds more complicated then it actually is!</p>



<h2>Getting the Camera Vector</h2>



<p>First we need to get a representation of the camera ray that is fired from the origin.</p>



<pre><code>a = i % w / 50 - 1</code></pre>



<p>The horizontal component of the camera vector is stored in a. We can calculate it from i by first moding i by the width which is 99. Then we divide by 50 to get a value between 0 and 2, and subtract 1 to normalize it between -1 and 1. Thankfully no parenthesis were needed which helps to save space.</p>



<pre><code>b = s = 1 - i / 4e3 </code></pre>



<p>The vertical component of the camera vector is stored in b. So it is a similar calculation to a. The correct way to calculate the vertical percentage is to first divide i by the width, then take the floor of that, then divide that by the height.</p>



<p>However by accepting a nearly imperceptible slant, we can simplify and just divide i by half the number of pixels and subtracting 1 to normalize between -1 and 1. The value 4e3 was chosen to move the horizon below center. You can play around with these values to see how it effects the result.</p>



<p>Also, notice that s is being set to the same value as b to create a vertical linear fade in the background if nothing in the scene is hit. The value of s will eventually be used to control the shading of the scene.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/city4-9.png"><img decoding="async" width="480" height="270" src="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/city4-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/city4-9.png 480w, https://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/city4-9-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></a><figcaption>Background fade stored in s</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Getting the Camera Position</h2>



<p>To make the scene appear animated moving to the right, the time value t is used as the starting X position.</p>



<pre><code>X = t</code></pre>



<p>We must also initialize the Y and Z component as well as d which is used to blend in the distance fog. A value of 1 works fine for all of these.</p>



<pre><code>Y = Z = d = 1</code></pre>



<h2>Raycasting System</h2>



<p>This inner loop is the most complicated part of the entire program, where the raycasting system steps until something is hit, then bounces the ray to check for shadows.</p>



<pre><code>for(; ++Z&lt;w &amp;</code></pre>



<p>The condition part of the for loop does a lot of heavy lifting here so we will split it up into several lines for clarity. The first part just moves Z forwards one step until it goes too far, which for us will be reusing the variable w that is equal to 99. The X and Y variables will be updated inside the loop.</p>



<h2>Checking The Building Height</h2>



<p>This code represents the shape of the city. It is here that we create the buildings, alleyways, and beautiful beach side real estate. It is a <em>very dense</em> bit of code!</p>



<pre><code>    (Y &lt; 6 - (32&lt;Z &amp; 27&lt;X%w &amp;&amp; X/9^Z/8)*8%46 ||</code></pre>



<p>To test if the ray is inside collision we check if the Y value is less than whatever the height is at that position. The city is formed by controlling the height for each XZ location</p>



<p>The 6 – part just moves the height result down below center and flips everything so the ground is on the bottom as it should be.</p>



<p>Inside the parentheses is where the real magic happens…</p>



<ul>
<li>Leave some space between the camera and the first row of buildings by making sure Z has moved at least 32 units.</li>



<li>Create the side streets and seaside by checking that X mod w (constant 99) is more than 27. This periodically leaves empty gaps like roads that divide the city up into blocks. As an added bonus this always returns false for negative values, creating a serendipitous ocean.</li>



<li>Generate a noise function for the heights of the buildings using X/9^Z/8. The bitwise exclusive or function is used here to produce an interesting spread of values, giving a random feel the height of the buildings.</li>



<li>The division is to scale it so the buildings will be 9 units wide and 8 units deep. Using larger units would increase the size of the buildings.</li>



<li>The value of X/9 here is also related the the side street width being between 27 and 99, all of those numbers are divisible by 9. This prevents very thin buildings being created on the sides.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result of everything in the parentheses ends up getting multiplied by 8 and moded by 46 which is the maximum height. These values were chosen after experimentation to produce an interesting variety of building heights.</p>



<p>We could just stop here without looping a second time and draw what we have using the Z value to fade off buildings in the distance.</p>


<div>

<h2>Creating Shadow and Texture</h2>



<p>If this code is hit, then the first test has passed so the ray must have collided with something. This is where we will get the texture of what is hit, bounce the light towards the sun to produce a shadow. It’s a little bit tricky because it’s actually two loops in one.</p>



<pre><code>    d | (s = (X&amp;Y&amp;Z)%3/Z, a = b = 1, d = Z/w));)</code></pre>



<p>The first part d | is to check if we are firing the ray from the camera or casting the ray towards the light to check for a shadow. We had already set d to 1 before the loop began, and end of this line it will be set to a value less that 1 which combined with the bitwise or will evaluate to false. This allows the loop to run a second time, moving towards the light to check for shadow. So if it is in shadow the next time this code is hit, it will exit the for loop and draw the pixel.</p>



<p>The grayscale texture value is stored in s and generated by using the &amp; operator with X, Y, and Z and modding that by 3. This creates and effect that looks something like different types of windows. The result is also divided by Z to fade off the texturing in the distance.</p>

<p>To point the ray towards the light source both a and b are set to 1. This works great for a directional light source light the sun.</p>



<p>A fog value is stored in d by dividing the current Z value by w (99) which will is used to brighten the buildings in the distance. This same value of d is now guaranteed to be less than 1 signifying that we are testing for shadow as mentioned earlier.</p>



<pre><code>X += a
Y -= b</code></pre>



<p>Each component is updated to move the ray end point. The X and Y part is controlled by a and b respectively. The Z part always moves forward by 1, since the directional light is also in the direction of the camera it never needs to change.</p>



<h2>Drawing Each Pixel</h2>



<p>Each pixel is finally drawn using a simple calculation of i to get the X and Y coordinates. The brightness is controlled by reducing the size of the pixel which is a very small way to create grayscale images one pixel at a time.</p>



<pre><code>c.getContext`2d`.fillRect(i%w, i/w|0, 1 - d*Z/w + s, 1)</code></pre>



<p>There are several values that are combined to control the final grayscale value. A value of 1 here would be a black pixel and so we will be subtracting from 1 to create the image.</p>

<p>The fog value d gets multiplied by the current distance Z/w, which is how the shadows are created. If the ray is not in shadow, than it must have traveled the maximum distance of w so Z/w will be 1. Conversely if it is in shadow, than Z will be less that w causing that area to be darker. This actually creates a type of ambient occlusion because the closer the light blocking object, the darker the shadow.</p>

<p>Finally we add s to the result which is the texture of the buildings we calculated earlier. You an see how both of those important components combine to create a realistic looking scene.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, that’s the entire program! This tiny 256-byte raycasting engine and city generator demonstrates how much can be achieved with minimal code. I hope you enjoyed this deep dive into the inner workings of “City In A Bottle.”</p>



<h2>Continued Learning</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=91532">This demo was entered into the Revision 2022 demo party and is available on Pouet.</a> It did not rank highly at the time because it was entered in the wrong category (oops) but I believe it stands as one of the most impressive 256 byte JavaScript demos out there.</p>



<p>Also, we have continued expanding this concept on Shadertoy where I worked with <a href="https://x.com/XorDev">Xor </a>and a few other coders to create a 256 byte shader that perfectly recreates the JavaScript version. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7dccRj">It’s kind of amazing to see it run in HD at 60fps, check it out!</a></p>

<p>Lastly, <a href="https://x.com/DanielDarabos">Daniel Darabos</a> made an interactive tool on observable that allows you to play with different aspects of the program in real time! – <a href="https://observablehq.com/@darabos/decoding-a-city-in-a-bottle">Decoding A City In A Bottle</a></p>



<h2>Wrap Up</h2>



<p>Thank you for following along this epic writeup. If you want to explore more, <a href="https://www.dwitter.net/d/25311">feel free to remix the code on Dwitter</a> or just play around with it on CapJS. I’m always excited to see the creative variations and improvements that the community comes up with.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more tiny cities and other projects! I’ll leave you with this cool little isometric rendering system I’ve been working on and shared recently. It works in a similar way to get the building heights and textures but without using raycasting.</p>





<p>Keep coding, keep experimenting, and let’s continue to push the boundaries of what we can do with tiny code! <a href="https://x.com/KilledByAPixel">Follow me on twitter more coding magic and other crazy experiments.</a></p>

If you're too specific about the position, you get too few quality candidates. If you keep it too broad, you get swamped with applicants that you don't know what to do. I don't even want to get in people faking their jobs/positions/duties/diplomas etc. Also, job posting and application management platforms are usually quiet expensive. As a bonus: if you are a startup, hiring wrong people will most likely kill your company. The best method that works as per my opinion is working with an agency to give you better first results however again nothing comes for free.</p><p>My view as job seeker: There are million companies and million posts. (especially with remote positions). LinkedIn is the platform that you can find more coverage yes however it doesn't usually represent the reality about the job/market. As first step, you start with the companies you like/know with being a bit more selective on the jobs but after some point you basically apply all somewhat related jobs and then want to see what happens after. (which only increase the complexity of the problem)</p><p>I am thinking to come up with a solution however I am not sure if there is a solution.</p><p>I guess my question here is that what else that you have experienced that worked/not worked.
