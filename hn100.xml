<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand -Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In the spirit of Feynman's immortal words, the goal of this project is to better understand the internals of databases by
implementing a relational database management system (RDBMS) (sqlite clone) from scratch.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project was motivated by a desire to: 1) understand databases more deeply and 2) work on a fun project. These dual
goals led to a:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>relatively simple code base</li>
<li>relatively complete RDBMS implementation</li>
<li>written in pure python
<ul dir="auto">
<li>No build step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zero configuration
<ul dir="auto">
<li>configuration can be overriden</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This makes the learndb codebase great for tinkering with. But the product has some key limitations that means it
shouldn't be used as an actual storage solution.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h3>
<p dir="auto">Learndb supports the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>it has a rich sql (learndb-sql) with support for <code>select, from, where, group by, having, limit, order by</code></li>
<li>custom lexer and parser built using <a href="https://github.com/lark-parser/lark"><code>lark</code></a></li>
<li>at a high-level, there is an engine that can accept some SQL statements. These statements expresses operations on a
database (a collection of tables which contain data)</li>
<li>allows users/agents to connect to RDBMS in multiple ways:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>REPL</li>
<li>importing python module</li>
<li>passing a file of commands to the engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>on-disk btree implementation as backing data structure</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>HP all-in-one printer owners, upset that their devices wouldn't scan or fax when low on ink, were handed a partial win in a northern California court this week after a judge denied HP's motion to dismiss their suit.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argued in their amended class action <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/11/freund-hp-amended-complaint.pdf" rel="nofollow">complaint</a> [PDF] that HP withheld vital information by including software in its all-in-one printer/scanner/fax machines that disabled non-printing functions when out of ink and not telling buyers that was the case.</p>
<p>"It is well-documented that ink is not required in order to scan or to fax a document, and it is certainly possible to manufacture an All-in-One printer that scans or faxes when the device is out of ink," the plaintiffs argued in their complaint. The amended complaint was filed in February this year after US federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman dismissed the suit on the grounds that it hadn't properly stated a claim.</p>

    

<p>Armed with their amended complaint, lawyers for San Francsican Gary Freund and Minneapolis resident Wayne McMath have succeeded at not only making relevant claims, but also surviving an attempt by HP to have the entire case dismissed for a second time.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>In the amended complaint, Freund and McMath's lawyers argue that HP's move to disable devices that were low on ink was intentional, citing HP's own comments from a support forum post in which an HP support agent told a user complaining of similar issues that their "HP printer is designed in such a way that with the empty cartridge or without the cartridge [the] printer will not function."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"At this stage, the message board post amounts to a factual allegation that bolster plaintiffs' allegations that HP designed its printers to disable certain functions when their ink is depleted," Judge Freeman said in her <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/11/freund-hp-judge-order.pdf" rel="nofollow">order</a> [PDF] handed down yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/13/hp_euconsumers_settlement_dynamic_security_printers_third_party_supplies/">HP pays $1.3m to settle dispute over printer security chip</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/23/hp_inc_q4_2022/">HP Inc to lay off up to 6,000 staff, cut costs by $1.4 billion</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/28/hp_ink_officejet_drm/">Florida man might just stick it to HP for injecting sneaky DRM update into his printers that rejected non-HP ink</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/12/hp_free_printing/">HP: That print-free-for-life deal we promised you? Well, now it's pay-per-month to continue using your printer ink</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Judge Freeman found the plaintiffs had "adequately" described "the alleged defect and HP's knowledge of that defect," they had adequately pleaded that HP had a duty to disclose the restrictions, and that the defect occurred within the warranty period since the devices were shipped with ink cartridge limitations for non-printing features.</p>
<p>Judge Freeman allowed other claims to stand as well, only dismissing the plaintiffs' request for equitable restitution under the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Otherwise, Freeman said, "these allegations are sufficient" to allow the case to proceed.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>This isn't the first time HP has been taken to court over claims it improperly locked printers down. In 2022 the IT giant settled a European lawsuit for $1.35 million alleging it used security chips and DRM-like software to prevent any third-party cartridges from functioning in HP printers. The US corporation has dealt with similar cases in Australia and America, which were settled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP hasn't responded to our questions about the latest lawsuit.</p>
<p>Canon, another printer manufacturer that sells all-in-one devices, was <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/19/canon_lawsuit_ink/">sued</a> in 2021 for the exact same reasons as Freund and McMath's suit against HP - that Canon all-in-ones disabled non-printing functions when ink was low. That case was settled late last year for an undisclosed sum. ®</p>

The charges appeared to arise from a March 12 Instagram post in which Glukhovsky invoked the city of Mariupol, which stood for months as a focal point of Ukrainian resistance, and called on readers to "recognize that this is a real war against an entire nation and stop it!"</p><p>Glukhovsky was found guilty of posting text and video messages on his social media channels accusing Russian soldiers of committing crimes in Ukraine.

"Ukraine has been resisting Putin's aggression for a year now," he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpDV6gfMIiG/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpDV6gfMIiG/">wrote in February</a>. "As it was a year ago, I am quite convinced that this war is just as destructive for Russia and our people as it is lethal and destructive for the people of Ukraine I love.</p><p>"I feel terribly sorry for all the human lives lost in this monstrous unjust war by a tyrant who just wanted to preserve power and make history. I still demand from the Russian authorities to immediately stop this senseless and futile anti-national war and to withdraw troops from the territory of Ukraine."</p><p>Glukhovsky has also paid tribute to other victims of Russia's crackdown on dissent, including theater director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr2jh1Uscnj/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr2jh1Uscnj/">Evgeniya Berkovich</a> and opposition leaders <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClTgsu1tEm_/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/ClTgsu1tEm_/">Ilya Yashin</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtD_eC_sfUM/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtD_eC_sfUM/">Alexei Navalny</a>.</p><p>Glukhovsky became known to gamers through the FPS based on his novel <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/metro-2033-redux-review/" target="_blank">Metro 2033</a>, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and released in 2010.

<p>It has been a bit of a tumultuous summer for the project, but now things are returning to normalcy.  For those who somehow missed it, the Dolphin on Steam project <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/07/20/what-happened-to-dolphin-on-steam/">has ceased</a> after contact between Valve and Nintendo.  Though we disagree with their stance and decision, we respect Valve's right to impose whatever restrictions they want within their private storefront. Please read the full article for details.</p>


<p>Fortunately, all that means is that nothing is going to change. We're going to continue working hard to improve Dolphin and make it the best emulator it can be. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, we hope you enjoy this Dolphin Progress Report!</p>

<p>GPU drivers for Android devices have come a long way from the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2013/09/26/dolphin-emulator-and-opengl-drivers-hall-fameshame/">nightmare they once were</a>, but they still lag behind their desktop counterparts in many ways. Missing features, performance problems, and plain old bugs are still plentiful on Android drivers. Furthermore, while drivers are improving over time, these improvements <a href="https://www.esper.io/blog/android-dessert-bites-14-gpu-driver-updates-3819534">rarely make their way to existing devices</a>, which is considerably worse than desktop. However, for Dolphin, Android GPU drivers are now at least good enough to <em>work</em> most of the time. There may be bugs or issues, but usually you'll get an image and the emulated title will function.</p>
<p>Emulators for newer consoles weren't so lucky, however, and Android drivers have been an intense pain point for them. This spurred <strong><a href="https://github.com/bylaws">ByLaws</a></strong> to take action and develop the library <a href="https://github.com/bylaws/libadrenotools">libadrenotools</a>, which lets apps temporarily switch out the system driver for a user-provided driver. libadrenotools has tremendously improved the experience of emulating newer consoles on Android devices, as not only does it allow loading of newer versions of official drivers, but it also allows the loading of <em>unofficial</em> open source drivers that are substantially better than their official counterparts. Specifically of note is Freedreno Vulkan, also known as Turnip.  It's a custom driver primarily for Adreno 600 GPUs (though support for Adreno 700 GPUs is in development as well) that is by far the most complete Vulkan driver available for Adreno.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/K0bin">K0bin</a></strong> saw all of the improvements that libadrenotools and Turnip granted other emulators and realized that Dolphin could take advantage of them too. With this change, libadrenotools is now integrated into Dolphin, allowing Android users to choose which Vulkan GPU drivers they prefer. While Android driver issues were not as critical for us, the Freedreno driver is a breath of fresh air.  Tons of Vulkan issues that have plagued our Adreno users are <em>gone</em> when using it.</p>


<p>If your GPU is among those supported, Turnip offers an opportunity to get a driver that's much closer to desktop quality.  However, we've only been talking about compatibility and bugs so far. How does Turnip compare to the official drivers in performance? Well, performance can be better, but it isn't always going to be.  Sometimes the more complete implementation of features allows Dolphin to go faster than other drivers, sometimes the fact it's able to emulate things in a more complete manner means that the game might run a little slower.  And, of course, the driver might not implement all features optimally, causing some variations that are out of the control of Dolphin.</p>
<p>Using an older phone, we can compare the Turnip driver to the latest supported Adreno driver and compare performance.  We also compared to the Adreno OpenGL driver - as Turnip is for Vulkan only.  All tests were done at 1x internal resolution in order to test the raw efficiency of the driver to keep maximum performance.</p>

<p>The results vary quite a bit, with a different driver being faster for each game!  However, for the most part performance is pretty similar between the different backends with the main benefit being that Turnip mostly just works.  While there are the occasional bugs, much like with the <em>official</em> Adreno drivers, overall Turnip provides a more consistent experience.  And with it under active development, the problems we have seen are likely to get fixed.</p>

<p>There is nothing fundamentally Adreno-specific about loading custom drivers.  Unfortunately for users with other GPUs, there aren't any viable custom drivers at this time.  If custom drivers do show up for these devices, we'll be able to update Dolphin to load them.</p>

<p>When WiiConnect24 shut down so suddenly just over ten years ago in June of 2013, there was a thought among Dolphin developers that WiiConnect24 would never be emulated - at least in Dolphin.  For nearly 10 years, <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/12/21/dolphin-progress-report-september-october-november-2022/#50-17613-implement-missing-features-for-wiiconnect24-support-by-noahpistilli">that remained true</a>.  However, a lot of the core features of WiiConnect24 were still missing in Dolphin, and setting it up required use of third party tools to patch channels.</p>
<p>In the latest builds of Dolphin, users can now enable WiiConnect24 directly in Dolphin's GUI, allowing you to use the Forecast Channel, Nintendo Channel, and soon the News Channel and Everybody Votes Channel directly in the system menu without the need for patching channel files.  This is all thanks to <strong><a href="https://github.com/noahpistilli">Sketch</a></strong> (aka noahpistilli) who is both implementing critical features in Dolphin's Network/KD and reimplementing the servers which the channels themselves communicate with as the lead developer of <a href="https://www.wiilink24.com/">WiiLink</a>.</p>
<p>This marriage between the two sides of development has led to a WiiConnect24 revolution within Dolphin, and more features will be coming online in the future.</p>


<p>With Dolphin adding support for WiiLink, does this mean RiiConnect24 will not work in Dolphin?  Of course not!  The same methods used to patch channels with RiiConnect24 will continue to work in the latest versions of Dolphin.</p>
<p>Choosing between WiiLink and RiiConnect24 for a default service was not an easy task.  RiiConnect24 has been an invaluable part of the WiiConnect24 preservation scene and will continue to work in Dolphin.  However, with <strong><a href="https://github.com/noahpistilli">Sketch</a></strong> working on both the server side (WiiLink) and the client side (Dolphin), compatibility and stability is currently higher with WiiLink.  As well, there are some features of RiiConnect24 that use cIOS features that do not currently work in Dolphin that are handled without cIOSes in WiiLink.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that Dolphin's priority is to emulate <strong>WiiConnect24</strong> to the best of its ability.  Currently, <strong><a href="https://github.com/noahpistilli">Sketch</a></strong> is reimplementing WiiConnect24 features in a manner that would work alike to the original WiiConnect24 servers.  We are aware that some bugs/inaccuracies in Dolphin's implementation of Network/KD that, when fixed, will require changes from RiiConnect24 in order to maintain compatibility.</p>
<p>We also request that users who have used the RiiConnect24 VFF downloader delete any VFF files created by it,  as well as disable the downloader. The VFFs created by it are made to never expire, meaning new files will never be downloaded by Dolphin. To locate these, click <code>File -&gt; Open User Folder</code> and then navigate to <code>Wii/title/00010002/484146xx/data</code> for the Forecast Channel and <code>Wii/title/00010002/484147xx/data</code> for the News Channel, where <code>xx</code> is <code>45</code> for NTSC-U consoles, <code>50</code> for PAL and <code>4a</code> for Japanese. If you're having problems with WiiLink/RiiConnect24 on the latest builds and have used the VFF downloader in the past, that may be the source of your troubles.</p>
<p>Note for those who want to use an unmodified Nintendo Channel: <strong>Cheats must be enabled in order for the channel to work.</strong></p>

<p>If everyone is being honest, there probably isn't much point to this feature, at least right now.  The only game that supports the Disney Infinity Base on the Wii is <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Disney_Infinity">Disney Infinity</a>, possibly the crown jewel of the Disney Trio of Destruction.  There is no existing <em>desktop</em> computer that can run the game full speed given how Dolphin currently emulates the game.  For phones, the situation is even worse.</p>


<p>But, maybe some day, some AArch64 JIT improvement and/or some future phone will somehow emulate Disney Infinity at a playable framerate.  Whenever that happens, future Android users will be able to emulate the Infinity Base and get in game without the need for physical hardware.</p>

</p>

<p>After the release of the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/21/dolphin-progress-report-february-march-april-2023/#50-18920-rewrite-android-input-handling-by-josjuice">input handling rewrite</a> a few months ago, there have been a few growing pains.  A rather annoying one for many users was an issue causing trigger inputs from certain controllers to simply be ignored in the menu.  More frustratingly, you could actually <em>manually</em> add them if you knew your way around the advanced mapping options!</p>
<p>This turned out to be relatively easy to fix in the end, though.  The input handling rewrite brought a lot of code from the PC version of Dolphin to the Android version, including a piece of code that is designed to skip over button inputs in case a gamepad provided both a button input and an axis input for a trigger at the same time.  But the affected controllers on Android were doing something that the PC version of Dolphin had never ran into: each trigger provided <em>two</em> axis inputs. Because the code wasn't expecting this, both of the inputs were getting skipped by accident.  With the cause of the problem known, <strong><a href="https://github.com/JosJuice">JosJuice</a></strong> was able to change the code to let both inputs through.</p>
<p>Users that suffered from this regression should be able to configure their controllers directly in the GUI again in the latest Play Store release.</p>
<h4 id="50-19863-add-filesize-checks-to-check-nand-by-admiralcurtiss"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19863/">5.0-19863 - Add Filesize Checks to Check NAND</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong><a href="#50-19863-add-filesize-checks-to-check-nand-by-admiralcurtiss" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>With the Wii NAND coming more to the forefront with some of Dolphin's latest features, <em>Check NAND</em> has been seeing a lot more usage.  The long-story-short of it is that the Wii File System is <em>extremely</em> tempermental and prone to breaking, so back in the day <strong><a href="https://github.com/leoetlino">leoetlino</a></strong> created a feature that allowed Dolphin to check the Wii NAND for certain common problems and automatically fix them.</p>
<p>Check NAND was mostly a tool used to fix the NAND to get the Wii Shop and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Dragon_Quest_X:_Mezameshi_Itsutsu_no_Shuzoku_Online">Dragon Quest X</a> working - as even the slightest problem with the NAND would prevent them from booting.  However, it wasn't designed to fix everything, and it'll often say no problems found when in fact there are critical problems with the NAND.</p>
<p>Enter <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong>.  Having debugged an issue where a user's NAND was "overfilled" due to spurious files being placed in the NAND directory, they decided that it was time to expand the scope of Check NAND a bit more.  In the latest versions of Dolphin, Check NAND will now make sure that the NAND size is within the bounds of the Wii NAND.</p>


<p>On a modern computer with terabytes of storage, you might think that the Wii NAND being limited to just 512MB is a bit archaic and that Dolphin should just allow any NAND size.  And we technically do - you can keep adding things to the NAND even if it is over that maximum size.  Unfortunately, the Wii System Menu and many games have checks to make sure that the NAND isn't getting close to full.  Even if we tell the Wii it has way more NAND space, it is <em>hardcoded</em> to use exactly 512MB, with certain portions of it being reserved.</p>
<p>In the past, Dolphin has tried to lie to the emulated Wii about the size of installed files, saying that they were one block no matter how big they were, but this just caused other problems and we ran into other limitations even in situations where that hack did seem to help.  So for now, we're handling things as accurately as possible in order to make sure users don't jeopardize their Wii Save Data.</p>
<p>It's possible there is some magic combination of hacks that could <em>maybe</em> trick the emulated Wii into supporting more/bigger files, but so far we haven't found it.  And considering how many people run into the Wii's paltry NAND size limits, a hack like this wouldn't see much resistance into being merged as an option.</p>
<h4 id="50-19716-support-accurate-ntscpal-color-spaces-by-filoppi"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19716/">5.0-19716 - Support Accurate NTSC/PAL Color Spaces</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/Filoppi">Filoppi</a></strong><a href="#50-19716-support-accurate-ntscpal-color-spaces-by-filoppi" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The GameCube and Wii were designed with analog CRT televisions in mind. In this era, "close enough" was the rule of the day. For example, each region had their own slightly different color spaces and gamma targets. Games almost never accounted for these differences, so how each game would appear varied slightly from region to region! To emulate this, Filoppi (helped by <a href="https://github.com/EndlesslyFlowering">Lilium</a>) has implemented a suit of color space and gamma correction settings.</p>
<p>Dolphin's color correction provides several color space options. Using these profiles, you can now set Dolphin to match the colour space of any given region and either make it match how you remember it in your region, or just see how your game would look in an entirely different region!</p>


<p>Something a little more impactful from these changes is <em>gamma correction</em>.  Most GameCube games (and some Wii games) targeted a gamma value of roughly 2.35.  Modern televisions and monitors normally use a value of 2.2, which can result in these games looking a tiny bit brighter than they would have (by default) on hardware of the day.</p>


<p>While it's possible for users to adjust their monitor's settings, and <em>some</em> games come with built-in gamma correction, <strong><a href="https://github.com/Filoppi">Filoppi</a></strong> added gamma correction to the color space features within Dolphin's settings in order to streamline the experience.</p>
<p>Note that these settings and features have not been ported to the Android version of Dolphin yet, however that is <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/pull/12095">in progress</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-body="true" data-testid="post-body"><p>So I stumbled a few weeks ago on <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this video<!-- --></a> about the world's smallest conlang and I've been thinking about it ever since.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/91c54129-9425-4695-bd68-6f65d83ae793/maxresdefault.jpeg"></a></p>
<!-- --><p><i>(You will probably have the idea more than fully by the ten minute mark.)<!-- --></i></p>
<!-- --><p>This fascinated me. I think languages are really interesting but I'm also really <!-- --><i>bad<!-- --></i> at them. I cannot hack the memorization. I've mostly avoided conlangs (that's Constructed Languages, like Esperanto or Klingon) because like, oh no, now there's <!-- --><i>even more languages<!-- --></i> for me to fail at memorizing. So like, a language so minimal you can almost learn it by <!-- --><i>accident<!-- --></i>, suddenly my ears perk up.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Toki pona is <!-- --><i>really interesting<!-- --></i>, on a lot of different axes. It's a thought experiment in Taoist philosophy that turns out to be actually, practically useful. It's Esperanto But It Might Actually Work This Time¹. It has NLP implications— it's a human language which feels natural to speak yet has such a deeply logical structure it seems nearly custom-designed for simple computer programs to read and write it². Beyond all this it's simply beautiful as an intellectual object—&nbsp;nearly every decision it makes feels deeply right. It solves a seemingly insoluble problem³ and does it with a sense of effortlessness and an <!-- --><a href="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/747b4517-a3cf-438b-a6a0-07ad9e6883fd/Toki_pona.svg.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">implied "LOL"<!-- --></a> at every step.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>So what toki pona is. Toki pona is a language designed around the idea of being <!-- --><i>as simple as it is possible for a language to be<!-- --></i>. It has 120 words in its original form (now, at the twenty year mark, up to 123), but you can form a lot of interesting sentences with only around twenty or thirty (I know this because this is roughly the size of my current tok vocabulary). <!-- --><a href="https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The whole tok-&gt;en dictionary fits on seventeen printed pages<!-- --></a>⁴. There are no conjugations or tenses to memorize. There are no <!-- --><i>parts of speech<!-- --></i>, generally: almost every single word can be used as almost any part of speech, drop a pronoun or a preposition⁵ in the right place and it becomes a verb, drop a verb in the right place and it becomes an adjective. There are almost no ambiguities in sentence structure; I've only found one significant one so far (using "of" [<!-- --><tt>pi<!-- --></tt>] twice in the same clause) and the community deals with this by just agreeing not to do that. There's in one sense quite a lot of ambiguity in the vocabulary but in another sense there's none; for example <!-- --><tt>nena<!-- --></tt> is listed in the dictionary as meaning <!-- --><i>hill, mountain, button, bump, nose<!-- --></i>, but the official ideology of Toki Pona is that this is not a word with five definitions, it is <!-- --><i>a word with exactly one definition, that being the concept encompassing all five of hills, mountains, buttons, bumps, and noses<!-- --></i>. Toki pona words are not ambiguous, they're just <!-- --><i>broad<!-- --></i>. I will now teach you enough toki pona to understand most sentences (assuming you consult the <!-- --><a href="https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dictionary<!-- --></a> as you go) in a paragraph shorter than this one:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Every sentence has an "verb" or action clause. Most sentences also have a subject clause, which goes before the verb separated by "<!-- --><tt>li<!-- --></tt>". Some sentences also have an "object" or target clause, which goes after the verb clause separated by "<!-- --><tt>e<!-- --></tt>". So "[subject] <!-- --><tt>li<!-- --></tt> [verb] <!-- --><tt>e<!-- --></tt> [object]". All three clauses are any number of words, the first word is the noun (or verb) and the rest are adjectives (or adverbs). If the first word in a sentence is <!-- --><tt>mi<!-- --></tt> or <!-- --><tt>sina<!-- --></tt> you can omit the <!-- -->li in that case <!-- --><i>only<!-- --></i>. There is no "is", a sentence like "a flower is red" is just "[a plant] <!-- --><tt>li<!-- --></tt> [red]" because there are no parts of speech and adjectives are verbs. Pronounce everything the way you would in English except "j" sounds like "y". If you see "<!-- --><tt>tawa<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>lon<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>tan<!-- --></tt>" or "<!-- --><tt>kepeken<!-- --></tt>" in adjective/adverb position that's a preposition, so treat whatever comes after it as a fourth clause. "<!-- --><tt>a<!-- --></tt>" and "<!-- --><tt>n<!-- --></tt>" are interjections and can go anywhere in a sentence. If you see "<!-- --><tt>o<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>pi<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>la<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>taso<!-- --></tt>, "<!-- --><tt>anu<!-- --></tt>" or "<!-- --><tt>en<!-- --></tt>", then you've found one of the few special words (particles) and you should probably either read the <!-- --><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">book<!-- --></a> or watch the <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIjft6ja7DM70MkOMu56c4Grku7LXR61" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jan Misali instructional videos<!-- --></a> on YouTube.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>That's like… almost it!⁶ Watch one youtube video, or read a half page of grammar summary and keep the dictionary open on your phone, and you're basically ready to jump into conversations. (You'll need those last six particles to make nuanced sentences, but sentences do not have to be nuanced.) In my own case I watched the Langfocus video linked at the top and then lazily over the next week watched the <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLn6LC1RpAo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jan Misali overview<!-- --></a> and two of their instructional videos then read a few chapters of the book, and was already able to construct a full paragraph and be understood by another person:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p><tt>o! mi sona e toki pona. mi lukin sona e toki mute... taso mi toki ike e toki ale. toki mute li jo e nimi mute. nimi mute li pona ala tawa mi. toki pona li pona e mi tan ni. toki pona li jo nimi lili. nimi lili li pona e me :)<!-- --></tt></p>

<!-- --><li>When the joke misfired, I was able to successfully toss off an entire complex paragraph rapidly without really thinking about it.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>Probably a sign I Am Getting It more significant than anything else: I realized that talking on the Discord I was dropping toki pona words into my English sentences <!-- --><i>solely because the toki pona word seemed to me to communicate a concept I wanted to communicate more precisely than any particular English word<!-- --></i>.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ul>
<!-- --><p>(That last one actually kind of excited me when I realized, after the fact, that it had been happening for several days before I noticed it.)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>All of the above happened on the toki pona Discord, which seems to be the largest and healthiest outpost of toki pona community online⁸ and, I assume therefore, the world. Here's my toki pona joke; you'll notice that I begin by preemptively apologizing for it, but by the end it becomes clear I was, at that moment anyway, apparently completely on the Discord's level:⁹<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/d5366ff6-ae17-4c70-a900-a02ac307f108/tokipona_conversation.png"></p><!-- --><hr>
<!-- --><p><b>Footnotes<!-- --></b></p><!-- --><p>¹ Esperanto was meant to be an auxillary language simple enough the entire world could learn it as a second language. But it does not seem to me to be actually all that simple to learn (the verb tenses may be free of exceptions, but there are still like six of them) and it seems hard to convince myself to study it when I could put that effort toward a more widespread language. Toki Pona on the other hand is a language simple enough <!-- --><i>the entire world actually could learn it<!-- --></i>, had it reason to, and the buy-in cost in time is a lot lower. Meanwhile Toki Pona just seems to get certain international-accessibility things <!-- --><i>right<!-- --></i>, probably due to the advantage of having over a century of conlang practice <!-- --><i>largely inspired by Esperanto<!-- --></i> to draw from. The difference that's most interesting to me, but which I'm also least qualified to evaluate, is that the Toki Pona author had some basic familiarity with, and gave Toki Pona input from, east Asian languages. Both Toki Pona and Esperanto draw roots from a variety of languages but in Esperanto's case this winds up being mostly European languages, mostly Italian, whereas Toki Pona has Mandarin and Cantonese in its mix. Both languages were intended to have a minimal, universal phonology but Esperanto's is not very universal at all and has some consonant sounds that are going to be be totally unfamiliar unless you speak Polish or a language related to Polish. Toki Pona's phonology is <!-- --><i>actually<!-- --></i> minimal-- it has the letters in the sentence "<!-- --><tt>mi jan pi ko suwi lete<!-- --></tt>" and <!-- --><i>nothing else<!-- --></i> and the legal syllabary is basically hiragana without the combination syllables. Now, what I don't know is whether any of this <!-- --><i>actually helps<!-- --></i> speakers of Asian languages in practice or if it just makes surface choices that make it seem that way to a westerner like me. In practice if you find a toki pona speaker their native language is almost certainly English, so there doesn't seem to have been a great deal of testing as to how learnable it is to people from varied regions.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>² I kept imagining toki pona as being like LLVM IR for human languages or something.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>³ Designing an actually learnable, universal(?) international auxillary language.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁴ By which I mean if you print the unofficial web version it's 17 pages long. But you can fit it in sixteen if you remove the web-specific introductory paragraph, the "joke word" <!-- --><tt>kijetesantakalu<!-- --></tt>, and the web footer with the "trans rights now!" banner in it.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁵ There's an awkward nuance in the specific case of prepositions: if you drop a preposition into verb position it still winds up "behaving like" a preposition, it's just that the preposition describes an action. It's probably more accurate to say that the <!-- --><i>preposition phrase<!-- --></i> becomes a verb rather than the preposition itself. So for example "<!-- --><tt>mi tawa kalama<!-- --></tt>" means "I went toward the sound" [<!-- --><tt>kamala<!-- --></tt> is a noun and the object of the preposition] not "I went loudly" [as it would be if <!-- --><tt>kamala<!-- --></tt> were an adverb modifying <!-- --><tt>tawa<!-- --></tt> as a verb]. Going into detail on this because I don't want to mislead anyone but "you can form a sentence using an unmodified preposition as a verb" is such a fun fact I wanted to include it.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁶ I guess I could say "what I'm calling 'clauses' are called 'word groups' in official sources; word groups are always separated by a particle or preposition" but I'm not sure that's interesting unless you're a linguist.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁷ There's a lot of repetition in this paragraph of both kinds that show what's cool about toki pona and what's kinda impractical about it. Cool, it has some sentences where a single word shows up twice conveying two different clear things based only on where it is in the sentence, like "<!-- --><tt>mi toki ike e toki ale<!-- --></tt>" where <!-- --><tt>toki<!-- --></tt> is a verb ("I speak") the first time and a noun ("language") the second. Less cool, because so much of the meaning of the hyper-versatile toki pona words is based on context, you sometimes wind up having to include multiple sentences saying nearly the same thing just to make sure the reader selects the correct context. I may have overdone it here.<!-- --></p>

<p dir="auto">ChatGPT has grown explosively in popularity as we all know now. Business users across the globe often tap into the public service to work more productively or act as a creative assistant.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, ChatGPT risks exposing confidential intellectual property. One option is to block corporate access to ChatGPT, but people always find workarounds. This also limits the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT and reduces employee productivity and their work experience.</p>
<p dir="auto">Azure ChatGPT is our enterprise option. This is the exact same service but offered as your private ChatGPT.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benefits are:</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Private:</strong> Built-in guarantees around the privacy of your data and fully isolated from those operated by OpenAI.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Controlled:</strong> Network traffic can be fully isolated to your network and other enterprise grade security controls are built in.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3. Value:</strong> Deliver added business value with your own internal data sources (plug and play) or use plug-ins to integrate with your internal services (e.g., ServiceNow, etc).</p>
<p dir="auto">We've built a Solution Accelerator to empower your workforce with Azure ChatGPT.</p>

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>In this short essay, written for a symposium in the San Diego Law Review, Professor Daniel Solove examines the nothing to hide argument.  When asked about government surveillance and data mining, many people respond by declaring: "I've got nothing to hide."  According to the nothing to hide argument, there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate justification to claim that it remain private.  The nothing to hide argument and its variants are quite prevalent, and thus are worth addressing.  In this essay, Solove critiques the nothing to hide argument and exposes its faulty underpinnings. </p>

      “High inflation of the past 2+ years has done lots of economic damage,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Markzandi/status/1689626766875254786" target="_blank">post on X</a>, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

      Most of that increase in spending is driven by housing costs, which have surged, Zandi told CNN in an email on Friday. He added that families are also spending more at the grocery store; on buying, maintaining and insuring vehicles and on recreational services like cable.

<p>When praising your child for a job well done, recognize the effort they put in instead of their natual ability. </p>
<p>Why? When students think they are born with a particular skill, they are less likely to put in additional effort. They practise less, study less, and try less. </p>
<p>Instead of recognizing students for being naturally gifted, focus on offering praise for the effort they put in to reach their goals. Praise can be an extremely important factor in a student’s growth. It is used to motivate, encourage and inspire children.</p>
<h2>Avoiding Failure</h2>
<p>Too much praise can also work the opposite way.  If children are consistently praised for something that they essentially have no control over, they will feel powerless and unable to find a solution when they don’t succeed.  This can lead to <a href="https://www.oxfordlearning.com/the-role-of-failure-in-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fear of failure,</a> which damages self-confidence. Instead of saying, “you are so smart,” try “you worked really hard. Awesome job!”</p>
<h2>Researching Success &amp; Failure</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://socialpsychonline.com/2016/07/psychology-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one study</a>,  psychologists gave 5th graders two separate tests: in the first test, students were either praised for being really smart or praised for their hard work. In the second test, students experienced a setback. The researchers noted that students who received praise for their intelligence took the setback negatively. The students who were praised for their effort were more likely to take the test home to practise working on the questions.</p>
<h2>Two Different Mindsets</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/carol-dwecks-attitude/">Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck</a>‘s&nbsp;research on effort and success found that people tend to have one of two different mindsets when it comes to ability— either a <strong>fixed</strong> or a <strong>growth </strong>mindset.</p>
<p>People with a a <strong>fixed mindset </strong>believe that you are born with natural talents and abilities or not.</p>
<p>People with a <strong>growth mindset</strong> believe that persistence, effort, determination, and practice are the keys to overcoming any obstacle. Check out these tips to help students <a href="https://www.oxfordlearning.com/growth-mindset-tips-for-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">develop a growth mindset</a>.</p>
<h3>2 Ideas to Praise Effort Effectively:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Praise Process, Not The Outcome:  Praising students for working hard on a project, or putting aside time every night to study for a test helps students understand the connection between the effort they put in and the results that they get. When a child comes home excited with a great mark, say, “you deserve it! You worked really hard for that mark.” Praise the entire process including concentration, self-correction, and strategies used.</li>
<li>Praise Specifically and Sincerely. Children love attention and feedback. However, children can recognize insincere praise. It can be easy to praise a child simply to boost their self-esteem. Be <a href="https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/social/how-to-praise-your-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as specific as possible</a> to make the praise meaningful to the child.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Praising for Success</h2>
<p>Praising effort rather than skills or natural ability helps students of all ages learn that the work they apply leads to the results they want. Skills such as perseverance, dedication, and determination help students learn to take risks, learn from their mistakes, and move on from setbacks. </p>

              <p>Back in my 20s, I used to hang out with trust fund kids. They told me about the paid internships their parents lined up for them. They bragged about taking long lunches and shopping on the clock. One chick laughed about her firm accidentally sending her three checks after her last day.</p><p>She tried to return the money.</p><p>"Keep it," they said.</p><p>Even my non-rich friends found ways to slack off. I had friends who managed to sneak back to their apartments for sex. I've worked at bars where the bartenders and servers snorted coke in the bathroom.</p><p>It made them <em>more </em>productive.</p><p>It made them smile.</p><p>These days, I work at a university. I have bosses making $200,000 a year. Do you know what we've caught them doing at the office? Watching soccer games. Taking selfies. Holding wine tastings. Zooming with family. Reading for edification. Holding meetings that were more like social gatherings.</p><p>David Graeber's essay on <a href="https://www.atlasofplaces.com/essays/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs/?ref=okdoomer.io">bullshit jobs</a> blew the myth of office productivity wide open a few years ago. The elite have been promising us shorter work weeks for about a hundred years. We have the technology. As we speak, they're bragging about their new AI minions.</p><p>The vast majority of us know what it's like to work an office job. It's full of bullshit errands that don't matter. It's full of distractions. A lot of that gets filed under "office culture." A lot of us finish our core duties in a few hours. We spend the rest of the day looking busy so we don't get fired. At the other end of the spectrum, some office workers can't ever get their real work done because of all the pointless interruptions they have to put up with. </p><p>Before the pandemic, the internet was filled with stories about the evils of office work. It was bad for your productivity. It was bad for your creativity. It was bad for your health. They were trying to sell us treadmill desks.</p><p>Remember all that?</p><p>Now everything has changed. If you work from home, apparently you're a lazy bum who wastes company time by snacking, playing video games, watching Netflix, shopping, hanging out with your friends, drinking, spending time with your family, or having sex. You're an awful person.</p><p>How dare you cook a healthy lunch at home. How dare you go for a walk in the middle of the day to clear your head. How dare you take a short nap to regain your focus. Didn't you know that an epic commute is actually good for your mental health? Sitting in a cubicle is <em>great </em>for your heart.</p><p>So, what's really going on here?</p><p><strong>It’s about real estate.</strong></p><p>That's it.</p><p>There's an office real estate <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/500-billion-office-real-estate-221017310.html?ref=okdoomer.io">apocalypse</a> unfolding. Corporate landlords currently hold <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1174938708/commercial-real-estate-property-offices-work-from-home-remote-work?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">$1.2 trillion in loans</a> on office towers all over the country. In some cases, these are the same assholes who've been buying up all the houses and driving up prices on residential real estate, too.</p><p>They were greedy, and dumb.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, these landlords did something even dumber. As <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a970a7f3-e493-43fd-ac11-afe40a73fbb7?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">The Financial Times</a></em> states, they took advantage of “nearly free money” from the Federal Reserve to buy up “trophy office buildings.” Now that everyone is embracing remote work, they can’t lease that office space to anyone. They have a bunch of zombie office towers.</p><p>They can’t do anything with them.</p><p>Some of these commercial real estate owners are trying to turn their empty buildings into apartments and restaurants, but it’s an expensive overhaul. Not every zombie office building makes a great apartment.</p><p>They’re stuck.</p><p>Anywhere from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/empty-office-buildings-downtown-what-happened-rcna77443?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">12 to 20 percent</a> of office space remains vacant. It’s worse than the 2008 recession. If these landlords can’t find a way to make money off their corporate real estate soon, they’re going to start defaulting on their loans. The landlords will go bankrupt, and banks will wind up with giant office towers they can’t sell. More than $1 trillion will go <em>poof</em>.</p><p>The Federal Reserve’s misguided war on inflation has made everything even worse over the last couple of years. By raising interest rates, they’ve motivated <em>more </em>companies to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/06/1174468821/companies-are-defaulting-on-loan-payments-for-unused-office-buildings?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">ditch their office leases</a>. Now commercial real estate is in a death spiral that could tank the economy (again).</p><p>There’s more bad news.</p><p>Major cities have spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/07/upshot/downtown-office-vulnerable-even-before-covid.html?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">the last several decades</a> catering to these corporate landlords. Now their entire downtowns rely on workers for commerce. We’re talking about all those restaurants and coffee shops that serve breakfast and lunch to white-collar workers, and all the bars where people used to go and complain about work before they spent an hour commuting home.</p><p>These cities also depend on property taxes from overpriced commercial real estate. When nobody wants those buildings, their value plummets. New York alone has lost <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3695581/after-the-remote-work-rush-vacant-offices-and-empty-downtowns.html?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">$453 billion</a> in office real estate. Across the U.S., office buildings have shed anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of their value.</p><p>So, we have a problem.</p><p>Once again, the elite have gotten themselves into big trouble. They want the rest of us to bail them out. If they don't want our tax money, they want us to give up our freedom and autonomy. They want us to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of capitalism to protect their fortunes.</p><p>They don't care how productive we are. They don't care how creative we are. They sure as hell don't care about our health.</p><p>It's all a bunch of lies.</p><p>They only care about one thing, forcing warm bodies back into office buildings to stop the commercial real estate apocalypse.</p><p>That's it.</p>

<p>This is one doctor’s experience as an explainer to friends, family and anyone who has a bicuspid aortic valve or who, for whatever reason, has developed Aortic Stenosis.</p>



<p><strong>Early days</strong></p>



<p>I was born half way through 1967. My mother was barely 27. She had qualified as a teacher before embarking on a family and was an older mum compared to many of her peers at that time. I was her first. As the world looked up to the stars, then still anticipating man walking on the moon, my mother was told that “I would never be an astronaut”. Her beautiful baby had a heart murmur – some sort of defect which meant, according to the doctors, that I would never be fit enough to get into space.</p>



<p><strong>Heart murmurs</strong></p>



<p>In truth, that limitation of my career trajectory may have been quite unnecessary. A heart murmur is merely the noise blood makes flowing through the heart. It’s an audible ripple from the eddies  blood makes as it’s being pumped from one chamber of the heart to the next, and out to the body. Murmurs may signify there’s ‘a problem’ with the heart. Normally, blood flows through the heart almost silently. Doctors can hear the valves opening and closing and hopefully not much else. Many heart murmurs, heard soon after birth, disappear with age and all babies should be re-examined at 6-8 weeks of age to see if they’ve gone. Many are just innocent ‘flow’ murmurs and nowadays would be investigated further if they persist. Some can be due to physiological changes that occur soon after birth and these go within days, others can be due to major heart abnormalities, some of which, if it weren’t for modern medicine, wouldn’t be compatible with life, though usually the blue colour of the baby makes that fairly obvious. I was pink, – albeit whingy – and my problem was not, at that point, serious.</p>



<p>In 1967 there wasn’t the technology for readily seeing inside the heart. X-rays with dye might show some, but not all abnormalities. Heart murmurs in otherwise pink and feeding babies were deemed not to be overly important. My mother just had to accept that, if she had ever had ambitions for me to become an astronaut, they were not to be. I clearly remember her telling me several times that, I wouldn’t be able to become an astronaut, as if I was missing a limb!</p>



<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>



<p>Eighteen years later she wasn’t too disappointed though to see me get into medical school and during the undergraduate course grab an opportunity to go and work with the Royal Flying Doctor Service in outback Australia. The Australian visa necessary for such an adventure required a full medical with my university GP. He was clinically astute. He heard the murmur, still there at the ripe old age of 21, predicted it was due to a congenital abnormality called a bicuspid aortic valve and referred me to a favourite lecturer, Professor David Wood, for confirmation.</p>



<p>By the mid-1980s the National Health Service in the UK had echocardiography. Using this ultrasound wizardry Prof. Wood confirmed a bicuspid aortic valve. By this time, I’d looked the condition up in the hefty pathology tome I owned. It affects 1% of the population and is hereditary in a small proportion, so if you have it, ensure your siblings and children are screened for it, and your parents, if they’re still around, when you discover it. It doesn’t normally impact on life until the fifth or sixth decade, and the impact then, if you’re unlucky, can be sudden and final, though for many they get warning symptoms that need good clinicians to note and diagnose.</p>



<p><strong>What is it and what does it matter?</strong></p>



<p>A normal aortic valve looks, if you’re looking down on it, like the Mercedes symbol. There are three flaps to it that open and close with every heartbeat.  A bit like a three petalled flower, opening and closing with daylight, but a lot faster! A bicuspid valve only has two flaps, something like a circle with a line across it. The line is just the gap though through which blood flows. It’s not dissimilar to a goldfish opening and closing its mouth.</p>

<p>The trouble with only two flaps is they have to do the work of three and over time they wear faster. They get calcified, and stiff and they restrict the flow of blood from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta. That restriction is called Aortic Stenosis. From here it should flow freely to the rest of the body. Restricting heart flow is never good. The muscle of the left ventricle gets beefed up to try and overcome the restriction and that makes it vulnerable to problems with its electrical system. Left ventricular muscle beefing up is called hypertrophy. It’s a process that takes time, years if not decades, and if unchecked it is a cause of many sudden deaths from abnormalities in electrical conduction and then rapid disorganised contraction of the heart muscle. That ain’t good! In truth, it’s so bad it leads to collapse and often a quick demise.</p>

<p>If that mode of death doesn’t get the hapless folk with an undiagnosed bicuspid valve the widening of the aorta, the big blood vessel that comes out of the heart and leads the blood around the entire body may similarly cause an abrupt ‘game over’. The aorta stretches with each pulse of blood coming out of the heart, sixty or eight times a minute, or 150 times a minute if you’re an athlete working hard. The aorta of someone with a bicuspid valve probably tries to compensate for the restricted flow through the valve by lowering the resistance beyond, and getting wider, but weaker.</p>



<p>Doctors call this dilatation and it leaves the aorta vulnerable to tears, that are known as aortic dissection. When the aorta in the chest tears, the window of opportunity to fix it is pretty small, depending on the extent and speed of the tear. If you’re standing outside a cardiothoracic operating theatre, you have a better chance than the majority who will be miles away living their lives. That said, it is survival for those who get to a hospital capable of treating it, and not all are. The symptoms are interscapular (between the shoulder blades) pain, often described as ripping, which comes on suddenly abruptly. If you know you’re at risk just dial 999 (or 112) if you get it and tell them you think you might have an aortic dissection!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The good news for the patient is the mode of death is pretty quick compared to the lingering deaths of aggressive cancer or dementia. For arrythmias it might be minutes. For dissections it’s a few hours. For those around them it’s awful. They might have to do CPR and try to resuscitate you. It’s worth them learning how to do this, but you and they have to be realistic. The chances of survival are slim. Pathology and physiology just aren’t on your side.</p>



<p>For these very justifiable reasons anyone with a bicuspid aortic valve should have monitoring echocardiograms done regularly. The interval can be 3-5 years when you’re young and annually or less as the valve is seen to stiffen, the ventricle muscle gets beefier or the aorta dilates. All of this is readily measurable with today’s high tech. The pressure difference across the valve can be measured too. I knew my numbers over the years were deteriorating – I’d kept them all. I knew I already had some ventricular hypertrophy, (the thickening of the heart muscle) and the pressure gradient across the valve was increasing. It had reached 50mmHg a couple of years previously. This is classed as moderate stenosis – i.e. moderate restriction of the blood flow out of the heart. Although I knew all this I had never really given the consequences much thought. I had kept pretty fit during my adult life and hadn’t really given any thought about the day things got really bad nor had I realised I was symptomatic of a deterioration. It’s difficult to be objective about symptoms that come on gradually, particularly if you’re a doctor, and especially if you’re a bloke! Perhaps that’s why so many seem to die suddenly around the age of retirement, for all sorts of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>My story</strong></p>



<p>I have been having regular checks for years. In recent years the interval had dropped from every 3 years to every twelve, and then, nine months. In March 2023 I was off-piste skiing, doing what I love, skiing ‘steep and deep’ powder, through trees around Chamonix. My fitness in recent years has not been what it was ten years ago and I was feeling it. Blowing my own trumpet to the max, I was told that the ski instructor leading us (a former Olympic skier herself) judged me to be an advanced skier, (a ‘purple’ for those familiar with Ski Club of Great Britain categories) <em>if only I was fitter</em>. Without the fitness I wasn’t ‘a purple’. I thought that was very fair. I know how to ski, but I just couldn’t find the physical effort needed to match the terrain. Each morning I felt drained and wondered whether I should go out and do it all again. I was enjoying it but I was disappointed with my lack of stamina. Videoing my step-sons doing a similar, if slightly easier pitch, a couple of weeks later my partner commented on my breathlessness, readily audible on the video, when I was standing still. I thought it was just the altitude and not being fit enough. Despite the boys having had less than two weeks of skiing under their belts, and highly annoyingly, becoming adept at off-piste so early into their skiing careers, I was having to work hard to keep up. But I still don’t think the had penny really dropped.</p>



<p>My partner had been commenting on my breathlessness at times for quite a while. I’d put that down to my asthma and had a few months before changed inhaler to see if that helped. I thought my asthma was better, but looking back, I was still becoming breathless after any little exertion.</p>



<p>I was due my annual echocardiogram whilst I was away skiing but the hospital had luckily rescheduled it for just after Easter. It was one of the first junior doctor strike days and I thought it would get cancelled but not needing junior doctors, it went ahead. Jane, the Chief Cardiac Physiologist had scanned me many times and asked how I was. I told her of my less than satisfactory stamina when skiing and she mused as she squeezed out the transducer gel “well perhaps the valve has got worse. Let’s see”.</p>



<p>Jane is very experienced and thorough. She normally takes about ten minutes to do the echo, take all the measurements and tell me the news. This time, it was the fastest echo I’ve ever had. Almost immediately Jane could see the narrowing was worse. The gradient was now 70mmHg and I needed something doing about it. She phoned Simon, a cardiologist colleague who had looked after me for years. Covering for striking juniors that day, he was in the hospital and able to come down to the department where we were. He’s a former cycling buddy and he told me straight: “Shaun, it’s now severe aortic stenosis. You need a new valve. I’ll refer you to the surgeons. Limit your heart rate”.</p>



<p>Six days later, I was in front of the surgeon. I’d never had an operation before, never had a general anaesthetic and here I was learning I urgently needed a new aortic valve. The operation involves splitting my sternum to open the chest, putting me on heart bypass, stopping my heart to be able to open it to put in a new metal valve, putting in some polyester based artificial artery, to replace the dilating aorta and then getting me off bypass, restarting my heart and sewing me up. It’s a 4 or 5-hour job. You wake up in Intensive Care with drips in your neck and arm, drain tubes coming out of your chest, a catheter and a wound over your breastbone. Privately it can costs anywhere from £50,000 to £100,000. Thank God we have the NHS in the UK.</p>



<p>The surgeon explained that I was under no obligation to have surgery although without it, I would probably die within the next two years. He said I had a fifty percent chance of dying within the next twelve months. If hip, hernia and cataract waiting lists had a similar mortality rate then tens of thousands would die before they got their op. Whilst there are fewer patients needing valve replacement there are also far fewer specialists who can perform this type of complex surgery. That said, there are still way too many cases for the NHS in its perilous post-austerity state to be able to fix quickly. Cardiac waiting lists had risen to a record high of 392,698 at the end of May 2023 in England. A third of these were waiting for longer than the NHS target of 18 weeks from identification of need for surgery for actual surgery<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.&nbsp; Heart surgeons perform coronary artery bypass grafts and there are lots of patients that urgently need these.</p>



<div><p>From the prognosis risk I was given I quickly calculated that meant a cumulative 1% risk each week! Waiting three months – a standard NHS wait would give me a 1 in 8 chance of not making it. If I waited 6 months it would be double, a 1 in 4 chance of not making it. Friends in the profession reassured me that these risks were an overall risk for all types of patients, including some who were much older and frailer than I, so in truth my risks were lower but it was still pretty un-nerving.</p><p>The operation itself has a mortality (death) risk of 1% and a risk of a major stroke of 1%. For every hundred patients who have the surgery the chances are one will die during or soon after the procedure and one will have a major stroke and not fully recover. To me, that meant a 98% chance of pulling through well and then having a near normal life expectancy. I would have to take the drug warfarin, for the rest of my life, to anti-coagulate (thin) my blood and prevent small blood clots forming on the new metal valve. Blood clots can stop the metal valve opening properly or they can get detached and float off in the blood stream. They can cause strokes if they get lodged in small blood vessels in the brain, and damage anywhere else in the body, where they get wedged. Good warfarin management is a serious business. </p></div>



<p>The surgeon told me I was too young to have a bioprosthetic valve – from a pig or a cow – as these don’t last like metal ones do, and other surgical options, even though they wouldn’t need warfarin for ever were not recommended for me, as a relatively young patient. Warfarin itself creates a risk of dying from a haemorrhage, but that risk is only about 1% per year. That means of 100 patients who are all on warfarin one will die each year as a result of being on warfarin. It might be from a haemorrhagic stroke (a bleed in the brain) or from the stomach or bowel. A full 99 will live on, and those who do their own monitoring tend to have better control of the extent that their blood is thinned and be less likely to suffer such dire side effects of warfarin. I’ll never be able to binge on booze again but I don’t have to be teetotal.</p>



<p>I would be able to hear the valve ticking for ever but was told my brain would in time filter out the sound. For someone who has had a lifelong intolerance of ticking clocks, in the bedroom at least, that sounded to me like torture. The surgeon told me people sitting next to me wouldn’t be able to hear it so I wasn’t going to be looked at as if I had a bomb on my person! I hoped my brain would soon make this sound disappear although, someone who has had the op, said he doesn’t mind as it reassures him he’s still alive!</p>

<p>I told the surgeon I’d been exercising on a static bike since Simon, the cardiologist, had told me I needed a new valve. I wanted to get fit for surgery and had limited my heart rate to just 130 per minute and felt ok. He immediately told me to not do that again, to limit my exercise to just walking and my heart rate to no more than 100. He warned me of the grave danger of a sudden death from worsening the ventricular hypertrophy. My partner heard that loud and clear, so no cycling, swimming, heavy lifting, or heavy petting! I would be limited to slowly walking the dog. It also meant no foreign holiday – no-one would insure such a risk, until the valve was fixed. I couldn’t play football with the boys or go cycling with them. Having an arrhythmia whilst swimming isn’t great either for long term survival so ruled that out too. I wasn’t aware of how physically limited I was until I found <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/c14851dd-00cb-43c8-921d-6d1e5888eea0">Julien Roux’s Heart Alarm app</a> for Garmin watches. He’d written the software for his father who also had aortic stenosis. Once I’d switched an alarm on to tell me when my heart rate reached 100 I was shocked at how often it was happening with minimal exertion. It was tens of times each day, with minimal exertion.</p>



<p>The surgeon warned me I might get admitted with chest pain, palpitations or a collapse whilst I was waiting and that would get me bumped up the queue, because the condition was becoming more critical. I realised that the twinges of pain I’d been having in my chest were angina, due to a lack of blood and oxygen getting to the heart itself, and the breathlessness was because my heart couldn’t pump out the body’s needs fast enough. No wonder I seemed unfit when skiing. It wasn’t so much physically unfit through lack of training, I was medically unfit. Even walking the dog up a slight slope or too quickly would trigger the alarm as would going up the stairs and even doing anything too quickly – sweeping up, showering, tying my shoe laces! Over time I got fed up with the alarm going off and got into the bad habit of muting it and not looking at the rate. Thinking about the risk of doing that though made me realise in fact, the alarm was a warning. The more I over did it, the more I’d be stimulating my heart muscle to get beefier and the more likely it was to trigger a fatal arrythmia. I had to take notice of it and I had to slow down.</p>



<p>I am now one week away from a third attempt at an admission. The two previous times were aborted, one a couple of weeks before the admission date and one, after I’d arrived at the hospital, with my bag all psyched up for the real deal the following day. The NHS is massively under-resourced for what it is expected to do. Each time I was cancelled it was because other people more seriously ill than I needed treatment first.</p>



<p>I’m sure I’ll survive one more week and be able to write about the surgery, the aftermath and the recovery. Here’s hoping!</p>

            <p>
    Posted on  8 September 2019
    
</p>


<p><em>Translated to <a href="https://pngset.com/ru-weird-cpu-instruction">Russian</a> by <a href="https://pngset.com/">Babur
Muradov</a> and <a href="https://pngflare.com/uz-popcount">Uzbek</a> by
<a href="https://pngflare.com/">Leonid Popov</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a pseudo-transcript of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLFqLfz2Fmc">a presentation I did at !!Con
2019</a>.</em></p>
<p>Most CPU architectures in use today have an instruction called <code>popcount</code>,
short for “population count”. Here’s what it does: it counts the number of set
bits in a machine word. For example (assuming 8-bit words for simplicity),
<code>popcount(00100110)</code> is <code>3</code> and <code>popcount(01100000)</code> is <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, like I was, if there’s more to this instruction, but
that’s all it does! This doesn’t seem very useful, right?</p>
<p>I thought this might be a recent addition for some hyperspecialised use case,
but it has in fact been present in CPU architectures since at least 1961:</p>
<ul>
<li>1961: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7030_Stretch">IBM Stretch</a></li>
<li>1964: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6000_series">CDC 6000</a></li>
<li>1975: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">Cray-1</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Advanced_SIMD_(NEON)">ARM NEON</a></li>
<li>2007: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_10h">AMD K10</a></li>
<li>2008: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture)">Intel Nehalem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s going on?</p>
<h4 id="the-nsa-instruction">The NSA Instruction</h4>
<p><code>popcount</code> is also known as “The NSA Instruction”, and a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.arch/UXEi7G6WHuU/Z2z7fC7Xhr8J">very entertaining
thread on
<code>comp.arch</code></a>
discusses its uses inside and outside cryptography. It is rumoured that it was
originally added to CPU instructions at the behest of the NSA. As <a href="http://cryptome.org/jya/sadd.htm">this
archived email thread</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was almost a tradition that one of the first of any new faster CDC machine
was delivered to a “good customer” - picked up at the factory by an anonymous
truck, and never heard from again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes for a great story, but what were they using it for?</p>
<p>One measure of information content is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">Hamming
weight</a>, which is the number of
symbols in a string that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet.
For a binary string, this is exactly <code>popcount</code>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=38521">As explained here</a>, the
NSA wanted to do cryptanalysis on intercepted messages, and since the CDC 6000
had 60-bit words, one word was enough to store most alphabets they were
interested in. They were able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Split a message into lines</li>
<li>Set a bit for each unique character they encountered per line</li>
<li>Use <code>popcount</code> to count the distinct characters</li>
<li>Use the count as a hash for further cryptanalysis</li>
</ol>
<p>Curiously, <code>popcount</code> seems to have disappeared from instruction sets between
the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s, so there has to be more to it than
cryptographic applications to explain its return. What else can it be used for?</p>
<h4 id="error-correction">Error Correction</h4>
<p>Related to the concept of Hamming weight is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming
distance</a>, which is the number
of differing positions between two strings of identical length. For two binary
strings <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, this is just the <code>popcount</code> of them XORed together. For
example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">00100110</span>
<span id="cb1-2">01100000 ^</span>
<span id="cb1-3">--------</span>
<span id="cb1-4">01000110</span>
<span id="cb1-5"></span>
<span id="cb1-6">popcount(01000110) = 3</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For telecommunications applications, this helps us calculate the signal
distance, where a known word is sent over the wire and the number of flipped
bits are counted to provide an estimate of the error introduced by transmission.</p>
<p>We can then design an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance#Error_detection_and_error_correction">error-correcting
code</a>
accordingly, e.g.&nbsp;if we want to be robust against up to 2 flipped bits, our
code words need to differ in Hamming distance by at least 5.</p>
<h4 id="binary-convolutional-neural-networks">Binary Convolutional Neural Networks</h4>
<p>And now for something completely different: binary convolutional neural
networks! But first, what are they?</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary means that we’re using matrices consisting of only the values +1 (coded
as <code>1</code>) and -1 (coded as <code>0</code>), as opposed to 32-bit floating-point values.</li>
<li>Convolutional means matrix multiplication is involved?</li>
<li>Neural networks are systems inspired by animal brains (I’m a bit hazy on
this part).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, we have to do binary matrix multiplication. But what’s special
about binary matrices?</p>
<p>Ordinary matrix multiplication on 32-bit values is a good fit on desktop
computers with powerful CPUs and GPUs, but increasingly we also want to do
useful work on smaller and simpler devices, such as smartphones, routers,
smartwatches, etc. We can decompose these more complex matrices into layers of
binary matrices, and these resulting matrices are so much easier to store and
operate on that we are better off even though there are more layers.</p>
<p>Where does <code>popcount</code> come into play? It’s used to calculate the dot product of
two binary matrices:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">a = xnor(x, y)</span>
<span id="cb2-2">b = popcount(a)</span>
<span id="cb2-3">c = len(a)</span>
<span id="cb2-4">dot(x, y) = 2 × b − c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>More details are available
<a href="https://sushscience.wordpress.com/2017/10/01/understanding-binary-neural-networks/">here</a>
and

<h4 id="chess-programming">Chess Programming</h4>
<p>Many chess programs store data using a
<a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards">bitboard</a> representation, which
conveniently fits into a 64-bit word. <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Population_Count">Population
Count</a> has been used to
perform meaningful operations with this representation, such as calculating the
<a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Mobility#Mobility_with_Bitboards">mobility</a>
of a piece.</p>
<h4 id="molecular-fingerprinting">Molecular Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>This is related to the notion of Hamming distance above: molecules are hashed
in some way and compared (with <code>popcount</code>) to determine how similar they are.
More details on that
<a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2008/06/26/fingerprint_background.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="hash-array-mapped-tries">Hash Array Mapped Tries</h4>
<p>This is where I first learned about <code>popcount</code>! The HAMT is a data structure
(<a href="https://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf">pioneered by Phil
Bagwell</a>) that can store a
very large number of values (usually 32 or 64) in an array at each node of the
trie. However, allocating memory for a 32 or 64-element array every time can be
incredibly wasteful, especially if the array only actually contains a handful
of elements. The solution is to add a bitmask in which the number of bits that
are set corresponds to the number of elements in the array, which allows the
array to grow and shrink as required. Calculating the index for a given element
efficiently can then be done using <code>popcount</code>. You can learn more about how
they work from <a href="https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2018/07/29/hamts-from-scratch/">this blog post</a>, where I
implement them myself.</p>
<h4 id="succinct-data-structures">Succinct Data Structures</h4>
<p>This is an exciting new area of research that focuses on how to store data in
as little space as possible, without having to decompress it in order to do
useful work. One technique is to think in terms of arrays of bits (bitvectors), which can be
queried using two operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rank(i)</code> counts the number of bits set upto the <code>i</code>th index in the bitvector</li>
<li><code>select(i)</code> finds the index where the <code>i</code>th ranked bit is set</li>
</ul>
<p>Making these operations efficient on large bitvectors requires constructing an
index and using it effectively, both involving <code>popcount</code>. There’s <a href="https://alexbowe.com/rrr/">a good
overview of the RRR index here</a>, and as far as I can
tell the current state-of-the-art approach is described in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./dga/papers/zhou-sea2013.pdf">Space-Efficient,
High-Performance Rank &amp; Select Structures on Uncompressed Bit
Sequences</a>.</p>
<h4 id="compiler-optimisations">Compiler Optimisations</h4>
<p><code>popcount</code> has become so pervasive that both
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/JUzmD8">GCC</a> and <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/AVqMGl">Clang</a>
will detect an implementation of <code>popcount</code> and replace it with the built-in
instruction. Imagine Clippy going “I see you are trying to implement
<code>popcount</code>, let me go ahead and fix that for you”! The relevant LLVM code is
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/f36485f7ac2a8d72ad0e0f2134c17fd365272285/lib/Transforms/Scalar/LoopIdiomRecognize.cpp#L960">here</a>.
Daniel Lemire points to this as an example of <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2016/05/23/the-surprising-cleverness-of-modern-compilers/">the surprising cleverness of
modern
compilers</a>.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>From beginnings shrouded in mystery, <code>popcount</code> has emerged as a generally
useful, if slightly unusual, CPU instruction. I love how it ties together such
different fields of computing, and I wonder how many other similarly weird
instructions are out there. If you have a favourite, I’d love to hear about it!</p>

<p>
The following is based upon systems of equations found in "Symmetry in Chaos,
A Search for Pattern in Mathematics, Art, and Nature" (the second edition) by
Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky.
They ask the question whether there are aperiodic chaotic attractors that generate
symmetric patterns?
Can there be order within chaotic systems?

The attractors are based upon the following
formula for the m+1'th term in the series given 5 parameters a<sub>0</sub>
 a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>4</sub>. The integer n is the degree of symmetry.
The z is complex valued and all a<sub>n</sub> are real valued.
</p>

</center><p>
Many of the examples presented here are named as published in the book and by other experimenters. The parameters a<sub>0</sub> 
 a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>4</sub> for some are provided in the book and subsequent papers, 
where they are denoted as lambda, alpha, beta, omega and gamma respectively.

The images here are generated by iterating the series typically 1,000 million times. This is performed in two passes,
the first pass with many fewer iterations is used to find the bounds of the attractor on the complex plane, the second
pass actually "draws" the attractor points. The process of drawing involves treating the bounded region of the complex
plane as a 2D histogram, each time the series passes through a pixel region on the plane the histogram at that
location is incremented. One might imagine the 2D histogram as a height field, a larger values at a point indicate
that the complex series passed through that pixel more often than a point with a smaller value.
At the end of the process the histogram is mapped onto colours depending on the histogram values, there are many
ways to do this based on aesthetic grounds.

A rough guide to parameters.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of n determines the rotational symmetry of the image, it should be greater than or equal to 2.
</li><li>a<sub>0</sub> is usually between -3 and 3, values between -1 and 1 are generally less interesting.
</li><li>a<sub>1</sub> should have the opposite sign as a<sub>0</sub>, and be in the same range.
</li><li>a<sub>2</sub> perturbs the attractor, it can be 0.
</li><li>a<sub>3</sub> controls bilateral symmetry, 0 will result in mirror symmetry. Otherwise typical values
are between -1 and 1.
</li><li>a<sub>4</sub> typically between -1 and 1 and not too close to zero.
</li></ul><center>

Unfortunately, for a system of equations with 6 parameters and therefore a large parameter space, the set of
parameters that yield "interesting" results is quite small.

Salesforce promoted that its CDP can process large amounts of customer data in "real-time," meaning in "milliseconds," the lawsuit says.</p><p>One benefit to real-time data processing that Salesforce advertises, for example, is when a hospital may need the most up-to-date information on a patient regarding urgent healthcare needs.</p><p>"When milliseconds matter most, your healthcare provider can deliver proactive guidance and care recommendations with access to your real-time patient data," <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.salesforce.com/ap/blog/2022/09/what-is-salesforce-genie.html#genie-business-impact" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">the company wrote</a>.</p><p>Salesforce unveiled its CDP software, Genie, to the public on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-dreamforce-acquisitions-growth-margins-revenue-target-2022-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">September 20, 2022</a>. In a keynote slide attached to the court documents, the company repeats the term "real-time" four times.</p><p>According to the court documents, Salesforce said it was the "biggest announcement" it had made since the founders started the company.</p><p>But "it was all a lie," the lawsuit says.</p><p>The court documents say the software does not operate as fast as the term "real-time" suggests, and "in fact many of its processes took several hours."</p><p>"While it was able to execute some functions such as information collection in real time, other operations such as the processing and organizing of that data took hours to complete," the lawsuit says.</p><p>On <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.salesforce.com/ap/blog/2022/09/what-is-salesforce-genie.html" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Salesforce's website about Genie</a>, the company says the software "collects and unifies data in milliseconds."</p><p>For example, "a personalized offer on a website you're browsing changes instantly because of something you just clicked in a marketing email," the company writes. "Because the company uses Marketing Cloud Genie, that offer changes immediately into something that is more relevant to you than the one you'd otherwise be looking at. This convinces you to go ahead and make a purchase."</p><p>Wirth recommended that Salesforce pursue this software capability in late 2021 or early 2022, according to court documents, but it became clear to the Customer Data Platform (CDP) team that it could not "develop the technology in time" for Salesforce's announcement in September 2022.</p><p>The lawsuit also claimed that the CDP team "wanted to redefine the meaning of 'real-time,' so that it could falsely claim that the CDP operated in real-time."</p><p>"Plaintiff reasonably believed that publicly claiming the CDP operated in 'real-time' without actually having (or even intending to have in the near future) such a capability would be fraudulent, and likely violate numerous provisions of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders, as well as rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission," the lawsuit stated.</p><p>Wirth then decided to act as a whistleblower and brought up his concerns to the CDP team and other "key executives," the lawsuit said.</p><p>In addition, he approached his direct supervisor, Lidiane Jones, now <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-lidiane-jones-the-new-slack-ceo-succeeding-stewart-butterfield-2022-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">CEO of Slack Technologies</a>, about his concerns. The lawsuit says Jones then began a "deceitful campaign to diminish" Wirth's reputation at the company.</p><p>One of Wirth's last "whistleblowing activities" was a one-on-one meeting with Saleseforce's CTO, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parker-harris-salesforce-cofounder-profile-2015-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Parker Harris</a>, during which he brought up his concerns about the CDP team and Jones's "use of false criticisms."</p><p>Wirth was fired hours later, the lawsuit says.</p><p>Harris and spokespersons for Slack and Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment sent during the weekend.</p><p>Wirth is seeking monetary damages due to what the lawsuit calls Salesforces' "whistleblower retaliation."</p><p>His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

For a rock solid alternative, I use Hetzner with Coolify (<a href="https://coolify.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://coolify.io</a>) installed, it's an open source Heroku alternative that uses Docker. I deploy all my apps on a 10 dollar Hetzner VPS that can handle millions of hits, and that 10 dollars gets you a much beefier machine than anything you'd get on other paid services like Render, Railway, Fly etc. They just aren't worth using in my experience when something like Coolify does the job for a fraction of the price.</span></p></div></td></tr>

      <p><span><strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> In the past, I’ve been effusive of my praise of CNET, a news outlet that (along with <em>Wired</em>) pioneered digital journalism, for one specific reason: Its archives have been kept safe from meddling. It is one of the most in-depth archives of news that we have from the early years of the internet, and it is arguably of the most important flavor—day-to-day, standard issue news content. But its ownership picture has changed in recent years, with the media holding company Red Ventures purchasing it (and its subsidiaries, most notably ZDNet, which hasn’t been attached to Ziff Davis for <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/cnet-networks-completes-zdnet-acquisition/">more than 20 years</a>) for $500 million back in 2020. Red Ventures has made some controversial moves with the CNET property, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai">most infamously bringing AI into the mix</a>, but the latest move was like a dagger to the heart: <em>Gizmodo</em> revealed that the company was actively culling its utterly massive archives for search-engine optimization reasons. I’ve talked about killing sites before, but in today’s Tedium, let’s talk culling, and why it’s often just as bad. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></span></p>

<p><h3>“Content pruning removes, redirects, or refreshes URLs that are no longer relevant or helpful to our audience, including outdated or redundant content that may confuse or frustrate users looking for up-to-date information. (For example, a 1996 article about available AOL service tiers is no longer relevant or useful.) Also called content deprecation, it sends a signal to Google that says CNET is fresh, relevant and worthy of being placed higher than our competitors in search results.”</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>— A description of “content pruning,”</strong> the process CNET’s archive is undergoing, in an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23903730-faq-on-cnet-content-pruning-aug-2023">internal memo</a> acquired by <em>Gizmodo</em> reporter Thomas Germain ahead of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cnet-deletes-thousands-old-articles-google-search-seo-1850721475">the scoop he wrote about CNET</a> earlier this week. Despite CNET’s claims, Google Search Liaison Danny Sullivan directly refuted CNET’s claims that this was an effective strategy <a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1689018769782476800">in a tweet he posted</a> just ahead of Germain’s story.</p>

<p><em>This is not a news website. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/PAEwrnasOvY">Devin H/Unsplash</a>)</em></p>
<h3>A news website is not a bonsai tree. Often, it’s a library and an archive. You shouldn’t prune a news archive.</h3>
<p>A few years ago, I wrote a piece that described the domain name system (DNS) <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/05/08/top-level-domain-history/">as a system of branches</a> built from a series of top-level domains. I think that comparison largely stands, but I do think that when you get to the website level, the comparison falls apart to some degree.</p>
<p>Oh sure, there are folders and directories, and those branch off in many ways akin to the world’s most complex flow chart, but in some ways, the information architecture starts to matter a little less. If you look at the tree of the domain system as branches when you finally get to the leaves, you are going to look at those leaves as disposable.</p>
<p>The problem is, those leaves are often not disposable. Much the opposite. They do not fall off the tree every fall after growing through the spring and summer. They in many cases, just stay there, maybe less visible than they once were, but still central to what the site represents. If they fall off, the tree is not doing its job. It’s the point where the tree metaphor to describe the internet totally breaks, if you get my drift.</p>
<p>If we did look at websites as trees with branches full of meaningless tiny leaves, it would be all too easy to see every website as a bonsai tree in waiting.</p>
<p>Yes, bonsai, the Asian art of growing miniature trees and pruning them perfectly, perhaps makes sense to some degree as a metaphor for websites that can be redesigned and restructured as necessary. But when it comes to the information architecture, the metaphor rings hollow over time, because it does not show proper deference to the information.</p>
<p>Now, it’s true that not every website is going to have long-term value. The term ephemera comes to mind, and sometimes, ephemeral things should be allowed to fade away with the passage of time. (<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59p89z/why-is-the-internet-archive-painstakingly-preserving-one-mans-junk-mail">Unless you’re Ted Nelson</a> and you keep those things.) Maybe you decide that your marketing blog shouldn’t live forever, that you would prefer to class up the joint and aim for a different approach.</p>
<p>But there’s a real risk of looking at a website as a tree you should prune, rather than a library or archive of information intended to be analyzed and studied over time. The value of the tool is that it has been allowed to grow and build into a robust archive of information. If the leaves are allowed to fall off the tree, following the metaphor, the tree grows significantly less valuable.</p>
<p>Despite my well-known opinions on <a href="https://tedium.co/2020/05/15/search-engine-etiquette-backlinks/">backlink begging</a>, I don’t think search engine optimization is necessarily evil, or even a necessary evil. I think it’s something that can make a lot of sense in a lot of contexts. The problem is, when you are building a resource to last the test of time, it can feel diametrically opposed to the goals of why you created the resource in the first place.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Leaves-Laminated.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Leaves Laminated" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Leaves-Laminated.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Can you believe that people used to laminate leaves in books for safekeeping? (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/O6N9RV2rzX8">Jeremy Thomas/Unsplash</a>)</em></p>
<p>But to be clear, ignore what the SEO experts say: News sites should never be trimmed with a tiny pair of clippers, because all their value is in the leaves. The branches are just a conduit.</p>
<p>You wanna keep the leaf metaphor? How about this: A news site is a collection of leaves laminated in books for safekeeping. If we fail to keep them safe, what was the point of collecting the leaves?</p>
<p>CNET, for years, was doing this right. But now, with a change in ownership, it’s throwing out its laminated leaves. And that’s a damn shame.</p>
</div>
<div>
        
<p><h3>“This is an industry-wide best practice for large sites like ours that are primarily driven by SEO traffic.”</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>— CNET spokesperson Taylor Canada,</strong> speaking in the <em>Gizmodo</em> piece. You can see why CNET was fooled—just do a search for “content pruning” on Google, and you’ll find that <a href="https://yoast.com/content-pruning/">basically</a> <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/content-pruning/">every</a> <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remove-outdated-content">single</a> <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/content-marketing/content-pruning/">SEO</a> <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/guide-seo-pruning-semrush/">expert</a> <a href="https://www.clearscope.io/blog/content-pruning">under</a> <a href="https://www.clearscope.io/blog/content-pruning">the</a> <a href="https://seoscout.com/guides/content-pruning-how-to-consolidate-pages-with-litt">sun</a> recommends content pruning as an effective strategy for removing dead weight, essentially based on perceived signals from Google. So for a top Google search expert to literally go out and say that “no, you shouldn’t do it,” as Danny Sullivan did this week, is basically throwing years of SEO “best practices” out the window with a single tweet. It’s kind of hilarious in hindsight.</p>

<p><em>A shot of CNET’s studios, circa 2014. (<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/nanpalmero/11868148205/">Nan Palmero/Flickr</a>)</em></p>
<h3>CNET pruning its content is a harbinger of something bigger</h3>
<p>To be clear, I am not a fan of CNET removing its content from its website in this way. It favors the present to the past, and removes important dots of context that future generations of researchers and journalists can use to tell important stories. And CNET owns perhaps the most complete archive of an important period of technology—the 1995 to 2005 period where the internet first took off, disrupted industries, and reshaped our relationship with the world.</p>
<p>But let’s be clear here. CNET is not a unique case. I am going to tell you right now that CNET is not the first website that has removed or pruned its archives, or decided to underplay them, or make them hard to access. Far from it.</p>
<p>Often, what I have noticed over the years is that websites will often go through major redesigns and decide not to pull certain types of content over. A lot gets lost in the process, and there are many reasons to not put in the work, including time, complexity, and resources.</p>
<p>Or maybe they will just not put in the work to make that information accessible without a lot of legwork.</p>
<p>To offer a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>USA Today</strong> is 40 years old, and has been online for 27 of those years. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/sitemap/">Its sitemap</a> only goes back to October of 2012, when it conducted a major redesign. While its content is archived in print from elsewhere, that means essentially half of its digital history is just not there. Older content, when accessible, appears to be buried at the subdomain usatoday30.usatoday.com, but that redirects to the main page and is hard to search via Google.</li>
<li><strong>Newsweek</strong> is prominently celebrating its 90th anniversary this year, but its <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/archive">archive page</a> only covers issues dating back to 2013, the year IBT Media bought the company from IAC, the parent company of <em>The Daily Beast</em>. The content from its legacy years (most famously <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirvana-185306">this piece</a>) is still there and can be searched, but it is not obviously organized.</li>
<li><strong>PC World,</strong> unlike its longtime competitor CNET, does not offer an easily accessible sitemap for its content, but it a little digging around uncovers <a href="https://static.pcworld.com/sitemap/">the fact that it once did</a>, and many of the articles in the sitemap are no longer accessible. The oldest article in the PC World archives <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/535817/toshiba_libretto.html">is from 1997</a>, and odds are it was likely missed in the pruning process, because it is one of only three articles currently on the site from the 1990s.</li>
<li><strong>People.com,</strong> while its archive appears to be online, does not make it easy to access said archive, because of the way the site is designed. There is no user-accessible sitemap or easy to use pagination, and its search functionality includes no visible date on the articles.</li>
<li><strong>Pitchfork</strong> has strong historic archives at this point, in part because search is a key reason why the site works, but it has been known for removing reviews in the past, including <a href="https://deletedpitchfork.blogspot.com/">old reviews that didn’t reflect its later editorial sensibility</a>. It notably faced a particularly odd situation around the time of its purchase by Condé Nast: A onetime reviewer became a very loud critic of the site, at one point making legal threats, and the site responded by <a href="https://tktk.gawker.com/pitchfork-deletes-its-harshest-critic-1736804618">removing that writer’s entire body of work</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these examples, the most egregious is easily USA Today, which as a national newspaper, fits under the “paper of record” category. One could argue that the company has a backstop in the form of online archives, but the company has literally decades of broken links inaccessible online. Poof.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, I do not blame small teams struggling to keep up with the huge tide of content for being unable to maintain the past. It’s a lot of work, even in the best of circumstances. Moving from one CMS to another takes time and money, both of which are sometimes in short supply.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Broken-Links.jpg" width="799" height="533" alt="Broken Links" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Broken-Links.jpg"></p>
<p><em>(<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/cogdog/16632103875/">Alan Levine/Flickr</a>)</em></p>
<p>But I only bring up these failings to point out that, while CNET is clearly making a mistake here, it is one that many other sites make in ways big and small every single day. The difference in the case of CNET is that it appears to be intentional and not just an oversight or the result of institutional history going away. CNET intentionally put in the work to protect its historic content in the first place, and now it’s putting in the work to bury it.</p>
<p>CNET’s editorial practices understandably have a laser focus on them right now, in no small part because the outlet was the first to start publishing AI-generated content. But let’s not give the rest of the media world a pass because CNET was the one in the headline.</p>
<p>These articles help expose the past; they were the hard work of people who spent a lot of time building them.</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<h3>Five news sites that do their archives exceptionally well</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>The New York Times.</strong> I have my problems with them in part because of <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/02/18/new-york-times-archives-open-letter-controversy/">their handling of trans issues</a>, but they really set the standard that the rest of the industry has followed.</li>
<li><strong>The Washington Post.</strong> Not only are many of their articles accessible digitally (I have linked stories from them from the 1970s), but they offer their subscribers access to their print archives via ProQuest, making their content accessible at a level familiar to many academics.</li>
<li><strong>Time Magazine.</strong> Nearly every Time Magazine cover from the start of its history until today is accessible <a href="https://time.com/vault/">from its vault</a>, and many of its articles are also freely accessible.</li>
<li><strong>The New Yorker.</strong> It not only offers full scans of its magazine archive to subscribers, it also takes time to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/archive">resurface its archive content</a> on the website.</li>
<li><strong>The Los Angeles Times.</strong> While <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives">the newspaper’s archive site</a> shunts off the newspapers themselves to Newspapers.com, it has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sitemap">a strong historic sitemap</a> that includes full articles from 1985 on and a selection of pieces from prior years.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><strong>I think an important distinction to make here, as I close this piece out,</strong> is that we should not expect the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to save us. Sure, it certainly can, and its affiliated archive.it site has collected much of CNET’s history.</p>
<p>But we should not expect it. The Internet Archive is an important resource, but it is a fallible one and an overworked one. These companies have the money and resources. They should be the ones protecting their own work. The Internet Archive is there to clean up your mess, not excuse your failings.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we should encourage better standards from publishers and other players in the content ecosystem. The reason why this content dies is because not enough work has been done to properly value it.</p>
<p>There are at least three distinct ways I could see other sites not fall down the CNET trap in the digital era:</p>

<p>I think CNET is making a mistake, but they’ve also identified a serious problem for the digital news ecosystem: Old content is a burden to carry, and intentionally or not, Google isn’t making that lift any easier.</p>
<p>I think as researchers, journalists, and SEO heads, we need to put our heads together to figure out ways to make maintaining historic content look less like a burden and more like an opportunity.</p>
<p>Our history is at risk if we can’t.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Linear algebraic primitives are at the core of many modern algorithms in
engineering, science, and machine learning. Hence, accelerating these
primitives with novel computing hardware would have tremendous economic impact.
Quantum computing has been proposed for this purpose, although the resource
requirements are far beyond current technological capabilities, so this
approach remains long-term in timescale. Here we consider an alternative
physics-based computing paradigm based on classical thermodynamics, to provide
a near-term approach to accelerating linear algebra.
<br>At first sight, thermodynamics and linear algebra seem to be unrelated
fields. In this work, we connect solving linear algebra problems to sampling
from the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of a system of coupled harmonic
oscillators. We present simple thermodynamic algorithms for (1) solving linear
systems of equations, (2) computing matrix inverses, (3) computing matrix
determinants, and (4) solving Lyapunov equations. Under reasonable assumptions,
we rigorously establish asymptotic speedups for our algorithms, relative to
digital methods, that scale linearly in matrix dimension. Our algorithms
exploit thermodynamic principles like ergodicity, entropy, and equilibration,
highlighting the deep connection between these two seemingly distinct fields,
and opening up algebraic applications for thermodynamic computing hardware.

<h2>What is VirGL?<a href="#what-is-virgl" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>VirGL is a virtual 3D GPU for use inside QEMU virtual machines, that
allows the guest operating system to use the capabilities of the host GPU
to accelerate 3D rendering. The plan is to have a guest GPU that is fully
independent of the host GPU.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-exactly-does-it-entail">
<h2>What exactly does it entail?<a href="#what-exactly-does-it-entail" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project entails creating a virtual 3D capable graphics card for
virtual machines running inside QEMU. The design of this card is based
around the concepts of Gallium3D to make writing Mesa and (eventually)
Direct3D drivers for it easy. The card natively uses the Gallium TGSI
intermediate representation for its shaders. The implementation of
rendering for the card is done in the host system as part of QEMU and is
implemented purely on OpenGL so you can get accelerated rendering on any
sufficiently capable card/driver combination.</p>
<p>The project also consists of a complete Linux guest stack, composed of a
Linux kernel KMS driver, X.org 2D DDX driver and Mesa 3D driver.</p>

<p>Ode to the M1</p><hr>


<p>It is not often I am blown away by a piece of hardware. My Hall of Fame features the 1991 Super Nintendo, the 1995 3dfx1, and the 2010 Intel's Serie 520 SSD<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This past month my 2021 MacBook Pro M1<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> joined the club.</p>


<p>My problem</p><hr><p>Much has been written about the performance and the battery life of the M1. I won't elaborate on that. Even though these alone would warrant much praise, it is for my peculiar usecase that the machine shines.</p>

<p>I spend my time either writing code or articles. Linux is perfect for that. But every once in a while that OS eats my time. Spending time figuring out why fractional scaling broke after an update, why that Thunderbolt SSD won't mount<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, or why it won't print is nerve wrecking. These rare, yet ragging, moments make me miss MacOS X.</p>

<p>As a retro-gamimg enthusiast, I may need to use an emulator to study a game's internals. Inevitably, I end up needing to run Windows.</p>

<p>Missed connection</p><hr><p>I attempted to solve my problem via KVM on a beloved Thinkpad Carbon Gen 9. It took me forever to get something running. Dealing with Windows 11 TPM requirements was a nightmare. And I never managed to have something stable. Not to mention the battery life was abysmal.</p>

<p>UTM</p><hr><p><a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> works. It was painless to set up both Ubuntu and Windows 11 with a few clicks. I spent 1mn creating both VMs<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. It allows me to have all three OSes a simple swipe motion away. Both Ubuntu and Windows run at native speed since they are virtualized instead of emulated.</p>


<video width="1240" height="1920" poster="https://fabiensanglard.net/m1/poster.webp" controls="">
  <source src="https://fabiensanglard.net/m1/magic1080.mov" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>The ability to share files in <code>rw</code> mode made writing and testing cross-platform mDNS software<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> something almost enjoyable. At the very least it gave me the satisfaction of iterating at maximum speed.</p>


<p>Concerns</p><hr><p>At this point, the M1 is a dream hypervisor. I wish I could freeze time on this setup. I have only two concerns.</p>

<h2>Software engineers</h2>
<p>For every extra cycle an hardware engineer can squeeze out of silicon, you will find a programmer adding one hundred cycles to their program<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. In other terms, I fear that once devs figure out how powerful the M1 is, they will throw more "features" at it.</p>

<h2>Enterprising</h2>
<p>UTM is simple, lightweight, and easy to set up. It is gorgeous and a pleasure to use.

<p dir="auto">With the goal of ending this current limbo and soothe longstanding tensions in the Nix community, this RFC does two things:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Establish general principles about Nix's architecture and evolution in order to ensure we do not get in this situation again.</p>
<p dir="auto">Notably we are allowed to make breaking changes to experimental features, which includes both the new CLI and Flakes, until they are stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Establish an incremental plan adhering to the principles deciding on the order and priority in which to stabilize these features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">First, the non-Flakes CLI wll be stabilized, in phases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Afterwards, Flakes itself and its CLI components can be stabilized. The final design of Flakes will also require another RFC.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>A note to anyone leaving comments, remember the point of this RFC is <em>not</em> to debate the <strong>content</strong> of what is being stabilized, but debate the <strong>process</strong> of stabilization. To my fellow Flakes skeptics in particular, please hold back on the minutiae what you think is wrong with the design of Flakes, the new CLI or other features, or we will end up with another monster RFC thread that goes nowhere.</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>The current trajectory as far as I can tell, prior to writing this. is that we all of the sudden get a Nix 3.0 where a huge swath of stuff without review becomes stable at once. This is because many people in charge feel exhausted, and fear properly audit and debate the new features will devolve into yet another messy useless flame war.</em></p>

      <p dir="auto">This is the crux of the issue, and I can't agree with it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Going into an effort to stabilise Flakes with the understanding that we can't actually change it very much would make a mockery of the RFC process as a whole.  It would establish a precedent that following the RFC process is optional, and that if you don't want to follow it (and you're one of the privileged set of committers to the appropriate repository) you can work around it encouraging adoption of your "experimental" work until it gets to the point that "we can't make big changes" any more.  Maybe the Flakes design is good enough that we wouldn't <em>need</em> to make huge drastic changes, but it still sets the same precedent if we go into it having accepted that we <em>can't</em>.</p>

But I have also long since given up on trying to influence Flakes. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/edolstra/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/edolstra">@edolstra</a> and others have a very specific vision on what UX they want for them, and I think a fine compromise is that they can basically do whatever they want with that <em>so long as</em> there remains a "rest of Nix" that is still fully functional and not an afterthought with huge gaps.</p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, I would <em>personally</em> work very hard to make sure the first two round of stabilizations under the plan yield a good result, making requests for some small tweak dyed-in-the-whole Flakers find baffling or boring. But then for the 3rd round, I would largely bow out, having gotten the things I wanted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, I am by no means demanding that persons besides myself do the same; there is still a 3rd round of stabilization for those interested in Flakes to voice their thoughts. But I gather a lot of the tensions around Flakes is predicated on a fear that Flakes will be the only way forward, with the non-Flakes functionality legacy stuff or otherwise left to rot. I think by making sure that the non-Flakes stuff is still good, or at least leaving room for that (e.g. we can rename <code>nix search</code> to <code>nix flake search</code> leaving room for the future re-emergence of Flake-agnostic searching) we can lower the temperature a lot in the room not only for people like me, but also for people that still care about Flakes being good (in their eyes) but can rest easier with there being a "plan B".</p>

      <p dir="auto">I would say that pushing flakes through an imitation RFC process without properly addressing the criticism would damage RFC process without really adding anything to flakes (hard to get extra credibility from the process that just lost its credibility).</p>
<p dir="auto">I guess with incremental stabilisation of Flakes we could reach a state where some things can neither be stabilised via an RFC nor removed via an RFC? I don't like this outcome too much, but maybe this would at least reduce the splash damage…</p>
<p dir="auto">(From experience, I am pessimistic about making consistent good decisions about issues, but somewhat optimistic about compartmentalising the damage)</p>

Saying "flakes are widely used, so we can't break interfaces even if they're not declared stable" is flawed reasoning. <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/tomberek/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/tomberek">@tomberek</a> recently pointed out to me that leading figures have been encouraging users to adopt flakes since NixCon 2019. And it still happens in side channels all the time, new users being introduced with <em>literally</em> saying "it's fine, just enable experimental features, it's the right way to do things" or "it's strongly encouraged" – by whom?</p>
<p dir="auto">These are people's opinions, they are free to have them, and others are free to believe them, but the manual and the guards in the code clearly state: this interface is subject to change.</p>
<p dir="auto">Don't rely on experimental features in production, unless you know what you're doing and know how to get yourself out of a mess. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/yXPQdZh8o7c?feature=share&amp;t=958" rel="nofollow">There is no deadline on stabilising the new CLI or flakes, because we don't want to get stuck with what we may end up regretting.</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not in the position to conclusively judge and not willing to opine whether the new CLI design or the flakes paradigm of organising Nix projects are the right way forward and whether the improvements in user experience are worth the sunk cost. But I'm confident with stating that the kind of signaling and narrative we have observed</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Confuses beginners, produces uncertainty, and associates these negative emotions with the project, which tend to stick due to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect#Primacy_effect" rel="nofollow">primacy effect</a></li>
<li>Reinforces distrust in Nix maintainers among new users, who we can expect soon to be the overwhelming majority</li>
<li>Exerts needless constraints and pressure on maintainers where the whole point of experimental features is, well, to be able to experiment, and therefore having the freedom to make breaking changes.</li>

          <p dir="auto">Thanks for fleshing this out (and sorry for taking that long to answer).</p>
<p dir="auto">I agree with the broad idea of stabilizing stuff incrementally. There's a huge pile of experimental stuff, ranging from “experimental on the paper, but too widely used to be changed” to “actually experimental, we might drop it tomorrow”.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problem that makes this whole thing much more complex is that Flakes and the new CLI are strongly tied together:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>On the one hand, the CLI is built around Flakes as the primary interface to Nix expressions. Which means that I'm quite anxious at the idea of trying to stabilize the CLI without flakes as it would be very hard to provide something nice and consistent.</li>
<li>On the other hand, a large part of the design of Flakes is here to provide a good user interface. Being able to just run <code>nix run nixpkgs#hello</code> is magical, and that's to a large part tied to the design of flakes. Which means that inverting the order to stabilize flakes first and the CLI after would also be weird.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All that being said, I think I'd favour trying to stabilize Flakes first for consistency reasons: A Nix with Flakes but not the new CLI would be a Nix with a not-so-obviously-good feature hidden somewhere within the language (under <code>builting.getFlake</code>). However, a Nix with the new CLI but no Flakes is a Nix where the primary user interface has a huge blind spot, which is frankly bad.</p>

<p dir="auto">I don't think it is hard to stabilize <code>nix show-derivation</code> and <code>nix eval</code> without <code>nix run</code>. <code>nix run</code> doesn't affect the design of those first two plumbing commands, does it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">However, a Nix with the new CLI but no Flakes is a Nix where the primary user interface has a huge blind spot, which is frankly bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We'd be just stabilizing the plumbing commands. Blind spots are completely acceptable and expected.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">I am guessing this is a simple understanding where you thought by "stabilize flakes" I meant just the file format; I mean the file format <em>and</em> the CLI commands that are tied to it. They go together, and the value of one <em>does</em> depend on the other. Trying to stabilize those in isolation would mean we are unable to judge the merits of either properly.</p>
<p dir="auto">I do think some of those Flakes commands (like <code>nix search</code>) could be made Flakes agnostic, but as I hoped to make clear I do <em>not</em> want to block the stabilizing of anything on making them Flakes agnostic. At most, I would advocate renaming things like <code>nix flakes run</code> and <code>nix flakes search</code> to "make room" for future generalized variants.</p>

<p dir="auto">However, I think this RFC opens the door to creating one or multiple experimental flake-based frontends based on the lower-level Nix Store and Nix Language. So you can still make breaking changes, but they are scoped and more experimentation is possible.</p>

I think the scope of the RFC is ok expanded, but what I would do is I would keep this RFC as a "plan" and then do RFCs separated for every step, which would go into more detail. In my view, it is ok to have an RFC that presents the context, history, reasons for the plan, and what the plan is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having something too big in scope for what we would like is inevitable at this point, as this is basically the RFC process "catching up" on years of work "outside of the process".</p>
<p dir="auto">On a different note. I fully support the plan to separate cli from core in your comments above, but I also understand if it does not happen.</p>

      <p dir="auto">As a shepherd, I agree to move this RFC to FCP. I honestly don't think this is a great RFC, it's not very formal, rather vague and seems hard to verify. But there's nothing bad about this RFC, it has good ideas, and RFCs don't <em>need</em> to be formal. This RFC by itself might not do much, but it definitely doesn't make things worse. My approval is mainly motivated by getting this over the finish line and letting everybody focus on more concrete work.</p>

                            For each connection you use two separate messaging queues to send and receive messages via different servers.

                            The servers have separate <span data-glossary="tooltip-anonymous-credentials">Anonymous credentials</span> for each queue, and do not know which users they belong to.

                            Users can further improve metadata privacy by using Tor to access servers, preventing corellation by IP address.
