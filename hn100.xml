 k.e. iverson[1920-2004] advisor:APL turing award'79
 john cocke  [1925-2002] advisor:RISC turing award'87

benchmarks: same machine. same data. same queries. (apples-to-apples)

h20:     1Billion rows  k is about 100 times faster than polars datatable ..
taxi:    1Billion rows  k is about 100 times faster than biggie shifty sparky ..
taq:  1000Billion rows  only k (incl. kx.com) can do the asof joins in our lifetime.
stac: 2000Billion rows  only k (incl. kx.com) can do these queries.

time - user and machine - is expensive. pandas and polars are free - god bless them - so

            1,000 rows: use excel
        1,000,000 rows: use polars
    1,000,000,000 rows: use k

<p><a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e">Stealing everything you’ve ever typed or viewed on your own Windows PC is now possible with two lines of code — inside the Copilot+ Recall disaster</a> (<a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/112537206611365804" title="@GossiTheDog">via</a>) Recall is a new feature in Windows 11 which takes a screenshot every few seconds, runs local device OCR on it and stores the resulting text in a SQLite database. This means you can search back through your previous activity, against local data that has remained on your device.</p>
<p>The security and privacy implications here are still enormous because malware can now target a single file with huge amounts of valuable information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During testing this with an off the shelf infostealer, I used Microsoft Defender for Endpoint — which detected the off the shelve infostealer — but by the time the automated remediation kicked in (which took over ten minutes) my Recall data was already long gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like Kevin Beaumont's argument here about the subset of users this feature is appropriate for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a surface level, it is great if you are a manager at a company with too much to do and too little time as you can instantly search what you were doing about a subject a month ago.</p>
<p>In practice, that audience’s needs are a very small (tiny, in fact) portion of Windows userbase — and frankly talking about screenshotting the things people in the <em>real world</em>, not executive world, is basically like punching customers in the face.</p>

               <span size="2"><p>Hello, this is Florine from the ROOT team! Over the past year, I’ve been working
as a technical student funded by ATLAS to evaluate and help further develop
RNTuple. As you may already be aware, RNTuple <a href="#rntuple-evolution">[1]</a> is
currently being developed as the successor to TTree, and is projected to be
used in Run 4. I imagine you might be wondering why there is a need for a
completely new (TTree-incompatible) system, and what this looks like. That’s why
in this blog post, I will try to answer this question, as well as give you an
overview of the current status of RNTuple, what we’re still working on before
its first production release (and what we will work on beyond this), and
finally how you can already try it out!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p> February 27, 2022 </p><div> <p>There’s a radio station in Colorado that broadcasts the time.</p>
<p>It’s WWVB, the station that the National Institute of Standards and Technology uses to broadcast the current time, tuned to the 60 kHz frequency. Day and night, this station diligently continues broadcasting.</p>
<p>60 kHz is at a “low frequency” part of the spectrum, which means the bandwidth is just enough to broadcast a single digit of binary every second. It takes a full minute just to broadcast the current time.</p>
<p>The WWVB station is used by every radio clock in the United States. They read the minute-long broadcast once a day or so, and set themselves to that time. Then, they offset the broadcasted time by whatever time zone you’ve set on the clock, since WWVB doesn’t know what time zone you’re in.</p>
<p>That’s how radio clocks accurately know the current time without you needing to set them. They read it from the airwaves.</p>
<p>Clever, isn’t it? We needed a way for clocks to set their own time, so the government set up a radio station that broadcasts the current time forever.</p>
<p>This kind of thing is exceedingly cool to me. That the solution feels like it’s just <em>neat</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not particularly patriotic, but this kind of thing feels particularly American. Perhaps my imagination of American innovation is still set in the era of lunar missions and radio. But we had a problem, and we solved it with technology. And none of that fancy newfangled technology — we solved it using&nbsp;<em>solid</em> technology, the kind that you can touch with your hands and that buzzes in the airwaves.</p>
<p>It’s also a reminder that we owe the way the world works to an unimaginable number of invisible people who have come before us. Everything around builds atop the contributions of people, not unlike us, who tried to leave the world a little better than they’d found it.</p> </div>  </div></div>]]></description>

        A set of common UI elements with a hand-drawn, sketchy look. These can be used for wireframes, mockups, or just
        the fun hand-drawn
        look.
      </p>
      <p>
        The elements are drawn with enough randomness that no two renderings will be exactly the same — just like
        two separate
        hand-drawn shapes.

As he says, it is photographic memory of your PC life.</p><p id="b900">I got ahold of the Copilot+ software and got it working on a system without an NPU about a week ago, and I’ve been exploring how this works in practice, so we’ll have a look into it that shortly. First, I want to look at how this feature was received as I think it is important to understand the context.</p><p id="2619">The overwhelmingly negative reaction has probably taken Microsoft leadership by surprise. For almost everybody else, it won’t have. This was like watching Microsoft become an Apple Mac marketing department.</p><p id="e553">At a surface level, it is great if you are a manager at a company with too much to do and too little time as you can instantly search what you were doing about a subject a month ago.</p><p id="054e">In practice, that audience’s needs are a very small (tiny, in fact) portion of Windows userbase — and frankly talking about screenshotting the things people in the <em>real world</em>, not executive world, is basically like punching customers in the face. The echo chamber effect inside Microsoft is real here, and oh boy… just oh boy. It’s a rare misfire, I think.</p><p id="7111">I think it’s an interesting <em>entirely, </em><strong><em>really </em></strong>optional feature with a niche initial user base that would require incredibly careful communication, cybersecurity, engineering and implementation. Copilot+ Recall doesn’t have these. The work hasn’t been done properly to package it together, clearly.</p><p id="b19a">A lot of Windows users just want their PCs so they can play games, watch porn, and live their lives as human beings who make mistakes.. that they don’t always want to remember, and the idea other people with access to the device could see a photographic memory is.. very scary to a great many people on a deeply personal level. Windows is a personal experience. This shatters that belief.</p><p id="cff5">I think they are probably going to set fire to the entire Copilot brand due to how poorly this has been implemented and rolled out. It’s an act of self harm at Microsoft in the name of AI, and by proxy real customer harm.</p><p id="38a6">More importantly, at the time I pointed out this <a href="http://If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, Windows will save snapshots of the screen and users will be able to search for or browse through a timeline of their past activities using Recall." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">fundamentally breaks the promise of security in Windows</a>.</p><p id="ae6d">I’d now like to detail why. Strap in — this is crazy.</p></div><div><p id="3526">I’m going to structure this as a Q&amp;A with myself now, based on comments online, as it’s really interesting seeing how some people handwave the issues away.</p><p id="ea19"><strong>Q. The data is processed entirely locally on your laptop, right?</strong></p><p id="fff7">A. Yes! They made some smart decisions here, there’s a whole subsystem of Azure AI etc code that process on the edge.</p><p id="b03c"><strong>Q. Cool, so hackers and malware can’t access it, right?</strong></p><p id="007d">A. No, they can.</p><p id="2d3a"><strong>Q. But it’s encrypted.</strong></p><p id="fd06">A. When you’re logged into a PC and run software, things are decrypted for you. Encryption at rest only helps if somebody comes to your house and physically steals your laptop — that isn’t what criminal hackers do.</p><p id="a323">For example, InfoStealer trojans, which automatically steal usernames and passwords, are a major problem for well over a decade — now these can just be easily modified to support Recall.</p><p id="bcd0"><strong>Q. But the BBC said data cannot be accessed remotely by hackers.</strong></p><p id="8721">A. They were quoting Microsoft, but this is wrong. Data can be accessed remotely.</p><figure></figure><p id="b9a0">This is what the journalist was told for some reason:</p><figure></figure><p id="59c6"><strong>Q. Microsoft say only that user can access the data.</strong></p><p id="2fcd">A. This isn’t true, I can demonstrate another user account on the same device accessing the database.</p><p id="68c7"><strong>Q. So how does it work?</strong></p><p id="2bb4">A. Every few seconds, screenshots are taken. These are automatically OCR’d by Azure AI, running on your device, and written into an SQLite database in the user’s folder.</p><p id="7050">This database file has a record of everything you’ve ever viewed on your PC in plain text. OCR is a process of looking an image, and extracting the letters.</p><p id="1e88"><strong>Q. What does the database look like?</strong></p><p id="5247">A:</p><figure></figure><p id="f17f"><strong>Q. How do you obtain the database files?</strong></p><p id="9624">A. They’re just files in AppData, in the new CoreAIPlatform folder.</p><p id="2079"><strong>Q. But it’s highly encrypted and nobody can access them, right?!</strong></p><p id="5407">A. Here’s a few second video of two Microsoft engineers accessing the folder:</p><figure></figure><p id="d89d"><strong>Q. …But, normal users don’t run as admins!</strong></p><p id="2985">A. According to Microsoft’s own website, in their Recall rollout page, they do:</p><figure></figure><p id="f3d8">In fact, you don’t even need to be an admin to read the database — more on that in a later blog.</p><p id="1013"><strong>Q. But a UAC prompt appeared in that video, that’s a security boundary.</strong></p><p id="aac7">A. According to Microsoft’s own website (and MSRC), UAC is not a security boundary:</p><figure></figure><p id="46a9"><strong>Q. So… where is the security here?</strong></p><p id="1d66">A. They have tried to do a bunch of things but none of it actually works properly in the real world due to gaps you can drive a plane through.</p><p id="53de"><strong>Q. Does it automatically not screenshot and OCR things like financial information?</strong></p><p id="dd01">A. No:</p><figure></figure><p id="9ee1"><strong>Q. How large is the database?</strong></p><p id="ae92">A. It compresses well, several days working is around ~90kb. You can exfiltrate several months of documents and key presses in the space of a few seconds with an average broadband connection.</p><p id="be41"><strong>Q. How fast is search?</strong></p><p id="0fad">On device, really fast.</p><p id="e412"><strong>Q. Have you exfiltrated your own Recall database?</strong></p><p id="1bd3">A. Yes. I have automated exfiltration, and made a website where you can upload a database and instantly search it.</p><p id="3f35">I am deliberately holding back technical details until Microsoft ship the feature as I want to give them time to do something.</p><p id="3dc5">I actually have a whole bunch of things to show and think the wider cyber community will have so much fun with this when generally available.. but I also think that’s really sad, as real world harm will ensue.</p><p id="6050"><strong>Q. What kind of things are in the database?</strong></p><p id="d4cb">A. Everything a user has ever seen, ordered by application. Every bit of text the user has seen, with some minor exceptions (e.g. Microsoft Edge InPrivate mode is excluded, but Google Chrome isn’t).</p><p id="a99e">Every user interaction, e.g. minimizing a window. There is an API for user activity, and third party apps can plug in to enrich data and also view store data.</p><p id="eb16">It also stores all websites you visit, even if third party.</p><p id="1c1b"><strong>Q. If I delete an email/WhatsApp/Signal/Teams message, is it deleted from Recall?</strong></p><p id="9afd">A. No, it stays in the database indefinitely.</p><p id="b22e"><strong>Q. Are auto deleting messages in messaging apps removed from Recall?</strong></p><p id="cf49">A. No, they’re scraped by Recall and available.</p><p id="d120"><strong>Q. But if a hacker gains access to run code on your PC, it’s already game over!</strong></p><p id="f14c">A. If you run something like an info stealer, at present they will automatically scrape things like credential stores. At scale, hackers scrape rather than touch every victim (because there are so many) and resell them in online marketplaces.</p><p id="0110">Recall enables threat actors to automate scraping everything you’ve ever looked at within seconds.</p><p id="c716">During testing this with an off the shelf infostealer, I used Microsoft Defender for Endpoint — which detected the off the shelve infostealer — but by the time the automated remediation kicked in (which took over ten minutes) my Recall data was already long gone.</p><p id="87cd"><strong>Q. Does this enable mass data breaches of website?</strong></p><p id="b1f3">A. Yes. The next time you see a major data breach where customer data is clearly visible in the breach, you’re going to presume company who processes the data are at fault, right?</p><p id="4995">But if people have used a Windows device with Recall to access the service/app/whatever, hackers can see everything and assemble data dumps without the company who runs the service even being aware. The data is already consistently structured in the Recall database for attackers.</p><p id="45da">So prepare for AI powered super breaches. Currently credential marketplaces exist where you can buy stolen passwords — soon, you will be able to buy stolen customer data from insurance companies etc as the entire code to do this has been preinstalled and enabled on Windows by Microsoft.</p><p id="b557"><strong>Q. Did Microsoft mislead the BBC about the security of Copilot?</strong></p><p id="ec43">A. Yes.</p><p id="840e"><strong>Q. Have Microsoft mislead customers about the security of Copilot?</strong></p><p id="6211">A. Yes. For example, they describe it as an optional experience — but it is enabled by default and people can optionally disable it. That’s wordsmithing. Microsoft’s CEO referred to “screenshots” in an interview about the product, but the product itself only refers to “snapshots” — a snapshot is actually a screenshot. It’s again wordsmithing for whatever reason. Microsoft just need to be super clear about what this is, so customers can make an informed choice.</p><p id="00ab"><strong>Q. Recall only applies to 1 hardware device!</strong></p><p id="0f41">A. That isn’t true.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>In this blog post, we benchmark different strategies for handling errors in Go and discuss their
relative performance and other tradeoffs. The difference in performance between different strategies
was very surprising to us, and we'd like to share the results.</p>
<p><em>The original publication of this blog overstated the difference in performance between error

<p>In particular, we were shocked to learn that <strong>naively using the sentinel error pattern combined
with errors.Is() slows your code down by over 5x</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="methodology"><a href="#methodology" aria-label="methodology permalink"></a>Methodology</h2>
<p>I wrote several different fake object stores with similar methods to retrieve an object, with
different method signatures and different ways to represent the value being not found. Here's one of
them, which follows a common recommendation in the Go community to use a sentinel error to represent
the "value not found" condition.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> notFoundErr <span>=</span> errors<span>.</span><span>New</span><span>(</span><span>"not found"</span><span>)</span>

<span>type</span> resultType <span>struct</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>type</span> errStore <span>struct</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span>b <span>*</span>errStore<span>)</span> <span>GetValue</span><span>(</span>found <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>resultType<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> found <span>{</span>

	<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> notFoundErr
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then I set up a benchmark that calls this function over and over, testing both the case where the
value is found and where it's not found, in the same way a client calling this method would need to
do.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>BenchmarkNotFoundErrEqual</span><span>(</span>b <span>*</span>testing<span>.</span>B<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>We'll look in depth at each of these strategies in a moment. The tables below list the error
handling strategies from fastest to slowest. We break the results down into the "found" and "not
found" scenarios, since their relative performance is different in each one.</p>
<p>First, here's the speed and relative performance of each strategy when the value is not found:</p>

<p>As you can see, it matters quite a lot for performance how you you design your APIs and handle
errors in Go.</p>
<p>Let's examine each strategy, going in order from fastest to slowest.</p>
<h2 id="bool-dont-return-an-error"><a href="#bool-dont-return-an-error" aria-label="bool dont return an error permalink"></a><code>Bool</code>: don't return an error</h2>
<p>The fastest way to handle a "not found" condition in Go is to not represent it as an error. This is
labled as the <code>Bool</code> strategy above. Here's how it's implemented:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> boolStore <span>struct</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span>b <span>*</span>boolStore<span>)</span> <span>GetValue</span><span>(</span>found <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>resultType<span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> found <span>{</span>
		<span>return</span> <span>&amp;</span>resultType<span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
	<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, this method does not return an error when the value isn't found, instead returning a
boolean <code>found</code> result. Here's how it's benchmarked:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>BenchmarkNotFoundBool</span><span>(</span>b <span>*</span>testing<span>.</span>B<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

			b<span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>"expected nil"</span><span>)</span>

	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>BenchmarkFoundBool</span><span>(</span>b <span>*</span>testing<span>.</span>B<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

		val<span>,</span> found<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> bs<span>.</span><span>GetValue</span><span>(</span>i <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

			b<span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>"expected not nil"</span><span>)</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This strategy performs the best in both scenarios, where the value is found and where it's
not. Technically speaking this isn't even an "error handling" strategy, since no error is
returned. Rather, it's a baseline to serve as a point of comparison for other strategies that do
return errors.</p>
<h2 id="errequal-sentinel-errors-with-direct-equality-check"><a href="#errequal-sentinel-errors-with-direct-equality-check" aria-label="errequal sentinel errors with direct equality check permalink"></a><code>ErrEqual</code>: sentinel errors with direct equality check</h2>
<p>This strategy uses classic Go sentinel errors to represent the "value not found" condition. It looks
like this (duplicated from the "Methodology" section above).</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> errStore <span>struct</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>(</span>b <span>*</span>errStore<span>)</span> <span>GetValue</span><span>(</span>found <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span>resultType<span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

		<span>return</span> <span>&amp;</span>resultType<span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
	<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> notFoundErr
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we benchmark this strategy, we use direct <code>==</code> comparison with an <code>error</code> constant to detect
the not found condition.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>BenchmarkNotFoundErrEqual</span><span>(</span>b <span>*</span>testing<span>.</span>B<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the "not found" scenario, this approach is about 2x slower than using boolean existence
checks. For the case where the value is found, it performs the same.</p>
<p>Note that checking for sentinel errors with <code>==</code> is no longer recommended for correctness reasons,
more details in following sections.</p>
<h2 id="errequalnilcheck-sentinel-errors-wrapped-with-a-err--nil-check"><a href="#errequalnilcheck-sentinel-errors-wrapped-with-a-err--nil-check" aria-label="errequalnilcheck sentinel errors wrapped with a err  nil check permalink"></a><code>ErrEqualNilCheck</code>: sentinel errors wrapped with a <code>err != nil</code> check</h2>
<p>There are two roughly equally idiomatic ways to check for a sentinel error in Go. The first is more
common in our experience, and is what's done in the <code>ErrEqual</code> strategy:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>		<span>if</span> err <span>==</span> notFoundErr <span>{</span>
			<span>// nothing to do</span>
		<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
			b<span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span>
		<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So you begin by checking for all sentinel error values you want to handle, either in a switch or an
<code>if / else</code> chain, and then if the error isn't one of the handled types, pass the error up the
stack, panic, or otherwise handle it.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can perform the above logic conditionally after first checking if the error is
non-nil. This code is slightly longer and more indented, and is what the <code>ErrEqualNilCheck</code> does.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>BenchmarkNotFoundErrEqualNilCheck</span><span>(</span>b <span>*</span>testing<span>.</span>B<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>var</span> es errStore
	<span>for</span> i <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> b<span>.</span>N<span>;</span> i<span>++</span> <span>{</span>
		val<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> es<span>.</span><span>GetValue</span><span>(</span>i <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

<p>This stategy is slightly worse than the previous one in the "not found" case because of the added
cost of the <code>nil</code> check, weighing in at about 2.5x slower than boolean existence checks. But in the
(usually more common) case when the value is found, it's also performs just as well as the boolean
strategy.</p>
<h2 id="errorsis-more-robust-sentinel-error-detection"><a href="#errorsis-more-robust-sentinel-error-detection" aria-label="errorsis more robust sentinel error detection permalink"></a><code>ErrorsIs</code>: more robust sentinel error detection</h2>
<p>The original sentinel error pattern using <code>==</code> caused problems when other parts of a library wanted
to wrap the original error in their own error type to add additional information, which causes the
equality check to fail. Many linters will warn about using <code>==</code> for sentinel errors, and my
JetBrains IDE puts a yellow squiggly under it for the same reason.</p>
<p>Modern best practice is to instead use <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-31-benchmarking-go-error-handling/%7Bhttps://pkg.go.dev/errors#example-Is">errors.Is()</a> for
sentinel error checks, which correctly detects wrapped errors.</p>

<p>Usually errors in Go are returned as values, but there is also another technique: you can <code>panic</code>
instead, then <code>recover</code> that panic at a higher layer of the stack. Most people don't recommend doing
this as an error handling technique, and we don't either. But there are some limited cases where it
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-14-keep-calm-and-panic/">can be more performant than returning

<p>This code is 240x slower than boolean return results in the not found case, and 13x slower in the
found case. So in addition to being risky (can halt your program if you forget to recover), panics
are generally slower than any other error handling strategy.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-error-wrapping"><a href="#what-about-error-wrapping" aria-label="what about error wrapping permalink"></a>What about error wrapping?</h2>
<p>These are microbenchmarks specifically engineered to zero in on the differences between the error
handling strategies. But real application code looks very different. One of the biggest differences
is that errors are typically passed through several layers of the stack in between other pieces of
business logic. I was curious to know how this difference impacted the benchmarks. Specifically, I
wanted to know how the practice of error wrapping impacted the performance of sentinel errors, and
how it related to the Boolean return strategy.</p>
<p>So I wrote two additional implementations of object stores that simulate an error deeper in the
stack, getting wrapped at every layer. Here's what it looks like:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>type</span> wrappedErrStore <span>struct</span><span>{</span><span>}</span>

<p>I also have another identical implementation that returns a boolean value to indicate presence or
absence of the value, rather than <code>notFoundErr</code> (omitted for brevity), symmetrical to the <code>Bool</code>
strategy. When I run the same benchmarks on these two implementations, I get the following results.</p>

<p>As you can see, wrapped errors severely degrade the performance of tihs strategy, making sentinel
error checks 120x slower than the boolean check when the error is non-nil. That's bad! Much of the
difference in time on this benchmark doesn't come directly from errors.Is() (although it is slower
for wrapped errors, that's to be expected). Instead, this difference primarily reflects the fact
that creating the wrapped errors is itself expensive. But this is a fair comparison, since in
practice your code must also wrap errors to use this strategy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the difference in strategies is partially smeared by the introduction of more
stack layers in the case the object exists, to the point that the nil-guarded <code>errors.Is()</code> check is
only 10% slower than boolean checks.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways-and-discussion"><a href="#takeaways-and-discussion" aria-label="takeaways and discussion permalink"></a>Takeaways and discussion</h2>
<p>If you want to reproduce this result or variations of it yourself, you can find the full source
<a href="https://gist.github.com/zachmu/00d0410431f9d8d314155361836eecdd">here</a>.</p>
<p>So what's the takeaway from all this? There are four main points in my view:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>errors.Is()</code> is expensive. If you use it, check the error is non-nil first to avoid a pretty big
performance penalty on the happy path.</li>
<li>Using <code>==</code> to check for sentinel errors is likewise expensive, but less so. If you do this, check
the error is non-nil first to make it cheaper on the happy path. But because of error wrapping,
you probably shouldn't do this at all.</li>
<li>Error wrapping makes using sentinel errors much more expensive, including making <code>errors.Is()</code>
more expensive when the error is non-nil.</li>
<li>Using sentinel errors is as performant as other techniques on the happy path if you take the
above precautions, but unavoidably much more expensive on the error path.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the main takeaway is really that sentinel errors can be expensive, and you should consider this
when deciding whether to use them.</p>
<p>The standard caveat for performance-based arguments applies here: measure what difference it
actually makes in your case, and don't sweat stuff that isn't on the hot path most of the time. We
are talking about nanoseconds here, and it takes a lot of those to add up to something
noticeable. If sentinel errors are measurably slow for you in practice, it's probably because the
ones you're using are some combination of commonly triggered and expensive to construct. YMMV. That
said: we have found expensive-to-construct, commonly triggered sentinel errors when profiling our
database, and we changed the code to remove them, squeezing several percentage points improvement in
the process.</p>
<p>But there are also non-performance reasons you might want to avoid sentinel errors, which are more
philosophical or aesthetic in nature.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I kicked the hornet's nest by suggesting that <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-10-ok-considered-harmful/">you shouldn't name boolean map
check variables <code>ok</code></a>. It got picked
up a few places in the Golang world and generated a lot of discussion on Reddit and elsewhere, which
I had expected. But I hadn't expected that so much of the conversation would focus on an almost
tangential point I made about API design, specifically about an API returning a <code>NotFound</code> sentinel
error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Separating out an existence check from an error condition is a good thing, actually. You never
want to force clients to check for a particular error type in business logic.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>An error should by default be considered non-recoverable, to be returned when something goes very
wrong. Semantically, a table not existing isn't really an error, it's something you expect to
happen all the time. An interface that returns an error in the course of normal operation forces
clients to understand a lot of details to use the interface correctly (looking at you,
<code>io.EOF</code>). And errors can be expensive to construct and examine, so you don't want them
constructed or interpreted on your hot path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had thought this was a commonly understood nugget of best practice wisdom, but this opinion got <em>a
lot</em> of pushback. People said some very hurtful, arguably accurate things about my character. Here's
one of the more thoughtful examples from <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/lnav33/ok_considered_harmful">the discussion on

<p>Now, obviously I disagree. And I think these numbers pretty clearly refute the classical view of
sentinel error handling in Go, summarized by the comment above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Errors are normal outcomes of any operation. They aren’t special and aren’t any more or less
expensive to deal with than any other type. They are, classically, just values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that sentinel errors, as typically and idiomatically used, in fact <em>are</em> special, and
<em>are</em> more expensive to deal with than other values. My suggestion to use boolean values outperforms
them by <em>a lot</em>, 6x in fairly common idiomatic usage and potentially much more if they're expensive
to construct.</p>
<p>And performance considerations aside, sentinel errors have a lot of other issues.</p>
<p>I'm not the first person to note this. Here's <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/27/dont-just-check-errors-handle-them-gracefully">Dave Cheney back in 2016 on this
topic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My advice is to avoid using sentinel error values in the code you write. There are a few cases
where they are used in the standard library, but this is not a pattern that you should emulate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, he recommends never inspecting the details of an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now we come to the third category of error handling. In my opinion this is the most flexible error
handling strategy as it requires the least coupling between your code and caller.</p>
<p>I call this style opaque error handling, because while you know an error occurred, you don’t have
the ability to see inside the error. As the caller, all you know about the result of the operation
is that it worked, or it didn’t.</p>
<p>This is all there is to opaque error handling – just return the error without assuming anything
about its contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dave didn't invent this advice. Going back further, lots of luminaries and philosophers in the field
have given the same advice in other contexts and for other languages: don't use errors for control
flow. I'm old enough to have seen Josh Bloch in person at a Java conference, where he was something
of a celebrity. He gave this advice on error handling in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/">Effective
Java</a> way back in 2001:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exceptions are, as their name implies, to be used only for exceptional conditions; they should
never be used for ordinary control flow.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This principle also has implications for API design. A well-designed API must not force its
clients to use exceptions for ordinary control flow. A class with a “state-dependent” method that
can be invoked only under certain unpredictable conditions should generally have a separate
“state-testing” method indicating whether it is appropriate to invoke the state-dependent method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now obviously Exceptions in Java are not the same as errors in Go. But just as obviously, they serve
the same purpose. Functionally and semantically, there is not much difference between these two code
snippets:</p>
<div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    val <span>=</span> store<span>.</span><span>getValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>NotFoundException</span> e<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// handle not found</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>val<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> store<span>.</span><span>GetValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> errors<span>.</span><span>Is</span><span>(</span>err<span>,</span> notFoundErr<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// handle not found</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>They're both workable and idiomatic. But they also both have serious drawbacks, for different but
related reasons. And they're both improved by changing the API to eliminate the need for the client
to interpret the not found case as an error during normal operation. Here the two languages diverge:
because Java lacks multiple return values, it's not ergonomic to add additional metadata like a
<code>found</code> boolean into the return result in most cases, so you tend to do something like this instead:</p>
<div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span>store<span>.</span><span>hasValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    val <span>=</span> store<span>.</span><span>getValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Bloch anticipates that people might be tempted to use exceptions for control flow for performance
reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More generally, use standard, easily recognizable idioms in preference to overly clever techniques
that purport to offer better performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, it really is more expensive to call two methods (<code>Has()</code>, <code>Get()</code>) than one (<code>Get()</code>),
even with caching. But because Go does have multiple return values, you don't have to make this
tradeoff the way you do in Java. You can just return more information and save yourself the extra
method call, while not forcing clients to examine the error value.</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>val<span>,</span> found<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> store<span>.</span><span>GetValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> err <span>// opaque error handling</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>!</span>found <span>{</span>
    <span>// handle not found</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Some people are bothered by the fact that a method named <code>GetValue()</code> may not succeed in getting a
value. If that sounds like you, then name it <code>MaybeGetValue()</code> instead. Other people are bothered by
the code overhead of a <code>found</code> boolean in the return. If that sounds like you, you might be able to
get away with using a <code>nil</code> return value instead (as long as <code>nil</code> isn't a valid object in your
API). Either way, understand that inspecting errors for business logic can come at a substantial
performance cost.</p>

<p>We're building <a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a>, the world's first version-controlled SQL database. We
have been writing it for over five years now, and our codebase has quite a few sentinel errors, many
of which we inherited from other libraries, but some of which we wrote ourselves. These days we
avoid sentinel errors and generally treat all errors as opaque. We also wrap errors very sparingly,
prefering to <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-10-stack-traces-in-go/">use stack traces instead</a>
where appropriate.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article><p>Over the past few years, I have tried to gradually reduce or eliminate my use of
Google products and services. It has been difficult to ditch Google’s products
in some categories, and in some others, it has been nigh impossible. Here, I
list the services I have tried to find alternatives for, discuss the ease (or
lack thereof) of finding a satisfactory alternative, and rant about my
experience so far.</p><p>Before we begin, I feel like I should put a few important caveats out of the
way. First, these are notes from personal experience, and are not a
comprehensive review of alternatives to Google’s offerings. If you are looking
for comparisons of alternatives, they are not here. Second, using some of the
alternatives I mention requires having a self-hosted server setup of some sort,
which for many people will be entirely out of the question.</p><h2 id="search">Search</h2><p>I have used DuckDuckGo as my primary search engine for the past six or seven
years, and although it has its flaws, it has been adequate. The problem with
DuckDuckGo is that in many cases, it doesn’t seem to show a good understanding
of the search query, for lack of a better way to put it. It takes my search
terms too literally. It’s saving grace, though, is the ‘bang’ feature: if you
decide that the results are not what you hoped for and you wish to go to Google
instead, just add a <code>!g</code> in your search. This works not just for Google but for
a long list of websites, and I find this feature incredibly handy when I know
beforehand that I want to search a particular website, like Wikipedia, YouTube
or Amazon.</p><p>After reading constant praise for it on HackerNews, I tried
<a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> for couple of months last year. Kagi has a lot of
strengths. Just out of the box, it’s results are markedly better than DuckDuckGo
and perhaps even Google. Their feature to up-rank or down-rank websites of your
choosing is an absolute lifesaver. Not having to wade through SEO’d junk to find
what I need prevents a lot of frustration. That said, I had two major issues
with Kagi. First, their cheapest subscription tier has a limit of 300 searches
monthly, and I would find myself running against the limit halfway into the
billing period. I would have gladly paid for the unlimited tier, if not for my
second issue with Kagi: privacy-wise, I simply don’t believe that a service that
requires login and thus naturally associates all your activity with your
identity is better than a service which can be used without a login. So I’m
sticking to DuckDuckGo for the time being.</p><h2 id="e-mail">E-Mail</h2><p>Unlike Search and many other categories in this list, it is not difficult to
find a capable alternative e-mail service. I personally use
<a href="https://proton.me/mail">ProtonMail</a> and <a href="https://fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>.
Proton positions itself as the privacy-focused option, and claim to have
end-to-end encryption. They bundle e-mail with storage, calendar, VPN and a
password manager at a very reasonable rate. I will continue using ProtonMail as
one of my email accounts, but I don’t like the fact it is difficult to use
third-party email clients with their service. Yes, that is due to how they do
end-to-end encryption, and I don’t have a reason to doubt their honesty, but is
it <em>really</em> end-to-end encryption if you don’t have sole ownership and full
control of your keys?</p><p>Besides moving away from Google, I also decided I want to own the whole of my
email address, including the domain name. So, a year and a half ago I started
using Fastmail with a custom domain. A feature of Fastmail I like and use all
the time is masked email, but in fairness a lot of services provide this feature
these days. Unlike Proton, FastMail makes no claims of extreme privacy, but I
lke it because it has a nice and clean web UI and it works with my favorite FOSS
e-mail client on Android.</p><h2 id="photos">Photos</h2><p>Back in the days when Google Photos had free unlimited photo storage, it was
pretty much unbeatable. Yes, the resolution was capped to 16 megapixels, but
during the time I relied on Google Photos, I didn’t have a phone with a camera
capable of much higher resolution. After Google axed the unlimited storage,
other photo storage services seem pretty competitive with Google Photos. At a
glance, Microsoft OneDrive, iCloud, Amazon Photos and DropBox all seem like
options I would at least consider. But I have not tried any of those services
and have no plans to do so, because I self-host a personal instance of
<a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> to store all my photos. In just a couple of years,
Immich has gone from zero to having a very rich feature-set, and although it
doesn’t have a stable release yet, it is stable enough for me. Using the
<a href="https://github.com/simulot/immich-go">immich-go</a> CLI tool, it is a breeze to
import media from your Google Takeout export to Immich as well.</p><h2 id="drive">Drive</h2><p>Cloud storage of files is an easy switch: there are many, many file storage
providers available with very competitive pricing. For myself, I initially used
a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> instance I self-host. I still have some of
my files in Nextcloud, but I found it to be slow when syncing a large amount of
files, so I opted for a simpler solution. All my important files are now in a
directory in my home server, and when I need access to them I just mount the
directory in my laptop with <code>sshfs</code>. In case I need a web interface, I have a
<a href="https://filebrowser.org/">FileBrowser</a> instance running. Side note: I love how
simple FileBrowser is. It does the things I need and not a thing more.</p><p>I realize switching to a different storage provider will be more difficult for
people who use Google Drive for collaboration and need to share files often with
other people. Fortunately, in my case what I needed was just to not lose my
files if my laptop goes belly up, and to be able to occasionally access
important files from my phone.</p><p>Using most calendar and contacts clients with different providers, and switching
between them, is more or less straightforward thanks to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV">CardDAV</a> open protocols. I use my
NextCloud instance as the server for both, and it works flawlessly. On the
client side, I use <a href="https://github.com/FossifyOrg">Fossify</a> Calendar and
GrapheneOS’s default contacts app along with <a href="https://www.davx5.com/">DavX5</a> to
facilitate the synchronization. I recently discovered that the Calendar and
Contacts apps that come with the Gnome Desktop Environment support CalDAV and
CardDAV as well, so that’s neat! I can now view or update my calendar and
contact list from my phone, laptop or the browser!</p><p>For people who can’t or don’t want to self-host a Nextcloud instance, there are
plenty of ‘cloud productivity suite’ providers that provide file storage,
calendar, contact and email services with a single account. Microsoft Outlook
and Apple iCloud are the most popular ones, but privacy-focused alternatives
like Proton are growing.</p><h2 id="phone">Phone</h2><p>Let me begin by saying that I am extremely grateful that
<a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> exists. It is Android but with privacy and
security features that severely limit the capacity of big tech to spy on you.
This includes Google itself, as GrapheneOS by default comes without all the apps
and services that Google includes on a regular Android phone. Optionally, you
can install Google Play Services, but as a regular, ‘sandboxed’ app: which means
Google has the same privilege as any other app in your phone, and you can decide
what permissions to allow it. But the catch is… well, there are several.
Whether or not you’ll find them acceptable depends on where your preference lies
in the privacy-convenience trade-off scale. Because unfortunately, you must
sacrifice one to get more of the other. The first issue is that it only runs on
Google Pixel devices. This is because the GrapheneOS project has a <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices">sizable list
of security and support requirements</a>
that a device will need to fulfill to be supported, and apparently only Google
Pixel devices do at the moment. If you already have a Pixel phone (like I did
when I first decided to try GrapheneOS), this is not an issue. If you don’t
already have one though, you’ll have to make a decision about whether you want
to support Google’s business by buying a device they produce, even though you’re
doing that so you can give Google less control of your digital life. To me, that
feels like an acceptable trade-off.</p><p>The other issue is that many apps will either not work, or will be partially
broken. I have used GrapheneOS for a total of 16 months in two stints, 8 months
each in two devices; first a Pixel 3a and now a Pixel 7. Until about 2 months
ago, I used it without the (sandboxed) Google Play Services. In this
configuration, there is a whole category of applications you cannot use: most
prominently, banking and finance apps will just refuse to work. Many apps that
work will have some features broken: notifications in particular will be missing
for a lot of apps. Some apps will keep complaining that your phone does not have
Google Play Services and thus is not supported, but still continue to mostly
work (looking at you, Snapchat). But I found I could still manage. Apps like
Telegram, Signal and Whatsapp use their own notification delivery mechanism, so
they aren’t impacted as long as you turn off battery optimization for them. All
the banks I have accounts with have mobile websites that work reasonably well. I
was even able to take trips through Uber’s mobile website, which was a pleasant
surprise. The location functionality did not work, but I believe that was due
more to the browser than to Uber itself. I tried to get as many apps as possible
from F-droid, the app store for open-source Android apps. For proprietary apps,
I used Aurora store, which is an alternative open-source client for the Google
Play Store. Not ideal, but better than manually downloading APKs from websites
like APKPure and APKMirror.</p><p>About two months ago, in a moment of frustration, I decided to install the
sandboxed Google Play Services and Google Play Store to see if that would
improve my experience. Some things are noticeably better: for instance,
notifications work for all apps, installing new apps is way easier, and I can
install and use some financial apps without issues. It is still far from the
regular Android experience; for instance, apps don’t auto-update, you have to
manually go into Google Play Store and update them. This is unfortunate, but you
necessarily lose some functionality when you limit the god-like permissions
Google has on a regular Android device.</p><p>Slight tangent: one of my big gripes here is with Android Auto. Contrary to what
the name might suggest, Android Auto is not part of the <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source
Project (AOSP)</a>. Instead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Auto">it is a proprietary
standard</a>, and the Android Auto app
on your phone is a proprietary app that has privileged access to your system. If
I want turn-by-turn navigation in my car’s head unit out of an open-source maps
app on my phone, that is simply not possible without a privileged, proprietary
app in between to mediate. Before January 2024, it was not even possible to use
Android Auto in GrapheneOS, but now it is at least supported, although it does
depend on the sandboxed Google Play being installed as well.</p><p>Every time I am frustrated with the state of things with GrapheneOS, I think
about getting an iPhone, using it without any Google apps, and enjoying the
‘just works’ nature of Apple products. But then I would be handing over control
of a large part of my digital life to another big tech company, so I haven’t
bought an iPhone yet. Apple does like to make a big deal of at least pretending
to care more about your privacy than the rest of Big Tech, but I would rather
not rely on promises if I can, and where possible, use open-source software
stacks I can trust. So I’m sticking with GrapheneOS on my Pixel, at least for
the near future.</p><h2 id="maps">Maps</h2><p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is a fantastic dataset and in
many cases, is better than Google Maps in terms of map accuracy. I use it a lot.
But Google Maps is much more than just the map data: it has client apps across
different platforms with a consistent interface, routing and turn-by-turn
navigation, public transport information, live traffic data, and most
importantly for me, business reviews and opening hours. For the last one,
Google’s sheer size means that the network effects are on their side, and I’m
not aware of any effort to create an open dataset of business reviews. All this
means that it is difficult to quit Google Maps entirely. OpenStreetMap-based
apps like <a href="https://organicmaps.app/">Organic Maps</a> are great and I frequently
use them, but I find myself using the Google Maps website a lot, for tasks like
searching for restaurants to getting an estimate of how long my commute is going
to take.</p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><p>The sad reality here is that YouTube essentially has no alternative. Yes, it is
technologically difficult to deliver video to the internet in a way that is
cost-effective, but the problem that is orders of magnitude more difficult is
that of building a critical mass of creators and viewers that the network effect
takes over. All the creators are on YouTube, so everyone goes there for content.
All the viewers are on YouTube, so creators put their videos there. There are
platforms that are trying to provide an alternative, but they are mostly unknown
to the general populace. I have never given serious thought to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerTube">PeerTube</a> because I don’t know of any
creators I watch that upload their videos to a PeerTube instance. I think
<a href="https://nebula.tv/">Nebula.tv</a> is promising, and a bunch of creators I like
upload their videos on it. I do have a Nebula account but rarely end up using
it, since most videos get uploaded to YouTube as well, and when I open Nebula, I
find myself having already watched all the interesting videos on YouTube.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>At this point in time, it is exceedingly difficult to fully avoid using Google
products and services, and you’ll need to sacrifice a lot of convenience in your
attempts to use alternatives. Nevertheless, capable and privacy-friendly
alternatives exist for many product segments in which Google dominates, and I
think it is worthwhile to reduce your dependence on Google where you can. If you
are so inclined, self-hosting can provide even more freedom and privacy.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

We show that their tools do reduce errors compared to general-purpose AI models like GPT-4. That is a substantial improvement and we document instances where these tools provide sound and detailed legal research. But even these bespoke legal AI tools still hallucinate an alarming amount of the time: the Lexis+ AI and Ask Practical Law AI systems produced incorrect information more than 17% of the time, while Westlaw’s AI-Assisted Research hallucinated more than 34% of the time.</span></p><blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>Read the full study, </span><a href="https://dho.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Legal_RAG_Hallucinations.pdf"><span>Hallucination-Free? Assessing the Reliability of Leading AI Legal Research Tools</span></a></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>To conduct our study, we manually constructed a pre-registered dataset of over 200 open-ended legal queries, which we designed to probe various aspects of these systems’ performance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Broadly, we investigated (1) general research questions (questions about doctrine, case holdings, or the bar exam); (2) jurisdiction or time-specific questions (questions about circuit splits and recent changes in the law); (3) false premise questions (questions that mimic a user having a mistaken understanding of the law); and (4) factual recall questions (questions about simple, objective facts that require no legal interpretation). These questions are designed to reflect a wide range of query types and to constitute a challenging real-world dataset of exactly the kinds of queries where legal research may be needed the most.</span></p><p><img src="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Hallucinations%201.png" data-entity-uuid="404ddaba-fd25-4ed2-a086-56fa9e67ddbc" data-entity-type="file" alt="comparison of hallucinated and incomplete responses" width="1328" height="1002" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong><span> Comparison of hallucinated (red) and incomplete (yellow) answers across generative legal research tools.</span></em></p><p dir="ltr"><span>These systems can hallucinate in one of two ways. First, a response from an AI tool might just be&nbsp;</span><em>incorrect</em><span>—it describes the law incorrectly or makes a factual error. Second, a response might be&nbsp;</span><em>misgrounded</em><span>—the AI tool describes the law correctly, but cites a source which does not in fact support its claims.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Given the critical importance of authoritative sources in legal research and writing, the second type of hallucination may be even more pernicious than the outright invention of legal cases. A citation might be “hallucination-free” in the narrowest sense that the citation&nbsp;</span><em>exists</em><span>, but that is not the only thing that matters. The core promise of legal AI is that it can streamline the time-consuming process of identifying relevant legal sources. If a tool provides sources that&nbsp;</span><em>seem</em><span> authoritative but are in reality irrelevant or contradictory, users could be misled. They may place undue trust in the tool's output, potentially leading to erroneous legal judgments and conclusions.</span></p><p><img src="https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/Hallucinations%202.png" data-entity-uuid="25e872e0-43c2-4c6b-965c-ad3dfd264ef2" data-entity-type="file" alt="examples of hallucinations from models" width="1600" height="927" loading="lazy"></p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Figure 2:&nbsp;</strong><span>Top left: Example of a hallucinated response by Westlaw's AI-Assisted Research product.

Given a user query (left), the typical process consists of two steps: (1) retrieval (middle), where the query is embedded with natural language processing and a retrieval system takes embeddings and retrieves the relevant documents (e.g., Supreme Court cases); and (2) generation (right), where the retrieved texts are fed to the language model to generate the response to the user query. Any of the subsidiary steps may introduce error and hallucinations into the generated response. (Icons are courtesy of FlatIcon.)</em></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Under the hood, these new legal AI tools use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce their results, a method that many tout as a potential solution to the hallucination problem. In theory, RAG allows a system to first&nbsp;</span><em>retrieve</em><span> the relevant source material and then use it to&nbsp;</span><em>generate</em><span> the correct response. In practice, however, we show that even RAG systems are not hallucination-free.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>We identify several challenges that are particularly unique to RAG-based legal AI systems, causing hallucinations.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>First, legal retrieval is hard. As any lawyer knows, finding the appropriate (or best) authority can be no easy task. Unlike other domains, the law is not entirely composed of verifiable&nbsp;</span><em>facts</em><span>—instead, law is built up over time by judges writing&nbsp;</span><em>opinions</em><span>. This makes identifying the set of documents that definitively answer a query difficult, and sometimes hallucinations occur for the simple reason that the system’s retrieval mechanism fails.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Second, even when retrieval occurs, the document that is retrieved can be an inapplicable authority. In the American legal system, rules and precedents differ across jurisdictions and time periods; documents that might be relevant on their face due to semantic similarity to a query may actually be inapposite for idiosyncratic reasons that are unique to the law. Thus, we also observe hallucinations occurring when these RAG systems fail to identify the truly binding authority. This is particularly problematic as areas where the law is in flux is precisely where legal research matters the most. One system, for instance, incorrectly recited the “undue burden” standard for abortion restrictions as good law, which was overturned in&nbsp;</span><em>Dobbs</em><span> (see Figure 2).&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Third, sycophancy—the tendency of AI to agree with the user's incorrect assumptions—also poses unique risks in legal settings. One system, for instance, naively agreed with the question’s premise that Justice Ginsburg dissented in&nbsp;</span><em>Obergefell</em><span>, the case establishing a right to same-sex marriage, and answered that she did so based on her views on international copyright. (Justice Ginsburg did not dissent in&nbsp;</span><em>Obergefell</em><span> and, no, the case had nothing to do with copyright.) Notwithstanding that answer, here there are optimistic results. Our tests showed that both systems generally navigated queries based on false premises effectively. But when these systems do agree with erroneous user assertions, the implications can be severe—particularly for those hoping to use these tools to increase access to justice among&nbsp;</span><em>pro se</em><span> and under-resourced litigants.</span></p><h2>Responsible Integration of AI Into Law Requires Transparency</h2><p dir="ltr"><span>Ultimately, our results highlight the need for rigorous and transparent benchmarking of legal AI tools. Unlike other domains, the use of AI in law remains alarmingly opaque: the tools we study provide no systematic access, publish few details about their models, and report no evaluation results at all.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This opacity makes it exceedingly challenging for lawyers to procure and acquire AI products. The large law firm&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/blaw/bloomberglawnews/business-and-practice/BNA%200000018f-1b15-dda8-a78f-1f75a0570001"><span>Paul Weiss</span></a><span> spent nearly a year and a half testing a product, and did not develop “hard metrics” because checking the AI system was so involved that it “makes any efficiency gains difficult to measure.” The absence of rigorous evaluation metrics makes responsible adoption difficult, especially for practitioners that are less resourced than Paul Weiss.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The lack of transparency also threatens lawyers’ ability to comply with ethical and professional responsibility requirements. The bar associations of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/ethics/Generative-AI-Practical-Guidance.pdf"><span>California</span></a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nysba.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Task-Force-on-AI-Report-draft-2024-04-02-FINAL.pdf"><span>New York</span></a><span>, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.floridabar.org/etopinions/opinion-24-1/"><span>Florida</span></a><span> have all recently released guidance on lawyers’ duty of supervision over work products created with AI tools. And as of May 2024,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.law360.com/pulse/ai-tracker"><span>more than 25 federal judges</span></a><span> have issued standing orders instructing attorneys to disclose or monitor the use of AI in their courtrooms.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Without access to evaluations of the specific tools and transparency around their design, lawyers may find it impossible to comply with these responsibilities. Alternatively, given the high rate of hallucinations, lawyers may find themselves having to verify each and every proposition and citation provided by these tools, undercutting the stated efficiency gains that legal AI tools are supposed to provide.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Our study is meant in no way to single out LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters. Their products are far from the only legal AI tools that stand in need of transparency—a slew of startups offer similar products and have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.midpage.ai/ChatGPT-plugin"><span>made</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://vlex.com/products/vincent-ai"><span>similar</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.paxton.ai/post/paxton-ai-has-raised-6m-to-power-fast-highly-accurate-legal-research-and-drafting-using-ai"><span>claims</span></a><span>, but they are available on even more restricted bases, making it even more difficult to assess how they function.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Based on what we know, legal hallucinations have not been solved.The legal profession should turn to public benchmarking and rigorous evaluations of AI tools.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><em>This story was updated on Thursday, May 30, 2024, to include analysis of a third AI tool, Westlaw’s AI-Assisted Research.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Paper authors: Varun Magesh is a research fellow at Stanford RegLab.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-toc-offsettop="5rem" fs-toc-element="contents"><h2>tl;dr</h2><p>Redpanda announced yesterday that they’ve acquired Benthos, and immediately made sweeping changes to the project: commercially licensing some of the most important integrations, redirecting all Benthos sites to Redpanda sites, and rebranding the Discord community to Redpanda. So TL;DR – we are (reluctantly) <a href="https://github.com/warpstreamlabs/bento" target="_blank">forking the Benthos project,</a> and maintaining it as a 100% free MIT-licensed open source project, just like Benthos was before the acquisition.</p><h2>Love at First Blob</h2><p>I first discovered the Benthos project serendipitously. I was browsing the /r/apachekafka subreddit and someone mentioned that they were using Benthos – a lightweight stream processing framework written in Go – as a simpler and more lightweight alternative to Kafka Connect. I was immediately intrigued. Kafka Connect is one of those projects in the data streaming space that <em>everyone</em> uses and <em>everyone</em> hates. A simpler and more performant alternative <em>written in Go</em>, WarpStream’s native language, immediately piqued my interest.</p><p>I Googled the project and fell in love with it pretty much right away. Unfortunately benthos.dev now redirects to a Redpanda docs site, but if you’ve never seen the original Benthos docs before, do yourself a favor and check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240520010651/https://benthos.dev/" target="_blank">old site</a>. The home page (to me at least) is <em>perfect</em>: crystal clear concise messaging with a clear explanation of the value proposition, but also cute and <em>hilariously</em> entertaining in the best way. If that doesn’t immediately make you a fan of the project’s primary author Ashley Jeffs, then check out his Benthos rap video:</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQqeWciaS9w" title="Quick FOSS Freestyle"></iframe></p></figure><p>After meeting Ashley in person at Kafka Summit London, we decided to bet on Benthos as the connect layer for WarpStream. We sponsored the project for the maximum amount allowed and (after asking and receiving Ashley’s explicit permission) <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/blog/fancy-stream-processing-made-even-more-operationally-mundane" target="_blank">embedded Benthos directly into the WarpStream Agents</a> to make it easy to integrate WarpStream with other systems and perform common lightweight stream processing tasks without needing to run any extra infrastructure. Then, a few weeks later, we <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/blog/introducing-warpstream-managed-data-pipelines-for-byoc-clusters" target="_blank">launched Managed Data Pipelines</a>, which brings a fully-managed model for managing streaming pipelines end to end, using the Benthos framework that we had already embedded into the Agents’ single Go binary.</p><p>We know Ashley well and loved working with him. He’s done an incredible amount of work over the last 7 years to build and maintain Benthos. He personally made nearly 3,500 commits on the Benthos repo, built a strong community, and most importantly, wrote some amazing software. He’s earned every cent that Redpanda paid him for the acquisition, and we couldn’t be happier for him.</p><h2>The Acquisition</h2><p>When we heard that Redpanda was going to acquire Benthos, we thought they were going to continue developing the project the same way (and under the same license) that Ashley had for the last 7 years, and that they would incorporate the already-proprietary Benthos Studio into their product. Instead, in less than 12 hours they:</p><ul role="list"><li>Changed the name of the project from Benthos to “Redpanda Connect”, and <a href="https://x.com/emaxerrno/status/1796219957589786810" target="_blank">prohibited anyone from using the term “Benthos</a>.” <sup>1</sup></li><li>Posted messages in both the Benthos Discord server and the #benthos channel in the Gophers Slack community encouraging community members to migrate to Redpanda’s Slack community instead.</li><li>Rebranded the Benthos Discord server to “Redpanda”.</li><li>Moved the Benthos Github repo to Redpanda’s repo, and split it into two repos with <em>two different licenses</em>.</li><li>Started relicensing some of the most critical integrations and connectors as proprietary<sup>2</sup> under a completely different license, <em>including some of the integrations that were written by open source contributors</em> who were not involved in the acquisition.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In just a few hours, Redpanda took a 7 year old open source project with nearly 8,000 stars on GitHub, hundreds of contributors, and thousands of users and began transitioning it to a proprietary software model.</p><p>We don’t really care what the GitHub repository is called, or how the Discord server is branded. In fact, if you go to <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/configuration/integrations" target="_blank">our docs</a>, you’ll see Redpanda Console displayed prominently as an integration because it’s a great product that helps our users get the most out of WarpStream, and we’re not afraid to give credit where credit is due<em>.</em></p><p>But we <em>do</em> care about the license change, and making sure that we’re not infringing on any trademarks (real, or imagined). And perhaps most importantly…Benthos rocks. People should be able to continue to use it freely without worrying about when the commercialization bell might toll.</p><p>Back to WarpStream, though: our unique BYOC deployment model means that our customers deploy our code and binaries into <em>their</em> environments. <em>Some</em> of the code in the core Redpanda Connect repo is still MIT-licensed, and we <em>technically</em> could have kept using <em>some</em> of it, but we couldn’t wait around to find out what the next change would be. We have to ensure that one of our most critical dependencies is being stewarded in a thoughtful and responsible manner. We also cannot, in good conscience, include any software dependencies containing mixed or muddled licensing that could be subject to change (again) at a moment's notice. Our customers deserve more stability and predictability than that.</p><p>When we started WarpStream, we didn’t see ourselves becoming the maintainers of a major open source project. In fact, we explicitly decided to <em>not</em> make WarpStream “open core” or “source available” from Day 1 because we hated the <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/blog/the-original-sin-of-cloud-infrastructure" target="_blank">perverse incentives</a> of that business model: hack distribution under the umbrella of “open source” for zero to one, and then pull the rug later by gating features, changing licenses, or crippling the open source project after the fact once critical mass has been achieved.</p><p>I’ll say it explicitly: We <em>really </em>didn’t want to create a fork. But we think that this is the only responsible thing to do given what’s happened already in just a few hours since the acquisition was announced.</p><p>So, we’re forking Benthos. We’ll be maintaining our fork as a free, open source, 100% MIT licensed project, just like Benthos was before.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/6659ff7041eea8223c23e4d1_62KLcJPSWfvRGPJXVfkoNzl4_GxA5ewnHP3JXO5kUCBuk-mCOmH-wlK0O6llelPHJPaQ6IeMD1m6w2TNNxWiLEuLSMXaNhplHo2zeN-REtB8qvhvfu_GZg1-2wb-lIeM403lnOpdYpvYX50-3A6A4FU.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Benty the Bento Box is not happy about the fork.</em></figcaption></figure><p>We’re calling our fork Bento<sup>3</sup>, an homage to the Benthos name, but separate and distinct from what is now called Redpanda Connect. We were proud to sponsor the Benthos project when it was an independent open source project, and now we’re looking forward to fostering a new project to carry on where Benthos left off.</p><p>We hope Bento becomes a place where the Benthos community can land and contribute to the project in the same spirit that the Benthos project once had - but if that doesn’t happen, that’s fine by us. We’ll keep maintaining it because our product, WarpStream Managed Data Pipelines, relies on it.</p><p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/warpstreamlabs/bento" target="_blank">the new Bento repository here</a>, as well as a hosted version of the <a href="https://warpstreamlabs.github.io/bento/" target="_blank">original docs</a> in all their glory.</p><p>You might be thinking, “Wait a minute, isn’t WarpStream just another corporation? Why should I spend my time contributing to <em>their</em> project if they can just take my contributions at any time and commercialize them?”. Bento is 100% MIT licensed and will stay that way forever. In addition, we want to move to a shared governance model, with other official maintainers, and create an independent structure. However, before we can do that, we first need to find some other maintainers!</p><p>So, if your company has <em>any</em> commercial interest in Benthos (even if you’re a competitor!) and is worried about the recent ownership and licensing changes, please let us know. We’d love to collaborate on contributions, bring you in as an official maintainer, create an independent Github organization with dedicated CI/Docker infrastructure, and establish a formal governance structure.</p><p>So please, join us: check out <a href="https://github.com/warpstreamlabs/bento">the new repository</a>, <a href="https://warpstreamlabs.github.io/bento/" target="_blank">docs website</a> (new domain coming soon), or even just <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/contact-us" target="_blank">get in touch</a> if you want to learn more about Bento or participate in stewarding the project.</p><p>P.S we hate that Benty is an ai-generated mascot. If you’re a talented illustrator with some ideas, please <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/contact-us">reach out</a> as well (we pay well!).</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><ol start="" role="list"><li>&nbsp;We’re pretty sure this isn’t how copyrights, software licensing, and trademarks work (like, at all), but we also didn’t feel like arguing about it, or getting the lawyers involved.</li><li>This relicensing was done with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/30/redpanda-acquires-benthos-to-expand-its-end-to-end-streaming-data-platform/?guccounter=1" target="_blank">justification</a> that “all the users that are using those services are used to paying for the integration with those services.” This seemed to us like a clear signal of more potentially hostile things to come.</li><li>Yes, this is the best we could come up with.

Using random-effect models and sensitivity/subgroup analyses, we estimated the effects of eye exercises compared to control on changes in three measures: visual acuity, refractive error (both quantified using standardized mean differences, SMDs), and protective/mitigating effects (assessed through risk ratios, RRs).</p><h3 data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis, with 921 participants. Nine studies had some concerns of bias in at least two domains, and two studies had a high risk of bias in two domains. Seven studies used visual acuity to measure myopia; visual acuity declined after eye-exercise interventions (SMD = −0.67, 95% CI −1.28 to −0.07, <i>Z</i> = 2.17, <i>P</i> = 0.03) and the effect was not better than control (SMD = −0.50, 95% CI −1.16 to 0.16, <i>Z</i> = 1.49, <i>P</i> = 0.14). Two studies used refractive error to measure myopia; the effect of eye-exercise interventions did not differ from control (SMD = −1.74, 95% CI −6.27 to 2.79, <i>Z</i> = 0.75, <i>P</i> = 0.45). Seven studies reported on protective/mitigating effects; eye exercises exhibited a greater protective/mitigating effect than control (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.23–0.71, <i>Z</i> = 3.13, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01).</p><h3 data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>Overall, the results suggest that eye exercises have limited to no efficacy in preventing or controlling myopia progression. Until robust evidence supports their efficacy, available evidence suggests retiring the eye-exercise policy.</p></div></div><div id="Abs2-section" aria-labelledby="Abs2" data-title="摘要" lang="zh"><h2 id="Abs2">摘要</h2><div id="Abs2-content"><p><b>方法:</b> 在九个主要中文和英文数据库里搜索与眼保健操相关的对照实验研究, 日期为从数据库建立起至2022年12月15日, 并使用荟萃分析 (随机效应模型和敏感性分析) 估计眼保健操相对对照组在三个近视指标上的效果, 即视敏度, 屈光误差 (均使用标准化均数差, SMD), 以及保护/缓解效果 (风险比, RR) 。</p><p><b>结果:</b> 共有11项研究纳入了这个荟萃分析, 涉及921名参与者——有九项研究在至少两个方面有偏倚问题, 而有两项研究在两个方面有高偏倚风险。其中七项研究使用视敏度来评估近视: 眼保健操干预后, 视力下降了 (SMD = −0.67, 95% CI −1.28 to −0.07, <i>Z</i> = 2.17, <i>P</i> = 0.03), 且其效果并不优于对照组 (SMD = −0.50, 95% CI −1.16 to 0.16, <i>Z</i> = 1.49, <i>P</i> = 0.14) 。两项研究使用屈光误差来评估近视: 眼保健操干预的效果与对照组无异 (SMD = −1.74, 95% CI −6.27 to 2.79, <i>Z</i> = 0.75, <i>P</i> = 0.45) 。七项研究报告了保护/缓解效果: 眼保健操的保护/缓解效果优于对照组 (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.23–0.71, <i>Z</i> = 3.13, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) 。</p><p><b>结论:</b> 荟萃分析表明, 眼保健操在预防或控制近视进展方面的疗效有限或无效。因此, 在有充分证据支持其疗效之前, 建议停止继续实施眼保健操政策。</p></div></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Doctors are hailing “off the chart” trial results that show a new drug stopped lung cancer advancing for longer than any other treatment in medical history.</p><p>Lung cancer is the world’s leading cause of cancer death, accounting for about 1.8m deaths every year. Survival rates in those with advanced forms of the disease, where tumours have spread, are particularly poor.</p><p>More than half of patients (60%) diagnosed with advanced forms of lung cancer who took lorlatinib were still alive five years later with no progression in their disease, data presented at the world’s largest cancer conference showed. The rate was 8% in patients treated with a standard drug, the trial found.</p><p>The results are the longest progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes ever recorded in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the world’s most common form of the disease. They were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) in Chicago on Friday.</p><p>“To our knowledge these results are unprecedented,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Benjamin Solomon, a medical oncologist at the Peter MacCallum <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Centre in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>In the phase 3 trial, 296 patients with advanced forms of non-small cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to receive either lorlatinib (149 patients) or crizotinib (147 patients, of whom 142 ultimately received treatment).</p><p>Just over half of the patients were women. In about 25% of them their lung cancer had already spread to the brain when the study began.</p><p>The participants all had ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Lorlatinib and crizotinib are both ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). ALK TKIs are targeted treatments that bind to the ALK protein found in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer and stop the growth of tumour cells.</p><p>“Despite significant advancements with newer generation ALK TKIs, the majority of patients treated with second-generation ALK TKIs will have progression of their disease within three years,” said Solomon.</p><p>“Lorlatinib is the only ALK TKI that has reported five-year progression-free survival, and even after this time, the majority of patients continue to have their disease controlled, including control of disease in the brain.”</p><p>The five-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 60% in patients who took lorlatinib and 8% in the crizotinib group.</p><p>“You don’t need a magnifying glass to see the difference between these two drugs,” said Dr Julie Gralow, Asco’s chief medical officer. “Sixty per cent five-year progression-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer is just unheard of.”</p><p>Dr David Spigel, the chief scientific officer of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in London, a world-leading clinical trials facility specialising in new therapies for cancer patients, welcomed the findings. “These long-term data results are off the chart,” he said.</p><p>Most of the patients experienced some side-effects. Treatment-related issues occurred in 77% of patients on lorlatinib and in 57% of patients on crizotinib. The most common side-effects reported in the trial that was funded by Pfizer were swelling, high cholesterol and elevated lipid levels.</p><p>Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, Prof Charles Swanton, who was not involved with the study, said the “groundbreaking” results would offer fresh hope for patients with advanced lung cancer.</p><p>“Despite progress in our understanding of the disease, it can be incredibly challenging to control cancers that have spread and there are limited treatment options for lung cancer,” he said.</p><p>“Showcasing the power of cancer-growth blocker drugs, this study could present us with an effective way of stopping cancer in its tracks and preventing it from spreading to the brain.</p><p>“The groundbreaking results show that over half of the patients who took lorlatinib did not suffer a progression in their disease after five years. In contrast, over half of the patients who took crizotinib experienced disease progression after just nine months.</p><p>“Research like this is vital to find new ways to treat lung cancer and help more people survive for longer.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>Between a dock and a hard place</h3>

<p>A family member presented me with an interesting problem: a PowerBook Duo 280c laptop from 1994 containing a few short audio recordings he wanted to preserve. A quick analysis of the problem at hand revealed a couple things working in our favor:</p>

<ul>
<li>The laptop still boots... after a few gentle taps on the hard drive to get it to spin up!</li>
<li>The audio files play back locally through the laptop's internal speakers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>The laptop has no audio jacks, so we couldn't get good analog copies of the recordings even if we wanted to.</li>
<li>The internal hard drive uses SCSI with an unusual connector. Adapting it didn't seem straightforward, and we weren't confident the old file system (HFS) would be easy to read from a modern system.</li>
<li>An external floppy drive accompanied the laptop... but the computer would not run with it connected. We couldn't figure out the hardware fault causing this.</li>
<li>The laptop has an AppleTalk port and a phone jack... but no networking software installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, it comes from a time before the Internet was mainstream. HTTP, the protocol underpinning the modern Internet, wasn't finalized until 1996. Software for connecting to a dial-up provider would have been available at the time, but was never installed. However, the laptop does have a phone dialer application, which gave us our first clue towards a potential solution.</p>

<h3>Deus fax machina</h3>

<p>While the laptop has no networking software, it does have <em>fax</em> software. We confirmed the modem could dial, so this might just be crazy enough to work.</p>

<p>The first question was how to turn the audio file into something faxable. The laptop contains a collection of games. Alongside them is a resource editor, called ResEdit, which had previously been used to inspect and modify the aforementioned games. Let's see what it can do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151605_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151605_size.jpg" alt="" title="The games folder contained a collection of games in addition to a resource editor" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>ResEdit has probably the most adorable splash screen ever.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/ResEdit_animated.gif" title="ResEdit splash screen" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/ResEdit_animated.gif" alt="" title="ResEdit splash screen" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Luckily, it includes a hex editor which allows you to view the raw contents of files in hexadecimal form. This is exactly what we need! Although, since ResEdit doesn't support printing, we'll have to copy the text into a different application that does.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151716_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151716_size.jpg" alt="" title="The contents of the sound file are selected in the hex editor" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>This particular sound file is 37,928 bytes long. The hexadecimal representation is double that, since each byte is represented by two characters (0-F).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151722_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-151722_size.jpg" alt="" title="An error message says, &quot;Can't cut or copy more than 32000 characters at one time.&quot;" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Huh. I guess we'll have to do it piecemeal. (And yes, that message literally means 32000, not 32767. Some programmer must have really liked base-10 numbers and signed shorts.) We'll use batches of 12288 (0x3000 in hex) to make the offsets easier to remember.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152059_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152059_size.jpg" alt="" title="Less of the document is selected in the hex editor, to stay within the 32,000 character limit" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Now that we have a chunk of the document in the clipboard, what do we do with it? Thankfully, Microsoft Office is also installed on this laptop, and it supports printing!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152119_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152119_size.jpg" alt="" title="Microsoft Word 5.1a in the applications folder" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Pasting the contents of the clipboard into a Word document inserts the hexadecimal representation verbatim.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152256_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152256_size.jpg" alt="" title="Blocks of hexidecimal text are copied into Microsoft Word" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>These sound files are all under 100KB, so copying them into Word doesn't take long. I'd estimate the transfer speed of manually copying the contents from ResEdit into Word via the clipboard averages about 316 bytes/second.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152449_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-152449_size.jpg" alt="" title="The remainder of the sound file's hexidecimal representation is copied into Word" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>With the whole file copied into a text document, we can leverage the previously-discovered fax software from the print dialog. But, who do we send the fax to?</p>

<h3>Fax is the new file copy</h3>

<p>My college laptop, a ThinkPad T60, is the only computer I still own with an internal dial-up modem. It's running Windows XP, which includes a fax application that can listen to the modem for incoming faxes and store them as multi-page TIF images.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-165154_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-165154_size.jpg" alt="" title="ThinkPad T60 with phone cable plugged in" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>There's a problem though. Simply plugging the two laptops together with a phone cable doesn't work. The PowerBook dials, but the ThinkPad doesn't answer. There is an "Ignore Dial Tone" option, but it makes no difference.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153033_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153033_size.jpg" alt="" title="Dialing options for the fax, showing the &quot;Ignore Dial Tone&quot; option checked" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>It turns out the voltage provided by an actual landline is important for the modem to function properly. Fortunately, a simple <a href="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/guide-build-a-line-voltage-inducer/">phone line simulator circuit</a> can overcome this problem, and is very easy to build with some common electronic components and a 9V battery.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-164725_crop_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="682"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-164725_crop_size.jpg" alt="" title="Primitive phone line circuit simulator, assembled with a resistor, capacitor, and a 9V battery" width="1024" height="682"></a></p>

<p>It's crude, but effective! (Side note: WAGO lever nuts are super handy for all sorts of electrical projects.) This schematic shows the circuit diagram of the mess of wires above.</p>

<p>With the two laptops now connected via a simulated phone line, we attempt to fax the document again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153219_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153219_size.jpg" alt="" title="An error message says I am not in compliance with FCC regulation 68.318.C3 because I did not include a cover page. Oops." width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Oops. The FCC says I need a cover page. Let's try to appease them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/CoverPage_edit_original.png" title="" width="864" height="375"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/CoverPage_edit.png" alt="" title="Example cover page generated by the fax software" width="864" height="375"></a></p>

<p>There we go.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153232_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153232_size.jpg" alt="" title="Successfully started printing the fax" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>It's working! It takes a while for it to rasterize the fax pages. After that's done, it estimates the fax will take 24 minutes to send.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153307_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153307_size.jpg" alt="" title="Rasterization completed, it will take 24 minutes to fax all 20 pages" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>That's kind of long. What if we reduce the font size?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153856_size_original.jpg" title="" width="1024" height="680"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/DSC_230304-153856_size.jpg" alt="" title="With the font size reduced, it will take 7 minutes to fax 6 pages" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>Down to 6 pages in 7 minutes. Much better. It chugs along at 14400bps until the fax is fully received by the ThinkPad.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/WindowsFaxComplete.png" title="Successfully received the fax on the Windows PC" width="314" height="394"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/WindowsFaxComplete.png" alt="" title="Successfully received the fax on the Windows PC" width="314" height="394"></a></p>

<p>It worked! Now the last step is figuring out how to turn this image back into a binary file.</p>

<h3>The file transfer to end all file transfers</h3>

<p>My first idea is to convert the TIF to a PDF and use optical character recognition (OCR) to translate it back to text. These images seem like the ideal candidate for an OCR algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>The text is computer-generated, so it's perfectly aligned and consistent.</li>
<li>Only 16 different characters are used (0-9, A-F).</li>
<li>It uses Courier, an extremely common fixed-width font.</li>
</ul>

<p>After running the PDF run through an OCR process, the text is now selectable. I can copy it into a hex editor and save it as a binary file.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/HexImage_OCR.png" title="PDF contains selectable text after performing OCR" width="500" height="114"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/HexImage_OCR.png" alt="" title="PDF contains selectable text after performing OCR" width="500" height="114"></a></p>

<p>The resulting file's size is close to, but not exactly, what I expected. Nonetheless, I import it into Audacity which is able to deduce the audio format: unsigned 8-bit PCM, little-endian, 22050 Hz, mono. A waveform appears!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Overview.png" title="A waveform of the audio as seen in Audacity" width="500" height="125"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Overview.png" alt="" title="A waveform of the audio as seen in Audacity" width="500" height="125"></a></p>

<p>I play it back, and it sounds pretty good! Especially considering it was recorded from the internal microphone of a laptop from 1994. There's an audible problem though, and it's actually visible on the waveform itself. Zooming in reveals it more clearly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Closeup.png" title="Closeup of the waveform from the OCR'd data contains sporadic errors" width="500" height="125"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/Waveform_Closeup.png" alt="" title="Closeup of the waveform from the OCR'd data contains sporadic errors" width="500" height="125"></a></p>

<p>All of those abrupt dips are the result of OCR transcription errors. They manifest as crackling or popping noises throughout the recording. I need a better way to convert this text to a file.</p>

<p>I try a bunch of different OCR programs, but can't find any that can transcribe the document with 100% accuracy. They often confuse certain letters or numbers (like 0 and C, 9 and 4, 0 and D). Sometimes they omit characters, sometimes they introduce new ones. I try different font sizes and different fonts, but it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I need to process these files with perfect accuracy, and OCR software is not going to cut it. With no sign of improvement a couple dozen faxes later, I decide to write my own.</p>

<h3>The fax, the whole fax, and nothing but the fax</h3>

<p>Knowing that the text in these images is tightly structured, I can make a lot of assumptions when processing them. They were generated with a fixed-width font, which means the whole document is essentially an evenly-spaced grid of characters. Once I figure out the correct starting point, character offsets, and line spacing, I can capture and analyze each character individually.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary1_original.png" title="" width="761" height="647"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary1.png" alt="" title="Screenshot of the fax image to binary converter program I wrote, showing a document being processed" width="761" height="647"></a></p>

<p>I can use the preview on the left to quickly confirm whether the size and offset parameters are correct. Once they are, there will be no drift in the preview when moving between characters or lines. Processing can commence.</p>

<p>The actual character recognition takes a quick-and-dirty approach. For each unique pattern encountered, the program simply asks you to specify what it is, and subsequently remembers the answer for the next time it finds an identical-looking character.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary2.png" title="The fax to binary program asks the user to identify each character the first time it's encountered" width="400" height="200"><img src="https://www.unterminated.com/images/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary2.png" alt="" title="The fax to binary program asks the user to identify each character the first time it's encountered" width="400" height="200"></a></p>

<p>(If for some strange reason anyone might find this program valuable, the source is available to download <a href="https://www.unterminated.com/files/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop/FaxToBinary.zip">here</a>.)</p>

<p>After a bit of manual training, it outputs the file. Success! The audio plays back smoothly without any popping. It's a perfect byte-for-byte copy of the original file!</p>

<p>With the most complicated file copy in history finally complete, there's only one thing left to do.</p>

<h2>// <strong>What we found</strong></h2>



<p>Following last year’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/exiled-russian-media-pegasus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>joint investigation</strong></a> into the use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware against Galina Timchenko, co-founder, CEO, and publisher of <em>Meduza</em>, Access Now, <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs &amp; Public Policy at the University of Toronto (“the Citizen Lab”)</a></strong>, and independent digital security expert Nikolai Kvantiliani have uncovered how <strong>at least seven more </strong>Russian, Belarusian, Latvian, and Israeli<strong> journalists and activists have been targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware within the EU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2>// <strong>Who was targeted</strong></h2>



<p>One victim, who has chosen to remain anonymous, is a <strong>member of Belarusian civil society currently based in Vilnius, Lithuania</strong>. After receiving an <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/faq-access-nows-digital-security-helpline-and-apple-threat-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Apple threat notification</strong></a> on June 22, 2023, that their device had been targeted with a state-sponsored attack, they reached out to the Citizen Lab for digital security support, who analyzed the device and <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a></strong> that it was infected with Pegasus spyware on or around March 25, 2021. This date, “Freedom Day” (Dzień Voli), is a significant one, as it commemorates the Belarusian Democratic Republic’s 1918 declaration of independence. Freedom Day celebrations have historically been suppressed by Belarusian officials.</p>



<p>Another <strong>Russian journalist living in exile in Vilnius</strong> since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and who has also chosen to remain anonymous, received two Apple threat notifications on October 31, 2023, and on April 10, 2024. Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline, with the <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical confirmation</a></strong> of the Citizen Lab, <strong><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identified</a></strong> an attempt to infect the journalist’s device on or around June 15, 2023. On June 16, the journalist attended an event in Riga, Latvia, for Russian journalists in exile, which was organized by the Baltic Center for Media Excellence (BCME), DW Academy, and Sustainability Foundation. This event highlighted the ongoing vulnerabilities faced by media professionals in the region, underscoring the critical need for robust digital security measures. There were also other significant circumstances surrounding the June 15 hacking attempt that the journalist decided to keep private at this time due to personal safety concerns.</p>



<p>Three additional victims, all based in Riga, Latvia, <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2023/09/14/three-journalists-report-receiving-threat-notifications-from-apple-about-state-sponsored-attackers-targeting-their-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>received</strong></a> Apple threat notifications. Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline <strong><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analyzed</a></strong> their devices, with the Citizen Lab reviewing our results:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Evgeny Erlikh</strong>, an Israeli-Russian journalist and the author and former producer of <em>Baltic Weekly, </em>on <a href="https://about.rferl.org/service/current-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Current Time</strong></em></a>, RFE RL’s 24/7 Russian-language TV network.&nbsp;Our analysis showed that Erlikh’s iPhone was infected with Pegasus spyware between November 28 and 29, 2022. At the time, Erlikh was vacationing in Austria with his spouse, who also received an Apple threat notification, but we were unable to forensically analyze her phone.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Evgeny Pavlov</strong>, a Latvian journalist, former correspondent for <a href="https://novayagazeta.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Novaya Gazeta Baltija</strong></em></a>, an independent news media covering the Baltic countries, and former freelance journalist for <em>Current Time’s Baltia </em>program. Pavlov’s device was targeted with Pegasus on or around November 28, 2022, and on or around April 24, 2023; however, we were unable to confirm if the attempts were successful.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Maria Epifanova</strong>, general director of <a href="https://novayagazeta.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Novaya Gazeta Europe</strong></em></a><em> </em>and director of <em>Novaya Gazeta Baltija.</em> Epifanova’s iPhone was infected on or around August 18, 2020 — the earliest known use of Pegasus to target Russian civil society. Epifanova was chief editor of <em>Novaya Gazeta Baltija</em> at the time, and the attack occurred shortly after she received accreditation to attend exiled Belarusian democratic opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya’s <a href="https://amp.meduza.io/en/feature/2020/08/21/i-hope-common-sense-will-prevail"><strong>first press conference in Vilniu</strong></a><a href="https://amp.meduza.io/en/feature/2020/08/21/i-hope-common-sense-will-prevail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>s</strong></a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Two Belarusian civil society members currently living in Warsaw, Poland, also received Apple notifications on October 31, 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Andrei Sannikov</strong> is a prominent Belarusian opposition politician and activist, who ran for President of Belarus in 2010, receiving the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/20/alexander-lukashenko-belarus-president-election" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>second highest vote</strong></a> count after incumbent Alexander Lukashenko. After the election he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/andrei-sannikov-world-complacent-belarus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>arrested by the Belarusian KGB</strong></a> and held as a prisoner of conscience. Authorities also threatened to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/world/europe/10belarus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>take away his three-year old son</strong></a>. <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>According to the Citizen Lab</strong></a>, Sannikov’s iPhone was infected with Pegasus on or around September 7, 2021.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Natallia Radzina</strong> is editor-in-chief of independent Belarusian media website <a href="http://charter97.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Charter97.org</strong></a> and a <a href="https://cpj.org/awards/natalya-radina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>recipient</strong></a> of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) International Press Freedom Award. Radzina was persecuted for journalistic activities in Belarus, imprisoned, and forced to flee the country. <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</strong></a>, as <strong><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> </strong>by the Citizen Lab, also identified that Radzina’s device was infected with Pegasus spyware on or around December 2, 2022, December 7, 2022, and January 16, 2023. The first infection took place the day after Radzina’s participation in the <a href="https://www.forumfreerussia.org/en/archives-en/forum-awciii-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Third Anti-War Conference</strong></a> in Vilnius, organized by the Free Russia Forum.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2>// <strong>New patterns emerge</strong></h2>



<p>Our investigation shows that the use of Pegasus spyware to target Russian- and Belarusian-speaking journalists and activists dates back until at least 2020, with more attacks following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>



<p>Access Now and the Citizen Lab also confirmed that five of the victims’ phones contained Apple IDs used by Pegasus operators in their attempts to hack the devices. We know that targeting via <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>various exploits</strong></a> that take advantage of bugs in <em>HomeKit</em> can leave a record of the attacker’s Apple ID email address on the victim’s device. The Citizen Lab believes that each Apple ID is used by a single Pegasus operator, though a single Pegasus operator might use multiple Apple IDs. We <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/civil-society-in-exile-technical-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>found</strong></a> the same Apple ID email address present on Pavlov, Radzina, and the second anonymous victim’s phones. A separate email account was used to target both Erlikh and Pavlov’s phones on November 28, 2022. Artifacts from Andrei Sannikov and Natallia Radzina’s phones contained another separate identical email, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/"><strong>according to the Citizen Lab</strong></a>. This suggests that a single Pegasus spyware operator may be behind the targeting of at least three of the victims and possibly all five.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>// <strong>Who is responsible?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Access Now and the Citizen Lab are not publicly naming a specific operator at this time. Given that Poland has not been documented as targeting victims outside the country with Pegasus spyware, and considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/01/poland-launches-inquiry-into-previous-governments-spyware-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>reports</strong></a> that Poland’s government stopped using Pegasus spyware in 2021, it is unlikely that Poland is behind the attacks mentioned in this investigation. The Citizen Lab tells us that there is also no evidence suggesting that Russia, Belarus, or Lithuania are Pegasus customers. Latvia <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>appears to use Pegasus</strong></a>, but the country is also not known for targeting victims outside of its borders. Estonia is another Baltic state that <a href="https://www.vm.ee/en/baltic-cooperation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cooperates closely with Latvia and Lithuania on security matters</strong></a>, including regarding <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/latvia-lithuania-estonia-common-defense-zone-russia-border-security-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Russia and Belarus</strong></a>. According to the Citizen Lab, Estonia does appear to use Pegasus extensively outside their borders, including within multiple European countries.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>// <strong>The investigation continues</strong></h2>



<p>Access Now, the Citizen Lab, and other partners continue investigating these attacks against journalists, activists, and dissidents in exile and at home. We advise members of civil society to follow <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/access-nows-digital-security-helpline-and-apple-threat-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>digital security recommendations</strong></a>, which include updating your devices’ software or implementing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Apple Lockdown Mode</strong></a>. If you received an Apple threat notification or suspect your device may have been targeted with spyware, contact <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</strong></a>; support is available in nine languages including <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help-ru/?ignorelocale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Russian</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Access Now <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/world-press-freedom-day-no-to-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>urges</strong></a> all governments to establish an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer, servicing, and use of targeted digital surveillance technologies until rigorous human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate such practices, and to ban the use of spyware technologies such as Pegasus that have a history of enabling human rights abuses.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
						
										
			<p><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce">James Joyce’s</a> most celebrated novel, and one of the most highly-regarded novels in the English language, records the events of one day—Thursday the 16th of June, 1904—in the city of Dublin.</p>
			<p>The reader is first reintroduced to Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of Joyce’s previous novel <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce/a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a></i>. Stephen is now living in a rented Martello tower and working at a school, having completed his B.A. and a period of attempted further study in Paris. The focus then shifts to the book’s protagonist, Leopold Bloom, an advertising canvasser and social outsider. It is a work day, so both Bloom and Stephen depart their homes for their respective journeys around Dublin.</p>
			<p>While containing a richly detailed story and still being generally described as a novel, <i>Ulysses</i> breaks many of the bounds otherwise associated with the form. It consists of eighteen chapters, or “episodes,” each somehow echoing a scene in <a href="https://standardebooks.org/standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer">Homer’s</a> <i><a href="https://standardebooks.org/standardebooks.org/ebooks/homer/the-odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>. Each episode takes place in a different setting, and each is written in a different, and often unusual, style. The book’s chief innovation is commonly cited to be its expansion of the “free indirect discourse” or “interior monologue” technique that Joyce used in his previous two books.</p>
			<p><i>Ulysses</i> is known not only for its formal novelty and linguistic inventiveness, but for its storied publication history. The first fourteen episodes of the book were serialized between 1918 and 1920 in <i>The Little Review</i>, while several episodes were published in 1919 in <i>The Egoist</i>. In 1921, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice won a trial regarding obscenity in the thirteenth episode, “Nausicaa.” <i>The Little Review</i>’s editors were enjoined against publishing any further installments; <i>Ulysses</i> would not appear again in America until 1934.</p>
			<p>The outcome of the 1921 trial worsened Joyce’s already-considerable difficulties in finding a publisher in England. After lamenting to Sylvia Beach, owner of the Parisian bookshop Shakespeare and Company, that it might never be published at all, Beach offered to publish it in Paris, and <i>Ulysses</i> first appeared in its entirety in February 1922.</p>
			<p>The first printing of the first edition was filled with printing errors. A corrected second edition was published in 1924. Stuart Gilbert’s 1932 edition benefited from correspondence with Joyce, and claimed in its front matter to be “the definitive standard edition,” but was later found to have introduced errors of its own.</p>
			<p>The novel’s initial reception was mixed. W. B. Yeats called it “mad,” but would later agree with the positive assessments of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, stating that it was “indubitably a work of genius.” Joyce’s second biographer Richard Ellmann reports that one doctor claimed to have seen writing of equal merit by his insane patients, and Virginia Woolf derided it as “underbred.” Joyce’s aunt, Josephine Murray, rejected it as “unfit to read” on account of its purported obscenity, to which Joyce famously retorted that if that were so, then life was not fit to live.</p>
			<p>The sheer density of references in the text make <i>Ulysses</i> a book that virtually demands of the reader access to critical interpretation; but it also makes it a book that is easily obscured by the industry of scholarship it has generated over the last century. The dismissal of a serious interpretation is tempting, but would trivialize Joyce’s enormous project as an extended joke or an elaborate exercise in ego. Likewise dismissing it as uninterpretable would ignore the profusion of earnest critical analyses.</p>
			<p>Today <i>Ulysses</i> is considered by many to be the zenith of 20th century literature: both one of the richest, and also the most difficult, books to ever be written. To appreciate it is not to think it unintelligible; rather, perhaps the best description of it is the one used of Ulysses himself in a 21st century translation of Homer’s epic—“complicated.”</p>
			<p>This Standard Ebooks edition is based on a transcription of the 1922 Shakespeare and Company first edition, with emendations from pre-1929 errata lists and the second edition in its 1927 ninth printing by Shakespeare and Company. It does not track any one particular edition, but rather is a blend of pre-1929 editions that aims to contain what scholars might consider to be the most accurate version of what was printed before 1929. Therefore, various probable misprints have been retained that may have been corrected in post-1929 editions. Consultation of various editions of the book and the historical collation list appended to Hans Walter Gabler’s Critical and Synoptic Edition is advised before contacting Standard Ebooks about potential mistakes.</p>
