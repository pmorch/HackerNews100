<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bill Ackman and Sean “Diddy” Combs are among the list of owners of Elon Musk’s <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/">X</a>, the social media site <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/14/x-ordered-to-pay-550000-to-irish-employee-fired-for-not-replying-to-elon-musk-yes-or-resign-extremely-hardcore-ultimatum/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/14/x-ordered-to-pay-550000-to-irish-employee-fired-for-not-replying-to-elon-musk-yes-or-resign-extremely-hardcore-ultimatum/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">formerly known as Twitter</a>.</p><div>



<p>The platform has been <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/elon-musk-x-twitter-must-disclose-full-ownership-structure-judge-rules/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/elon-musk-x-twitter-must-disclose-full-ownership-structure-judge-rules/">forced to disclose its investors</a> as <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/elon-musk-litigation-lawsuits-x-spacex-tesla-legal-federal-court/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/elon-musk-litigation-lawsuits-x-spacex-tesla-legal-federal-court/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">part of a lawsuit brought by former employees</a>, who are seeking payment of arbitration fees incurred following <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-twitter-x-advertiser-boycott-finances-bradford-ferguson/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-twitter-x-advertiser-boycott-finances-bradford-ferguson/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">Musk’s purchase of the site</a>. </p>



<p>Previously, X has argued that its investors were confidential as a matter of “routine practice and policy,” but this week, a federal judge in California ruled to unseal the list of the site’s owners.</p>



<p>Among the nearly 100 owners of the social media giant are some familiar names, both from the world of investment and within the X universe.</p>



<p>Previously, <span>high-profile investors like Fidelity have been connected with X, most notably because&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/elon-musk-twitter-value-72-percent-drop-fidelity/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/elon-musk-twitter-value-72-percent-drop-fidelity/" rel="noopener">the investment vehicle’s filings implied a 72% drop in the company’s value</a></span> since Musk took it over.</p>



<p>However, the latest filing reveals the investment behemoth’s backing of the platform, with almost 30 separate Fidelity-linked entities holding stakes in the brand.</p>



<p>This week’s unsealed documents also lay bare the lesser-known stakeholders in the company. </p>



<p><span>The list seen by&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>&nbsp;reveals the Pershing Square Foundation owns a stake in X. </span>If the name sounds familiar, that’s because of its link to&nbsp;Pershing Square Holdings, founded by billionaire investor Bill Ackman 20 years ago.</p>



<p><span>Although the foundation of the same name is led by an independent senior leadership team, Ackman and his wife, Neri Oxman,&nbsp;<a href="https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" rel="noopener">are</a></span><a href="https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" rel="noopener"> co-trustees</a>.</p>



<p>Ackman is a vocal user of X and frequently uses the platform to address other <span>high-profile individuals and entities. He has used it to&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/05/mark-cuban-elon-musk-bill-ackman-tesla-twitter-dei-mavericks/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/05/mark-cuban-elon-musk-bill-ackman-tesla-twitter-dei-mavericks/" rel="noopener">debate <em>Shark Tank</em> star Mark Cuban</a>&nbsp;and raise<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/11/bill-ackman-larry-summers-harvard-critics-student-israel-statement-palestine-solidarity-committee-psc/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/11/bill-ackman-larry-summers-harvard-critics-student-israel-statement-palestine-solidarity-committee-psc/" rel="noopener">&nbsp;questions about the leadership of his alma mater, Harvard University</a></span>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the list of owners is <a href="https://fortune.com/company/oracle/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/oracle/">Oracle</a> founder Larry Ellison. <span>The stake in X comes via the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, the principal business of which, per an SEC report filed in 2008 and seen by&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>, is to “hold the assets and estate of Mr. Ellison.”</span></p>



<p>The interests of the trust and Oracle bear no relation to each other, the SEC filing adds. </p>



<p>Unlike Ackman, Ellison is not an avid user of the site. Despite having more than 130,000 followers, Ellison has posted twice—once in 2012 and once in 2023.</p>



<p>Another notable name on the list is Sean Combs Capital. </p>



<p>While SEC filings show no matches for the company, the business has previously been linked to the American rapper Diddy—previously known as Puff Daddy—who has launched a number of businesses under his birth name.</p>



<p>These have included the Sean Combs Foundation, Combs Investments, and more recently the umbrella brand for his holdings, Combs Global.</p>



<p>Musk has also managed to attract some royal attention for his endeavor, with HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud also featured on the list. </p>



<p>The Saudi prince has a net worth just shy of $19 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" rel="noopener">per </a><em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>,</em> and also has holdings in the likes of luxury hotels the Four Seasons and the Savoy, as well as other technology firms like ride-sharing company <a href="https://fortune.com/company/lyft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/lyft/">Lyft</a>.</p>



<p>It also seems that despite his criticism of Musk’s leadership, Jack Dorsey still owns shares in the platform he founded via the Jack Dorsey Remainder LLC.</p>



<p>The Twitter cofounder previously backed the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> CEO in his takeover of the company but <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/">walked </a><span><a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" rel="noopener">back his support earlier this year</a>, telling a member on rival social media platform Bluesky, “It</span> all went south.”</p>



<h2>Doubling down on investments</h2>



<p>Among the less eminent names are some organizations that not only hold stakes in X as a business but have also seen senior leaders pitch in.</p>



<p>Take the likes of Danilo Kawasaki and Ross Gerber. </p>



<p>According to the filing, the pair are named as individual investors in X but also have a stake in the business they lead, the wealth and investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the list are the Silicon Valley VCs one might expect: 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia.</p>



<p>The list, of course, also features Musk himself. Via the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/spacex/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/spacex/">SpaceX</a> founder is also listed.</p>



<p>Musk purchased the site for $44 billion in 2022, though the <span>filing did not make clear the proportion of his investment versus that of others. Since then, the business has been&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/elon-musk-declares-war-on-advertisers-lawsuit-x-boycott/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/elon-musk-declares-war-on-advertisers-lawsuit-x-boycott/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="noopener">beleaguered by departing advertisers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/elon-musk-learn-stripe-layoffs-twitter-patrick-collison/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/elon-musk-learn-stripe-layoffs-twitter-patrick-collison/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="noopener">mass layoffs,</a></span> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/elon-musk-x-linda-yaccarino-twitter-advertisers-free-speech-dealbook/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/elon-musk-x-linda-yaccarino-twitter-advertisers-free-speech-dealbook/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">criticism of Musk’s strategy.</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a long post telling my experiences. Sorry for the length, couldn't make it any shorter.</em></p>

<p>Hello everybody. My name is Ed and I'm the developer of <a href="https://edgrace.itch.io/idletale">IdleTale</a>.</p>

<p>I started this project because I love incremental and RPG games, and I wanted to create something that I would really love to play myself, and idle RPGs are not something too common. So I did it out of pure passion.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1dedf6k/incremental_rpg_game_im_working_on/">made this first post</a> a few months ago when the game was just an idea. It received so much support that I decided to keep going and turn it into something a bit more serious. Nothing lucrative or anything (actually the game is free and it was never intended to be paid nor have in-app purchases / ads), just something for the fans of incremental and RPG games, like me. A game made by and for RPG/idle games lovers.</p>

<p>So I decided to launch it on Google Play since that platform can help reach a bigger audience than just promoting it yourself, and people are more comfortable downloading apps from Google Play than downloading random .apks from other sites which may contain malware.</p>

<p>In June (2 months ago) I created my Google Play dev account and offered a total of 200 (the maximum Google Play allows you to) spots for alpha testing to my community. We filled the list and more than 100 people kept playing the game for more than those 2 weeks required for the app to be approved for production. The alpha testing ended up being slightly more than 1 month long.</p>

<p>For this whole month of alpha testing, over 50 versions were built and (not sure about the exact numbers) around 20-30 were uploaded to Google Play. Meanwhile, in the internal testing track, over 50 versions were pushed for me and my close friends to keep testing new features before adding them to the alpha testing or the official release.</p>

<p>No problems were found. Everything went well and the alpha testing period ended on July 19th of this year (last month).</p>

<p>I kept pushing versions on a daily basis to the internal testing for no more than 4 friends + myself, and kept testing everything. Some days I would even upload 2-3 versions that day.</p>

<p>The app was ready to be launched and I announced its launch for August 20th, 3 days ago.</p>

<p>I published the app. Around 1K downloads were made within the first 24 hours.</p>

<p>I then made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1ex2xpy/comment/ljjnvqz/?context=3">this post</a>, which as of today has been edited removing the Google Play links and changing them for different ones since the Google Play app is no longer available.</p>

<p>Everyone was happy and I was proud of the game. A free idle game with no ads, no in-app purchases and no P2W. No possibility to spend any money nor have nasty ads 24/7. After all, I did it because I loved it.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up with a mail from Google. The app had been deleted due to "Malware or Deceptive Behavior". How could it be? I had already stated everything the app did in my Privacy Policy, and after starting an antivirus scan, no malware was found in my PC.</p>

<p>So I appealed it. Within a few minutes I received a mail stating that the decision would be upholded and the app would not come back.</p>

<p>I was really confused. What kind of deceptive behavior could it have?</p>

<p>After reviewing my code over and over, thousands of lines of it, I found a single line of code that could've been the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Someone on Discord requested the game to keep the phone's screen always on while the game was active. They even attached a link of someone sharing their piece of code with that function included. It was an Unity integrated (I build in Unity) function:</p>

<p><code>Screen.SleepTimeout = SleepTimeout.NeverSleep();</code></p>

<p>I really liked the idea because if my players wanted it, I couldn't see any reason to not give it to them.</p>

<p>That was the only function I used that would not request the user's consent to make changes in the device's settings. It only worked while the game was active, but it's enough to break Google Play's policies.</p>

<p>I didn't know that this would be a problem or break Google Play's policies. I didn't even know this actually changed the phone's settings, but I'll take the blame for not reading further into this function and knowing this could be a problem.</p>

<p>The thing is, the version that was marked as "Deceptive Behavior" was not the live one, it was the one I sent for revision to hotfix a bug. And they didn't "refuse" it, they completely deleted the app, not only the "under revision" build.</p>

<p>So I re-appealed stating that I'm now aware of what I did wrong and that I'm willing to take that piece of code out because it's not my intention to modify anyone's settings without their consent. The same answer was given within a few minutes.</p>

<p>But in their initial mail they stated that, if I sent a new version compliant with their terms, they could re-enable the app. But I couldn't send any new revisions since my app got completely deleted, my Google Play Console's panel was totally inaccesible.</p>

<p>So I thought the way (and what they meant by sending a new version) was creating a new app and re-send it for revision, starting the same process of 2 weeks with 20 or more testers over again. But I wouldn't mind, I just wanted my game to be out there and share it with everyone.</p>

<p>I didn't even have time to upload the new version when I received another mail from Google. I had just put the name to the new app and I was doing the ESRB rating survey when I received it.</p>

<p>Not only my app, but my whole dev account was completely closed FOREVER, and any attempt at creating any new account would result in closure as well. I lost the opportunity to publish anything in Google Play for my whole life as a game or app developer.</p>

<p>And it started with a function of keeping the screen turned on while the game was open. I really feel like a fool for not thinking this could be a problem.</p>

<p>My guess is that they deleted the account because I broke another rule: uploading a rejected app twice.</p>

<p>I know this now because I read almost all the policy after having my account closed to see what I could've done wrong, but I didn't know I would break a rule by uploading a compliant version of a rejected app when they asked me to do so in order to save my app.</p>

<p>With all this story I want to share my pain with anyone that has had a similar problem, and remember that sometimes a little misstep followed by lack of knowledge can turn a little problem into a really big one.</p>

<p>I am no one to judge whether this is fair or not, but I definitely feel terribly bad for having lost something that not only made me really happy and feel fullfilled, but also gave me hope to create a good game everyone could enjoy.</p>

<p>Thank you if you've read this far and sorry again for the long post.</p>

<p>Edit: And sorry if this sounds too intense, it's just frustrating that this happened after investing a lot of time, money and hopes in something that would end up like this 24 hours after its launch.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

The greek quiz is so obscure that it is ridiculous -- noone can play
this.  Replace it with a new quiz about galley (ship) parts.  This
commit changes the *LAST UNMODIFIED ORIGINAL FILE* (meaning revision
1.1.1.1) from the original import that created OpenBSD on Oct 18,
1995.  With this commit, we have completed an amusing mission of
replacing the final parts of the original OpenBSD.

We have reached OpenBSD of Theseus.

<p>With an operating system as old as Windows, what Microsoft decides to remove is often just as (if not more) newsworthy as what it is trying to add. You may or may not care about new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-utilities-like-paint-and-snipping-tool-could-get-an-ai-infusion-soon/">AI-themed MS Paint additions</a> or the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/microsoft-will-try-the-data-scraping-windows-recall-feature-again-in-october/">soon-to-be-reborn Recall feature</a>, but you've almost certainly interacted with one of Windows' Control Panel applets at some point in the last 39 years. And according to a note <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b">buried on Microsoft's support site</a>, those Control Panels' days may be numbered (emphasis ours):</p>
<p>"The Control Panel is a feature that's been part of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view and manipulate system settings and controls," the support page explains. "Through a series of applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. <strong>The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience.</strong>"</p>

<p>This won't be news to anyone who has followed Windows' development over the last decade. The Settings app was initially introduced in Windows 8 in 2012 as a touchscreen-friendly alternative for some of the Control Panel applets, but during the Windows 10 era it began picking up more and more Control Panel settings, and by the time Windows 11 rolled around it was full-featured enough to serve as a complete Control Panel replacement most of the time, with a handful of exceptions made for especially obscure changes (and those who simply prefer the Old Ways).</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>But while individual Control Panel applets have disappeared over the years—the Displays panel, the Add/Remove Programs screen, panels for deprecated features like Homegroups—Microsoft's note suggests that the rest of the applets may disappear en masse in some future Windows update. That said, for now, there's nothing that's changing in Windows. Even the upcoming 24H2 update still has all the old Control Panels in it, and the gap between "deprecated" and "removed" can span years.</p>
<p>What's incredible about some of the Control Panels at this point is how far back some of their designs go. You're never more than a double-click away from some piece of UI that has been essentially exactly the same since 1996's Windows NT 4.0, when Microsoft's more-stable NT operating system was refreshed with the same user interface as Windows 95 (modern Windows versions descend from NT, and not 95 or 98). The Control Panel idea is even older, dating all the way back to Windows 1.0 in 1985.</p>
<p>Most of the current Control Panel designs and iconography settled down back in Windows Vista and Windows 7 in 2006 and 2009, which explains why so many of the panels still feature the rounded, glassy look that defines those versions of the operating system (check out the way the clock looks in our screenshots above). It's one of the few areas of the operating system that hasn't been spruced up for Windows 11, which is otherwise probably Microsoft's most cohesive Windows design since 95 and NT 4.0; even old apps like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/hell-freezes-over-ms-paint-adds-support-for-layers-and-png-transparency/">Paint</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/notepads-spellcheck-and-autocorrect-are-rolling-out-to-everybody-after-41-years/">Notepad</a> have gotten facelifts, while other Windows 7-era holdovers like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/microsoft-is-killing-wordpad-windows-28-year-old-built-in-word-processor/">WordPad</a> have been put out to pasture.</p>

            <guid>41329505</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 14:50:09 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine">https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41329505">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Surreal Engine</h2><a id="user-content-surreal-engine" aria-label="Permalink: Surreal Engine" href="#surreal-engine"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The goal of this project is to reimplement enough of the original Unreal Engine to make the Unreal Tournament (UT99) maps playable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5136903/125014285-afc65580-e06d-11eb-80c0-0a1992a7d0ff.jpg"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5136903/125014285-afc65580-e06d-11eb-80c0-0a1992a7d0ff.jpg" alt="facingworlds"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current status</h2><a id="user-content-current-status" aria-label="Permalink: Current status" href="#current-status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The engine can load and render the maps. The Unrealscript VM is almost feature complete - only arrays and network conditional execution are not implemented yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">It will attempt to load all level actors and initialize the map. However, while the menus and the HUD will appear, there are still many native functions not implemented yet. It is also quite possible some events aren't firing as they should. You will therefore see exceptions shown if you interact with them and that is where the project is at.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the time of this writing, SurrealEngine can detect the following UE1 games:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Unreal Tournament (v436, v451b, v469(a, b, c, d))</li>
<li>Unreal (v200, v209, v220, v224v, v225f, v226f)</li>
<li>Unreal Gold (v226b, v227(i, j, k_11))</li>
<li>Deus Ex (v1002f, v1112fm)</li>
<li>Klingon Honor Guard (219)</li>
<li>NERF Arena Blast (v300)</li>
<li>TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter (v200)</li>
<li>Rune Classic (v1.10)</li>
<li>Clive Barker's Undying (v420)</li>
<li>Tactical-Ops: Assault on Terror (v3.4.0 and v3.5.0 - both running under UT436 and UT469 engines)</li>
<li>Wheel of Time (v333)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">From the list above, only Unreal Tournament v436 and Unreal Gold v226 is in a relatively playable state. Running any other game (and UT versions) can and will result in crashes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unreal Tournament v436</h3><a id="user-content-unreal-tournament-v436" aria-label="Permalink: Unreal Tournament v436" href="#unreal-tournament-v436"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The game launches, menu options will work and botmatches can be played, however the bots will barely have any AI (they move around sometimes and retaliate upon being attacked), and some maps will have some functionality missing (like DM-Morpheus will not have the "X leading the match" screens work).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unreal Gold v226</h3><a id="user-content-unreal-gold-v226" aria-label="Permalink: Unreal Gold v226" href="#unreal-gold-v226"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The game launches, menu options will work most of the time. Single player maps can be played, as well as botmatches. The AI will behave more or less the same as how they behave in UT. Objects from Return to Na Pali have their models appear broken.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deus Ex v1112fm</h3><a id="user-content-deus-ex-v1112fm" aria-label="Permalink: Deus Ex v1112fm" href="#deus-ex-v1112fm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Only the intro flyby works. No keyboard or mouse inputs will be detected, as Deus Ex handles them differently than Unreal/UT.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Command line parameters</h2><a id="user-content-command-line-parameters" aria-label="Permalink: Command line parameters" href="#command-line-parameters"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>SurrealEngine [--url=&lt;mapname&gt;] [--engineversion=X] [Path to game folder]</code></p>
<p dir="auto">You can simply copy paste the SurrealEngine executable inside the System folder of your UE1 game of choice, and run it from there. If no game folder is specified, and the executable isn't in a System folder, the engine will search the registry (Windows only) for the registry keys Epic originally set. If no URL is specified it will use the default URL in the ini file (per default the intro map). The --engineversion argument overrides the internal version detected by the engine and should only be used for debugging purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows build instructions</h2><a id="user-content-windows-build-instructions" aria-label="Permalink: Windows build instructions" href="#windows-build-instructions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Use CMake to build the project. A recent version of Visual Studio, and MSVC compiler that supports C++17 is required.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, SDL2 is an optional dependency that you need to supply locally yourself (download the Visual C++ version of SDL2, extract it somewhere and point to that folder in CMake settings). Supplying SDL2 will allow you to use it as an alternative windowing system.</p>
<p dir="auto">Other than that there are no other external third party dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux build instructions</h2><a id="user-content-linux-build-instructions" aria-label="Permalink: Linux build instructions" href="#linux-build-instructions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Use CMake to build the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the folder you want to clone the repo to (commands should be entered in the given order):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine.git
cd SurrealEngine
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 16"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine.git
cd SurrealEngine
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 16
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When compilation is successfully finished, <code>build</code> folder should contain these 3 executables: <code>SurrealEngine</code>, <code>SurrealEditor</code> and <code>SurrealDebugger</code></p>
<p dir="auto">You'll need the dev packages for the following things:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>cmake</li>
<li>g++</li>
<li>pthreads</li>
<li>dl</li>
<li>alsa (libasound2)</li>
<li>SDL2</li>
<li>waylandpp (optional) (C++ bindings for Wayland, used on ZWidget Wayland backend)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On Linux, SDL2 is required, as SurrealEngine will utilise it for its windowing functionalities and native Wayland support (with <code>SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that these packages won't always have the exact names given above, as it can change from distro to distro. In general, if you get an include error that looks like it is trying to include something external, then you are probably missing the dev package for that library. :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You probably haven’t heard of cardiologist Don Poldermans, but experts who study scientific misconduct believe that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2014/01/15/medicine-or-mass-murder-guideline-based-on-discredited-research-may-have-caused-800000-deaths-in-europe-over-the-last-5-years/">thousands of people may be dead</a> because of him. </p><p>Poldermans was a prolific medical researcher at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, where he analyzed the standards of care for cardiac surgery, publishing a series of definitive studies from 1999 until the early 2010s.</p><p>One crucial question he studied: Should you give patients a beta blocker, which lowers blood pressure, before certain heart surgeries? Poldermans’s research said yes. European medical guidelines (and to a lesser extent US guidelines) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20068416/">recommended it accordingly</a>. </p><div><p>The problem? Poldermans’s data <a href="https://cardiobrief.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/integrity-report-2012-10-english-translation.pdf">was reportedly fake</a>. A <a href="https://cardiobrief.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/integrity-report-2012-10-english-translation.pdf">2012 inquiry by Erasmus Medical School, his employer, into allegations of misconduct</a> found that he “used patient data without written permission, used fictitious data and… submitted to conferences [reports] which included knowingly unreliable data.” Poldermans <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2011/11/17/breaking-news-prolific-dutch-heart-researcher-fired-over-misconduct-concerns/">admitted the allegations and apologized</a>, while stressing that the use of fictitious data was accidental. </p></div><div><p>Sign up <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p></div><p>After the revelations, a new meta-analysis was published in 2014, evaluating whether to use beta blockers before cardiac surgery. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3932762/">It found</a> that a course of beta blockers made it 27 percent more likely that someone would die within 30 days of their heart surgery. That is, the policy which Poldermans had recommended using falsified data, adopted in Europe on the basis of his research, was actually dramatically increasing the odds people would die in heart surgery. </p><p><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17525-heart-surgery">Tens of millions</a> of heart surgeries were conducted across the US and Europe during the years from 2009 to 2013 when those misguided guidelines were in place. One provocative analysis from cardiologists Graham Cole and Darrel Francis estimated that there were <a href="https://drmalcolmkendrick.org/tag/don-poldermans/">800,000 deaths</a> compared to if the best practices had been established five years sooner. While that exact number is hotly contested, a 27 percent increase in mortality for a common procedure for years on end can add up to an extraordinary death toll. </p><p>I learned about the Poldermans case when I reached out to some scientific misconduct researchers, asking them a provocative question: Should scientific fraud be prosecuted? </p><p>Unfortunately, fraud and misconduct in the scientific community isn’t nearly as rare as one might like to believe. We also know that the consequences of being caught are frequently underwhelming. It can take years to get a bad paper retracted, even if the flaws are readily apparent. Sometimes, scientists alleged to have falsified their data <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24107889/francesca-gino-lawsuit-harvard-dishonesty-researcher-academic-fraud">file frivolous lawsuits</a> against their peers who point it out, further silencing anyone who would speak out about bad data. And we know that this behavior can have high stakes, and can dramatically <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22776428/ivermectin-science-publication-research-fraud">affect treatment options for patients</a>. </p><p>In cases where research dishonesty is literally killing people, shouldn’t it be appropriate to resort to the criminal justice system?</p><div><p id="the-question-of-whether-research-fraud-should-be-a-crime"><h2>The question of whether research fraud should be a crime</h2></p></div><p>In some cases, research misconduct may be hard to distinguish from carelessness. </p><p>If a researcher fails to apply the appropriate statistical correction for multiple hypothesis testing, they will probably get some spurious results. In some cases, researchers are heavily incentivized to be careless in these ways by an academic culture that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process">puts non-null results above all else</a> (that is, rewarding researchers for finding an effect even if it is not a methodologically sound one, while being unwilling to publish sound research if it finds no effect). </p><p>But I’d argue it’s a bad idea to prosecute such behavior. It would produce a serious chilling effect on research, and likely make the scientific process slower and more legalistic — which also results in more deaths that could be avoided if science moved more freely. </p><p>So the conversation about whether to criminalize research fraud tends to focus on the most clear-cut cases: intentional falsification of data. Elisabeth Bik, a scientific researcher who studies fraud, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z">made a name for herself</a> by demonstrating that photographs of test results in many medical journals were <a href="https://www.vox.com/unexplainable/23945153/how-to-catch-a-scientific-fraud">clearly altered</a>. That’s not the kind of thing that can be an innocent mistake, so it represents something of a baseline for how often manipulated data is published.</p><p>While technically some scientific fraud could fall under existing statutes that prohibit lying on, say, a grant application, in practice scientific fraud is more or less never prosecuted. Poldermans eventually lost his job in 2011, but most of his papers weren’t even retracted, and he faced no further consequences. </p><p>But in response to growing awareness of fraud’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/scientific-misconduct-retraction-watch">frequency</a> and its harms, some scientists and scientific-fraud watchdogs have <a href="https://chris-said.io/2024/06/17/the-case-for-criminalizing-scientific-misconduct/">proposed changing that</a>. A new statute, narrowly tailored to scientific fakery, could make it clearer where to draw the line between carelessness and fraud. </p><p>The question is whether legal consequences would actually help with our fraud problem. I asked Bik what she thought about proposals to criminalize the misconduct that she studied. </p><p>Her reaction was that, while it’s not clear whether criminalization is the right approach, people should understand that currently there are almost no consequences for wrongdoers. “It’s maddening when you see people cheat,” she told me, “And even if it involves grant money from the NIH, there’s very little punishment. Even with people who have been caught cheating, the punishment is super light. You are not eligible to apply for new grants for the next year or sometimes three years. It’s very rare that people lose jobs over it.”</p><p>Why is that? Fundamentally, it’s a problem of incentives. It is embarrassing for institutions when one of their researchers commits misconduct, so they’d rather impose a mild penalty and not keep digging. There’s little incentive for anyone to get to the bottom of misconduct. “If the most serious consequence for speeding was a police officer saying ‘Don’t do that again,’ everyone would be speeding,” Bik told me. “This is the situation we have in science. Do whatever you want. If you get caught, it’ll take years to investigate.” </p><p>In some ways, a legal statute isn’t the ideal solution. Courts are also guilty of taking years to deliver justice in complex cases. They also aren’t well suited to answering detailed scientific questions, and would almost certainly be relying on scientific institutions that conduct investigations — so what really matters is those institutions, not whether they’re attached to a court, a nonprofit, or to the NIH.</p><p>But in sufficiently severe cases of misconduct, it does seem to me that it’d be a major advantage to have an institution outside academia at work on getting to the bottom of these cases. If well designed, a statute that allowed prosecution for scientific fraud could shift the overwhelming incentives to let misconduct go unpunished and move on. </p><p>If there were ongoing investigations conducted by an outside agency (like a prosecutor), it would no longer be easiest for institutions to maintain their reputation by sweeping incidents of fraud under the rug. But the outside agency would not actually have to be a prosecutor; an independent scientific review board would probably also suffice, Bik said. </p><p>Ultimately, prosecution is a blunt tool. It might help provide accountability in cases where no one is incentivized to provide it — and I do think in cases of misconduct that lead to thousands of deaths, it would be a matter of justice. But it’s neither the only way to solve our fraud problem nor necessarily the best one. </p><p>So far, however, efforts to build institutions within the scientific community that police misconduct have had only limited success. At this point, I’d consider it a positive if there were efforts to allow external institutions to police misconduct as well.</p></div></div>]]></description>
