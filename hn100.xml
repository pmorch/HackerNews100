            <h2 id="the-computational-view-of-time">The Computational View of Time</h2>
<p>Time is a central feature of human experience. But what actually is it? In traditional scientific accounts it’s often represented as some kind of coordinate much like space (though a coordinate that for some reason is always systematically increasing for us). But while this may be a useful mathematical description, it’s not telling us anything about what time in a sense “intrinsically is”. </p>
<p>We get closer as soon as we start thinking in computational terms. Because then it’s natural for us to think of successive states of the world as being computed one from the last by the progressive application of some computational rule. And this suggests that we can identify the progress of time with the “progressive doing of <nobr id="link-test"> computation</nobr> by the universe”. </p>
<p>But does this just mean that we are replacing a “time coordinate” with a “computational step count”? No. Because of the phenomenon of <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-6--computational-irreducibility">computational irreducibility</a>. With the traditional mathematical idea of a time coordinate one typically imagines that this coordinate can be “set to any value”, and that then one can immediately calculate the state of the system at that time. But computational irreducibility implies that it’s not that easy. Because it says that there’s often essentially no better way to find what a system will do than by explicitly tracing through each step in its evolution.<span id="more-63438"></span></p>
<p>In the pictures on the left there’s computational reducibility, and one can readily see what state will be after any number of steps <em>t</em>. But in the pictures on the right there’s (presumably) computational irreducibility, so that the only way to tell what will happen after <em>t</em> steps is effectively to run all those steps:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2024/10/sw10082024timeBimg1.png" alt="" title="" width="642" height="178"> </p>
</div>
<p>And this implies is that there’s a certain robustness to time when viewed in these computational terms. There’s no way to “jump ahead” in time; the only way to find out what will happen in the future is to go through the irreducible computational steps to get there. </p>
<p>There are simple idealized systems (say with purely periodic behavior) where there’s computational reducibility, and where there isn’t any robust notion of the progress of time. But the point is that—as the <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence/">Principle of Computational Equivalence</a> implies—our universe is inevitably full of computational irreducibility which in effect defines a robust notion of the progress of time.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-observer">The Role of the Observer</h2>
<p>That time is a reflection of the progress of computation in the universe is an important starting point. But it’s not the end of the story. For example, here’s an immediate issue. If we have a computational rule that determines each successive state of a system it’s at least in principle possible to know the whole future of the system. So given this why then do we have the experience of the future only “unfolding as it happens”?</p>
<p>It’s fundamentally because of the way <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/12/observer-theory/">we are as observers</a>. If the underlying system is computationally irreducible, then to work out its future behavior requires an irreducible amount of computational work. But it’s a core feature of observers like us that we are computationally bounded. So we can’t do all that irreducible computational work to “know the whole future”—and instead we’re effectively stuck just doing computation alongside the system itself, never able to substantially “jump ahead”, and only able to see the future “progressively unfold”.</p>
<p>In essence, therefore, we experience time because of the interplay between our computational boundedness as observers, and the computational irreducibility of underlying processes in the universe. If we were not computationally bounded, we could “perceive the whole of the future in one gulp” and we wouldn’t need a notion of time at all. And if there wasn’t underlying computational irreducibility there wouldn’t be the kind of “progressive revealing of the future” that we associate with our experience of time.</p>
<p>A notable feature of our everyday perception of time is that it seems to “flow only in one direction”—so that for example it’s generally much easier to remember the past than to predict the future. And this is closely related to the Second Law of thermodynamics, which (as <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/">I’ve argued at length elsewhere</a>) is once again a result of the interplay between underlying computational irreducibility and our computational boundedness. Yes, the microscopic laws of physics may be reversible (and indeed if our system is simple—and computationally reducible—enough of this reversibility may “shine through”). But the point is that computational irreducibility is in a sense a much stronger force.</p>
<p>Imagine that we prepare a state to have orderly structure. If its evolution is computationally irreducible then this structure will effectively be “encrypted” to the point where a computationally bounded observer can’t recognize the structure. Given underlying reversibility, the structure is in some sense inevitably “still there”—but it can’t be “accessed” by a computationally bounded observer. And as a result such an observer will perceive a definite flow from orderliness in what is prepared to disorderliness in what is observed. (In principle one might think it should be possible to set up a state that will “behave antithermodynamically”—but the point is that to do so would require predicting a computationally irreducible process, which a computationally bounded observer can’t do.)</p>
<p>One of the longstanding confusions about the nature of time has to do with its “mathematical similarity” to space. And indeed ever since the early days of relativity theory it’s seemed convenient to talk about “spacetime” in which notions of space and time are bundled together.</p>
<p>But in our <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physics Project</a> that’s not at all how things fundamentally work. At the lowest level the state of the universe is <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#what-is-space">represented by a hypergraph</a> which captures what can be thought of as the “spatial relations” between discrete “atoms of space”. <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#time">Time then corresponds</a> to the progressive rewriting of this hypergraph.</p>
<p>And in a sense the “atoms of time” are the elementary “rewriting events” that occur. If the “output” from one event is needed to provide “input” to another, then we can think of the first event as preceding the second event in time—and the events as being “timelike separated”. And in general we can construct a <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-graph-of-causal-relationships">causal graph</a> that shows the dependencies between different events. </p>
<p>So how does this relate to time—and spacetime? As we’ll discuss below, our everyday experience of time is that it follows a single thread. And so we tend to want to “parse” the causal graph of elementary events into a series of slices that we can view as corresponding to “successive times”. As in <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#deriving-special-relativity">standard relativity theory</a>, there typically isn’t a unique way to assign a sequence of such “simultaneity surfaces”, with the result that there are different “reference frames” in which the identifications of space and time are different. </p>
<p>The complete causal graph bundles together what we usually think of as space with what we usually think of as time. But ultimately the progress of time is always associated with some choice of successive events that “computationally build on each other”. And, yes, it’s more complicated because of the possibilities of different choices. But the basic idea of the progress of time as “the doing of computation” is very much the same. (In a sense time represents “computational progress” in the universe, while space represents the “layout of its data structure”.)</p>
<p>Very much as in the derivation of the Second Law (or of fluid mechanics from molecular dynamics), the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#general-relativity-and-gravity">derivation of Einstein’s equations</a> for the large-scale behavior of spacetime from the underlying causal graph of hypergraph rewriting depends on the fact that we are computationally bounded observers. But even though we’re computationally bounded, we still have to “have something going on inside”, or we wouldn’t record—or sense—any “progress in time”.</p>
<p>It seems to be the essence of observers like us—as captured in my <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/12/observer-theory/">recent Observer Theory</a>—that we equivalence many different states of the world to derive our internal perception of “what’s going on outside”. And at some rough level we might imagine that we’re sensing time passing by the rate at which we add to those internal perceptions. If we’re not adding to the perceptions, then in effect time will stop for us—as happens if we’re asleep, anesthetized or dead. </p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that in some extreme situations it’s not the internal structure of the observer that makes perceived time stop; instead it’s the underlying structure of the universe itself. As we’ve mentioned, the “progress of the universe” is associated with successive rewriting of the underlying hypergraph. But when there’s been “too much activity in the hypergraph” (which physically corresponds roughly to too much energy-momentum), one can end up with a situation in which “there are no more rewrites that can be done”—so that in effect some part of the universe can no longer progress, <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/cosmology-expansion-and-singularities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and “time stops” there</a>. It’s analogous to what happens at a spacelike singularity (normally associated with a black hole) in traditional general relativity. But now it has a very direct computational interpretation: one’s reached a “fixed point” at which there’s no more computation to do. And so there’s no progress to make in time.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-threads-of-time">Multiple Threads of Time</h2>
<p>Our strong human experience is that time progresses as a single thread. But now our <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#the-inevitability-of-quantum-mechanics">Physics Project suggests</a> that at an underlying level time is actually in effect multithreaded, or, in other words, that there are many different “paths of history” that the universe follows. And it is only because of the way we as observers sample things that we experience time as a single thread. </p>
<p>At the level of a particular underlying hypergraph the point is that there may be many different updating events that can occur, and each sequence of such updating event defines a different “path of history”. We can summarize all these paths of history in a multiway graph in which we merge identical states that arise:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2024/10/sw10082024timeAimg2.png" alt="" title="" width="194" height="242"> </p>
</div>
<p>But given this underlying structure, why is it that we as observers believe that time progresses as a single thread? It all has to do with the notion of <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-concept-of-branchial-graphs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">branchial space</a>, and our presence within branchial space. The presence of many paths of history is what leads to quantum mechanics; the fact that we as <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/12/observer-theory/#the-case-of-quantum-mechanics">observers ultimately perceive just one path</a> is associated with the traditionally-quite-mysterious phenomenon of “measurement” in quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>When we talked about causal graphs above, we said that we could “parse” them as a series of “spacelike” slices corresponding to instantaneous “states of space”—represented by spatial hypergraphs. And by analogy we can similarly imagine breaking multiway graphs into “instantaneous slices”. But now these slices don’t represent states of ordinary space; instead they represent states of what we call branchial space.</p>
<p>Ordinary space is “knitted together” by updating events that have causal effects on other events that can be thought of as “located at different places in space”. (Or, said differently, space is knitted together by the overlaps of the elementary light cones of different events.) Now we can think of branchial space as being “knitted together” by updating events that have effects on events that end up on different branches of history. </p>
<p>(In general there is a close analogy between ordinary space and branchial space, and we can define a multiway causal graph that includes both “spacelike” and “branchlike” directions—with the branchlike direction supporting not light cones but what we can call entanglement cones.)</p>
<p>So how do we as observers parse what’s going on? A key point is that we are inevitably part of the system we’re observing. So the branching (and merging) that’s going on in the system at large is also going on in us. So that means we have to ask how a “branching mind” will perceive a branching universe. Underneath, there are lots of branches, and lots of “threads of history”. And there’s lots of computational irreducibility (and even what we can call <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/games-and-puzzles-as-multicomputational-systems/#humanizing-multicomputational-processes">multicomputational irreducibility</a>). But computationally bounded observers like us have to equivalence most of those details to wind up with something that “fits in our finite minds”. </p>
<p>We can make an analogy to what happens in a gas. Underneath, there are lots of molecules bouncing around (and behaving in computationally irreducible ways). But observers like us are big compared to molecules, and (being computationally bounded) we don’t get to perceive their individual behavior, but only their aggregate behavior—from which we extract a thin set of computationally reducible “fluid-dynamics-level” features. </p>
<p>And it’s basically the same story with the underlying structure of space. Underneath, there’s an elaborately changing network of discrete atoms of space. But as large, computationally bounded observers we can only sample aggregate features in which many details have been equivalenced, and in which space tends to seem continuous and describable in basically computationally reducible ways. </p>
<p>So what about branchial space? Well, it’s basically the same story. Our minds are “big”, in the sense that they span many individual branches of history. And they’re computationally bounded so they can’t perceive the details of all those branches, but only certain aggregated features. And in a first approximation what then emerges is in effect a single aggregated thread of history. </p>
<p>With sufficiently careful measurements we can sometimes see “quantum effects” in which multiple threads of history are in evidence. But at a direct human level we always seem to aggregate things to the point where what we perceive is just a single thread of history—or in effect a single thread of progression in time.</p>
<p>It’s not immediately obvious that any of these “aggregations” will work. It could be that important effects we perceive in gases would depend on phenomena at the level of individual molecules. Or that to understand the large-scale structure of space we’d continually be having to think about detailed features of atoms of space. Or, similarly, that we’d never be able to maintain a “consistent view of history”, and that instead we’d always be having to trace lots of individual threads of history. </p>
<p>But the key point is that for us to stay as computationally bounded observers we have to pick out only features that are computationally reducible—or in effect boundedly simple to describe. </p>
<p>Closely related to our computational boundedness is the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/">important assumption</a> we make that we as observers have a certain persistence. At every moment in time, we are made from different atoms of space and different branches in the multiway graph. Yet we believe we are still “the same us”. And the crucial physical fact (that has to be derived in our model) is that in ordinary circumstances there’s no inconsistency in doing this.</p>
<p>So the result is that even though there are many “threads of time” at the lowest level—representing many different “quantum branches”—observers like us can (usually) successfully still view there as being a single consistent perceived thread of time.</p>
<p>But there’s another issue here. It’s one thing to say that a single observer (say a single human mind or a single measuring device) can perceive history to follow a single, consistent thread. But what about different human minds, or different measuring devices? Why should they perceive any kind of consistent “objective reality”?</p>
<p>Essentially the answer, I think, is that they’re all sufficiently nearby in branchial space. If we think about physical space, observers in different parts of the universe will clearly “see different things happening”. The “laws of physics” may be the same—but what star (if any) is nearby will be different. Yet (at least for the foreseeable future) for all of us humans it’s always the same star that’s nearby. </p>
<p>And so it is, presumably, in branchial space. There’s some small patch in which we humans—with our shared origins—exist. And it’s presumably because that patch is small relative to all of branchial space that all of us perceive a consistent thread of history and a common objective reality. </p>
<p>There are many subtleties to this, many of which aren’t yet fully worked out. In physical space, we know that effects can in principle spread at the speed of light. And in branchial space the analog is that effects can spread at the maximum entanglement speed (whose value we don’t know, though it’s <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/units-and-scales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">related by Planck unit conversions to the elementary length and elementary time</a>). But in maintaining our shared “objective” view of the universe it’s crucial that we’re not all going off in different directions at the speed of light. And of course the reason that doesn’t happen is that we don’t have zero mass. And indeed presumably nonzero mass is a critical part of being observers like us. </p>
<p>In our Physics Project it’s roughly the density of events in the hypergraph that determines the density of energy (and mass) in physical space (with their associated gravitational effects). And similarly it’s roughly the density of events in the multiway graph (or in branchial graph slices) that determines the density of action—the relativistically invariant analog of energy—in branchial space (with its associated effects on quantum phase). And though it’s not yet completely clear how this works, it seems likely that once again when there’s mass, effects don’t just “go off at the maximum entanglement speed in all directions”, but instead stay nearby.</p>
<p>There are definitely connections between “staying at the same place”, believing one is persistent, and being computationally bounded. But these are what seem necessary for us to have our typical view of time as a single thread. In principle we can imagine observers very different from us—say with minds (like the inside of an idealized quantum computer) capable of experiencing many different threads of history. But the Principle of Computational Equivalence suggests that there’s a high bar for such observers. They need not only to be able to deal with computational irreducibility but also multicomputational irreducibility, in which one includes both the process of computing new states, and the process of equivalencing states. </p>
<p>And so for observers that are “anything like us” we can expect that once again time will tend to be as we normally experience it, following a single thread, consistent between observers. </p>
<p>(It’s worth mentioning that all of this only works for observers like us “in situations like ours”. For example, at the <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/event-horizons-and-singularities-in-spacetime-and-quantum-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“entanglement horizon” for a black hole</a>—where branchially-oriented edges in the multiway causal graph get “trapped”—time as we know it in some sense “disintegrates”, because an observer won’t be able to “knit together” the different branches of history to “form a consistent classical thought” about what happens.)</p>
<h2 id="time-in-the-ruliad">Time in the Ruliad</h2>
<p>In what we’ve discussed so far we can think of the progress of time as being associated with the repeated application of rules that progressively “rewrite the state of the universe”. In the previous section we saw that these rules can be applied in many different ways, leading to many different underlying threads of history. </p>
<p>But so far we’ve imagined that the rules that get applied are always the same—leaving us with the mystery of “Why those rules, and not others?” But this is where <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/">the ruliad</a> comes in. Because the ruliad involves no such seemingly arbitrary choices: it’s what you get by following all possible computational rules.</p>
<p>One can imagine many bases for the ruliad. One can make it from all possible hypergraph rewritings. Or all possible (multiway) Turing machines. But in the end it’s a single, unique thing: the entangled limit of all possible computational processes. There’s a sense in which “everything can happen somewhere” in the ruliad. But what gives the ruliad structure is that there’s a definite (essentially geometrical) way in which all those different things that can happen are arranged and connected.</p>
<p>So what is our perception of the ruliad? Inevitably we’re part of the ruliad—so we’re observing it “from the inside”. But the crucial point is that what we perceive about it depends on what we are like as observers. And my big surprise in the past few years has been that assuming even just a little about what we’re like as observers immediately implies that what we perceive of the ruliad follows the core laws of physics we know. In other words, by assuming what we’re like as observers, we can in effect derive our laws of physics.</p>
<p>The key to all this is the interplay between the computational irreducibility of underlying behavior in the ruliad, and our computational boundedness as observers (together with our related assumption of our persistence). And it’s this interplay that gives us the Second Law in statistical mechanics, the Einstein equations for the structure of spacetime, and (we think) the path integral in quantum mechanics. In effect what’s happening is that our computational boundedness as observers makes us equivalence things to the point where we are sampling only computationally reducible slices of the ruliad, whose characteristics can be described using recognizable laws of physics.</p>
<p>So where does time fit into all of this? A central feature of the ruliad is that it’s unique—and everything about it is “abstractly necessary”. Much as given the definition of numbers, addition and equality it’s inevitable that one gets 1 + 1 = 2, so similarly given the definition of computation it’s inevitable that one gets the ruliad. Or, in other words, there’s no question about whether the ruliad exists; it’s just an abstract construct that inevitably follows from abstract definitions. </p>
<p>And so at some level this means that the ruliad inevitably just “exists as a complete thing”. And so if one could “view it from outside” one could think of it as just a single timeless object, with no notion of time. </p>
<p>But the crucial point is that we don’t get to “view it from the outside”. We’re embedded within it. And, what’s more, we must view it through the “lens” of our computational boundedness. And this is why we inevitably end up with a notion of time. </p>
<p>We observe the ruliad from some point within it. If we were not computationally bounded then we could immediately compute what the whole ruliad is like. But in actuality we can only discover the ruliad “one computationally bounded step at a time”—in effect progressively applying bounded computations to “move through rulial space”. </p>
<p>So even though in some abstract sense “the whole ruliad is already there” we only get to explore it step by step. And that’s what gives us our notion of time, through which we “progress”. </p>
<p>Inevitably, there are many different paths that we could follow through the ruliad. And indeed every mind (and every observer like us)—with its distinct inner experience—presumably follows a different path. But much as we described for branchial space, the reason we have a shared notion of “objective reality” is presumably that we are all very close together in rulial space; we form in a sense a tight “rulial flock”.</p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that not every sampling of the ruliad that may be accessible to us conveniently corresponds to exploration of progressive slices of time. Yes, that kind of “progression in time” is characteristic of our physical experience, and our typical way of describing it. But what about our experience, say, of mathematics?</p>
<p>The first point to make is that just as the ruliad contains all possible physics, it also <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/">contains all possible mathematics</a>. If we construct the ruliad, say from hypergraphs, the nodes are now not “atoms of space”, but instead abstract elements (that in general <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/the-physicalization-of-metamathematics-and-its-implications-for-the-foundations-of-mathematics/#metamath-emes">we call emes</a>) that form pieces of mathematical expressions and mathematical theorems. We can think of these abstract elements as being laid out now not in physical space, but in some abstract metamathematical space. </p>
<p>In our physical experience, we tend to remain localized in physical space, branchial space, etc. But in “doing mathematics” it’s more as if we’re progressively expanding in metamathematical space, carving out some domain of “theorems we assume are true”. And while we could identify some kind of “path of expansion” to let us define some analog of time, it’s not a necessary feature of the way we explore the ruliad.</p>
<p>Different places in the ruliad in a sense correspond to describing things using different rules. And by analogy to the concept of motion in physical space, we can effectively “move” from one place to another in the ruliad by translating the computations done by one set of rules to computations done by another. (And, yes, it’s nontrivial to even have the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/03/on-the-concept-of-motion/">possibility of “pure motion”</a>.) But if we indeed remain localized in the ruliad (and can maintain what we can think of as our “coherent identity”) then it’s natural to think of there being a “path of motion” along which we progress “with time”. But when we’re just “expanding our horizons” to encompass more paradigms and to bring more of rulial space into what’s covered by our minds (so that in effect we’re “expanding in rulial space”), it’s not really the same story. We’re not thinking of ourselves as “doing computation in order to move”. Instead, we’re just identifying equivalences and using them to expand our definition of ourselves, which is something that we can at least approximate (much like in “quantum measurement” in traditional physics) as happening “outside of time”. Ultimately, though, everything that happens must be the result of computations that occur. It’s just that we don’t usually “package” these into what we can describe as a definite thread of time.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-in-the-end-is-time">So What in the End Is Time?</h2>
<p>From the paradigm (and Physics Project ideas) that we’ve discussed here, the question “What is time?” is at some level simple: time is what progresses when one applies computational rules. But what’s critical is that time can in effect be defined abstractly, independent of the details of those rules, or the “substrate” to which they’re applied. And what makes this possible is the Principle of Computational Equivalence, and the ubiquitous phenomenon of computational irreducibility that it implies.</p>
<p>To begin with, the fact that time can robustly be thought of as “progressing”, in effect in a linear chain, is a consequence of computational irreducibility—because computational irreducibility is what tells us that computationally bounded observers like us can’t in general ever “jump ahead”; we just have to follow a linear chain of steps. </p>
<p>But there’s something else as well. The Principle of Computational Equivalence implies that there’s in a sense just one (ubiquitous) kind of computational irreducibility. So when we look at different systems following different irreducible computational rules, there’s inevitably a certain universality to what they do. In effect they’re all “accumulating computational effects” in the same way. Or in essence progressing through time in the same way.</p>
<p>There’s a close analogy here with heat. It could be that there’d be detailed molecular motion that even on a large scale <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/how-did-we-get-here-the-tangled-history-of-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#what-is-heat">worked noticeably differently in different materials</a>. But the fact is that we end up being able to characterize any such motion just by saying that it represents a certain amount of heat, without getting into more details. And that’s very much the same kind of thing as being able to say that such-and-such an amount of time has passed, without having to get into the details of how some clock or other system that reflects the passage of time actually works.</p>
<p>And in fact there’s more than a “conceptual analogy” here. Because the <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/">phenomenon of heat is again a consequence of computational irreducibility</a>. And the fact that there’s a uniform, “abstract” characterization of it is a consequence of the universality of computational irreducibility.</p>
<p>It’s worth emphasizing again, though, that just as with heat, a robust concept of time depends on us being computationally bounded observers. If we were not, then we’d able to break the Second Law by doing detailed computations of molecular processes, and we wouldn’t just describe things in terms of randomness and heat. And similarly, we’d be able to break the linear flow of time, either jumping ahead or following different threads of time. </p>
<p>But as computationally bounded observers of computationally irreducible processes, it’s basically inevitable that—at least to a good approximation—we’ll view time as something that forms a single one-dimensional thread. </p>
<p>In traditional mathematically based science there’s often a feeling that the goal should be to “predict the future”—or in effect to “outrun time”. But computational irreducibility tells us that in general we can’t do this, and that the only way to find out what will happen is just to run the same computation as the system itself, essentially step by step. But while this might seem like a letdown for the power of science, we can also see it as what gives meaning and significance to time. If we could always jump ahead then at some level nothing would ever fundamentally be achieved by the <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/chap-12--the-principle-of-computational-equivalence#sect-12-7--the-phenomenon-of-free-will">passage of time (or, say, by the living of our lives)</a>; we’d always be able to just say what will happen, without “living through” how we got there. But computational irreducibility gives time and the process of it passing a kind of hard, tangible character.</p>
<p>So what does all this imply for the various classic issues (and apparent paradoxes) that arise in the way time is usually discussed? </p>
<p>Let’s start with the question of reversibility. The traditional laws of physics basically apply both forwards and backwards in time. And the ruliad is inevitably symmetrical between “forward” and “backward” rules. So why is it then that in our typical experience time always seems to “run in the same direction”? </p>
<p>This is closely related to the Second Law, and once again it’s consequence of our computational boundedness interacting with underlying computational irreducibility. In a sense what defines the direction of time for us is that we (typically) find it much easier to remember the past than to predict the future. Of course, we don’t remember every detail of the past. We only remember what amounts to certain “filtered” features that “fit in our finite minds”. And when it comes to predicting the future, we’re limited by our inability to “outrun” computational irreducibility. </p>
<p>Let’s recall how the Second Law works. It basically says that if we set up some state that’s “ordered” or “simple” then this will tend to “degrade” to one that’s “disordered” or “random”. (We can think of the evolution of the system as effectively “encrypting” the specification of our starting state to the point where we—as computationally bounded observers—can no longer recognize its ordered origins.) But because our underlying laws are reversible, this degradation (or “encryption”) must happen when we go both forwards and backwards in time:</p>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2024/10/sw10082024timeAimg3.png" alt="" title="" width="169" height="167"> </p>
</div>
<p>But the point is that our “experiential” definition of the direction of time (in which the “past” is what we remember, and the “future” is what we find hard to predict) is inevitably aligned with the “thermodynamic” direction of time we observe in the world at large. And the reason is that in both cases we’re defining the past to be something that’s computationally bounded (while the future can be computationally irreducible). In the experiential case the past is computationally bounded because that’s what we can remember. In the thermodynamic case it’s computationally bounded because those are the states we can prepare. In other words, the “arrows of time” are aligned because in both cases we are in effect “requiring the past to be simpler”. </p>
<p>So what about time travel? It’s a concept that seems natural—and perhaps even inevitable—if one imagines that “time is just like space”. But it becomes a lot less natural when we think of time in the way we’re doing here: as a process of applying computational rules. </p>
<p>Indeed, at the lowest level, these rules are by definition just sequentially applied, producing one state after another—and in effect “progressing in one direction through time”. But things get more complicated if we consider not just the raw, lowest-level rules, but what we might actually observe of their effects. For example, what if the rules lead to a state that’s identical to one they’ve produced before (as happens, for example, in a system with periodic behavior)? If we equivalence the state now and the state before (so we represent both as a single state) then we can <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/#black-holes-singularities-etc">end up with a loop in our causal graph (a “closed timelike curve”)</a>. And, yes, in terms of the raw sequence of applying rules these states can be considered different. But the point is that if they are identical in every feature then any observer will inevitably consider them the same. </p>
<p>But will such equivalent states ever actually occur? As soon as there’s computational irreducibility it’s basically inevitable that the states will never perfectly match up. And indeed for the states to contain an observer like us (with “memory”, etc.) it’s basically impossible that they can match up. </p>
<p>But can one imagine an observer (or a “timecraft”) that would lead to states that match up? Perhaps somehow it could carefully pick particular sequences of atoms of space (or elementary events) that would lead it to states that have “happened before”. And indeed in a computationally simple system this might be possible. But as soon as there’s computational irreducibility, this simply isn’t something one can expect any computationally bounded observer to be able to do. And, yes, this is directly analogous to why one <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/computational-foundations-for-the-second-law-of-thermodynamics/#maxwells-demon-and-the-character-of-observers">can’t have a “Maxwell’s demon”</a> observer that “breaks the Second Law”. Or why one can’t have something that carefully navigates the lowest-level structure of space to <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/10/faster-than-light-in-our-model-of-physics-some-preliminary-thoughts/">effectively travel faster than light</a>. </p>
<p>But even if there can’t be time travel in which “time for an observer goes backwards”, there can still be changes in “perceived time”, say as a result of relativistic effects associated with motion. For example, one classic relativistic effect is time dilation, in which “time goes slower” when objects go faster. And, yes, given certain assumptions, there’s a straightforward mathematical derivation of this effect. But in our effort to understand the nature of time we’re led to ask what its physical mechanism might be. And it turns out that in our Physics Project it has a surprisingly direct—and almost “mechanical”—explanation.</p>
<p>One starts from the fact that in our Physics Project space and everything in it is represented by a hypergraph which is continually getting rewritten. And the evolution of any object through time is then defined by these rewritings. But if the object moves, then in effect it has to be “re-created at a different place in space”—and this process takes up a certain number of rewritings, leaving fewer for the intrinsic evolution of the object itself, and thus causing time to effectively “run slower” for it. (And, yes, while this is a qualitative description, one can make it quite formal and precise, and recover the usual formulas for relativistic time dilation.)</p>
<p>Something similar happens with gravitational fields. In our Physics Project, energy-momentum (and thus gravity) is effectively associated with greater activity in the underlying hypergraph. And the presence of this greater activity leads to more rewritings, causing “time to run faster” for any object in that region of space (corresponding to the traditional “gravitational redshift”). </p>
<p>More extreme versions of this occur in the context of black holes. (Indeed, one can roughly think of spacelike singularities as places where “time ran so fast that it ended”.) And in general—as we discussed above—there are many “relativistic effects” in which notions of space and time get mixed in various ways. </p>
<p>But even at a much more mundane level there’s a certain crucial relationship between space and time for observers like us. The key point is that observers like us tend to “parse” the world into a sequence of “states of space” at successive “moments in time”. But the fact that we do this depends on some quite specific features of us, and in particular our effective physical scale in space as compared to time. </p>
<p>In our everyday life we’re typically looking at scenes involving objects that are perhaps tens of meters away from us. And given the speed of light that means photons from these objects get to us in less than a microsecond. But it takes our brains milliseconds to register what we’ve seen. And this disparity of timescales is what leads us to view the world as consisting of a sequence of states of space at successive moments in time. </p>
<p>If our brains “ran” a million times faster (i.e. at the speed of digital electronics) we’d perceive photons arriving from different parts of a scene at different times, and we’d presumably no longer view the world in terms of overall states of space existing at successive times. </p>
<p>The same kind of thing would happen if we kept the speed of our brains the same, but dealt with scenes of a much larger scale (as we already do in dealing with spacecraft, astronomy, etc.).</p>
<p>But while this affects what it is that we think time is “acting on”, it doesn’t ultimately affect the nature of time itself. Time remains that computational process by which successive states of the world are produced. Computational irreducibility gives time a certain rigid character, at least for computationally bounded observers like us. And the Principle of Computational Equivalence allows there to be a robust notion of time independent of the “substrate” that’s involved: whether us as observers, the everyday physical world, or, for that matter, the whole universe. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/htmx-critique/">https://chrisdone.com/posts/htmx-critique/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41781457">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>At work, we really like the basic simple idea of Htmx. Based on using
Htmx in a non-trivial user interface, across a team, we’ve found that
the following cases are actually not simple and are quite
complicated.</p>
<h2 id="inheritance-of-htmx-properties-is-a-definite-mistake">Inheritance of
Htmx properties is a definite mistake</h2>
<p>Across pieces of code, it’s very surprising and it’s implicit. Like
in CSS, inheritance is a cheap hack but you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>It contradicts <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/">the author’s
reasonable argument of locality of behaviour.</a> It’s not local, it
comes from all the way up there or some other module. Pretty much
dynamic binding.</p>
<p>Default inheritance differs across various properties
(e.g.&nbsp;<code>hx-delete</code> is not inherited, but
<code>hx-confirm</code> and <code>hx-ext</code> are). So you have to
remember these exceptions and you end up just being explicit about
everything, which means inheritance is pointless.</p>
<h2 id="most-interesting-web-apps-cannot-replace-wholesale-a-dom-element">Most
interesting web apps cannot replace wholesale a DOM element</h2>
<p>Because DOM elements almost always have browser-local state, such as
the open/closed state of a <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element, the
input of an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, the open/close state of
a dropdown element (which, note, is not encoded by an attribute of the
element when you click it). All of this state is lost if you replace
outerHTML directly with the naive happy path of Htmx.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://v1.htmx.org/extensions/morphdom-swap/">morphdom</a>
overwrites some things you’d expect it not to, so we had to patch it to
avoid messing with input elements, and details elements.</p>
<h2 id="storing-state-in-the-dom-element-itself-is-a-bad-idea">Storing
state in the DOM element itself is a bad idea</h2>
<p><a href="https://v1.htmx.org/extensions/morphdom-swap/">Morphdom</a>
is intended to correct the pains of the previous heading, but we
discovered that the way that Htmx works <em>assumes</em> it’s based on
replacing elements wholesale: it stores the request queue for the
element on the DOM element itself. When you kick off a request, either
from this element or from another that points to it, you have a request
queue. Some bad failure modes are avoided by wholesale-replacing the DOM
element, as the queue is reset. But with morphdom, the queue is retained
because the element is retained. You’re now in a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior">undefined
behavior land</a>, where the designs of Htmx are violated.</p>
<h2 id="the-default-queuing-mode-is-bonkers">The default queuing mode is
bonkers</h2>
<p>By default, Htmx will cancel requests that are in-flight if you
trigger another request on the same queue (element). That’s the default
strategy. We discovered this afterwards. It’s highly unintuitive, it
meant we were losing work.</p>
<h2 id="event-triggers-are-non-local">Event triggers are non-local</h2>
<p>Event triggers often help to make things happen, but they’re a
non-local effect, and suffer from similar issues as property
inheritance. A bit of DSL work in the server-side language can help with
this, but it feels like old-school JavaScript callback-based programming
to some extent; where you “subscribe” to an event happening and do
something.</p>
<h2 id="component-state-cannot-be-maintained-very-well">Component state
cannot be maintained very well</h2>
<p>A broader problem, similar to the DOM element state issue, is that
your own components have their own state. E.g. if you want a page that
consists of three sections that have their own state that the server
needs (e.g.&nbsp;which page of a set of results) and state that some
e.g.&nbsp;React or WebComponents need, then you have a problem of
synchronising state between a parent component and the child
component.</p>
<p>Htmx does not provide a good story for this. We have some ideas, but
they all have big caveats: use query parameters, use hidden form inputs,
use event triggers.</p>
<p>React and Halogen (see also <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/halogen-is-better-than-react/">Halogen
is better than React at everything</a>) <em>do</em> have an answer to
this. In both cases, child components have their own state, and parents
can give them “props” which are pretty much “advice”, and they also have
their own internal state, and can choose to ignore/take precedence over
props. The props are typically sourced from the server or derived from
the server, and the state is usually some client-side state.</p>
<p>We often do need to use React for off-the-shelf components or
components that we have to use that are just provided as React. React
and Htmx do not interact nicely.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve done some unsatisfying work with WebComponents, but those
things have bizarre limitations that are surprising.</li>
<li>We’ve also made a bridge directly to React components that we use
from our server-side language, but in general Htmx and React fight for
control over the flow of state and management of DOM elements.</li>
<li>We’ve played with Alpine, which is nice, but it represents <em>yet
another</em> client-side-programming library and is therefore redundant
if React is already in your codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-up-sides">The up sides</h2>
<p>Our current thinking is that being able to use your server side
language is <strong>a huge obvious and uncontroversial win</strong>, no
one on the team would want to go back to writing all this business logic
in TypeScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>No serialisation from our DB types to frontend types is needed.
<ul>
<li>No data leaks, and no GraphQL needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can use our (in our opinion) more powerful abstraction facilities
of the server-side language.</li>
<li>We can use the form builder in our server side language; instead of
doing one frontend <em>and also</em> one backend implementation of the
same validations.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the above downsides are real.</p>
<h2 id="htmx-in-react">Htmx-in-React?</h2>
<p>An attractive future direction might be to re-implement Htmx in
React:</p>
<ul>
<li>The server sends a JSON blob that React converts into virtual DOM
components.</li>
<li>That would solve the component state problem.</li>
<li>It would mean we require no special bridge to use React
components.</li>
<li>It would let us use our React-connected web fetching library, and
carefully avoid the queuing choices made by Htmx.</li>
<li>It would solve the morphdom problems and browser DOM input elements
problem, too, which is pretty much a solved problem in React.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, we could drop the Htmx dependency but retain the
benefits of the idea. That is, given a budget to embark on such a big
piece of work.</p>

The most profound revelation in Thomas Piketty’s era-defining “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” wasn’t that we were experiencing Gilded Age levels of inequality, but his argument that Forbes’ list of the ultrawealthy isn’t accurate — and we don’t really know the billionaires living among us, or the extent of their wealth.</p><p>Last year, observers with the economic equivalent of a radio telescope detected a radiating anomaly on the February 28, 2023, daily balance sheet of the US Treasury Department: a $7 billion estate- and gift-tax payment.&nbsp;</p><p>John Ricco, now an analyst at Yale University’s Budget Lab, first spotted the huge receipt while trying to answer a somewhat macabre question: how did senior-citizen deaths from Covid affect government revenues? (<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/240607/pandemic-era-trends-estate-tax-collections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quite a bit</a> — high mortality and the frenzied pandemic stock market more than offset the Trump administration’s tax cuts.)</p><p>He was struck, though, by the appearance of that enormous deposit. “The degree by which this payment exceeds others in modern history — it’s not just, ‘Oh, this was the biggest one by 20%,’” Ricco said later. This was the biggest one by a factor of seven.</p><p>The data wasn’t erroneous, Treasury officials found, who are legally forbidden to discuss tax filings. But it was a mystery. Who died? And why didn’t they hire better tax attorneys?</p><p>It’s not just that this number is an outlier. These days, paying the estate tax is almost optional. Most estates aren’t taxed, and most people with an estate that is taxable — worth more than $13.6 million, or $27.2 million for a married couple — can afford to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/more-than-half-of-americas-100-richest-people-exploit-special-trusts-to-avoid-estate-taxes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimize its impact</a> with careful tax planning and philanthropic largesse. When David Koch, the heir and conservative political activist, died in 2019, his reported $42.2 billion fortune didn’t leave a ripple in the estate-tax data. After that $7 billion payment, the next highest receipt since 2005 was just over $1 billion deposited on January 10, 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These days, paying the estate tax is almost optional.</p><p>You don’t wind up one of the richest people in the world without entanglement in the world of wealth-management advisers and tax attorneys. Martin Behn, an attorney at the firm Lathrop GPM who specializes in estate planning, said that sufficiently advanced planning and enough charitable donations can dramatically reduce an end-of-life levy.</p><p>There are many complexities, but one popular technique is to put assets into trusts that allow the returns to accrue for heirs without taxation. Nike founder Phil Knight, for example, put his company’s stock in a series of trusts to benefit his children. The trusts pay him a modest return, but the rest of the gains avoid incurring estate tax, including Nike shares that were worth $6.1 billion in 2021, <a href="https://bloomberg.com/features/how-billionaires-pass-wealth-to-heirs-tax-free-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg reported</a>. Such scrutiny was possible only because Knight’s position as an executive and board member at a publicly traded company entailed SEC disclosures.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Behn’s clients typically want to maximize the money they leave for their children or establish a philanthropic legacy; some seek to do both. But there’s a third group. “They say, ‘I don’t care, we’ll pay taxes. Why is the federal government any worse than the charity down the street?’”</p><p>“It feels a little un-American,” Behn said. “Usually European clients have that kind of mentality.” He referenced a quote by Learned Hand, the esteemed jurist <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/69/809/1562063/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who wrote</a> that “there is not even a patriotic duty to increase one’s taxes” in a 1934 opinion.</p></div><p>Behn suspects our mystery estate originates from someone in that camp. There are other possible explanations, like dying without heirs, or without heirs you like enough to go to great lengths to preserve your dynastic wealth. Another could be family discord. A messy divorce could break apart carefully structured inheritance trusts, or cause a Rupert Murdoch-esque late-in-life reallocation between multiple heirs.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried to narrow down some suspects. Based on estimates of the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-estate-tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average tax rate</a> on estates, the February 2023 payment implied the death of someone possessing a fortune between $17.5 and $40 billion. At the upper range, it would make the person one of the 100 richest people in the world, at least on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg’s billionaire index</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And, typically, the estate tax has to be paid within nine months of death, though that can vary with extensions or audits. That suggests our billionaire strode off this mortal coil in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>We lost a few that year: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/business/herbert-kohler-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herb Kohler</a>, the plumbing magnate; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/realestate/robert-toll-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Toll</a>, the homebuilder; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/edward-c-johnson-iii-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edward Johnson III</a>, who built financial giant Fidelity.

Could a dispute with the IRS have dragged out that payment until 2023?&nbsp;</p><p>No one would say, and it seemed we’d never know.</p><hr><p>Last year, I published a <a href="https://qz.com/can-a-billionaire-die-without-anyone-noticing-1850268606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief story</a> about the statistical mystery and had nearly forgotten about it months later when I got a phone call from a number I didn’t recognize.&nbsp;</p><p>The voice on the other end of the line was calling about my mysterious billionaire. A financial-services professional, the source was familiar with the handling of a certain large and publicly undervalued estate that matched the timing of the enormous payment.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the person suggested that the late billionaire hadn’t sought to avoid the tax; they didn’t care about the bite being taken out of their fortune by the government, just as Behn suspected. The deceased was glad to pay up, this source said, because they came to the US as an immigrant and the country had provided them a huge opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>The voice struck me as familiar with the world of high-end services available to family offices of the superwealthy. The tale seemed like a strange story to make up. If the family in question wanted to bask in the glow of public gratitude, why not simply announce it?&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the phone number was a burner. But before they hung up, the source gave me a name for the nation’s late benefactor: Fayez Sarofim.&nbsp;</p><p>From afar, Sarofim fits the bill. A billionaire who existed largely beyond the eye of national news, he died in May 2022, and, most importantly to our purposes, made his fortune in opaque private-investment vehicles, not in publicly traded companies, over a six-decade career.&nbsp;</p><p>The son of an Egyptian landowner, Sarofim attended college in the US and moved to Houston in the 1950s. He soon hung out his shingle as an investment manager (reportedly with $100,000 from his father in hand) and gained a reputation for meticulous analysis, winning the business of Houston’s upper crust and managing the pensions of the companies they owned and universities they patronized.&nbsp;</p><p>Before they hung up, the source gave me a name for the nation’s late benefactor: Fayez Sarofim.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Sarofim’s clients called him the Sphinx. As <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/cant-buy-me-love/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Monthly</a> wrote in 2000: “He spends most of his days at his office on the twenty-ninth floor of Two Houston Center, dressed as always in a tailored three-piece suit, silently smoking a cigar, his owlish face contemplative, as if he might never speak again but gradually turn into a monument.”&nbsp; </p><p>As a businessman, he was sagacious. Famously, he wouldn’t buy Enron because he couldn’t make sense of the balance sheet. He made headway into Houston society, marrying Louisa Stude, the adopted daughter of the founder of Brown &amp; Root, the enormous oil-services company, and bought a mansion in the tony River Oaks neighborhood.</p></div><p>In 1979, though, love intervened. An affair resulted in a $250 million divorce, a new marriage, another expensive separation, and various other bits of soap-opera-worthy drama, culminating in his final marriage in 2015 to a son’s ex-wife’s mother.</p><p>But what about the money? Forbes, which <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2022/05/29/fayez-sarofim-the-egypt-born-texas-billionaire-made-a-fortune-betting-on-americas-blue-chip-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first interviewed</a> him in 1969, assessed his net worth in 2022 at $1.5 billion. He dropped off the Forbes 400 list in 2016. In 2000, Texas Monthly estimated his net worth at $2 billion to $3 billion and suggested his firm managed $45 billion. Upon his death, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/937729/000095012322005920/xslForm13F_X02/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC filings</a> pegged the firm’s assets under management at $31.6 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>With standard fee structures, Sarofim’s company might’ve been earning $100 million or more a year running that much money. He was also a minority owner of the NFL’s Houston Texans, which was purchased for $700 million in 1999 and valued at more than $5 billion last year. And he was <a href="https://www.mfah.org/exhibitions/three-centuries-american-art-masterpieces-sarofim-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an art collector</a> with an eye for appreciation, purchasing works by Picasso, Mary Cassatt, Winslow Homer, and Andy Warhol.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that Sarofim made use of trusts. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/237065248/202431359349106083/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tax filings</a> for his foundation reveal nearly $400 million in post-death contributions from several Sarofim vehicles, including a management trust and his estate. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/business/talking-money-with-donald-sultan-fayez-sarofim-portrait-artist-investor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1999 interview</a> with the New York Times, he even fretted about the effect of taxes on his investment strategies, which might be a point against the case that his estate is the source of our mystery tax payment. It’s safe to say that if he did expose some share of his fortune to the tax man, it was intentional.</p><p>Ultimately, my source said Sarofim’s net worth was north of $20 billion — and that was after the expensive divorces and high-end philanthropy, like<a href="https://www.attractionsmanagement.com/attractions-news/Museum-of-Fine-Arts,-Houston,-reveals-US$450m-masterplan/313428" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $70 million</a> for the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and<a href="https://www.uth.edu/sarofim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $25 million</a> to build a health center at the University of Texas.</p><p>How could public estimates of his wealth be so far off? A few factors seem relevant, including Sarofim’s wealthy father, who may have passed an inheritance of his own to his son with assets held abroad, beyond the easy reach of US authorities. Then there’s his job. Unlike billionaires like Phil Knight whose fortunes are made (and traced) through public companies, opacity is the nature of private-investment management. Some assets under management can be assessed through public filings, but fee structures and profit distribution are closely held.&nbsp;</p><p>How could public estimates of his wealth be so far off?</p><p>Perhaps most important is what we know about Sarofim’s investment strategy. Whether or not he was patriotic about his tax payments, his reputation as an investor was betting on iconic US corporations and holding the stock long-term. He told Forbes in 1969 that it took a foreigner to see the potential of the US in the years before its post-World War II ascent as the world’s economic superpower.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 64 years of investing, there would have been a lot of compounding value. A single $100 investment in the S&amp;P 500 in 1958, with dividends reinvested, would garner you more than $76,000 today, with inflation-adjusted returns of more than 7,000%. While managing a Dreyfus mutual fund between 1990 and 1999, for example, Sarofim averaged annual returns of just over 20%, Morningstar reported. Sitting on blue chip US stocks over a lifetime is the kind of thing that might just make you a secret billionaire.&nbsp;</p><p>Can I prove it? Try the oldest son, my source suggested; see if he’ll tell you.&nbsp;</p><p>He would not. Multiple emails and calls to Christopher Sarofim, who now leads his father’s firm, Fayez Sarofim &amp; Co., were not returned. Another son, Phillip, contacted through his venture-capital firm, Trousdale Ventures, declined to comment. I didn’t hear back from Sarofim’s widow, Susan, after contacting her through her New Orleans art gallery. And Sarofim’s longtime colleague, Raye White, didn’t respond to messages left with her office or the Sarofim Foundation.</p><p>Still, there is another data point to support the allegation. As with most data produced by the federal government, more granular versions emerge with time. This year, a state-level update revealed that the $7 billion payment had indeed come from Texas. There aren’t any records to indicate the death of a different Texan with a (publicly known) fortune of that magnitude in the relevant time period.&nbsp;</p><figure><div><p><img alt="CEO's And Corporate Executives Gather For Annual Allan And Co Gathering In Sun Valley" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><figcaption><p>Sarofim in 2011. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)</p></figcaption></figure><hr><p>The estate tax is a funny levy. These days, it hardly contributes to US coffers, and the earnings are a rounding error when compared to other taxes. But it plays an outsize role in the politics of taxation, with conservatives referring to the “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/death-tax-or-estate-tax-2017-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death tax</a>” and the (<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/the-myth-that-the-estate-tax-threatens-small-farms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsubstantiated</a>) plight of family farms while progressives bring up the disproportionate power of the superwealthy.</p><p>In the US, estates have been taxed in various ways since 1797. A nation founded with a suspicion of aristocrats always prioritized political moves trimming inherited wealth. The modern estate tax emerged alongside the income tax when 20th-century progressives pushed against the robber barons — and had to answer World War I’s demands on the federal budget.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, the estate tax hardly contributes to US coffers.</p><p>Despite growing formal and informal exemptions, today’s estate tax is the closest thing the country has to a wealth tax that someone like Sen. Bernie Sanders would like to enact. The situation seems unlikely to change when Trump’s 2017 package of tax cuts expires at the end of next year. Still, you can add “a once-in-a-decade chance to futz with tax policy” to the consequences of this year’s elections, should one party manage to win the presidency and control of Congress.&nbsp;</p><p>Absent confirmation from the Sarofims, there’s another potential source for that $7 billion payment. It’s the estate <i>and</i> gift tax, after all; the gift part is to keep people from avoiding the tax man by giving away their assets before they die.&nbsp;</p><p>Some tax attorneys I spoke with theorized that the $7 billion payment was in fact a gift tax paid as part of an estate-planning strategy designed to avoid an even larger payment down the road, a strategy they expect to be common ahead of the Trump tax expiration. (I note, without comment, that the richest person in the world, Elon Musk, moved to Texas in 2020.)</p><p>In other words, if the source isn’t the possibly patriotic Fayez, it means our secret billionaire is alive — and trying to minimize their taxes.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><i>Tim Fernholz is a journalist in Oakland, CA.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
				
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="323" src="https://blog-cdn.panic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/street-ends-1024x323.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog-cdn.panic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/street-ends-1024x323.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.panic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/street-ends-300x95.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.panic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/street-ends-768x242.jpg 768w, https://blog-cdn.panic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/street-ends-1536x485.jpg 1536w, https://blog-cdn.panic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/street-ends-2048x646.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>We never like removing functionality from our apps. We especially don’t like doing it when it’s due to circumstances beyond our control. But, sometimes — rarely? — it can happen, and so, please take note:</p>



<p><strong>At some unknown point in the future, Google will revoke Transmit’s access to Google Drive. Sometime after that, we’ll be releasing updates to Transmit and Nova that remove the ability to create Google Drive connections.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Transmit itself is of course still in active development, and no other connection types are affected.</strong></p>



<p>(Note that existing connections should continue to work for as long as they remain authenticated!)</p>



<h2>Why Though</h2>



<p>Well, Google has a new set of policies that require apps that connect to Google Drive to go through expensive, time-consuming annual reviews, and this has made it extremely difficult for us to reasonably maintain Google Drive access. You may have seen <a href="https://ia.net/topics/our-android-app-is-frozen-in-carbonite">iA Writer’s announcement</a> that they are stopping development of their Android version for similar reasons. Our experience was different, but our circumstances are similar. While Google Drive may not be the most popular connection option in Transmit, we know many users rely on it, and we often use it here at Panic to send and receive files from the game developers we work with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not a decision we took lightly, and was the result of much debate and anguish in the office. But rest assured we looked at every angle. Hopefully that explains everything.</p>



<h2>Actually, I Want to Know More</h2>



<p>Okay, okay, here’s a more background for the deeply curious. In 2019, Google <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/enhancing-security-controls-for-google-drive-third-party-apps">announced they were adding additional security checks</a> to apps with full access to users’ files on Drive. Shortly after, they prevented Transmit from authorizing new Drive users. We submitted Transmit to Google for review. And waited for months without hearing anything back.</p>



<p>Eventually, by reaching out through friends of friends of friends to find someone inside Google who could help, we got in contact with a Google employee who was very helpful in getting the process started. We went through review, and our access was restored in early 2020. Unfortunately, we were never able to get Google to approve Nova.</p>



<p>For the next couple years, the annual re-review was pretty straightforward. However, in December 2023, Google again disabled Transmit and emailed us, explaining that we would need to complete a “Cloud Application Security Assessment (CASA)” security review. The review found no security issues with Transmit, but it was an incredibly lengthy process. It involved registering with a security lab, running a vulnerability scanner on Transmit’s source code, and filling out a long form. Between each step, we had to wait for days before we’d hear back from the lab, causing the process to take nearly a month.</p>



<p>In March, Transmit was re-approved for Google Drive access — but we were told we would now need to pass this check annually. At this point, we began to question whether this yearly process was worth it.</p>



<p>Between the weeks of waiting, submitting the required documentation and the process of scanning the code, it took a significant amount of time from our engineers. For example, Google provided a Docker image for running the scanner, but it didn’t work. We had to spend more than a week debugging and fixing it. And because the scanner found no problems, it didn’t result in any improvements to Transmit. No one benefitted from this process. Not Google, not Panic, and not our users.</p>



<p>As a small, independent developer, losing this time for no benefit is a huge cost. That week could have been better spent improving our products. But even so, at the time, we resigned ourselves to the yearly checks. We didn’t want to let our users down, and hopefully, now that we had experience with it, the scanner would be easier to run next year.</p>



<p>But then… a couple of months later, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1b483a6/end_of_google_drive_integration/"><strong>Google completely removed the option for us to scan our own code</strong></a>. Instead, to keep access to Google Drive, <strong>we would now have to pay one of Google’s business partners to conduct the review.</strong> They promised a discounted minimum price, but no maximum price. We realized that either we’d most likely be paying someone else a chunk of cash to run the same scanner we were running, or our bill would end up much higher.</p>



<p>These ever-shifting requirements and expenses are finally catching up to third parties. Other products have discontinued Google Drive support or come up with <a href="https://www.ghisler.com/googledrivehelp.htm">interesting workarounds</a> with various limitations that don’t work for all users. Ultimately, we think any workaround strategy is too risky and may result in banned accounts, and we definitely don’t want to be responsible for anyone getting banned.</p>



<h2>We’re Very Sorry!</h2>



<p>In short, with all these factors in play, we have decided we will not attempt to renew Google Drive access for Transmit once it expires. We’ll miss it too. We will instead focus our efforts on other features and products. We know that this situation, to put it in simplified terms, kinda sucks. If Google ever revises their security policies to be more in reach for a small software company like Panic, we will definitely take a second look.</p>



<p>Thanks for using Transmit and thanks for supporting Panic for all of these years. Onward.</p>

<hr>
<p>DNA analysis company 23andme has been in trouble lately: data was breached in a <a href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/addressing-data-security-concerns" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>2023 hack</u></a>, and this September the <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/independent-directors-23andme-resign-board" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>entire board of directors resigned</u></a> over disagreements with the CEO. That CEO, Anne Wojcicki, had said she was open to third-party takeover proposals; she only reversed that decision <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/23andme-ceo-wojcicki-no-longer-open-third-party-takeover-proposals-filing-shows-2024-09-30/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>this week</u></a>. The company is not currently for sale, but nothing about this is looking good—and it’s not clear what would happen to customer data if the company goes under.</p><h2 id="is-23andme-data-being-sold">Is 23andme data being sold?&nbsp;</h2><p>So far there is no definitive word about the company being sold, with or without its data. However, it’s reasonable to expect that the company <em>could</em> be sold, and that owner <em>could</em> inherit the data. Something similar happened when <a href="https://lifehacker.com/if-you-ever-used-promethease-your-dna-data-might-be-on-1841327595" target="_blank"><u>MyHeritage bought Promethease</u></a>, another DNA analysis company, in 2020.</p><p>Currently, your data may already be shared with other companies. If you signed up to participate in <a href="https://www.23andme.com/research/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>research studies through 23andme</u></a>, “de-identified” data about you (including genetic data) has likely been given to research institutions and pharma companies. For example, 23andme <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-announces-collaboration-extension-new-data-licensing" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>has a data licensing agreement with GSK</u></a> (formerly GlaxoSmithKline) to use the 23andme database to “conduct drug target discovery and other research.”&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t a possible future scenario, but rather the current operation of the business. Licensing agreements like these are a big part of how 23andme makes money. Or intends to make money. Or possibly once made money. They’re not doing so great at the money making thing these days.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-happens-when-you-delete-your-23andme-data">What happens when you delete your 23andme data?&nbsp;</h2><p>Deleting your 23andme data doesn’t necessarily withdraw it from studies, especially since the data was “de-identified,” that is, stripped from your name and personal information.

It says:</p><p><em>If you participated in 23andMe Research, your Personal Information will no longer be used in any future research projects.

(You can also opt out of research studies there.). Click <strong>View</strong> on the 23andme Data card.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll be asked to enter your date of birth to confirm your identity. In theory this is where you can download your data, but I can’t test this—I have a 23andme account, but I must have given the company a fake date of birth all those years ago. The website just tells me to contact <a href="https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050651194-Contact-23andMe-Customer-Care" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>Customer Care</u></a>.</p><p>That sounds like a pretty bullshit obstacle to me, but here we are. A redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/1fvdqn9/want_to_download_raw_data_but_havent_used_my_real/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"><u>says</u></a> that Customer Care asked them to send a copy of their ID, which isn’t very useful if you used a fake date of birth. Still, the company’s documentation claims that you can download your data and delete your account if you can get past that screen. Good luck.</p><div x-data="{ showAll: false }">

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nVRzCstyspQ"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/nVRzCstyspQ/0.jpg" alt="MegaRick Game"></a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/nVRzCstyspQ">https://youtu.be/nVRzCstyspQ</a></p>
<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>After a while, I decided to resume work on <a href="https://github.com/carimbolabs/carimbo">my game engine</a>.</p>
<p>I made a game for my son. I could have used an existing engine, but I chose to write everything from scratch because code is like pasta—it’s much better and more enjoyable when homemade.</p>
<p>This actually reminds me of when my father used to build my toys, from kites to wooden slides. Good memories. I have decided to do the same using what I know: programming.</p>
<p>You can watch it here or <a href="https://play.carimbo.cloud/1.0.10/carimbolabs/megarick/1.0.7/720p">play it here</a>, (runs in the browser thanks to WebAssembly), use <code>A</code> and <code>D</code> for moving around and <code>space</code> to shoot.</p>
<p>The engine was written in C++17, and the games are in Lua. The engine exposes some primitives to the Lua VM, which in turn coordinates the entire game.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/carimbolabs/megarick">Game source code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/carimbolabs/carimbo">engine source code</a>.</p>
<h3 id="going-deep">Going Deep</h3>
<p>The entire game is scripted in Lua.</p>
<p>First, we create the engine itself.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>engine</span> <span>=</span> <span>EngineFactory</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
    <span>:</span><span>set_title</span><span>(</span><span>"Mega Rick"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span><span>set_width</span><span>(</span><span>1920</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span><span>set_height</span><span>(</span><span>1080</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span><span>set_fullscreen</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
    <span>:</span><span>create</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then we point to some resources for asset prefetching; they are loaded lazily to avoid impacting the game loop.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>prefetch</span><span>({</span>
  <span>"blobs/bomb1.ogg"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/bomb2.ogg"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/bullet.png"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/candle.png"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/explosion.png"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/octopus.png"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/player.png"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/princess.png"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"blobs/ship.png"</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We created the postal service, which is something I borrowed from languages like Erlang, where an entity can send messages to any other. As we’ll see below, the bullet sends a hit message when it collides with the octopus, and the octopus, upon receiving the hit, decrements its own health.</p>
<p>We also obtain the SoundManager to play sounds and spawn the main entities.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>postal</span> <span>=</span> <span>PostalService</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>()</span>
<span>local</span> <span>soundmanager</span> <span>=</span> <span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>soundmanager</span><span>()</span>
<span>local</span> <span>octopus</span> <span>=</span> <span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>"octopus"</span><span>)</span>
<span>local</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>"player"</span><span>)</span>
<span>local</span> <span>princess</span> <span>=</span> <span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>"princess"</span><span>)</span>
<span>local</span> <span>candle1</span> <span>=</span> <span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>"candle"</span><span>)</span>
<span>local</span> <span>candle2</span> <span>=</span> <span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>"candle"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It’s not a triple-A title, but I’m very careful with resource management. A widely known technique is to create an object pool that you can reuse. In the code below, we limit it to a maximum of 3 bullets present on the screen.</p>
<p>The on_update method is a callback called each loop in the engine. In the case of the bullet, I check if it has approached the green octopus. If so, I send a message to it indicating that it received a hit.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>bullet</span> <span>=</span> <span>engine</span><span>:</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>"bullet"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>bullet</span><span>:</span><span>set_placement</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>128</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>128</span><span>)</span>
  <span>bullet</span><span>:</span><span>on_update</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>

      <span>postal</span><span>:</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>Mail</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>"bullet"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hit"</span><span>))</span> <span>-- id 0 is the octopus</span>
      <span>bullet</span><span>:</span><span>unset_action</span><span>()</span>

  <span>end</span><span>)</span>
  <span>table.insert</span><span>(</span><span>bullet_pool</span><span>,</span> <span>bullet</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>On the octopus’s side, when it receives a “hit” message, the entity triggers an explosion animation, switches to attack mode, and decreases its health by 1. If it reaches 0, it changes the animation to “dead”.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>octopus</span><span>:</span><span>set_action</span><span>(</span><span>"idle"</span><span>)</span>
<span>octopus</span><span>:</span><span>set_placement</span><span>(</span><span>1200</span><span>,</span> <span>620</span><span>)</span>
<span>octopus</span><span>:</span><span>on_mail</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>message</span> <span>==</span> <span>'hit'</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>bomb</span><span>()</span>
    <span>octopus</span><span>:</span><span>set_action</span><span>(</span><span>"attack"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>life</span> <span>=</span> <span>life</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And finally, the player’s <code>on_update</code>, where I apply the velocity if any movement keys are pressed, or set the animation to idle if none are pressed.</p>
<p>We also have the projectile firing, where the fire function is called, taking an instance of a bullet from the pool, placing it in a semi-random position, and applying velocity.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>fire</span><span>()</span>

            <pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 12:59:52 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.eriksen.com.br/en/introducing-kotlin-money">https://blog.eriksen.com.br/en/introducing-kotlin-money</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41776878">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Manipulating monetary amounts is a common computing chore. However, no mainstream language has a first-class data type for representing money, it’s up to programmers to code abstractions for it. This isn’t an issue per se until dealing with rounding issues from operations like installment payments (e.g., buy now, pay later), foreign exchange, or even simple things like fee processing and tax collection.</p>

<p>Inspired by my days at <a href="https://blog.eriksen.com.br/en/platform-engineering-n26">N26</a> dealing with these challenges, I introduce <a href="https://github.com/eriksencosta/money/">Money</a>: a Kotlin library that makes monetary calculations and allocations easy:</p>

<pre><code>val price = 100 money "USD"                     // USD 100.00
val shipping = 5 money "USD"                    // USD 5.00
val subtotal = price + shipping                 // USD 105.00
val discount = 10.percent()                     // 10%
val total = subtotal decreaseBy discount        // USD 94.50

val ratios = listOf(60.percent(), 40.percent()) // [60%, 40%]

total allocate 2                                // [USD 47.25, USD 47.25]
total allocate ratios                           // [USD 56.70, USD 37.80]
</code></pre>

<p>The library supports mathematical operations with monetary amounts, calculations with percentages, and allocation, making it simple to model use cases like those mentioned. Cryptocurrencies are also fully supported out of the box:</p>

<pre><code>val price = 0.01607580 money "BTC"           // BTC 0.01607580
val transactionFee = 1.25.percent()          // 1.25%
val total = price increaseBy transactionFee  // BTC 0.01627675
val installments = total allocate 3          // [BTC 0.00542559, BTC 0.00542558, BTC 0.00542558]

val rate = 62_555.60 money "USD"             // USD 62555.60
val totalInUsd = total exchange rate         // USD 1005.63
</code></pre>

<h2 id="allocation">Allocation</h2>

<p>One of the nicest features of the library is its allocation capability. Allocation allows the distribution of a monetary amount into parts while guaranteeing that the sum of the parts equals the original value. For example, a retailer may accept purchases by credit card installments or by buy now, pay later (BNPL). What happens when a customer makes a purchase totaling USD 100.00 to be paid in three installments?</p>

<pre><code>val price = 100 money "USD"
val number = 3
val installment = price / number
val installments = List(number) { installment } // [USD 33.33, USD 33.33, USD 33.33]
val total = installments.sum()                  // USD 99.99

<p>As you noticed, there is a loss of USD 0.01. A penny here and there may seem a slight loss, but it may be <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/round-floor-software-errors-stock-market-battlefield.html">costly over time</a>. But there are other complications as well, such as overcharging a customer (which can be an infringement of consumer rights in several countries) due to rounding issues. The library provides a handy <code>allocate()</code> method that guarantees the result won’t differ from the original amount:</p>

<pre><code>val price = 100 money "USD"
val installments = price allocate 3          // [USD 33.34, USD 33.33, USD 33.33]
val total = installments.allocations().sum() // USD 100.00
</code></pre>

<p>To allocate in proportional parts, pass a list of <code>Percentage</code> values to the method:</p>

<pre><code>val amount = 2345.89 money "USD"
val result = dueAmount allocate listOf(50.percent(), 30.percent(), 20.percent())
val allocations = result.allocations() // [USD 1172.94, USD 703.77, USD 469.18]
val total = allocations.sum()          // USD 2345.89
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the previous examples, both results totaled up to the original monetary amount. No cent was lost or gained. By default, the library automatically allocates the difference. But you can tweak how the difference is allocated in the allocations list. For example, suppose your company requires the difference to be always allocated to the last item. You can do it by creating the allocator object directly with the desired allocation strategy:</p>

<pre><code>val price = 100 money "USD"
val allocator = EvenAllocator(OnLast)
val installments = allocator.allocate(price, 3) // [USD 33.33, USD 33.33, USD 33.34]
val total = installments.allocations().sum()    // USD 100.00
</code></pre>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>This post is just a glimpse of the library’s capabilities. I intend to keep the library’s API concise and to expand its capabilities gradually, including supporting Android development and out of the box persistence and serialization. Nevertheless, I hope it’s useful in its current version for people manipulating monetary amounts in Kotlin projects.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/eriksencosta/money/tree/trunk/docs/usage">usage guide</a> on how to work with Money. The library has built-in support for <a href="https://github.com/eriksencosta/money/blob/trunk/docs/appendixes/circulating-currencies.md">306 circulating currencies</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eriksencosta/money/blob/trunk/docs/appendixes/cryptocurrencies.md">2283 cryptocurrencies</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/eriksencosta/money/#installation">installation procedures</a> are explained in the project’s README. Give it a shot!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>On October 1st, 47,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), primarily dockworkers on East and Gulf Coast ports, went on strike after failing to agree contract terms with </span><a href="https://www.usmx.com/" rel="">USMX</a><span>, an alliance of port operators and employers. (West Coast ports, which are worked by a different union, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, remained open.) Along with higher pay, the main point of disagreement was automation; the ILA demanded a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_port_strike" rel="">complete ban</a><span> on introducing new port automation. The strike ended on October 3rd with a tentative agreement on wage increases, but </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/dockworkers-strike-suspended-sources/story?id=114445386" rel="">negotiations over automation</a><span> will continue until January 15th.</span></p><p><span>The strike sparked a discussion about the quality of U.S. ports, and the degree they need to be automated to improve their performance. Most folks have (reasonably) assumed that the union is holding back port automation that would improve productivity. In the 1960s, dockworkers unions vehemently protested against introducing the productivity-enhancing shipping container, and current ILA president Harold Daggett has complained about </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/business/union-boss-harold-daggett-rages-against-e-zpass-for-costing-union-jobs-in-video-weeks-before-strike-shut-down-ports/" rel="">EZ passes for highway tolls</a><span> eliminating union jobs. The ILA’s case has not been helped by the extremely high wages of longshoremen (and of Daggett), the </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAj5A3-SfYn/" rel="">video of Daggett</a><span> threatening to “cripple” the entire economy, or the fact that Daggett is alleged to have </span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/01/harold-daggett-union-leader-fought-allegations-mob-ties/" rel="">connections to organized crime</a><span>.</span></p><p>But despite Daggett and the ILA doing everything in their power to turn people against their cause, the case for port automation isn’t straightforward. It is true that U.S. ports perform poorly compared to ports around the world, but it’s hard to blame this entirely on a lack of automation. Few ports around the world are automated, and the most heavily automated ports (including in the U.S.) don’t necessarily perform the best. Lack of automation may be partly behind poor American port performance, but there are many other factors as well.</p><p><span>Since 2020, the World Bank has released a </span><a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/87d77e6d-6b7b-4bbe-b292-ae0f3b4827e8" rel="">Container Port Performance Index</a><span>, which ranks ports around the world based on how long vessels stay in port. Since a ship waiting in port isn’t making money by transporting cargo, shipowners want them in and out of ports as quickly as possible. Major American ports routinely rank near the bottom of this list. Los Angeles, the largest port in the U.S. by container volume, ranked #375 in 2023, and Long Beach (the second-largest) ranked #373. Savannah ranked #395, and Seattle ranked #360. Of the five largest American container ports, only New York-New Jersey cracked the top 100 (at #92). On average, per this index the U.S. has the worst-performing ports of any country in the world.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png" width="590" height="287" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:287,&quot;width&quot;:590,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ecd19f8-4dfa-437b-82b0-8f25f0fc699b_590x287.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via UNCTAD.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Other measures of port performance show the same thing.

Traditionally these cranes were operated from cabs attached to the crane itself, though some ports are installing systems that allow for remote operation.</span></p><p><span>Unloaded containers will typically be moved to a storage yard, using a range of types of vehicles. Some, like regular trucks, move horizontally, while others, like </span><a href="https://www.konecranes.com/en-us/port-equipment-services/container-handling-equipment/straddle-carriers" rel="">straddle carriers</a><span>, can both move it horizontally and lift the container to stack it.

Both types of cranes can also be automated.</span></p><p>From the yard, containers are moved out of the port onto land via trucks or rail. Containers must be checked at the port gate, and parts of these gate-checking operations can also be automated using things like radiofrequency ID (RFID) and optical character recognition (OCR) systems to automatically track and update container movements.</p><p>When a container port is referred to as “automated,” it typically means it has adopted container-moving technologies like automated guided vehicles and straddle carriers, automated gantry cranes, and remotely operated ship-to-shore cranes. Lashing is still mostly done manually even in automated ports, and even “un-automated” ports (including most large ports in the U.S.) have adopted gate automation systems.</p><p><span>Does automating container handling improve port productivity? It’s not clear that it does, or that the lack of it is why U.S. ports perform so poorly. For one thing, few ports around the world have adopted this sort of automation. As of 2021 there were around 63 automated or semi-automated container terminals in the world out of more than 1,300 container terminals total, accounting for only about 4% of global container capacity.

Rotterdam was one of the first ports to automate (its first automated terminal opened in 1993), and today it’s one of the most heavily automated ports in the world, but its port performance ranking is just #91, one point above the comparatively less automated New York, and far below the un-automated ports of Charleston and Philadelphia (#53 and #55 respectively). Likewise, the U.S.’s most automated port, Los Angeles, comes in very close to the bottom of the worldwide rankings, while the top two ports on the list (Yangshan in China and Salalah in Oman) have just one and zero automated terminals, respectively.</p><p><span>Other analyses likewise point to a complex relationship between automation and efficient port operations.

A </span><a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/container-port-automation-impacts-and-implications" rel="">2021 OECD report</a><span> similarly found that “automated ports are generally not more productive than their conventional counterparts,” and a </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106498" rel="">2024 GAO report</a><span> also noted that both U.S. and international ports found “mixed effects” on performance when adopting automation. APM Terminals, a global container terminal operator, stated in 2021 that its fully automated terminal in Rotterdam (Maasvlakte 2) had lower performance than its older, non-automated terminal (Maasvlakte 1). A </span><a href="https://www.porteconomics.eu/container-terminal-automation-a-global-analysis-on-decision-making-drivers-benefits-realized-and-stakeholder-support/" rel="">2021 survey</a><span> of automated port operators found that while port operators did generally receive benefits they expected from automation, they were somewhat prone to overestimating the reduction in container handling costs (though they also underestimated the benefits to things like truck turn time).</span></p><p><span>Why is port automation not a more obvious win? A variety of factors are at work. For one, automated container handling equipment is not always as capable as manual handling. The GAO survey of automated port operators found that while automated equipment had benefits like being able to stack containers closer and sometimes needing fewer container moves, it was sometimes slower and less capable than conventional equipment, even after several years of operation. Automated cranes might make fewer crane moves per hour due to inability to operate in adverse weather conditions, like rain or fog, that a human could handle. When the Port of Auckland tried to adopt automated handling equipment, automated straddle carriers were found to operate at just one third the speed of manual ones, and often behaved unsafely and unpredictably. Auckland ultimately abandoned its automation project after spending $400 million (and losing hundreds of millions more due to shipping delays), and is now </span><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/350189426/auckland-port-revives-machines-failed-automation-project" rel="">converting</a><span> its automated straddles to manual. The performance of remotely operated cranes has sometimes been disappointing for similar reasons. </span></p><p><span>Automated equipment is less flexible than a human operator, and it can’t respond to unusual or unexpected situations that a human could handle; AGVs, for instance, often follow fixed paths guided by </span><a href="https://www.goetting-agv.com/dateien/downloads/ptn_article.pdf" rel="">transponders</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NULoelb7PzA" rel="">embedded</a><span> in the concrete. And automation does best with a steady, predictable volume of containers. But as container ships have gotten larger, container volumes have often gotten </span><em>less</em><span> steady, with more peaks and troughs. Highly varying volumes might be more easily handled by a human labor force that can be scaled up and down as needed.</span></p><p>Relatedly, it’s typically easier to install automated equipment in a new, greenfield container terminal than to retrofit an existing terminal. Union work rules that limit labor flexibility might also make it hard to take maximum advantage of automated equipment. These last two factors are likely part of the reason why Chinese ports tend to see greater advantage from automation than U.S. ports.</p><p><span>Container unloading and transport is a long sequence of operations, of which only some can be addressed by automation. If your operations aren’t carefully synced, or they’re bottlenecked by some other factor unrelated to automation (such as the availability of truck chassis), then automation can’t do much to help. Conversely, carefully synchronizing operations to minimize waiting and waste doesn’t require automation to achieve. In 2013, the best-performing container terminal in the world was a non-automated APM terminal in the Japanese port of Yokohama. It achieved this via good old fashioned </span><a href="https://mag.toyota.co.uk/kaizen-toyota-production-system/" rel="">continuous improvement</a><span> methods to cut out as much waiting as possible.</span></p><p>Automated equipment reduces unit costs of container handling, but this reduction can be offset by the high upfront costs needed to install the equipment. A survey of automated port operators found that payback periods were most often 6 years or more, and some U.S. operators expected payback periods of 10 to 20 years. This makes automation risky if the expected future container volumes don’t materialize, and automation tends to be easiest to justify in very large ports with large container volumes.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png" width="1456" height="871" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:871,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde98017a-853a-4171-8dd3-8168f05e1153_1464x876.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via GAO.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Large volumes might also be needed for the productivity benefits of automation to materialize. APM Terminals stated in 2021 that its Maasvlakte 2 Terminal was too small to fully achieve the benefits from automation:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The high degree of automation only comes into its own when large volumes can be rotated, and these are insufficient at this time. Sometimes, processes are still carried out manually, which should actually be automated. If the terminal is expanded, with the same staffing, more volume is processed, and productivity goes to the intended level.”</em></p></blockquote><p>In addition to the factors of scale, greenfield vs. brownfield sites, and work rules that make it harder for U.S. ports to take maximum advantage of automation (and to generally operate efficiently), there are other factors that drag down American port performance.</p><p><span>One factor is the type of work ports are doing. Most U.S. ports are “</span><a href="https://porteconomicsmanagement.org/pemp/contents/part1/ports-and-container-shipping/levels-transshipment-incidence/" rel="">gateway</a><span>” ports, where imports enter the country and exports leave via land-based travel like rail and trucks. By contrast, some ports that act as hubs for global trade do much more </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transshipment" rel="">transhipment</a><span>, where containers arrive on one ship and depart on another. Singapore, for instance, has one of the largest ports in the world, but very little of the cargo is Singaporean imports and exports.</span></p><p><span>Transhipment cargo tends to take less time to move, and ports that have a large fraction of transhipment will naturally have higher performance as measured by vessel waiting time. On the Container Port Performance Index, many of the top-performing ports, like </span><a href="https://asyad.om/ports/salalah-port" rel="">Salalah</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/ports-logistics/cartagena-is-the-largest-transhipment-hub-in-the-caribbean" rel="">Cartagena</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-expands-tangiers-med-terminal-as-port-s-transshipment-role-grows" rel="">Tanger-Med</a><span>, are primarily transhipment ports. (Of course, the Jones Act makes it hard for the U.S. to take advantage of transhipment for domestic cargoes.) High transhipment fractions may also make it easier to adopt automated equipment, though experts seem to disagree about this.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-149929827" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/do-us-ports-need-more-automation#footnote-1-149929827" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p>Another major performance factor is hours of operation. Top-performing ports tend to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whereas U.S. ports don’t operate around the clock.</p><p><span>The limited hours of operation relate to another potential issue, that of lack of coordination. As we noted, effective container handling requires all operations to be coordinated and synchronized, and there’s some evidence that American ports don’t coordinate their operations especially well. In Los Angeles and Long Beach, for instance, individual terminals have separate rail systems for moving cargo, and the systems don’t work together. Lack of coordination between truckers, shipyards, and companies that move containers also seems to be behind the failure of a </span><a href="https://ambrook.com/research/supply-chain/ag-exports-bottlenecked-at-oakland-port-despite-usda-efforts" rel="">program</a><span> designed to help farmers ship out crops through the Port of Oakland. Historically, U.S. ports have </span><a href="https://www.joc.com/article/us-ports-move-toward-truck-appointment-model-5238478" rel="">lacked appointment systems</a><span> for trucks to arrive and pick up cargo; instead trucks would simply arrive randomly, often creating large amounts of congestion as they waited to load and unload. And while U.S. ports seem to be adopting truck appointment systems, they don’t yet appear to be universal or completely coordinated (as of last year the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach had </span><a href="https://www.truckingdive.com/news/california-harbor-trucking-association-port-of-long-beach-port-of-los-angeles-appointments-system/641644/" rel="">several different appointment systems</a><span> in place). During the post-pandemic cargo congestion at major ports, things like </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-ports-supply-chain-fix-challenge-selling-247-shifts-2021-10-14/" rel="">lack of available warehouse space</a><span> made temporary 24/7 port operations less than successful. There are often shortages of </span><a href="https://www.foodlogistics.com/transportation/3pl-4pl/news/12090302/ports-and-truckers-face-chassis-shortage" rel="">truck chassis</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.kanarysolutions.com/resources/what-is-causing-port-congestion" rel="">truck drivers</a><span> needed to move containers out of ports, and </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11800" rel="">customs processes are often slow</a><span> and not coordinated.</span></p><p><span>Another possible issue is infrastructure investment not keeping up with port container volumes, an issue highlighted in a 2015 Federal Maritime Commission Study. One example of this is </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/trade/commentary/113-year-old-law-hurting-american-ports" rel="">insufficient dredging</a><span> to handle larger container ships (a problem made worse by the Foreign Dredge Act, which prevents the use of foreign-built dredges). Most American ports </span><a href="https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter6/port-terminals/channel-depth-ports-north-america/" rel="">can’t handle</a><span> the very largest container ships. In 2021 a </span><a href="https://enotrans.org/article/port-of-long-beach-highlights-dredging-project-in-tis-wrda-hearing/" rel="">24,000-TEU container ship</a><span> needed to unload its cargo to a smaller ship at the Port of Long Beach, which then transferred its cargo ashore, a time-consuming operation required because the Bay was not deep enough to allow the larger ship to access the port.</span></p><p>Automation, at best, seems like a partial explanation of American port productivity problems. The U.S. is not necessarily all that far behind in automated equipment adoption, and it’s not as clear a win as some people seem to think. Plenty of automated ports (including American ones!) don’t operate particularly efficiently, and plenty of non-automated ports do.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that the union is correct to ban all automation going forward. Right now, automation is the worst that it will ever be. It will only get better and more capable, and banning it will hamstring port efficiencies in the future even if it doesn’t necessarily do it now. It’s hard to imagine how much poorer the U.S. (and the world) would be if unions had successfully fought off the introduction of the shipping container in the 1960s. We shouldn’t stop the introduction of new, productivity-enhancing technology, but we should also be realistic about what benefits it will actually be expected to yield.</p><p><em><strong><span>If you’re interested in learning more about port automation, a recommended reading list of the best and most useful sources I found is </span><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/constructionphysics/p/port-automation-reading-list?r=23el8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web" rel="">available here</a><span> for paid subscribers.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.chicagomag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kulle-book.jpg"></p><p>Adapted from <em>Our Nazi: An American Suburb’s Encounter With Evil</em> by Michael Soffer, with permission from the University of Chicago Press. © 2024 by the University of Chicago. All rights reserved.</p></div>



<p>Jack Swanson walked into his second-floor office at Oak Park and River Forest High School. It was December 4, 1982, and this three-room suite next to the boardroom had been his for the last eight years, after he had beaten out 60 other administrators vying to run the storied west suburban school. The normally bustling building was quiet, the 3,400 students enjoying the unseasonably warm Saturday at home.</p>



<p>Swanson exuded calm and professionalism. Deeply religious, he was in some ways a throwback to Oak Park’s more genteel past, when the village was informally known as Saints’ Rest. When he first took the reins at the school, Swanson had streamlined its administrative structure, and had told the local papers that he wanted to ensure that Oak Park was a “viable community” for people from diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Oak Parkers had always felt there was something special about their town. It had raised Ernest Hemingway and was home to a dozen of Frank Lloyd Wright’s iconic Prairie-style structures. Oak Parkers’ pride was reflected even in the high school’s motto: “Those Things That Are Best.” The village no longer resembled the conservative community that Hemingway once quipped had “wide lawns and narrow minds.” Oak Park had become a national model for integration, recognized by the National Civic League as an All-America City at the end of Swanson’s first year.</p>



<p>Trim and dignified, the 54-year-old superintendent readied for a quiet morning of paperwork. Outside his window, large Victorian homes sat across sleepy Scoville Avenue. Swanson settled into his chair and opened the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>.</p>



<p>A headline on the bottom right-hand corner of page 7 caught his eye: “Deportation Bid on Suburb Man.”</p>



<p>He scanned the article, and a wave of shock rushed over him. It had to be a misprint, some kind of misunderstanding. Maybe it was a different man with the same name? No, the <em>Sun-Times</em> left no room for doubt.</p>



<p>Swanson fumbled for his phone and dialed school board president Paul Gignilliat, unsure of what exactly he would say.</p>



<p>Gignilliat was relaxing at his home two blocks away when his phone pierced the morning quiet.</p>



<p>“Have you noticed?” Swanson bellowed. The next few seconds were a blur, the words almost impossible to believe. But Swanson wanted Gignilliat to hear the news from him directly: Reinhold Kulle, the high school’s chief custodian, had been a Nazi.</p>





<p><span>I</span>t was 1957, and the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, was abuzz with activity. Katherine Geoghegan, one of the consulate’s veteran officers, ushered a new visa applicant and his family into her office. A physician had just examined them, drawing their blood and listening to their hearts.</p>



<p>This interview was the final step in the monthslong process. It was exciting and nerve-racking for the applicants, but routine by now for Geoghegan. She placed the applicants under oath and offered them a seat.</p>



<p>Geoghegan looked at the soon-to-be-American family in front of her. Reinhold and Gertrud Kulle made a handsome couple. He had kind eyes and a warm smile and answered her questions patiently. Their daughter, Ulricke, was 12; their 8-year-old son, Rainer, was the spitting image of his father.</p>



<p>Kulle had first contacted the consulate a few months earlier. It had sent him a detailed preliminary questionnaire to fill out, along with an information sheet, translated into German, that explained the application process and listed the classes of individuals who were ineligible for American visas.</p>



<p>Geoghegan looked over the paperwork and asked the family a series of questions through an interpreter.</p>



<p>Kulle had served in the German army, which was not surprising; nearly every German man had been conscripted by the end of the war. But on the preliminary questionnaire, he indicated that he had not been in any organizations that would have barred him from entry, and no derogatory information had come back from the consulate’s background check. He had a job waiting for him with a rivet company in Chicago, and a place to stay, with one of his wife’s relatives.</p>



<p>It was hard to imagine a better candidate. Geoghegan had just a few last questions that her bosses stressed she and other officials ask each candidate.</p>



<p>“Are you a member of the Communist Party?”</p>



<p>“Were you a member of the Nazi Party?”</p>



<p>“Were you a member of the Waffen-SS?”</p>



<p>Reinhold Kulle’s warm smile covered the dark secret he had closely guarded for over a decade. He had kept it in Krempe, the northern German town where the Kulles had fled after the war, and in Lahr, where they had moved after Rainer’s birth, and on the forms Reinhold had sent to the U.S. Consulate.</p>



<p>If Geoghegan somehow found out that he had been in the SS, a member of its elite Totenkopf (Death’s Head) division, and had served as a guard at Gross-Rosen, a forced-labor concentration camp in Silesia, now part of Poland, everything would be over.</p>



<p>But she didn’t.</p>



<p>Geoghegan signed visa application No. 6037. Reinhold Kulle was officially welcome in America.</p>





<p><span>W</span>ith its patchwork of ethnic neighborhoods, Chicago became one of the most common landing spots for former Nazis in the years after the war. Liudas Kairys, a guard at the Treblinka killing center in occupied Poland, was among the throngs of Lithuanian immigrants who settled on the Southwest Side. He arrived in 1949, claiming to be a displaced person, and took a job packaging candied popcorn at the Cracker Jack plant near Midway Airport. A few miles south, Hans Lipschis was often up early to work on his house. A Lithuanian member of the SS at Auschwitz, Lipschis came to Chicago in 1956 and found work at a factory making guitars. A year later, Conrad Schellong, a former concentration camp guard, moved to Lake View with his wife and three kids, living in several apartments within a few blocks of Wrigley Field. He worked as a welder and as a janitor for the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. There were others, too — Michael Schmidt in suburban Lincolnwood, Joseph Grabauskas on the Southwest Side, Bronislaw Hajda in Schiller Park, and Juozas Naujalis in Cicero — so many that investigators would later joke that America’s Nazi-hunting organizations could have moved to Chicago and ignored the rest of the country.</p>

<p>The Kulles first stayed in suburban Forest Park, with Gertrud’s relative. Much of the land that became Forest Park had been purchased shortly before the Civil War by Ferdinand Haase, a German immigrant, and the village’s first major businesses were the German Waldheim Cemetery, the Deutsche Altenheim (German Old People’s Home), and Karl Lau’s sausage factory. Though it was becoming more ethnically diverse when the Kulles arrived, Forest Park still retained a large German cohort.</p>



<p>In 1959 there was an opening on the custodial staff at Oak Park and River Forest High School, and Kulle applied. He was quickly hired. Before he could officially start, he had to fill out paperwork. He did so in English, though he was still learning the language. In block letters, all capitalized, he wrote that he enjoyed gardening. During his physical, the medical examiner noted an “operational scar” on Kulle’s abdomen and “two wound scars” on his skin. Among the other papers in his personnel file was his marriage certificate, listing him as “SS-Unterscharführer Reinhold Kulle” and the registry office as “Groß-Rosen II.” Stamped on the bottom of the page, the Reichsadler eagle looked off into the distance, a swastika below its perch. If anyone at the high school was concerned, they kept it to themselves.</p>



<p>Kulle soon proved hard-working and indispensable. OPRF’s leadership took notice, and when the head night custodian fell ill in 1963, administrators asked Kulle to fill in. His English was still a work in progress, but he handled the added responsibilities well. When the ailing head custodian retired a few months later, Kulle was officially appointed his replacement.</p>



<p>Kulle’s steady work meant that his family could afford to move into a house of their own. Their first was a few blocks north of the Eisenhower Expressway on Harlem Avenue, the line separating Forest Park from Oak Park. It was just around the corner from Otto’s Restaurant, to which the Kulles could walk for schnitzel, Thuringer, calf’s liver, sauerbraten, and herring, and the kids could enjoy strudel or German chocolate cake for dessert.</p>



<p>Like Kairys, Lipschis, and Schellong, Kulle lived simply and quietly. He paid his bills, doted on Ulricke, and cheered for Rainer at wrestling matches. He avoided politics and stayed out of trouble. In his spare time, he gardened. He slipped into obscurity, just another blue-collar worker in Middle America with a thick accent and an untold past.</p>





<p><span>A</span>fter a dozen years at OPRF, Kulle had become every faculty member’s go-to. He knew where everything was, an impressive feat in a four-story behemoth of a building occupying an entire city block. Science teachers could count on him to escort students down to the school’s drafty basement to grab beakers, acids, and other materials for experiments. One day, he saw a colleague frantically setting up a college fair. When the man anxiously explained that he was running behind, Kulle immediately reassigned his crew to take over the setup.</p>



<p>His staff was among the best in the building, and the school was renowned for its cleanliness. Kulle rarely missed a day of work. He worked through injuries, like the time his hand had slipped through a glass window when he was cleaning it, or the time a few months later when he had stepped on a wooden board and nails had punctured his shoe, lacerating his foot.</p>



<p>Even as a supervisor, overseeing 30 custodians, Kulle continued washing hallway floors with the power scrubber and cleaning the library carpet on his hands and knees. A staff member once complained that Kulle’s hard work diminished opportunities for overtime, but Kulle took pride in keeping the building immaculate, and the faculty, administration, and staff respected him for it.</p>



<p>“At night,” a local newspaper explained, “he’s boss at [the] high school.” Tucked in the back pages of the Oak Leaves, the simple profile of the OPRF janitor described him warmly as a “refugee from East Germany” who kept the floors clean, the kids in line, and the school running on time. “There’s something in Reinhold Kulle’s voice that tells you he means it,” it began. The article was accompanied by a posed picture of Kulle: shoulders slightly hunched, a faint smile, and a short-sleeved work shirt tucked into his dark pants. His name was stitched in cursive above the pen in one breast pocket, and he had a small notebook in his other. Though he had gained a few pounds, he was still fit: his shoulders broad, his body solid. The huge ring of keys he typically carried for access to every room in the building was just out of sight.</p>



<p>At high school dances, explained Kulle in the article, he walked around to make sure students were not drinking. It was important to set a strict tone at the outset: “When you stop it the first night, then that’s all you have to do.” Although Kulle was often in contact with students, he did not get to know them well. He had learned somewhere in his past “not to get too close to [them] because those relationships might interfere with his enforcement of the school’s rules.” The high school was Kulle’s domain. “Whether it’s an evening class or a little theater event, Kulle is usually there, standing guard,” the paper noted.</p>



<p>Kulle had become something of an institution at OPRF. He adored the school, and the feeling was mutual. OPRF compensated him well — he earned more than many of the teachers. As his English improved, Kulle formed strong friendships with his colleagues, inviting them out to Oktoberfest celebrations and giving recommendations and reviews of Chicago’s German restaurants. Students in OPRF teacher Herr Schoepko’s German classes occasionally tried to practice with Kulle in the hallways. He would engage politely and briefly before returning to his work. A more awkward encounter came when the theater department asked whether the set for their production of <em>The Sound of Music</em> looked authentic. He shrugged; it was not worth explaining that he was a German citizen from a town that was now in Poland while the play’s story took place in Austria.</p>

<p><span>I</span>t wasn’t just any letter. It was from the Department of Justice, which had questions about the war and wanted to talk.</p>



<p>The summer usually brought calm. Just weeks earlier, the senior class had bidden OPRF a final farewell. Kulle was one year closer to retirement — to being at home with Gertrud in Brookfield, where they had moved after their children had left the house and married, to spending his days in the garden, to having more time with the grandkids. After the graduation ceremony, the custodial staff broke down the chairs and cleaned up from the event. Soon the building would be quiet again.</p>



<p>But at the end of July 1982, the Kulles received formal correspondence from the deputy director of the Justice Department’s Office of Special Investigations, created to track down Nazis and their collaborators now living in the United States. OSI had scheduled a meeting with Kulle, and because he was not a U.S. citizen, he had no choice but to go. Gertrud told OSI attorney Bruce Einhorn that Reinhold would take OSI up on its offer to provide an interpreter.</p>



<p>On Saturday morning, August 14, Einhorn waited for Kulle at the Midland Hotel in downtown Chicago. He placed an American flag on OSI’s side of the table. Kulle might not have noticed, but the symbolism was important to the 29-year-old curly-haired prosecutor. Einhorn, a Jewish kid from Brooklyn and the descendant of a prominent American rabbi, would be standing over a Nazi.</p>



<p>Einhorn had a file of documents gathered over the past year from the Berlin Document Center and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They were more than OSI could have hoped for. The documents included not only Kulle’s SS personnel file but the marriage application Kulle had filed with the Reich Security Main Office. They had Kulle, in his own handwriting, detailing his Nazi history, proudly recalling his time in the Hitler Youth and Waffen-SS, and assuring Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler that there were no Jews in Kulle’s bloodline. They even had photos of him in his SS uniform.</p>



<p>When Kulle arrived, Einhorn was almost relieved by his appearance. Now 61, Kulle still had a powerful frame, though his hair was thinning on top. Most important, he looked exactly like he did in the photos OSI had of him in uniform. Kulle had come without an attorney, and the interview began just before 11 a.m.</p>



<p>Einhorn walked through Kulle’s childhood in Silesia. “Have you always gone by that name?” “Where and when were you born?” “What was your father’s name?” More questions, straight from Kulle’s SS files, followed. “Have you ever had the measles?” “Did you ever have scarlet fever?” “You are approximately 170 centimeters tall?” The questions seemed innocuous enough. They were confirming, though, that the Reinhold Kulle of Gross-Rosen, Silesia, was the Reinhold Kulle of Brookfield, Illinois.</p>



<p>Kulle freely acknowledged having volunteered for the SS and joining the Death’s Head division. He described his service in occupied France and the wounds he had suffered on the eastern front. He answered before the questions could be translated into German. Einhorn repeatedly reminded him to wait for the translation, but it was clear that Kulle’s English was now quite fluent.</p>



<p>Einhorn asked whether he had received any decorations for his service. Yes, Kulle said, but they had been lost when the family fled Silesia. He did have a picture to show Einhorn: one of him in his uniform, with the Death’s Head insignia, and with patches and stripes that denoted the medals he had received. The photograph was one of the only items Kulle still had from the war, a remnant he had managed to keep and protect for nearly 40 years. Einhorn looked at the photo and then up at Kulle.</p>



<p>“I take it this photograph means a great deal to you,” he said.</p>



<p>Kulle dismissed the remark. “It doesn’t mean anything today.”</p>



<p>Though he freely acknowledged his military service, Kulle was coy about anything connected to Nazi persecution. He tried to portray his time at Gross-Rosen as strictly military duty, saying he had nothing to do with the prisoners and was only at the camp to train recruits. He clearly understood that admitting to more could spell trouble, but once he had acknowledged that he was the same Reinhold Kulle who had been born on March 5, 1921, in Breslau, in the then-German province of Silesia, his protestations were of little value.</p>



<p>Once back in Washington, D.C., Einhorn and his colleagues prepared to begin formal deportation proceedings.</p>





<p><span>F</span>or two days that December of 1982, OPRF superintendent Jack Swanson walked through the Oak Park community, almost singularly carrying a bombshell. So far, the school had been spared any publicity. The <em>Sun-Times</em> article had not mentioned OPRF, and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> had misidentified Kulle as a custodian at an elementary school in Brookfield.</p>



<p>But it was only a matter of time. Eric Linden, the lead reporter for Oak Park’s <em>Wednesday Journal</em>, had already asked for a comment. Swanson exuded his typical patience and calm, responding that Kulle was “an exemplary employee who will continue to work here at least until some kind of a court decision is made.” It was premature to do anything else, he explained. Everyone just needed to let the legal process play out.</p>



<p>That Monday afternoon, Swanson asked Kulle to come to his office before his shift began. Everyone knew that Kulle had been in the German army. He used to joke with the American veterans on his staff about the possibility they had shot at each other back in Europe. But a concentration camp guard? Reinhold? There was no way.</p>



<p>Swanson could not change the past, but he certainly wished the revelations had not been unearthed. He could never know exactly what had happened a lifetime ago and a world away. But he knew Reinhold, the kind of man he was now. They had become friends. He dreaded having to ask him about the allegations. His focus needed to be on the future, on students, on the budget. It was his job to do what was best for the school, and Kulle was an irreplaceable asset.</p>



<p>Kulle walked in, his collared short-sleeved work shirt covering the slight paunch of middle age. Swanson looked him in the eye and asked if the allegations were true. Had he really been a guard at a Nazi concentration camp?</p>



<p>Yes, Kulle told Swanson, he had worked at Gross-Rosen, but he had never even fired his rifle. It was just a prison, he added.</p>



<p>And he hadn’t said this on his visa application?</p>



<p>No, Kulle admitted. He had not.</p>



<p>And he had been in the Hitler Youth?</p>



<p>Yes, Kulle answered. He had joined the Nazi youth movement as a teenager, but he had never been an active participant.</p>



<p>Swanson peered through the large, thin-framed glasses that crossed his angular face. Kulle looked uneasy, as if he knew he was in trouble. Swanson was not finding his answers convincing. But after 23 years, Kulle had earned some compassion, some grace.</p>



<p>Swanson had to determine how to navigate OPRF through the ordeal to come. He hoped it would all just go away. Kulle had been a young man in the war, doing what everybody else at the time was doing there. And so many years had passed. The man at Gross-Rosen, Swanson told himself, had been a different Reinhold Kulle.</p>





<p><span>E</span>arly one August morning in 1983, RaeLynne Toperoff was reading the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> at home in Oak Park, enjoying a day off from the summer program she was teaching. The veteran Chicago Public Schools educator flipped through a dozen pages full of advertisements for back-to-school sales.</p>



<p>Then, above a large ad for a new Apple computer, the word “Nazi” caught her eye. Another of Hitler’s men had been caught. Good, she thought, scanning the short article about a deportation hearing.</p>



<p>Then she saw it.</p>



<p>“The Oak Park school maintenance man…” She read the line over and over, thinking her eyes were playing tricks on her. How had she not heard about this before? She thought about her school-age kids. At which school was this Reinhold Kulle working?</p>



<p>Toperoff grabbed her phone and called Rima Lunin Schultz, a close friend from her synagogue. Toperoff began to explain what she had read but soon gave up and instead scurried the four blocks to Lunin Schultz’s house to tell her in person.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>There was one question that RaeLynne Toperoff could not get out of her head: Why, if it was already determined that Reinhold Kulle was a known member of the SS, was he still employed at the high school?</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>They tried to figure out where the hearing was being held. Something they could not yet articulate was compelling them to go, to witness the proceedings. From Lunin Schultz’s kitchen, they called local leaders, Jewish organizations, anyone they could think of. “Where is this happening?” they kept asking, but nobody seemed willing or able to tell them. Exasperated, Lunin Schultz called the Justice Department itself.</p>



<p>“I’d like to speak to whomever is involved with the matter of Reinhold Kulle,” she said. She was put through to Einhorn’s hotel room, and the attorney told her how to get to the courtroom at the Dirksen Federal Building in downtown Chicago.</p>



<p>Toperoff and Lunin Schultz raced the two blocks south to the L stop and boarded the Green Line train. By the time they entered the courtroom 45 minutes later, the hearing was well underway. Toperoff looked over to the defense table. There he was, this Nazi, this Kulle, sitting in an American courtroom, getting due process and a prominent lawyer.</p>



<p>On the other side of the courtroom, by the OSI table, several elderly women sat together. Lunin Schultz and Toperoff knew instantly that they were survivors. Without saying a word, they walked over to sit with the women. They looked around the courtroom to see whether anyone else they knew from Oak Park had come. Sure enough, a contingent sat on Kulle’s side of the room, near a cadre of neo-Nazis. Toperoff and Lunin Schultz stared in disbelief. Their neighbors had walked into the same contrast they had seen — Holocaust survivors on one side, a former Nazi on the other — and had chosen their seats differently.</p>



<p>At the end of the long and emotionally exhausting day of testimony, there was one question that Toperoff could not get out of her head: Why, if it was already determined that Kulle was a known member of the SS, was he still employed at the high school?</p>





<p><span>A</span>s the first phase of the hearing came to a close, 20 members of the high school’s maintenance staff wrote a public letter chastising the <em>Oak Leaves</em> for reporting on the proceedings in a “sensational manner” and for not including “even one item in support of Mr. Kulle.” Had the paper sent reporters to OPRF, Kulle’s colleagues wrote, it would have learned that Kulle was “held in high esteem at the high school” and that the “school and community are just a little better because Mr. Kulle has been here.”</p>



<p>RaeLynne Toperoff put down the paper in a fit of disgust. “The same cannot be said of his Gross-Rosen victims,” she thought. The next week, as if in response to the custodial staff’s letter to the <em>Oak Leaves</em>, the <em>Wednesday Journal</em> sent Eric Linden to the high school. Kulle’s boss, the assistant director of buildings and grounds, told the reporter that Kulle remained “respected” and “popular” and that the charges had “not changed that impression.”</p>



<p>Rima Lunin Schultz was following OSI’s other cases, and she knew that those situations were difficult. There was little precedent for how a community or an employer should handle such allegations. But Oak Park was supposed to be different. It was, she explained to anyone who would listen, “better equipped to deal with these kinds of issues than other communities.”</p>



<p>Each Wednesday, Lunin Schultz opened the weekly papers with trepidation, anxiety, and a pair of scissors, collecting each article and letter about Kulle and placing them in a box. She and Toperoff bristled at Linden’s gentle portrayals of Kulle and at the absence of historical context about the slave labor at Gross-Rosen. They were relieved to see, in the middle of September, that they were not entirely alone. Three men sent a letter to the <em>Wednesday Journal</em> expressing outrage at the “good guy image” in Linden’s recent piece.</p>



<p>Still, the women knew they were in the minority. Linden said as much when Toperoff called him. Kulle’s colleagues still supported him, the school continued to employ him, and even the local press was sympathetic. Kulle seemed to have the support of Oak Park’s most powerful institutions.</p>



<p>Searching for allies, Lunin Schultz, Toperoff, and their husbands attended a meeting of a small new group organized by Bruce and Julie Samuels, who were active in progressive politics and environmental issues in town. Bruce Samuels thought the Kulle situation was a symptom of an ignorance of history, especially Holocaust history, and he hoped to push the high school to improve its curriculum. His goals were expressed in the lofty name of the group: Coalition for an Informed and Responsible Citizenry.</p>





<p><span>T</span>hat October, the school board received an anonymous letter, seemingly from faculty members, requesting that Kulle not be removed. Riddled with antisemitic tropes, the letter had harsh words for Lunin Schultz and Toperoff: “We are concerned that a small minority are acting immorally, ungodly, and unAmerican, trying to force their selfish, narrow pointed opinions on the rest of the community.” The writers contended that Kulle was being unfairly condemned “because he joined an organization over 45 years ago when he was 18 or 19 years of age.”</p>



<p>With a legal case ongoing, the letter said, there was “no justification for a small group to take the law into their own hands.” The letter characterized anti-Kulle sentiments as an “undemocratic … attitude of guilt by association” and asked the school board to judge the case “on the facts presented to the Federal government” and not “on the emotions of a small minority of citizens in Oak Park.” Though it argued that Kulle should be considered “innocent until proven guilty,” it also criticized the Coalition for an Informed and Responsible Citizenry for being “completely unforgiving.”</p>



<p>One of the first Oak Parkers to speak out publicly in Kulle’s defense was a student at the high school, who declared the head custodian “one reason to be proud of [the] school.” Toperoff was crushed when she saw the girl’s name in the <em>Oak Leaves</em>. Their families were friendly, and her son and the girl were close. The student argued that Kulle did not deserve “the mistreatment and verbal abuse that gets printed in the paper. … Mr. Kulle is a very kind and friendly man at school and I am sure that he is not proud of his Nazi background.”</p>



<p>Lunin Schultz had expected Kulle’s family, and even some friends and colleagues, to support him. But now the community’s children were standing up for a former concentration camp guard. Lunin Schultz was left deeply unsettled. What was happening at the high school?</p>



<p>She had barely calmed down the next day when she received a letter from John Lukehart, the idealistic chair of Oak Park’s Community Relations Commission. He thanked her and Toperoff for bringing the Kulle matter to the commission’s attention and attached a letter he had sent to the school board. “Mr. Kulle is a public employee, paid with public funds,” Lukehart wrote. “He is visible to the community in his present job. Given the above observations, it is the commission’s judgment that the Board of Education should put Mr. Kulle on a leave of absence immediately.”</p>



<p>Then Lukehart went a step further, beyond even what Lunin Schultz and Toperoff had called for: “The Community Relations Commission further believes that, should Mr. Kulle’s involvement as a member of the Nazi SS be substantiated, regardless of the outcome of the present judicial proceedings, the School Board should terminate his employment immediately.”</p>





<p><span>B</span>y now, Kulle was a constant topic of debate in the local papers, and both the <em>Tribune</em> and the <em>Sun-Times</em> had been covering the hearing. One of Kulle’s friends called Rich Deptuch, the beloved head of the school’s math department, to ask what the staff could do to help Kulle, and Deptuch agreed that it was time to make sure the school board knew how the faculty felt. Other teachers had approached Deptuch as well, hoping to help a friend. On at least one occasion a colleague expressed explicit antisemitism, and Deptuch immediately shut the conversation down. He would not tolerate bigotry. Nor was it his place to decide Kulle’s guilt.</p>



<p>In early November, Deptuch drafted a petition to the board stressing the “positive influence” Kulle had and arguing that “accusations of Reinhold’s alleged criminal misconduct as a member of the German SS nearly 40 years ago should have no bearing on his opportunity to continue to provide such valuable services to the school.” The final paragraph urged the school board to wait until a court ruling before making a decision regarding Kulle’s employment. Deptuch made several hundred copies of the petition at a local printer and distributed them in faculty mailboxes the next day.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>One math teacher drafted a petition arguing that Kulle’s actions “nearly 40 years ago should have no bearing on his opportunity to continue to provide such valuable services to the school.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Though the majority of the staff members were solidly in Kulle’s corner, there were exceptions. At a faculty meeting that fall, history teacher Michael Averbach had given an impassioned speech. It was not simply a legal case, he had said, or even a moral one; the school had a pedagogical responsibility to fire Kulle. “How can we tell kids that what they do at 16 or 17 matters,” he had pleaded, “if we say that what Reinhold did at 20 or 21 doesn’t?” Keeping Kulle employed, Averbach argued, would undermine everything the school claimed to be.</p>



<p>The school board had hoped that the legal system would take the decision out of its hand, but even now, after the hearing had ended and Kulle awaited a ruling, a fundraising note addressed to the “Friends of Reinhold Kulle” and asking for contributions to his defense made it clear that Kulle had no interest in a quick resolution. The case, it said, would “probably require appeal.”</p>



<p>That December, shortly before a school board meeting, Lunin Schultz, Toperoff, and a few others gathered to strategize. They needed to find a way to force the board to discuss Kulle in open session; the board had declared the matter a “personnel issue,” one that could be discussed only behind closed doors.</p>



<p>Back in October, Bruce Samuels had asked, almost sarcastically, whether the school had a policy about employees’ memberships in questionable organizations. What if, Lunin Schultz suggested, they asked the board to adopt a policy against employing former Nazis? There was something elegant about the idea. They would not mention Kulle by name. The discussion would remain theoretical, and the board would not be able to hide behind the “personnel issue” buffer.</p>



<p>The group had little interest in an actual policy — it seemed entirely unlikely that OPRF would be in this position again — but the proposal would box the school board into a corner. Driving home that evening, Lunin Schultz felt a weight coming off her chest.</p>





<p><span>T</span>here were few empty chairs at the next school board meeting. Lunin Schultz recognized many of the visitors, but the Kulle issue seemed to cast a wide net. Neo-Nazis were an increasing presence in front of the school, passing out booklets denying the Holocaust. Some of them even tried to speak on Kulle’s behalf at school board meetings, but lacking Oak Park addresses, they were denied.</p>



<p>The board and the administration took their seats just after 7:30 p.m. and proceeded with typical housekeeping. After agreeing to draft a letter of appreciation to a retiring engineer, the board ceded the floor to the superintendent. But the large crowd certainly had not come to hear him discuss the new geometry textbooks. The meeting continued with a long list of items — everything but Kulle.</p>



<p>Finally, it was time for public comments. Gignilliat, the school board president, issued a reminder that the board would hear discussion of policy but that personnel issues would be reserved for executive session. Toperoff tried to cover a wry smile as Michael Fleisher, a member of the Coalition for an Informed and Responsible Citizenry, rose to address the board.</p>



<p>The board’s refusal to take action, he asserted, jeopardized “the first obligation of the high school” — to train its students to make informed and moral decisions. After pushing for more specifics on a statement the board had made earlier about the school reviewing its Holocaust curriculum, Fleisher shifted to his group’s ultimate demand. “We urge action based on a moral principle,” he said. A recent statement by Gignilliat had said that the board would not act on the Kulle matter until it had all of the “relevant information.” “If you are awaiting a legal decision by a hearing officer and/or continue to see this as a narrow personnel matter, you have misunderstood the issue,” Fleisher said. “We request an answer: Should a person who has voluntarily served in the SS be considered a suitable employee of District 200?”</p>



<p>Fleisher handed the board members copies of his statement, which had 40 signatures at the bottom, and returned to his seat. A few other speakers followed him, but even as they talked, his words kept a firm hold on the room.</p>



<p>Some of the board members grew defensive, and the discussion began to unravel. William “Jay Jay” Turner, the only Black member of the school board, tried to reestablish order. Thanking Fleisher for his statement, he pointed out that the members of the Coalition for an Informed and Responsible Citizenry had taken time to formulate their ideas together, and the school board needed to do the same.</p>



<p>At 10:15 p.m., Turner moved for the board to go into closed session in Swanson’s office. Almost exactly a year earlier in this very room, Swanson had first learned of Kulle’s Nazi past from the <em>Sun-Times</em> article. Swanson, who had unsuccessfully urged Kulle to take an early retirement, could tell he was losing the board members’ support. Kulle was just “a simple sergeant,” he argued. “Why was he getting blamed for everything the Nazis did?”</p>



<p>It was now past midnight, nearly five hours after the meeting had begun. The board members were all haggard, emotional, and drained. Deptuch’s petition, Fleisher’s speech, and the continued increase in attendance at school board meetings made it clear to everyone in the room: A decision regarding Kulle’s employment had to be made, separate from the outcome of the legal case.</p>





<p><span>D</span>eliberations resumed in the high school’s boardroom on the morning of January 14, 1984. Kulle was asked to attend, but before he arrived, one board member recounted a harrowing conversation he’d had with a former Gross-Rosen prisoner. Gignilliat was struck by the fact that the number of reported deaths at the camp was almost the same as the entire population of Oak Park.</p>



<p>At 9:20 a.m., Kulle joined the meeting with his attorney, who gave prepared remarks. The board members then took turns interviewing him.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“Tell us exactly how you feel,” one school board member asked Kulle, hoping for clarity. “I feel bad, very bad,” Kulle said. “I just wished we had won the war.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Turner had been reading everything he could about Gross-Rosen and had grown convinced that Kulle was responsible for a lot of dastardly things. When his turn to interview Kulle came, he stared across the table and asked him whether he had seen prisoners. No, Kulle responded, he had been on the outskirts of the camp. Turner abruptly changed the subject: He asked how Kulle’s promotions at Gross-Rosen had affected his relationship with Gertrud’s father. Then he switched back, asking Kulle whether he had ever done anything kind for the prisoners. Kulle told Turner the same stories he had told in court: He had brought chickens to a prisoner once, given water to another.</p>



<p>Which was it? Turner thought. Had Kulle been away from the prisoners, or had he brought them gifts? It was all Turner needed to hear. Kulle was lying.</p>



<p>Other questions followed from other board members, but Kulle claimed to recall very little from Gross-Rosen.</p>



<p>Had he ever shot anyone?</p>



<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>



<p>Had he ever abused or tortured a prisoner?</p>



<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>



<p>Had he ever killed anyone?</p>



<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>



<p>Gignilliat found the answers eminently frustrating. Kulle was certainly not helping his cause. Killing someone seemed like a thing a man would remember.</p>



<p>Finally, board member Carl Dudley, a minister and professor at a nearby theological seminary, tried to break through. It had been a tense day, and the stress of the entire situation was wearing on everyone. “Reinhold, how do you feel? Do you feel guilty? Do you feel that the things you did were wrong?”</p>



<p>“Yah, yah, I feel bad. I feel bad about the whole situation,” he responded.</p>



<p>“Tell us exactly how you feel,” Dudley implored, hoping for some kind of clarity.</p>



<p>“I feel bad, very bad,” Kulle said. “I just wished we had won the war.”</p>





<p><span>A</span>n envelope addressed to Reinhold Kulle arrived at OPRF that January. Inside were two pension estimates from the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund. They would prove instructive.</p>



<p>The policy proposal against employing Nazis had indeed boxed the school board into a corner, and Kulle’s answers to Dudley’s questions had done him no favors. One by one, school officials were coming to terms with the gravity of the situation. Gignilliat, who had long held out hope that they could weather the storm, now recognized that it would be impossible to retain Kulle.</p>



<p>Back in December the board had promised a response to Fleisher by its January 24 meeting, but as the meeting neared, no statement had been released. Growing impatient, Lunin Schultz and Toperoff distributed a note urging friends to attend the upcoming meeting, hoping their presence would help “bring about a sound policy on this issue.” Attached to the note was a petition from Fleisher requesting substantive responses to the questions he had raised at the previous meeting. He planned to speak again.</p>



<p>Finally, on January 18, the school board released a statement. In large part a response to Fleisher, it pushed back on the suggestion that the board adopt a resolution condemning racism and genocide, which “would imply that the board has not previously condemned those heinous ideas and acts.” Quoting board policies, the letter stressed the district’s commitment to both moral concerns and diversity and reiterated that an ongoing curriculum review was underway.</p>



<p>At the end of the statement, Gignilliat addressed the board’s decision process. These were complicated issues, he explained, and it was precisely because “the board is well aware of the impact this matter has had on our community” that it would “continue to seek counsel as needed, act with prudent deliberation, and resist attempts to precipitate a premature decision.” It would announce a final decision when members had all the necessary and relevant information and when they were sure they could do so without abridging Kulle’s rights.</p>



<p>Lunin Schultz could not understand what “necessary and relevant information” the board still needed. What new information could possibly come out?</p>



<p>But Gignilliat felt that a decision of this magnitude would have to be unanimous, and the board would need the administration’s support. It could not just summarily fire Kulle and move on — not after a quarter century of service. As important as it was to end what had become a public relations nightmare for the school, the board hoped to somehow avoid hurting Kulle financially. The two IMRF simulations provided some clarity. The first estimated Kulle’s pension if he retired at the end of the school year; the second if he waited two more years and retired in July 1986.</p>



<p>Over the next few days, Gignilliat, the school board, and the administration weighed their options. Quietly, slowly, carefully, they crafted a way out — one they would shroud in secrecy for decades.</p>





<p><span>O</span>n the evening of January 24, 1984, Toperoff waited nervously for the school board meeting to begin. Word had gotten out that the board planned to make an announcement about Kulle. To accommodate the large crowd that was expected, the board moved the meeting to one of the school’s auditoriums. Toperoff’s husband, Gil, sat on one side of her; Lunin Schultz and her husband, Richard, on the other. Friends were clustered in nearby rows. Herr Schoepko, the school’s German teacher and Kulle’s friend, settled into a seat behind them.</p>



<p>The room grew quiet. Oak Parkers were still filtering into the few remaining seats. After some formalities, Gignilliat announced that he was going to read a statement and that visitors would not be allowed to comment until later in the meeting.</p>



<p>Toperoff took a deep breath.</p>



<p>“In recent months,” Gignilliat began, “this board has devoted considerable time and attention to Reinhold Kulle’s employment in the district.”</p>



<p>The room was eerily quiet. Gignilliat read slowly and deliberately: “The board understands that under present law, no guard at a Nazi concentration camp would be permitted to immigrate to the United States.”</p>



<p>Toperoff looked to her husband, and to Lunin Schultz.</p>



<p>“As a member of the noncertified supervisory staff, Mr. Kulle does not have a written employment contract.”</p>



<p>The crowd was now becoming animated, whispers growing louder.</p>



<p>“The law does not compel the board either to reemploy or to terminate Mr. Kulle. The paramount considerations are and have been moral issues, including fairness to Mr. Kulle. Fairness to Mr. Kulle suggested to the board that it do nothing to interfere with his defense during the deportation hearing. The hearing has concluded. The board has obtained all the necessary relevant information, has been deliberate in its consideration, and is now prepared to act.”</p>



<p>Lunin Schultz tried to quell her frustration at the revisionist history of the last 13 months.</p>



<p>“The board is unwilling to show less than utter revulsion for the Nazi horrors. In making a decision, the board rejects any suggestion that to terminate Mr. Kulle’s employment involves notions of ‘guilt by association.’ It is not the board’s charge to decide whether Mr. Kulle is ‘guilty’ in that sense; nor does the board wish to prejudice his employment in the private sector. It is simply that no former guard at a Nazi concentration camp will be employed by this district. In a public school supported by public funds for educational purposes, the goal is to teach that each individual must accept responsibility for personal behavior and its implications for society.”</p>



<p>It was strong rhetoric, and the crowd was responding strongly as well. Around Toperoff there were smiles and tears of exhaustion; behind her, groans of frustration and murmurs of discontent.</p>



<p>“Accordingly,” Gignilliat continued, “Mr. Kulle will not be reemployed as of July 1, 1984, and is placed on terminal leave of absence effective January 25, 1984. Because the performance of his duties has given no legal cause to end his employment status or to cease compensating him, he will continue to receive his salary until June 30, 1984.”</p>



<p>Gignilliat moved back from the microphone. Toperoff stood up, applauding. So did Lunin Schultz and dozens of others.</p>



<p>It was over. Kulle was gone.</p>



<p>A group of Kulle’s friends a couple of rows away heckled loudly. “Where do these Jews come from? They rise from the ashes!”</p>



<p>Jeffrey Greenwald, a sophomore, stood with his parents and heard a scolding voice a few rows behind him: “Wir bleiben setzen.”</p>



<p>He turned around to see Herr Schoepko, the German teacher, and leaned over to his father, confused. “We stay seated,” his father translated.</p>



<p>Chills went down the boy’s spine.</p>



<p>The announcement had done exactly what the board had hoped. Kulle’s opponents were happy, and the board would soon be able to move on from the turmoil and return to its work running the school. Though Kulle’s colleagues would be upset, Swanson would be able to handle the faculty.</p>



<p>But Reinhold Kulle had not been fired. He would be allowed an early retirement, and the board would give him a severance package. School officials would work with the retirement fund and Kulle’s lawyers to find the best possible solution for his family. They would do their best to take care of him. It was a compromise between the board and the administration, a way of satisfying those who wanted Kulle gone and those who thought the school still owed him loyalty.</p>



<p>And it would all be kept quiet. There would be no additional public announcements. The board would be careful to discuss the topic only in closed session, and the notes from those meetings would be kept sealed for nearly 40 years — one of the high school’s best-kept secrets.</p>





<p><span>I</span>n November 1984, the judge in the deportation hearing finally issued her ruling. The evidence was “clear, convincing, and unequivocal,” she wrote, that Reinhold Kulle had participated in persecution under the direction of the Nazi Reich.</p>



<p>After a series of failed appeals, Kulle was taken into custody at his Brookfield home on a Friday night in October 1987. The following Monday, he was put on a plane to Germany. Once there, he headed to a relative’s home in Lahr, the city he had left 30 years earlier. West Germany’s chief Nazi crimes prosecutor announced that Kulle would not face charges; a preliminary investigation had turned up “no indications of a crime that can still be prosecuted.”</p>



<p>After a few years, Kulle lost touch with most of his friends from Oak Park, though a reminder of his time at OPRF came in the mail each month in the form of a pension check from the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund. Those payments stopped in 2006, when Reinhold Kulle died in Germany, at the age of 85, still a free man.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body"><p>In front of you are two personal websites, each used as a blog and to display basic contact info of the owner:</p><ol><li>One is a complex CMS written in PHP that requires a web server, multiple workers, a Redis cache, and a SQL database. The site also has a big frontend component that loads as a Single Page Application and then performs navigation by requesting the content in JSON form, which then gets "rehydrated" client-side.</li><li>The other is a collection of static HTML files and one or two CSS files. No JavaScript anywhere.</li></ol><p>If you didn't know any better, you would expect almost all normal users to have [2] and professional engineers to have something like [1], but it's actually the inverse: only few professional software engineers can "afford" to have the second option as their personal website, and almost all normal users are stuck with overcomplicated solutions.</p><p>Weird as it might be, it's not a great mystery why that is: it's easier to spin up a Wordpress blog than it is to figure out by yourself all the intermediate steps:</p><ol><li>Buy a domain</li><li>Find a hosting platform</li><li>Configure DNS</li><li>Find an SSG (or handcraft everything yourself)</li><li>Learn how to setup a deployment pipeline</li></ol><p>And so, while we software engineers enjoy free hosting &amp; custom domain support with GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages / etc, normal users are stuck with a bunch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/" target="_blank">greedy clowns</a> that make them pay for every little thing, all while wasting ungodly amounts of computational power to render what could have been a static website in 99% of cases.</p><p>Last week I spoke at SquiggleConf in Boston about my experience writing a language server for HTML. Most of the talk is tactical advice on what to do (or avoid) when implementing one, but I concluded the talk with a more high-level point, which I will now report here fully as conclusion to this blog post.</p><blockquote><p>When I published SuperHTML, I discovered that it was <a href="https://kristoff.it/blog/first-html-lsp/" target="_blank">the first ever language server for HTML</a> that reported diagnostics to the user. I wrote a blog post about it, it got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41512213" target="_blank">on the frontpage of Hacker News</a> and nobody corrected me, so you know it's true.</p><p>I originally found it a funny thing, but thinking about it more, it's a bit sad that this is the case. Linters do exist, and people can get diagnostics in their editor, but that's usually tooling tied to a specific frontend framework and not vanilla HTML, which leads to people opting to use frameworks even if they don't really have a real need for all the complexity that those frameworks bring.</p><p>And that's bad in my opinion. Not because of an abstract appreciation for simplicity, but because <strong>the web doesn't belong just to software engineers</strong>. The more we make the web complex, the more we push normal users into the enclosures that we like to call <em>social networks</em>.</p><p>Don't you find it infuriating when lawyers and accountants fail to clarify how their respective domains work, making them unavoidable intermediaries of systems that in theory you should be able to navigate by yourself?</p><p><strong>Whenever we fail to make simple things easy in software engineering, and webdev especially, we are failing society in the exact same way.</strong></p><p>This is not something that startups or big tech can solve for us, their economic incentives are just too misaligned, so I invite you all to help make the web more accessible, partially as a matter of taking pride in our craft, and partially because the web used to be more interesting when more of it was made by people different from us.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-wrapper">
    
    <article data-clarity-region="article" id="post-110345">
        <div data-bi-area="body_article" data-bi-id="post_page_body_article">
            <p>It seems that a popular way of converting a string to uppercase or lowercase is to do it letter by letter.</p>
<pre>std::wstring name;

std::transform(name.begin(), name.end(), name.begin(),
    std::tolower);
</pre>
<p>This is wrong for many reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, <code>std::<wbr>tolower</code> is not an <i>addressible function</i>. This means, among other things, that you are not allowed to take the function’s address,¹ like we’re doing here when we pass a pointer to the function to <code>std::<wbr>transform</code>. So we’ll have to use a lambda.</p>
<pre>std::wstring name;

std::transform(name.begin(), name.end(), name.begin(),
    [](auto c) { return std::tolower(c); });
</pre>
<p>The next mistake is a copy-pasta: The code is using <code>std::<wbr>tolower</code> to convert wide characters (<code>wchar_t</code>) even though <code>std::<wbr>tolower</code> works only for narrow characters (even more restrictive than that: it works only for <i>unsigned</i> narrow characters <code>unsigned char</code>). There is no compile-time error because <code>std::<wbr>tolower</code> accepts an <code>int</code>, and on most systems, <code>wchar_t</code> is implicitly promotable to <code>int</code>, so the compiler accepts the value without complaint even though over 99% of the potential values are out of range.</p>
<p>Even if we fix the code to use <code>std::<wbr>towlower</code>:</p>
<pre>std::wstring name;

std::transform(name.begin(), name.end(), name.begin(),
    [](auto c) { return std::towlower(c); });
</pre>
<p>it’s still wrong because it assumes that case mapping can be performed <code>char</code>-by-<code>char</code> or <code>wchar_t</code>-by-<code>wchar_t</code> in a context-free manner.</p>
<p>If the <code>wchar_t</code> encoding is UTF-16, then characters outside the basic multilingual plane (BMP) are represented by pairs of <code>wchar_t</code> values. For example, the Unicode character OLD HUNGARIAN CAPITAL LETTER A² (U+10C80) is represented by two UTF-16 code units: <kbd>D803</kbd> followed by <kbd>DC80</kbd>.</p>
<p>Passing these two code units to <code>towlower</code> one at a time prevents <code>towlower</code> from understanding how they interact with each other. If you call <code>towlower</code> with <kbd>DC80</kbd>, it recognizes that you passed only half of a character, but it doesn’t know what the other half is, so it has to just shrug its shoulders and say, “Um, <kbd>DC80</kbd>?” Too bad, because the lowercase version of OLD HUNGARIAN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+10C80) is OLD HUNGARIAN SMALL LETTER A (U+10CC0), so it should have returned <kbd>DCC0</kbd>. Of course <code>towlower</code> doesn’t have psychic powers, so you can’t really expect it to have known that the <kbd>DC80</kbd> was the partner of an unseen <kbd>D803</kbd>.</p>
<p>Another problem (which applies even if <code>wchar_t</code> is UTF-32) is that the uppercase and lowercase versions of a character might have different lengths. For example, LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (“ß” U+00DF) uppercases to the two-character sequence “SS”:³ Straße ⇒ STRASSE, and LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FL (“ﬂ” U+FB02) uppercases to the two-character sequence “FL”. In both examples, converting the string to uppercase causes the string to get longer. And in certain forms of the French language, capitalizing an accented character causes the accent to be dropped: à Paris ⇒ A PARIS. If the accented character à were encoded as LATIN SMALL LETTER A (U+0061) followed by COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT (U+0300), then converting to uppercase causes the string to get shorter.</p>
<p>Similar issues apply to the <code>std::string</code> version:</p>
<pre>std::string name;

std::transform(name.begin(), name.end(), name.begin(),
    [](auto c) { return std::tolower(c); });
</pre>
<p>If the string potentially contains characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range, then this triggers undefined behavior when those characters are encountered. And for UTF-8 data, you have the same issues discussed before: Multibyte characters will not be converted properly, and it breaks for case mappings that alter string lengths.</p>
<p>Okay, so those are the problems. What’s the solution?</p>
<p>If you need to perform a case mapping on a string, you can use <code>LCMap­String­Ex</code> with <code>LCMAP_<wbr>LOWERCASE</code> or <code>LCMAP_<wbr>UPPERCASE</code>, possibly with other flags like <code>LCMAP_<wbr>LINGUISTIC_<wbr>CASING</code>. If you use the <a href="https://icu.unicode.org/"> International Components for Unicode (ICU)</a> library, you can use <code>u_strToUpper</code> and <code>u_strToLower</code>.</p>
<p>¹ The standard imposes this limitation because the implementation may need to add default function parameters, template default parameters, or overloads in order to accomplish the various requirements of the standard.</p>
<p>² I find it quaint that Unicode character names are ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS, in case you need to put them in a Baudot telegram or something.</p>
<p>³ Under the pre-1996 rules, the ß can capitalize under certain conditions to “SZ”: Maßen ⇒ MASZEN. And in 2017, the Council for German Orthography (<i lang="de">Rat für deutsche Rechtschreibung</i>) permitted LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (“ẞ” U+1E9E) to be used as a capital form of ß.</p>
