  <p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/001.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Hi, I’m excited that there are so many people interested in learning more about how and why to run SQLite in production.</p>

<p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/002.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let me start by introducing myself. My name is Stephen, and you can find me on Twitter (no, I will not call it X) at <a href="https://twitter.com/fractaledmind">fractaledmind</a>. I am an American who moved to Berlin Germany 5 years ago, and in only a few more weeks I get to marry my fiancé, who is a Russian who moved to Germany around 10 years ago. She is actually here today, and this is her first time seeing me give a conference talk. So, no pressure, right?</p>

<p>At my day job, I am the head of engineering at <a href="https://test.io/">Test IO</a>, which is a crowd-driven testing service. Then, in my spare time I am an open source developer, actively contributing to and maintaining a number of gems. I also write a fair bit on <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/">my blog</a> as I go.</p>

<p><img src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/003.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Today I want to talk about why this is how I start all of my new Rails projects, and why you might want to as well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/004.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Specifically, I want to discuss why it might make sense to choose SQLite as your database engine. In fact, I want to even suggest that you might lean on SQLite for all of your app’s data needs. Now, whenever I suggest using SQLite in production for web applications, the primary and most common question I get is…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/005.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Why? So, let’s explore that together. Who here is running or has run an application in production with SQLite? Who has experimented with SQLite for an app, but not shipped it to production? There are a couple hands up, but not many. So, let’s turn this question around.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/006.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Why not use SQLite in production? What are some of the reasons you haven’t considered SQLite as an option?</p>

<p>Well, the primary reason I choose SQLite is that it allows me to build useful and valuable applications quickly and to maintain them easily.</p>

<p>Why? So, let’s explore that together. Who here is running or has run an application in production with SQLite? Who has experimented with SQLite for an app, but not shipped it to production? There are a couple hands up, but not many. So, let’s turn this question around.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/007.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In his RailsWorld keynote, DHH re-emphasized the point that Rails, at its core, is “the one-person framework”. It aims to be a bridge over complexity that allows even the smallest possible team—only you—to build full, rich, valuable web applications. And I believe that SQLite aligns perfectly with that vision. There are 3 basic reasons…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/008.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>First is that SQLite is simple. The database is a literal file on disk. The engine is a single executable. Every aspect of the database can be fully embedded into your majestic Rails monolith.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/009.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Next, this simplicity grants you unique control. When both the storage and the engine for your database are embedded in your app, their configuration naturally lives in your app as well. Plus, because SQLite is a single executable, it is possible to fine-tune the actual compilation of that executable through Bundler. Then, having your database simply be a file permits novel and powerful developer experiences, like branch-specific databases.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/010.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Finally, SQLite is fast. When your data lives on the same machine as your application, you eliminate all network latency. You go from measuring queries in milliseconds to microseconds. Microseconds. Now, that being said, I know that there is a presumption that SQLite isn’t actually fast for web applications. One of my goals for this talk is to dispel this myth and show you that a well-tuned SQLite installation is plenty fast to drive your next big idea.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/011.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, that is why you should consider using SQLite in production, but the real heart of the matter is how.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/012.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And let’s start where all projects start —&nbsp;with building an MVP.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/013.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As I said, this is how I start all of my projects lately. And once you generate your basic Rails skeleton, all you need to do is, well, build your actual application. In an earlier iteration of this talk, I was actually going to walk thru the details of building an MVP with you. But, eventually I realized that this was completely off-topic. None of the details of the MVP were specific to SQLite, and any of the details of how I organized or structured the code are distractions.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/014.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, instead, I want to just show you a very simple MVP that I have built for this talk. We can then use this codebase as the playground for exploring how to leverage some of SQLite’s unique powers to improve our application.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/015.jpg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>show the codebase
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, that is the basic MVP that we will be working with today. It is a SQLite on Rails application that we have gotten the core functionality implemented and running on our machine. The next step is getting this application running in production, on the internet.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/016.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, how do we deploy SQLite on Rails applications? The first and maybe most important detail here is that Heroku isn’t an option. Any hosting provider that only provides an ephemeral file system won’t work as a host for a SQLite on Rails application. Luckily though, there are a number of different hosting providers that do provide some form of persistent disk storage. fly.io, Render, and Hatchbox are two of the most popular ones in the Rails ecosystem, but I know there are others.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/017.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I personally have used (and loved) <a href="https://hatchbox.io/">Hatchbox</a> for years. So that is what I use, and that’s what I want to show you today. Hatchbox is essentially an “Ops-as-a-Service”. You bring your own server, whether a DigitalOcean droplet or a Hetzner VPS or something else, and their platform will configure the server, deploy the repo, and generally take care of going from “I don’t have an app on the internet” to “I do have an app on the internet”.</p>

<p>This is another occasion where I originally wanted to walk you thru deploying our app live, but after doing it a couple of times in preparation, I realized that I didn’t want to have us all just sitting here waiting for a server to be provisioned. So, I instead documented literally every single step and screen of the process. So, let’s walk thru a simulated live demo of deploying our MVP application to production.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/018.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When you begin, you need to create what Hatchbox calls a “cluster”. They need to support applications that have maybe 3 servers running instances of the web app, two different servers running two different instances of Redis, each with different eviction policies, and one primary database server alongside one replica database server. Thus, they have clusters. One of my favorite aspects of a SQLite on Rails application is that we don’t need a complex network of interconnected servers to run our application. And especially at the beginning, when just trying to create something from nothing, being able to get a fully-functioning application without having to figure out all of these operational details can be the difference between shipping in days vs shipping in months.
Anyway, we will create our cluster, and use DigitalOcean as our hosting provider. In the end, our cluster will only have one server, but we need to conform to Hatchbox’s view of the world nonetheless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/019.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We then need to connect our DigitalOcean account, to grant Hatchbox the ability to manage our DigitalOcean droplets on our behalf.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/020.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>This will take us to a DigitalOcean OAuth page where we authorize Hatchbox for whichever DigitalOcean team account we want.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/021.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once we have authorized Hatchbox,</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/022.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We can start configuring our cluster. We first need to choose the region that our cluster will be hosted in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/023.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>DigitalOcean offers a number of different region options.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/024.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s choose Frankfurt for now. Pretty nicely centrally located.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/025.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With that, our cluster is created, and so we need to add a server to our cluster next.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/026.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As Hatchbox will remind us, we minimally need a server with two core responsibilities—run our web app and run cron.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/027.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s create a single server with both responsibilities.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/028.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>With that done, we can consider what size of server we want.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/029.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>DigitalOcean’s Frankfurt region has a number of different server size options.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/030.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The largest option in this region goes up to 32GB of RAM, 8 CPUs, and is $192 a month. For our MVP though, let’s start with the smallest, simplest, cheapest option.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/031.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, Hatchbox will begin creating and provisioning our server.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/032.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You can tail the logs of what precisely Hatchbox is doing if you’d like.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/033.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But once it has created the server on Digital Ocean, it will begin provisioning it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/034.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That can take some time—in this case around 10 minutes, but once it is done, we can begin creating our App to deploy to this server on this cluster.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/035.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When we navigate to the “Apps” tab, we can create a new app.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/036.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You give the app a name and choose which cluster it should be deployed to.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/037.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We want our new app to deploy to our new cluster.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/038.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When we tell Hatchbox to create this app,</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/039.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>it will ask us for the repository information. If you are just starting, you can connect their GitHub app to your GitHub account.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/040.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Or, if you are using some other git host, or you have already installed their GitHub app</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/041.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You can just choose that.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/042.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Provide the repo name and branch name, and that’s it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/043.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, we just need to deploy our new app to our new server.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/044.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Again, Hatchbox handles the details here. And, again, you can tail the logs to see precisely what it is doing if you’d like.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/045.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After a few minutes, your app will be deployed. You can now view that app running on a Hatchbox subdomain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/046.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Congrats! As quickly and easily as that, you have a production SQLite on Rails application running. And I really want to emphasize just how quick and easy that was. In preparing this talk, I quite literally built and deployed this demo app in a single day. And I am running that app on a DigitalOcean droplet that costs $4 a month. And DigitalOcean gives you $200 dollars in credit when you first sign up. This is the beauty and promise of the majestic monolith—when your entire operational setup is embedded in your app repository, simple and consistent deployment becomes possible. Then, with a SQLite on Rails application, you can also make this simple deployment cheap. Great for MVPs and R&amp;D projects. But I can already imagine what some of you are likely thinking: “Sure, it is technically running, but is it actually usable?” Let’s check.
I’d love for anyone with a phone or laptop to head to <a href="https://demo.sqliteonrails.com/">demo.sqliteonrails.com</a> and just click around. Does it feel useable? I’ll explore myself here on the conference wifi from Taipei hitting the server in Frankfurt.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/047.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We can also run our benchmarks to get a sense of our performance. I ran our different benchmarking scenarios against increasingly concurrent load. I ran each request twice as well to get a bit more variability for the averages. And, taking the overall average across every scenario and every concurrency setting, we get just over 20 requests per second.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, I did run all of these benchmarks from my laptop sitting in Berlin. And we deployed our app to Frankfurt. Of course, the app will be slower from here in Taiwan. Let’s see how much slower.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/048.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I ran the balanced benchmark from my hotel last night. Again, I ran it against increasingly concurrent load and ran each scenario twice. Taking the overall average, we get 14 requests per second. Sure, these aren’t staggeringly large numbers, but we were all using the app and saw that it was completely useable. Let’s put this in context.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/049.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://x.com/fractaledmind/status/1731988289349931080?s=20">I asked</a> for some anecdotal information about average and peak load for real, valuable production Rails apps. Here are the 6 replies I got. Does our demo work for the busiest half of these examples? No. But, the critical point here is that I built a working application, deployed to the smallest and cheapest server available, I’m running it in a single region on that tiny cheap server, and it is still totally useable. Useable enough to start making actual money.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/050.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It is so easy for us engineers to get lost in trying to do things the “right way” that we lose sight of the value and importance of just doing things at all. Especially when working on a side-project that isn’t just a learning exercise or an R&amp;D project at work, don’t lose time to trying to have an app that handles large scale that it simply won’t get at first. Ship, and ship quickly. This is a completely vanilla Rails app deployed on a completely vanilla and tiny DigitalOcean droplet via a completely vanilla Hatchbox process. One day of work in total. One single day. This is the single most important point I hope you take home with you from this talk. A SQLite on Rails application is good enough. Ship it.</p>

<p>That being said, this hasn’t always been the case. The out-of-the-box experience for SQLite on Rails applications wasn’t production ready even 3 months ago. So, there is some legitimacy to the presumption that people have had that SQLite can’t back production web applications. I hope I’ve shown you, though, that today it can.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/051.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, I want to briefly explain why our vanilla Rails app was useable in production on day one, because that certainly wasn’t always the case. Starting with Rails 7.1, we are applying a better default configuration for your SQLite database. These changes are central to making SQLite work well in the context of a web application. And the reality is, if you had tried to run a SQLite on Rails application in production before Rails 7.1, you likely did have a more difficult time and your performance wasn’t at a baseline of good enough. So I understand why and how this belief that SQLite can’t work in production for your Rails application came from. But, it is important that we don’t let our opinions formed in the past go unchallenged in the present. We have been doing a lot of work to make the out-of-the-box experience of SQLite on Rails applications noticeably better. If you’d like to learn more about what each of these configuration options are, why we use the values we do, and how this specific collection of configuration details improve things, I have <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/07/enhancing-rails-sqlite-fine-tuning/">a blog post</a> that digs into these details.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/052.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Another factor in ensuring that the default experience of SQLite on Rails applications is high quality is the default compilation settings of the SQLite executable itself. Mike Dalessio is the current maintainer of the sqlite3-ruby gem, and he and I have worked together to find the minimal default configuration for the executable that has the best default performance experience. When you install SQLite thru the Ruby gem, it is compiled to use the write ahead log and include the full text search extension. Again, more details on compilation settings and why we use the values we do are in <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/10/enhancing-rails-sqlite-optimizing-compilation/">my blog post</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/053.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, that being said, we all are hoping that our side-projects will take off somehow to some degree, so we want to know that a SQLite on Rails application can “scale”. And while I do genuinely believe that 10 to 20 requests per second is good enough for shipping an MVP on the smallest cheapest server possible, this stack isn’t viable if it can’t grow as our app and usage grows. So, let’s talk some about how to enhance the power of our SQLite database and our SQLite on Rails application. Plus, I want to show you some of the ways you can take advantage of SQLite’s unique design to make your life and your application better.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/054.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The first thing you should do when you start “scaling” your app is to install the enhanced adapter gem. While the default configuration for a Rails app is notably better today than it was even just 3 months ago, Rails moves relatively slowly, and there are improvements that we as a community have proven out that aren’t yet in Rails core. Or, there are some improvements that are currently in Rails core, but we want to make them available to all Rails apps at least on version 7.1. So, I created the <a href="https://github.com/fractaledmind/activerecord-enhancedsqlite3-adapter">enhanced adapter gem</a>, which when added to your application will automatically, well, <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/10/09/sqlite-on-rails-enhanced-sqlite3-adapter/">enhance your SQLite database</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/055.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>How does it enhance it? Well, in 5 ways. It ensures that some ActiveRecord features are present that weren’t released as a part of Rails 7.1 (tho both should be in Rails 7.1.3, and both are (as of yesterday) currently in Rails main). It then also powers up the <code>database.yml</code> file to allow for you to fine-tune your SQLite configuration and also load SQLite extensions, directly from the database.yml file. But, probably most importantly, it improves how your SQLite on Rails application handles concurrent load. I want to highlight two of these features today, to demonstrate some of the more powerful and useful enhancements that the gem provides.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/056.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>First, it is now easy to install and <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/08/enhancing-rails-sqlite-loading-extensions/">load SQLite extensions</a> into your app. In this example, I am installing and loading the vector similarly search extension for SQLite. Yes, you can integrate vector similarly search into your SQLite on Rails application. This makes it possible to implement a Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) AI feature into your Rails application. pgvector isn’t the only kid on the block. For those of you in Andrei Bondarev’s talk this morning on catching the AI train, this should be of particular interest.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/057.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But, my favorite feature of the gem is its <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/12/11/sqlite-on-rails-improving-concurrency/">improved concurrency support</a>. And why is this important? The first lever you should pull as you start to scale your application is increasing concurrency. The simplest first thing to do is to scale your server to one that has multiple cores such that Puma naturally runs in clustered mode, spinning up multiple Puma workers to server your app’s requests. The reality is that the out-of-the-box experience for SQLite on Rails applications today isn’t well suited for concurrent workloads. Let’s do some quick local benchmarking to see how.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/058.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So, what’s going on here? How is the enhanced adapter so radically improving how our application handles concurrent workloads? I don’t have time to go into great detail here, but you can read my recent blogpost on the topic linked via the QR code. The short explanation is that the gem defines a custom timeout handler that will release the GIL while waiting for a connection. Plus, we ensure that all transactions will use this custom timeout handler. And, this feature will eventually be upstreamed into Rails, but you can get it today via the enhanced adapter gem.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/059.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Beyond the default compilation configuration, we can <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/10/enhancing-rails-sqlite-optimizing-compilation/">enhance the compilation settings</a> for the SQLite executable for our specific application as well. SQLite has lots of compilation options. But, for modern web applications, these are the compilation options that the SQLite documentation itself recommends. They are particularly useful when you need to extract every possible bit of performance out of SQLite for your app.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/060.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Beyond just enhancing the default SQLite setup, we can also extend how our app uses SQLite, taking advantage of some of its unique characteristics.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/061.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>For example, this is one of my favorite developer experience improvements that SQLite makes so easy. You can get <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/06/enhancing-rails-sqlite-branch-databases/">isolated databases for each git branch</a> in your repository, so that you never get schema conflicts as you checkout different branches throughout your workday. And I just love that this massive improvement to your daily development experience is literally just a 2-line change.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/062.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Plus, one of the most important details for a production SQLite on Rails system is to have a backup procedure in place. The <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/09/09/enhancing-rails-sqlite-setting-up-litestream/">Litestream utility</a> allows you to stream every update to your SQLite database (or databases) to any of a number of bucket storage systems. And, as of Wednesday, there is now <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2023/12/12/sqlite-on-rails-litestream-ruby/">a Ruby gem</a> that will install the executable into your app. Then, you can run the installer to get it integrated into your Rails app as well.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/063.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Finally, you can take advantage of SQLite’s speed and simplicity to simply use SQLite as your backend for all of the Rails components that need some kind of persistent data</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/064.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack">Litestack</a> offers SQLite-backed, fine-tuned implementations of each of these data-bound components. This allows you to keep the operational simplicity of your majestic SQLite on Rails monolith while also building out a truly full-featured Rails application.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://fractaledmind.github.io/images/rubyconftw/065.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In the end, I hope that this exploration of the tools, techniques, and defaults for SQLite on Rails applications has shown you how powerful, performant, and flexible this approach is. Rails is legitimately the best web application framework for working with SQLite today. The community’s growing ecosystem of tools and gems is unparalleled. And today is absolutely the right time to start a SQLite on Rails application and explore these things for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://hothardware.com/news/controversy-google-ai-image-tool-gemini">AI image generators</a> typically work through a process known as "diffusion". Basically, the model that's generating the image starts with a very vague, blurry picture, and successive sampling steps refine the image until it's sharp and realistic—or at least, as real as the model can get for what you've prompted. Diffusion is usually a time-consuming process requiring lots of steps, but MIT researchers have found a better way.</p>

<p><a href="https://hothardware.com/photo-gallery/NewsItem/64189?image=big_dmd-method.jpg&amp;tag=popup" target="_blank"><img height="231px" width="708px" alt="dmd method" data-src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/small_dmd-method.jpg" src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/small_dmd-method.jpg"></a><br>
</p>
<p>
Using a new approach called "distribution matching distillation", researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have managed to reduce the diffusion process down to a single sampling step. Obviously, this is much faster than having to <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/dall-e-ai-art-generator-open-for-public-with-improved-safety-systems">iterate on the image</a> thirty to fifty times as you usually do with typical image diffusion processes. The results produced aren't bad, either; take a look:</p><p><img height="397px" width="708px" alt="dmd vs sd" data-src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/dmd-vs-sd.jpg" src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/dmd-vs-sd.jpg"><br>
</p>
<p>
There's a video, too, which evocatively showcases the performance improvement. While Stable Diffusion 1.5 takes around a second and a half to distill an image on modern hardware, MIT's new DMD-based model takes around five hundredths of a second. The video allows a few images from SD 1.5 to fill in before rapidly spitting out a whole litany of pictures from the new model. Check it out:</p>

This isn't the first time people have tried to use diffusion distillation to accelerate image generation; models like Instaflow and LCM have tried the same thing as MIT's DMD with at-times <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/controversy-google-ai-image-tool-gemini">questionable results</a>. Like with most things in computing, it's a trade-off between quality and performance. MIT's new method seems to offer the best of both worlds, with a balance between speed and resolved image detail.</p><p><img height="264px" width="708px" alt="cat comparison" data-src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/cat-comparison.jpg" src="https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64189/content/cat-comparison.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p>
This also isn't the first time that people have figured out how to do diffusion in far fewer steps; notably, <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/stable-diffusion-3-announced">Stability AI itself created</a> a model called Stable Diffusion Turbo that can generate 1-megapixel images in a single diffusion step, although the results tend to be better with a few extra steps. Stable Diffusion Turbo works in a very similar manner to MIT's "DMD" approach; it uses a smaller model trained on Stable Diffusion XL output to "lead" the Turbo model toward what the full SDXL model would produce.</p>

<p>
We have to salute the efforts of developers working on AI technologies who release their work publicly. While image generators like DALL-E and <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/imagine-meta-ai-images">Meta AI's Imagine</a> can produce extremely impressive results, these groups are highly protective of their technology and jealously guard it from curious public eyes.

ARPA-H is a federal funding agency that funds transformative biomedical and health research breakthroughs, rapidly translating research from the lab to applications in the marketplace.&nbsp;</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>The Award</h2>
		<p><span>The award, part of the ARPA-H’s Novel Innovations for Tissue Regeneration in Osteoarthritis (</span><a href="https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/nitro" rel="nofollow"><span>NITRO</span></a><span>) program, will support the development of NOVAJoint, a revolutionary biocompatible, low-cost, patient-specific knee joint replacement. This high-risk project builds upon more than two decades of collaborative musculoskeletal research at Columbia in engineering and medicine, and promises to offer a transformative solution for the more than thirty million people in the U.S. who suffer from osteoarthritis. NITRO is the first Health Science Futures specific program under the new ARPA-H agency, established by the Biden Administration.</span></p>

<p><span>The project is led by</span><a href="https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/clark-hung" rel="nofollow"> <span>Clark T. Hung</span></a><span>, </span>Professor and Vice Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Professor of Orthopedic Science (in Orthopedic Surgery) at Columbia Engineering<span>, and</span><a href="https://www.columbiaortho.org/profile/nadeen-o-chahine-phd" rel="nofollow"> <span>Nadeen O.

			<h2>Impact of Osteoarthritis</h2>
		<p><span>Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is the most common type of arthritis. It gradually worsens over time as cartilage, the specialized connective tissue that covers the ends of bones, wears down, leading to pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility. Osteoarthritis is already the third most common type of disability and has an estimated economic burden of more than $136 billion per year. </span><span>It disproportionately affects women, the elderly, certain racial/ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status. </span><span>The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis has been rising due to aging of the population, increasing rates of joint injury, and, significantly, obesity.</span></p>

<p><span>The clinical gold standard treatment for knee joints ravaged by pervasive OA or traumatic injury is a total joint replacement using prosthetic implants made of metal and plastic. Although knee replacement is widely successful, there are some major drawbacks to these conventional materials. There can be life-changing complications and limitations of current artificial knee replacements, including infection, loosening, hardware failure, stiffness, abnormal kinematics (i.e., the way a knee moves), instability, and persistent pain. Historically, knee replacements have had a limited lifespan with a portion failing at 15 to 20 years due to plastic wear or implant loosening. This means that younger patients may need one or even two revision implants. The demand for total knee replacements is projected to grow by 673% -- 3.48 million procedures from 2005 to 2030 -- with total knee revisions projected to grow 601% between 2005 to 2030.&nbsp;</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>NOVAJoint — a living solution to ravaged knees</h2>
		<p><span>With the ARPA-H award, the researchers propose to design NOVAJoint to address the urgent, unmet clinical need for a permanent solution for patients with advanced OA where a conventional knee replacement is indicated. The project’s goal is to develop a replacement knee of regenerated living cartilage and bone that integrates seamlessly with the native bone and restores pain-free joint function. Since cells are required to regenerate and maintain this living implant, the team will create two versions of NOVAJoint: a version that uses patient’s own cells and one that uses donor cells. The researchers expect NOVAJoint to substantially extend the implant life, reducing complications, and to become a permanent and final procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.&nbsp; With an aggressive timeline, in the first two years, the team will create the first prototypes before moving into preclinical and clinical studies in the final three years, including a Phase 1 safety clinical trial in the final year.</span></p>

<p><span>Though the first NOVAJoint is still in development, many of the technologies and scientific discoveries necessary to create the joint have already been developed and validated by Columbia researchers through funding from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and institutional support.</span></p>

<p><span>“The ARPA-H NITRO program has enabled us to leverage our innovative technologies and expertise to solve one of the most difficult challenges in biomedical engineering,” said Hung, a groundbreaking researcher in musculoskeletal regeneration.</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>The Collaborators</h2>
		<p><span>The NOVAJoint team will fabricate a living knee replacement using modern manufacturing techniques and capitalizes on the critical mass of musculoskeletal researchers at Columbia with collective expertise in biomechanics, biomaterials, stem cells, and orthopedic surgery from across the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and College of Dental Medicine, building on a decades-long history of collaboration between the Departments of Orthopedic Surgery and Biomedical Engineering. The project team is multidisciplinary, with scientific leadership from faculty in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Orthopedic Surgery, and Dental Medicine. Co-PIs and Task Leads include Treena Arinzeh, Professor of Biomedical Engineering; Gerard Ateshian, Andrew Walz Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Professor of Biomedical Engineering;&nbsp; Alice Huang, Associate Professor of Bioengineering (in Orthopedic Surgery); and Roshan Shah, Russell A. Hibbs Associate Professor of Orthopedics (in Orthopedic Surgery) and Director of Complex Reconstruction; Chang Lee, Associate Professor of Craniofacial Engineering (in Dental Medicine).</span></p>

<p><span>Working with the Columbia team is James L. Cook, William &amp; Kathryn Allen Distinguished Chair in Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Missouri, who will lead preclinical testing. Drs. Cook and Shah will also lead the clinical trial, which will be recruiting patients at both universities. The team is partnering with New York Stem Cell Foundation and New York Blood Center for GMP manufacturing of NOVAJoint.</span></p>

<p><span>“This is a big challenge, but by creating a large and experienced team that works well together and can be focused on one goal, we expect to succeed,” said Chahine, a leader in orthopedic research. “NOVAJoint will mark a major milestone in the field of regenerative medicine and orthopedic surgery, and has the potential to revolutionize musculoskeletal treatments of the many joints that degenerate with age or injury.”</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>Equity and Commercialization</h2>
		<p><span>In addition to the advancement in science, equity and commercialization are key pillars to the programmatic success of this project. Part of NITRO’s vision is to establish a clear path to commercialization, which is a prerequisite for successful clinical translation and impact of disruptive technologies such as NOVAJoint. ARPA-H has a firm commitment to equitable healthcare access for all, irrespective of race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, geography, employment, insurance, and socioeconomic status.</span></p>

<p><span>“Our goal is to push knee replacement to its next stage of evolution and to create a better solution to osteoarthritis for all Americans. Every day patients ask me about new advancements in knee replacement surgery, hoping for validation of their years of suffering before seeking care,” says Dr. Shah.&nbsp; “Now I have something to tell them. I think the big orthopedic companies will be watching this project closely, and will be vying for the chance to commercialize NOVAJoint nationally.”</span></p>

<p><span>In order to meet these programmatic goals, the team will also be leveraging the expertise and resources of the</span><a href="https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/" rel="nofollow"> <span>Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://techventures.columbia.edu/" rel="nofollow"> <span>Columbia Technology Ventures</span></a><span>. The NOVAJoint team will include a full-time Equity Officer who will help develop key equity performance indicators. The equity officer will work closely with </span><span>Rachel C. Shelton</span><span>, Associate Professor of Sociomedical Sciences at Mailman School of Public Health and co-director of the Irving Institute’s</span><a href="https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/about-us/resources-and-cores/community-engagement-core-resource-cecr" rel="nofollow"> <span>Community Engagement Core Resource</span></a><span> (CECR) and Lisa Royse, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Missouri, to foster research conducted in partnership with community stakeholders to better inform the application of scientific findings to clinical and community settings.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">In 2016, Facebook launched a secret project designed to intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat’s app and its servers. The goal was to understand users’ behavior and help Facebook compete with Snapchat, according to newly unsealed court documents. Facebook called this “Project Ghostbusters,” in a clear reference to Snapchat’s ghost-like logo.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a federal court in California released new documents discovered as part of the class action lawsuit between consumers and Meta, Facebook’s parent company.</p>
<p>The newly released documents reveal how Meta tried to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors, including Snapchat and later Amazon and YouTube, by analyzing the network traffic of how its users were interacting with Meta’s competitors. Given these apps’ use of encryption, Facebook needed to develop special technology to get around it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24515959-facebookmeta-class-action-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One of the documents</a> details Facebook’s Project Ghostbusters. The project was part of the company’s In-App Action Panel (IAPP) program, which used a technique for “intercepting and decrypting” encrypted app traffic from users of Snapchat, and later from users of YouTube and Amazon, the consumers’ lawyers wrote in the document.</p>
<p>The document includes internal Facebook emails discussing the project.</p>
<p>“Whenever someone asks a question about Snapchat, the answer is usually that because their traffic is encrypted we have no analytics about them,” Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an email dated June 9, 2016, which was published as part of the lawsuit. “Given how quickly they’re growing, it seems important to figure out a new way to get reliable analytics about them. Perhaps we need to do panels or write custom software. You should figure out how to do this.”</p>
<p>Facebook’s engineers solution was to use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/onavo/">Onavo</a>, a VPN-like service that Facebook acquired in 2013. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/facebook-removes-onavo/">Facebook shut down Onavo</a> after a TechCrunch investigation revealed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">Facebook had been secretly paying teenagers to use Onavo</a> so the company could access all of their web activity.</p>
<p>After Zuckerberg’s email, the Onavo team took on the project and a month later proposed a solution: so-called kits that can be installed on iOS and Android that intercept traffic for specific subdomains, “allowing us to read what would otherwise be encrypted traffic so we can measure in-app usage,” read an email from July 2016. “This is a ‘man-in-the-middle’ approach.”</p>

<p>A man-in-the-middle attack — nowadays also called adversary-in-the-middle — is an attack where hackers intercept internet traffic flowing from one device to another over a network. When the network traffic is unencrypted, this type of attack allows the hackers to read the data inside, such as usernames, passwords, and other in-app activity.</p>
<p>Given that Snapchat encrypted the traffic between the app and its servers, this network analysis technique was not going to be effective. This is why Facebook engineers proposed using Onavo, which when activated had the advantage of reading all of the device’s network traffic before it got encrypted and sent over the internet.</p>
<p>“We now have the capability to measure detailed in-app activity” from “parsing snapchat [sic] analytics collected from incentivized participants in Onavo’s research program,” read another email.</p>
<p>Later, according to the court documents, Facebook expanded the program to Amazon and YouTube.</p>
<p>Inside Facebook, there wasn’t a consensus on whether Project Ghostbusters was a good idea. Some employees, including Jay Parikh, Facebook’s then-head of infrastructure engineering, and Pedro Canahuati, the then-head of security engineering, expressed their concern.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of a good argument for why this is okay. No security person is ever comfortable with this, no matter what consent we get from the general public. The general public just doesn’t know how this stuff works,” Canahuati wrote in an email, included in the court documents.</p>
<p>In 2020, Sarah Grabert and Maximilian Klein <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/12/class-action-lawsuit-against-facebook-alleges-anticompetitive-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook</a>, claiming that the company lied about its data collection activities and exploited the data it “deceptively extracted” from users to identify competitors and then unfairly fight against these new companies.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>Google, Meta, and Snap did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>In the small Appalachian city of Bristol, Virginia, City Council member Neal Osborne left a meeting on the morning of Jan. 3 and rushed himself to the hospital.</p>







<p>Osborne, 36, has Type 1 diabetes. His insulin pump had malfunctioned, and without a steady supply of this essential hormone, Osborne’s blood sugar skyrocketed and his body was shutting down.</p>



<p>Osborne went to the nearest hospital, Bristol Regional Medical Center. He said he settled into a wheelchair in the emergency room waiting area, where over the next few hours he drifted in and out of consciousness and retched up vomit, then bile, then blood. After 12 hours in the waiting room, Osborne said, he was moved to an ER bed, where he stayed until he was sent to the intensive care unit the next day. In total, the council member was in the ER for about 30 hours, he said.</p>



<p>Osborne said his ordeal echoes stories he’s heard from constituents for years. In his next crisis, Osborne said, he plans to leave Bristol for an ER about two hours away.</p>



<p>“I want to go to Knoxville or I want to go to Roanoke, because I do not want to further risk my life and die at a Ballad hospital,” he said. “The wait times just to get in and see a doctor in the ER have grown exponentially.”</p>



<p>Ballad Health, a 20-hospital system in the Tri-Cities region of Tennessee and Virginia, benefits from the <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/">largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly</a> in the United States. In the six years since lawmakers in both states waived anti-monopoly laws and Ballad was formed, ER visits for patients sick enough to be hospitalized grew more than three times as long and now far exceed the criteria set by state officials, according to <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/health/health-program-areas/health-planning/certificate-of-public-advantage/redir-copa/copa-reports.html">Ballad reports</a> released by the Tennessee Department of Health.</p>












<p>Tennessee and Virginia have so far announced no steps to reduce time spent in Ballad ERs. The Tennessee health department, which has a more direct role in regulating Ballad, has each year issued a report saying the agreement that gave Ballad a monopoly “continues to provide a Public Advantage.” Department officials have twice declined to comment to KFF Health News on Ballad’s performance.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480905-ballad_health_fy23_copa_reports">Ballad’s latest annual report</a>, which was released this month and spans from July 2022 to June 2023, the median time that patients spend in Ballad ERs before being admitted to the hospital is nearly 11 hours. This statistic includes both time spent waiting and time being treated in the ER and excludes patients who weren’t admitted or left the ER without receiving care.</p>



<p>The federal government once tracked ER speed the same way. When compared against the latest <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/archived-data/hospitals">corresponding federal data</a> from 2019, which includes more than 4,000 hospitals but predates the covid-19 pandemic, Ballad ranks among the 100 hospitals with the slowest ERs. More current federal data is not available because the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services retired this statistic in 2020 in favor of other measurements.</p>



<p>Newer data tells a similar story. The Joint Commission, a nonprofit that accredits health care organizations, collected this same measurement for 2022 from about 250 hospitals that volunteered the data, finding a median ER speed of five hours and 41 minutes — or about five hours faster than Ballad’s latest annual report.</p>



<p>Ballad Health spokesperson Molly Luton said in an email statement that, by holding patients in the ER, where they are observed while waiting for a bed, Ballad avoids “overwhelming” its staff. Luton said ER delays are also caused by two nationwide crises: a nursing shortage and fewer admissions at nursing homes and similar facilities, which can create a backlog of patients awaiting discharge from the hospital.</p>



<p>Luton added that Ballad’s ER time for admitted patients has dropped to about 7½ hours in the months since the company’s latest annual report.</p>



<p>“On those issues Ballad Health can directly control, our performance has rebounded from 2022, and is now among the best in the nation,” Luton said.</p>



<p>Luton also noted that Ballad performs better than or close to the national average on several other measurements of ER performance, including having fewer patients who leave without being treated. CMS data shows the national average is about 3%. Ballad reported 1.4% in its latest annual report.</p>



<p>Osborne, the Bristol council member, attributed this statistic to Ballad’s monopoly.</p>



<p>“Just because they aren’t leaving the ER doesn’t mean they are happy where they are,” he said. “It just means they don’t have anywhere else they could be.”</p>

<p><strong>Ballad’s Big Monopoly</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Ballad Health was formed in 2018 after state officials approved the nation’s biggest hospital merger based on a so-called Certificate of Public Advantage, or COPA, agreement. COPAs have been used in about 10 hospital mergers over the past three decades, but none has involved as many hospitals as Ballad’s.</p>



<p>State lawmakers in Tennessee and Virginia waived federal anti-monopoly laws so rival hospital systems — Mountain States Health Alliance and Wellmont Health System — could merge into a single company with no competition. Ballad is now the only option for hospital care for most of about 1.1 million residents in a 29-county region at the nexus of Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission warns that hospital monopolies lead to increased prices and decreased quality of care. To offset the perils of Ballad’s monopoly, officials required the new company to commit to a long list of special conditions, including dozens of quality-care metrics spelled out with specific benchmarks.</p>



<p>In its latest annual report, Ballad improved on many quality-of-care metrics over the prior year, including several that the company prioritized, but still fell short on 56 of 75 benchmarks.</p>



<p>ER time for admitted patients is one of those. The benchmark was set at three hours and 47 minutes in the original COPA agreement. Ballad met or nearly met this goal for three years, according to its annual reports. Then the ERs slowed.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480925-fy21-ballad-health-copa-annual-report">2022</a>, Ballad reported a median ER time for admitted patients of about six hours.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480923-ballad-health-fy22-copa">2023</a>, it reported the same statistic at seven hours and 40 minutes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480905-ballad_health_fy23_copa_reports">the latest report</a>, ER time for admitted patients had reached 10 hours and 45 minutes.</p>



<p>CMS, which grades thousands of hospitals nationwide, <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/hospitals/timely-effective-care#emergency-department-care">warns on its website</a> that timely ER care is “essential for good patient outcomes,” and that more time spent in the ER has been linked to higher complication rates and delays in patients getting pain medication and antibiotics.</p>



<p>Ben Harder, chief of health analysis for U.S. News &amp; World Report, said extensive ER times can be a symptom of slowdowns throughout a hospital, including in the operating room.</p>



<p>“A long delay in getting patients admitted is both a risk in itself, in that a test may not get conducted as promptly,” Harder said. “But it’s also an indication that the hospital is backed up, and that there are problems getting patients moved from one unit to another.”</p>



<p>Bill Christian, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health, said Ballad’s rising ER times had been “noted” but did not say if the agency had taken or was considering any action. Christian directed questions about Ballad’s latest stats to the company itself.</p>



<p><strong>‘A Nightmare for Community Members’</strong></p>



<p>Ballad has also fallen short — by about $191 million over the past five years — of its obligation to Tennessee to provide charity care, which is free or discounted care for low-income patients, according to health department documents and Ballad’s latest report. The health department <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23929508-ballad-health-charity-care-waiver-letters">waived this obligation</a> in each of the past four fiscal years. Ballad has said it would ask for another this year.</p>



<p>In a two-hour interview last year, Ballad CEO Alan Levine defended his company and said that because the Tri-Cities region could not support two competing hospital companies, the COPA merger had likely prevented at least three hospital closures. Levine attributed Ballad’s failure to meet quality benchmarks to the pressure of the covid pandemic and said charity care shortfalls were partly caused by Medicaid changes beyond Ballad’s control.</p>



<p>“Our critics say, ‘No Ballad. We don’t want Ballad.’ Well, then what?” Levine said. “Because the hospitals were on their way to being closed.”</p>



<p>Some residents see Ballad as a savior. John King, who runs a physical therapy clinic in the core of Ballad’s region, said at a <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/COPA-meeting-TRANSCRIPT-6-12-23.pdf">public hearing last June</a> that in multiple visits to Ballad ERs, including one for a stroke, he found their care to be quick and compassionate.</p>



<p>“If it weren’t for Ballad Health, I literally would not be here today,” King said, according to a hearing transcript.</p>



<p>Ballad’s failures to live up to the terms of the COPA agreement were detailed in a <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/">KFF Health News investigation</a> last September, and the company faced a new wave of criticism in the months that followed.</p>



<p>Local leaders in Carter County, Tennessee, in October debated but did not pass a resolution calling for Ballad to be better regulated or broken up. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, said in an <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/06/tenn-attorney-general-urges-close-look-at-ballad-health-operations-amid-community-concerns-over-monopoly-deal/">interview with the Tennessee Lookout</a> published in November that Ballad must be constantly monitored in light of community complaints. Earlier this month, Tennessee state Rep. David Hawk (R-Greeneville), who represents a region within Ballad’s monopoly, called for Levine’s resignation, according to wjhl.com.</p>



<p>In response, Ballad Health said in a statement it has “strong relationships with the majority of elected officials” in Carter County and welcomed scrutiny from the Tennessee attorney general. Ballad said Hawk’s “opinion certainly does not reflect our broader relationships” within the area. Tennessee lawmakers are also considering legislation to <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB2600&amp;ga=113">forbid future COPA mergers</a> in the state, which Ballad said “risks putting more hospitals at risk for closure.”</p>



<p>The bill was introduced by state Sen. Heidi Campbell (D-Nashville) and state Rep. Gloria Johnson (D-Knoxville), who is running for the U.S. Senate. Johnson said the bill would end Ballad’s protection from antitrust laws.</p>



<p>“It’s just been a nightmare for community members out there,” Johnson said. “And they have no other option.”</p>

Turns out SOMEBODY has to wrangle atoms in the real biological world and that’s me!</p><p>After almost a year of work I finally smoothed out all the kinks in the process, so can now go from a design to synthetic DNA in a cell in about a week (not counting oligo pool synthesis time). I can do about 600,000bp per week, which is large enough to synthesize the smallest bacterial genome (each week), tho I only do about 1000bp fragments. I’m also completely bootstrapped and self funded, and only get help from my several opentrons robots

A lot of it centers around creating good corporate governance and a reason for either me (or someone else) to stay interested (careful incentive design). This is obviously antithetical to the typical scale-up strategy of a tech company, and the financials are very similar to an insurance company. It's also why there is no free plan in the pricing.<p>In terms of convincing, for the technically-minded, I have a public disaster recovery plan, a public business continuity plan, and "escape hatches" for "common" events -- war, subpoenas, changes in law, a post-RSA future, etc. The goal is to cover as many events as possible, including the very improbable (like AWS losing a whole AZ!). The backing clouds are Microsoft Files and AWS S3, both with excellent track records and absurdly good durability. There is some special caching in front to minimize cost.</p><p>For the less technically-minded, there are no good alternatives. Self-hosted data is difficult to geographically distribute (and if you do it's difficult to update true cold storage). Cloud services have a very high lifetime cost, and unclear rules around data distribution to next of kin. Other methods, like burying some vacuum sealed MDISCs in a freezer, are not realistic.</p><p>I am of the opinion that while it is impossible to predict the future, it is possible to plan for it.

After trading them successfully with my own capital for more than a year, I launched <a href="https://grizzlybulls.com/" rel="nofollow">https://grizzlybulls.com</a> as an alternative to the traditional hedge fund monetization path.<p>Since launching in January 2022, we've significantly outperformed the market with lower volatility and reduced max drawdown:</p><p>Model - Return - Max drawdown</p><p>S&amp;P 500 (benchmark):       +9.91%      -27.56%</p><p>Platinum:              +45.34%      -16.48%</p><p>Gold:                      +39.53%      -19.12%</p><p>Silver:                      +17.24%      -22.96%</p><p>Bronze:                      +14.12%      -23.93%</p><p>Vix Basic:               +9.81%      -24.23%</p><p>TA - Mean Reversion:      +17.77%      -19.92%</p><p>TA - Trend:              +17.29%      -24.98%</p><p>This is an unleveraged, apples to apples comparison. These are not high frequency trading models. Most of them only make a trade every 2-4 weeks on average. During long signals, the models are simply long the S&amp;P 500 and during short signals, they go to cash. This can be implemented very tax efficiently by holding a core ETF long position that never gets sold and then selling S&amp;P 500 futures (ES or MES) of equal value to the ETFs against the long position. This way your account will accumulate unrealized capital gains indefinitely and you'll only pay tax on the net result of successful hedging. The cherry on top is that the S&amp;P 500 futures are section 1256 contracts that are taxed at 60% long term / 40% short term capital gains rates regardless of the duration they are held.</p><p>The models use a variety of indicators, many of them custom built. Most important are various VIX metrics (absolute level, VIX futures curve shape/slope, divergences against S&amp;P 500 price, etc), trend-following TA metrics (MACD, EMV, etc), mean-reversion TA metrics (Bollinger Bands, CMO, etc), macroeconomic (unemployment, housing starts, leading composite), and monetary policy (yield curve inversion, equity risk premium, dot plot, etc). They've been backtested very cautiously to avoid overfitting.

You can design another template like Supplements with metrics for specific dosages, for example.

This is useful for creating charts quickly, or using them in places that don't support dynamic charting (email, SMS, various app plugins, etc).<p>I messed around with some AI features, mostly just for fun and to see if they could help users onboard.

                  <p><span>One reliable way to convince customers is to provide emergency notes with a fixed expiration date of a maximum of 1 year from the time the note was written. After 1 year, customers are, in a way, forced to create a new emergency note, and at the same time, they can verify if anything is going to change soon on the platform (e.g. upcoming shutdown). This would also help to keep the emergency note’s content always up-to-date. When you sign up for car insurance, you do so for a maximum of 1 year, as prices and coverages may change.</span></p></div></td></tr>

But it would be quite a task to make the UX good in the case of runtime errors etc.<p>It was a while since I had a look on how the plugin system works in Wordpress. I should read up on that.

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re Jack and Finn from Aqua Voice (<a href="https://www.withaqua.com/">https://www.withaqua.com/</a>). Aqua is a voice-native document editor that combines reliable dictation and natural language commands, letting you say things like: “make this a list” or “it’s Erin with an E” or “add an inline citation here for page 86 of this book”. Here is a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM</a>.</p><p>Finn, who is big-time dyslexic, has been using dictation software since the sixth grade when his dad set him up on Dragon Dictation. He used it through school to write papers, and has been keeping his own transcription benchmarks since college. All that time, writing with your voice has remained a cumbersome and brittle experience that is riddled with painpoints.</p><p>Dictation software is still terrible. All the solutions basically compete on accuracy (i.e. speech recognition), but none of them deal with the fundamentally brittle nature of the text that they generate. They don't try to format text correctly and require you to learn a bunch of specialized commands, which often are not worth it. They're not even close to a voice replacement for a keyboard.</p><p>Even post LLM, you are limited to a set of specific commands and the most accurate models don’t have any commands. Outside of these rules, the models have no sense for what is an instruction and what is content. You can’t say “and format this like an email” or “make the last bullet point shorter”. Aqua solves this.</p><p>This problem is important to Finn and millions of other people who would write with their voice if they could. Initially, we didn't think of it as a startup project. It was just something we wanted for ourselves. We thought maybe we'd write a novel with it - or something. After friends started asking to use the early versions of Aqua, it occurred to us that, if we didn't build it, maybe nobody would.</p><p>Aqua Voice is a text editor that you talk to like a person. Depending on the way that you say it and the context in which you're operating, Aqua decides whether to transcribe what you said verbatim, execute a command, or subtly modify what you said into what you meant to write.</p><p>For example, if you were to dictate: "Gryphons have classic forms resembling shield volcanoes," Aqua would output your text verbatim. But if you stumble over your words or start a sentence over a few times, Aqua is smart enough to figure that out and to only take the last version of the sentence.</p><p>The vision is not only to provide a more natural dictation experience, but to enable for the first time an AI-writing experience that feels natural and collaborative. This requires moving away from using LLMs for one-off chat requests and towards something that is more like streaming where you are in constant contact with the model. Voice is the natural medium for this.</p><p>Aqua is actually 6 models working together to transcribe, interpret, and rewrite the document according to your intent. Technically, executing a real-time voice application with a language model at its core requires complex coordination between multiple pieces. We use MoE transcription to outperform what was previously thought possible in terms of real-time accuracy. Then we sync up with a language model to determine what should be on the screen as quickly as possible.</p><p>The model isn't perfect, but it is ready for early adopters and we’ve already been getting feedback from grateful users. For example, a historian with carpal tunnel sent us an email he wrote using Aqua and said that he is now able to be five times as productive as he was previously. We've heard from other people with disabilities that prevent them from typing. We've also seen good adoption from people who are dyslexic or simply prefer talking to typing. It’s being used for everything from emails to brainstorming to papers to legal briefings.</p><p>While there is much left to do in terms of latency and robustness, the best experiences with Aqua are beginning to feel magical. We would love for you to try it out and give us feedback, which you can do with no account on <a href="https://withaqua.com/">https://withaqua.com</a>. If you find it useful, it’s $10/month after a 1000-token free trial. (We want to bump the free trial in the future, but we're a small team, and running this thing isn’t cheap.)</p><p>We’d love to hear your ideas and comments with voice-to-text!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<p dir="auto">A full write-up of the exploit - including background information and loads of useful diagrams - can be found in the <a href="https://pwning.tech/nftables/" rel="nofollow">Flipping Pages blogpost</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Affected versions</h2><a id="user-content-affected-versions" aria-label="Permalink: Affected versions" href="#affected-versions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The exploit affects versions from (including) v5.14 to (including) v6.6, excluding patched branches v5.15.149&gt;, v6.1.76&gt;, v6.6.15&gt;. The patch for these versions were released in feb 2024. The underlying vulnerability affects all versions (excluding patched stable branches) from v3.15 to v6.8-rc1.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The exploit does not work v6.4&gt; kernels with kconfig <code>CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y</code> (including Ubuntu v6.5)</li>
<li>The exploits requires user namespaces (kconfig <code>CONFIG_USER_NS=y</code>), that those user namespaces are unprivileged (sh command <code>sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone</code> = 1), and that nf_tables is enabled (kconfig <code>CONFIG_NF_TABLES=y</code>). By default, these are all enabled on Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF. Other distro's have not been tested, but may work as well.</li>
<li>The exploit may be unstable on systems with a lot of network activity
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Systems with WiFi adapter, when surrounded by high-usage WiFi networks, will be very unstable.</li>
<li>On test devices, please turn off WiFi adapters through BIOS.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h3><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The default values should work out of the box on Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF with a local shell. On non-tested setups/distros, please make sure the kconfig values match with the target kernel. These can be specified in <a href="https://github.com/Notselwyn/CVE-2024-1086/blob/main/src/config.h"><code>src/config.h</code></a>. If you are running the exploit on a machine with more than 32GiB physical memory, make sure to increase <code>CONFIG_PHYS_MEM</code>.
If you are running the exploit over SSH (into the test machine) or a reverse shell, you may want to toggle <code>CONFIG_REDIRECT_LOG</code> to <code>1</code> to avoid unnecessary network activity.</p>

<p>Originally released in 1986 by Geoff Crammond, The Sentinel, also known as The Sentry in the United States, was a pioneer in 3D graphics for home computers. It quickly became one of the highest rated games on the&nbsp;BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.</p><div uk-scrollspy-class=""><p>In the annals of video game history, certain titles stand out for their innovative gameplay, groundbreaking graphics, or compelling narratives. Among these is the 1986 game "The Sentinel", published as "The Senty" in the USA.</p>
<p>Developed by Geoff Crammond, a British game designer renowned for his work on the Grand Prix series, The Sentinel pushed the boundaries of what was possible on home computers at the time, offering a unique blend of strategy, atmosphere and tension that captivated players and critics alike.</p>
<p>For its time, The Sentinel was a revolutionary game. It was one of the first games to use solid 3D polygon graphics on home computers, a significant leap forward in an era when most games were text based, using 2D sprites.</p>
<p>Geoff developed a technique where rather than rendering a complete view in real time - impossible on&nbsp;8-bit hardware - the camera would rotate a number of degrees at set intervals. The edge portion of the screen would be rendered as it came into view.</p>
<p>This mechanic was built into the game play and for the first time on home computers allowed for a truly immersive 3D gaming experience.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Tuesday, March 26, 2024
  

  </p><p>You're probably familiar with tech debt.  There is a joke that if there is
tech debt, surely there must be derivatives to work with that debt?  I'm
happy to say that the Rust ecosystem has created an environment where it
looks like one solution for tech debt is collateralization.</p>
<p>Here is how this miracle works.  Say you have a library <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta">stuff</a> which depends on some other
library <a href="https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust">learned-rust-this-way</a>.
The author of <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> at one point lost interest in this
thing and issues keep piling up.  Some of those issues are feature
requests, others are legitimate bugs.  However you as the person that
wrote <cite>stuff</cite> never ran into any of those problems.  Yet it's hard to
argue that <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> isn't tech debt.  It's one that does
not bother you all that much, but it's debt nonetheless.</p>
<p>At one point someone else figures out that <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> is debt.
One of the ways in which this happens is because the name is great.
Clearly that's not the only person that learned Rust this way and someone
else also wants that name.  Except the original author is unreachable.  So
now there is one more reason for that package <a href="https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/1921">to get added to the RUSTSEC
database</a> and all
the sudden all hell breaks lose.  Within minutes CI will start failing for
a lot of people that directly or indirectly use <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite>
notifying them that something happened.  That's because <cite>RUSTSEC</cite> is
basically a rating agency and they decided that your debt is now junk.</p>
<p>What happens next?  As the maintainer of <cite>stuff</cite> your users all the sudden
start calling you out for using <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> and you suffer.
Stress levels increase.  You gotta unload that shit.  Why?  Not because it
does not work for you, but someone called you out of that debt.  If we
really want to stress the financial terms this is your margin call.  Your
users demand action to deal with your debt.</p>
<p>So what can you do?  One option is to move to alternatives (unload the
debt).  In this particular case for whatever reason all the alternatives
to <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> are not looking very appealing either.  One is
a fork of that thing which also only has a single maintained, but all the
sudden pulls in 3 more dependencies, one of which already have a "B-"
rating.  Another option in the ecosystem just decided <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/commit/3ba8462f7d3b603d832e0daeb6cfc7168a673d7a">to default</a>
before they are called out.</p>
<p>Remember you never touched <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> actively.  It worked
for you in the unmaintained way of the last four years.  If you now fork
that library (and name it <cite>learned-rust-this-way-and-its-okay</cite>) you are
now subject to the same demands.  Forking that library is putting cash on
the pile of debt.  Except if you don't act up on the bug reports there,
you will eventually be called out like <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> was.  So
while that might buy you time, it does not really solve the issue.</p>
<p>However here is what actually does work: you just merge that code into
your own library.  Now that junk tech debt is suddenly rated “AAA”.  For
as long as you never touch that code any more, you never reveal to anyone
that you did that, and you just keep maintaining your library like you did
before, the world keeps spinning on.</p>
<p>So as of today: I collateralized <cite>yaml-rust</cite> by vendoring it in <cite>insta</cite>.
It's now an amalgamation of insta code and yaml-rust.  And by doing so, I
successfully upgraded this junk tech debt to a perfect AAA.</p>
<p>Who won?  I think nobody really.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Web-based design platform Canva has acquired the <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/">Affinity creative software suite</a>, positioning itself as a challenger to Adobe’s grip over the digital design industry. Canva <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Faffinity%2F">announced the deal on Tuesday</a>, which gives the company ownership over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23448945/affinity-version-2-adobe-creative-app-features-price">Affinity Designer, Photo, and Publisher</a> — three popular creative applications for Windows, Mac, and iPad that provide similar features to Adobe’s Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign software, respectively.</p><p>Official figures for the deal have not been revealed, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/canva-acquires-affinity-design-suite-in-push-to-rival-adobe?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports that it’s valued at “several hundred million [British] pounds.” Nevertheless, the acquisition makes sense as the Australian-based company tries to attract more creative professionals. As of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fcanva-us-growth%2F">January this year</a>, Canva’s design platform attracted around 170 million monthly global users. That’s a <em>lot </em>of people who probably aren’t using equivalent Adobe software like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/16/23834146/adobe-express-firefly-generative-ai-release-design-app">Express</a>, but unlike Adobe, Canva doesn’t have its own design applications that target creative professionals like illustrators, photographers, and video editors.&nbsp;</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A screenshot of Affinity Designer 2 with a colorful boardwalk." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/376x235/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/384x240/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/415x259/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/480x300/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/540x338/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/640x400/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/750x469/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/828x518/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1080x675/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1200x750/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1440x900/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1920x1200/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/2048x1280/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/2400x1500/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/2400x1500/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Affinity Designer 2 (pictured) is a vector-based application similar to Adobe Illustrator.

The decision to make its Affinity applications a one-time-purchase with no ongoing subscription fees has earned it a loyal fanbase, especially with creatives who are actively looking for alternatives to Adobe’s subscription-based design ecosystem.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/canva-has-designs-on-the-pros-following-its-largest-ever-acquisition-20240325-p5fezk.html"><em>Sydney Morning Herald</em></a>, Canva co-founder Cameron Adams said that Affinity applications will remain separate from Canva’s platform, but that some small integrations should be expected over time. “Our product teams have already started chatting and we have some immediate plans for lightweight integration, but we think the products themselves will always be separate,” said Adams.</p><p>With Affinity and its 90 UK-based employees now on board, Canva has more opportunities to compete with Adobe across the wider creative software market. And given how attractive Canva’s simplicity-focused platform already is to creatives, it might have a real chance of luring away professionals who are tired of filling Adobe’s pockets.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Julian Assange has been handed a reprieve in his fight against extradition to the US after two judges ruled the WikiLeaks founder could take his case to an appeal hearing – but only if the Biden administration is unable to provide the court with suitable assurances.</p><p>The president of the king’s bench division, Victoria Sharp, and Mr Justice Johnson said Assange had real prospects of success on three of the nine grounds argued, but adjourned the leave to appeal application to give the US government three weeks to provide reassurance on the relevant matters.</p><p>If Assange had been denied permission to appeal he could have been extradited within days to face espionage charges. While the judges’ decision means he avoids that fate it leaves him facing a further wait, with his future still unresolved.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/assange-v-government-of-the-united-states-of-america-3/" data-link-name="in body link">a written judgment</a>, handed down on Tuesday morning, Sharp said the concerns that had real prospects of success at appeal but which “may be capable of being addressed by assurances” were “that the applicant [Assange] is permitted to rely on the first amendment, that the applicant is not prejudiced at trial, including sentence, by reason of his nationality, that he is afforded the same first amendment protections as a United States citizen, and that the death penalty is not imposed”.</p><p>At a two-day hearing last month, which Assange was too unwell to attend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/20/julian-assange-risks-flagrant-denial-of-justice-if-tried-in-us-london-court-told" data-link-name="in body link">his lawyers argued</a> that he faced a “flagrant denial of justice” if extradited to the US to face charges relating to the publication by Assange and WikiLeaks of thousands of classified and diplomatic documents they said had exposed torture, rendition, extrajudicial killings and war crimes.</p><p>His wife, Stella Assange, expressed dismay at the judges’ decision. “What the courts have done has been to invite a political intervention from the United States … send a letter saying ‘its all OK’,” she said. “I find this astounding.</p><p>“This case is a retribution. It is a signal to all of you that if you expose the interests that are driving war they will come after you, they will put you in prison and will try to kill you.</p><p>“The Biden administration should not issue assurances. They should drop this shameful case that should never have been brought.”</p><p>Ahead of the decision there had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/20/julian-assange-wikileaks-plea-deal" data-link-name="in body link">reports that the US government was considering a plea deal offer</a> to Assange, allowing him to admit to a misdemeanour, which would enable him to walk free from prison in the UK but his lawyers said they had been “given no indication” Washington intended to change its approach.</p><p>Sharp stated in Tuesday’s 66-page judgment that the UK home secretary’s lawyer had accepted that there was nothing in place to prevent Assange being charged in the US with an offence that carried the death penalty and it then being imposed.</p><p>She cited as evidence of such a risk “the calls for the imposition of the death penalty by leading politicians and other public figures; the fact that the [UK-US extradition] treaty does not preclude extradition for death penalty charges, and the fact that the existing assurance does not explicitly cover the death penalty”.</p><p>On free speech protections under the first amendment in the US, Sharp said: “He [Assange] contends that if he is given first amendment rights, the prosecution will be stopped. The first amendment is therefore of central importance to his defence to the extradition charge. Further, if he is convicted, he may wish to invoke the first amendment on the question of sentence. If he is not permitted to rely on the first amendment because of his status as a foreign national, he will thereby be prejudiced – potentially very greatly prejudiced – by reason of his nationality.”</p><p>The US has been given until 16 April to file its assurances. If it does not do so, leave to appeal will be granted. If it does provide assurances by that date the parties will be invited to file further written submissions on the issue of leave to appeal with another hearing provisionally listed for 20 May.</p><p>Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, welcomed the “temporary reprieve” but called on the US to pursue a plea deal.</p><p>“The conditionality around the grounds of appeal, which are contingent on the examination of US government assurances that he will not face the death penalty and has the right to free speech, mean the risks to Assange and press freedom remain stark,” she said.</p></div></div>]]></description>
