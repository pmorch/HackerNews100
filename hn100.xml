            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/new-york-disbars-infamous-copyright-troll/">https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/new-york-disbars-infamous-copyright-troll/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39710455">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-post-content">
<p><img src="https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/03/iStock-484137638-300x200.jpg" alt="Dictionary Series – Ethics" width="300" height="200">For years, Richard Liebowitz ran a very successful operation mostly sending threatening letters to companies claiming that they had infringed upon copyrights held by his photographer clients. Under the best of circumstances it’s a niche practice area that’s… <em>kinda shady</em>. But Liebowitz gained a degree of infamy across a number of matters for high-profile missteps in cases that sparked the ire of federal judges. Now, finally, <a href="https://nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2024/2024_01309.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York has disbarred him</a>.</p>
<p>Liebowitz wasn’t alone in the copyright trolling practice. A number of entities scour the internet looking for photographs that they can claim are “unlicensed” and demanding thousands of dollars to settle the matter knowing that between statutory damages for copyright infringement and the cost of litigation, most companies will just pay it. Many times, the photo in question actually is legally licensed through an agency like Getty Images, but the plaintiff photographer has, for whatever reason, pulled the image since the license was granted.</p>
<p>This runs the risk that some plaintiff might do this on purpose hoping to catch some legal licenseholder unawares and bank on the target just settling to avoid bringing any lawyers into the situation. Which is why, for example,&nbsp;a judge in one case cited by the disbarment opinion ordered Liebowitz “produce to the defendant records sufficient to show the royalty paid the last three times that the picture at issue was licensed, and the number of times the picture was licensed in the last five years; if the picture was never licensed, the plaintiff was to certify that fact as part of the plaintiff’s production.” In this case, Liebowitz “did not timely produce the required royalty information to the defendant” per the disbarment opinion.</p>
<p>Though most of the opinion describes more fundamental case management problems. From a case brought in 2017:</p>
<blockquote><p>The respondent stated under penalty of perjury that he did not and had never made a settlement demand in this matter. In fact, the respondent had sent the defendant’s counsel an email in which the respondent proposed settling the matter for the sum of $25,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>And another case brought in 2017:</p>
<blockquote><p>On January 13, 2018, the respondent submitted a letter (hereinafter the January 13, 2018 letter) to the District Court, requesting an adjournment of the pretrial conference scheduled for January 19, 2018, and stating that the defendant “had yet to respond to the complaint” and that the plaintiff intended to file a motion for a default judgment. Judge Cote granted the request and ordered the motion for entry of default due on January 26, 2018.</p>
<p>The respondent’s statement in his January 13, 2018 letter that the defendant “had yet to respond to the complaint” was false and misleading, and the respondent knew that it was false and misleading when he made it. The January 13, 2018 letter failed to advise the court of the months-long history of communication between the parties, beginning in July 2017, as mentioned above.</p></blockquote>
<p>From yet another matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>The plaintiff admitted in a deposition and in other documents that the Photograph had been previously published on numerous occasions. To prevent the defendants from learning that the plaintiff did not hold a valid registration, the respondent stonewalled the defendants’ requests for documents and information. The respondent also failed to comply with an order by Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman to obtain and produce Copyright Office documents to demonstrate a valid registration. After it came to light that the Photograph was not registered, and despite the record stating otherwise, the respondent argued, without evidence, that the lack of registration was merely a mistake.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there’s a lesson to take away from these and the many, many more examples included in the opinion, it’s that copyright trolling outfits are largely unprepared for someone to push back on their demands. Firing off demand letters, memorializing boilerplate licensing agreements, and collecting cash is a tidy business model right up until a firm has to juggle hearings and discovery requests and experts and “not committing perjury.”</p>
<p>But perhaps the most bizarre story involves Liebowitz missing an April 12, 2019 hearing, explaining that his grandfather had passed. When Judge Seibel directed Liebowitz under penalty of contempt to furnish evidence or documentation regarding the date of his grandfather’s death, Liebowitz shot back that the order “likely constitutes a usurpation of judicial authority or a breach of judicial decorum.”</p>
<blockquote><p>On November 7, 2019, the respondent retained counsel to represent him in the contempt proceedings, and on November 11, 2019, the respondent sent a letter to Judge Seibel admitting that he failed to carry out his responsibilities to the District Court and to his adversary. The respondent also admitted that his grandfather died on April 9, 2019, and was buried that same day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just. Wow. You know, “my grandfather died this week” is something you can tell a court <em>before</em> a hearing and they’ll probably grant it. <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/pregnant-dont-plan-on-practicing-before-ohios-supreme-court-any-time-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s not like you’re asking to give birth or anything</a>. But to lie about it to the court and then keep doubling down is… a choice.</p>
<p>And a poor one as it turns out:</p>
<blockquote><p>ORDERED that pursuant to 22 NYCRR 1240.13, the respondent, Richard P. Liebowitz, a suspended attorney, is disbarred, effective immediately, and his name is stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law….</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the J. Paul Get­ty Muse­um <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2013/08/the-getty-puts-4600-art-images-into-the-public-domain.html">launched its Open Con­tent pro­gram back in 2013</a>, we’ve been fea­tur­ing their efforts to&nbsp;make their vast col­lec­tion of cul­tur­al arti­facts freely acces­si­ble online. They’ve released not just dig­i­tized works of art, but also a great many <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2016/06/enjoy-100000-free-art-art-history-texts-courtesy-of-the-getty-research-portal.html">art his­to­ry texts</a> and <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2016/06/enjoy-100000-free-art-art-history-texts-courtesy-of-the-getty-research-portal.html">art books in gen­er­al</a>. Just this week, they announced an expan­sion of access to their dig­i­tal archive, in that they’ve made near­ly 88,000 images free to down­load on their <a href="https://newsletters.getty.edu/t/t-l-eyhxty-tltjujtrih-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsletters.getty.edu/t/t-l-eyhxty-tltjujtrih-r/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709952228434000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3D3T98bAbjSN30Dt8L1t4o">Open Con­tent</a>&nbsp;data­base under&nbsp;<a href="https://newsletters.getty.edu/t/t-l-eyhxty-tltjujtrih-y/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://newsletters.getty.edu/t/t-l-eyhxty-tltjujtrih-y/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709952228434000&amp;usg=AOvVaw22gWg7B6gaFWK4wfpyrGsj">Cre­ative Com­mons Zero (CC0)</a>.

<p>The Get­ty sug­gests that you “add a print of your favorite Dutch still life to your gallery wall or cre­ate a show­er cur­tain using the <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103JNH"><em>Iris­es</em></a> by Van Gogh.” But if you <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/search?open_content=true">search the open con­tent in their archive your­self</a>, you can sure­ly get much more cre­ative than that.</p>


<p>The por­tal’s inter­face lets you search by cre­ation date (with a time­line graph stretch­ing back to the year 6000 BC), medi­um (from agate and alabaster to wood­cut and zinc), object type (includ­ing paint­ings, pho­tographs, and sculp­tures, of course, but also akro­te­ria, horse trap­pings, and tweez­ers), and cul­ture. The selec­tion reflects the wide man­date of the Get­ty’s col­lec­tion, which encom­pass­es as many of the civ­i­liza­tions of the world as it does the eras of human his­to­ry.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p>I searched GitHub using the keywords <code>gpt</code>, <code>llm</code>, and <code>generative ai</code>. If AI feels so overwhelming right now, it’s because it is. There are 118K results for <code>gpt</code> alone.</p>

<p>To make my life easier, I limited my search to the repos with at least 500 stars. There were 590 results for <code>llm</code>, 531 for <code>gpt</code>, and 38 for <code>generative ai</code>. I also occasionally checked GitHub trending and social media for new repos.</p>

<p>After MANY hours, I found 896 repos. Of these, 51 are tutorials (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide">dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide</a>) and aggregated lists (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts">f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts</a>). While these tutorials and lists are helpful, I’m more interested in software. I still include them in the final list, but the analysis is done with the 845 software repositories.</p>

<p>It was a painful but rewarding process. It gave me a much better understanding of what people are working on, how incredibly collaborative the open source community is, and just how much China’s open source ecosystem diverges from the Western one.</p>

<h3 id="add_missing_repos">Add missing repos</h3>

<p>I undoubtedly missed a ton of repos. You can submit the missing repos <a href="https://forms.gle/1ijNSnizgWQaVYK16">here</a>. The list will be automatically updated every day.</p>

<p>Feel free to submit the repos with less than 500 stars. I’ll continue tracking them and add them to the list when they reach 500 stars!</p>

<h2 id="the_new_ai_stack">The New AI Stack</h2>

<p>I think of the AI stack as consisting of 4 layers: infrastructure, model development, application development, and applications.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Generative AI Stack" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/1-ai-stack.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>

    <p>At the bottom is the stack is infrastructure, which includes toolings for serving (<a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vllm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server">NVIDIA’s Triton</a>), compute management (<a href="https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot">skypilot</a>), vector search and database (<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">faiss</a>, <a href="https://milvus.io/">milvus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant">qdrant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb">lancedb</a>), ….</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Model development</strong></p>

    <p>This layer provides toolings for developing models, including frameworks for modeling &amp; training (transformers, pytorch, DeepSpeed), inference optimization (ggml, openai/triton), dataset engineering, evaluation, ….. Anything that involves changing a model’s weights happens in this layer, including finetuning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application development</strong>
 With readily available models, anyone can develop applications on top of them. This is the layer that has seen the most actions in the last 2 years and is still rapidly evolving. This layer is also known as AI engineering.</p>

    <p>Application development involves prompt engineering, RAG, AI interface, …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Applications</strong></p>

    <p>There are many open sourced applications built on top of existing models. The most popular types of applications are coding, workflow automation, information aggregation, …</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Outside of these 4 layers, I also have another category, <strong>Model repos</strong>, that are created by companies and researchers to share the code associated with their models. Examples of repos in this category are <code>CompVis/stable-diffusion</code>, <code>openai/whisper</code>, and <code>facebookresearch/llama</code>.</p>

<h3 id="ai_stack_over_time">AI stack over time</h3>
<p>I plotted the cumulative number of repos in each category month-over-month. There was an explosion of new toolings in 2023, after the introduction of Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT. The curve seems to flatten in September 2023 because of three potential reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I only include repos with at least 500 stars in my analysis, and it takes time for repos to gather these many stars.</li>
  <li>Most low-hanging fruits have been picked. What is left takes more effort to build, hence fewer people can build them.</li>
  <li>People have realized that it’s hard to be competitive in the generative AI space, so the excitement has calmed down. Anecdotally, in early 2023, all AI conversations I had with companies centered around gen AI, but the recent conversations are more grounded. Several even brought up scikit-learn. I’d like to revisit this in a few months to verify if it’s true.</li>
</ol>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Generative AI Stack Over Time" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/2-ai-timeline.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<p>In 2023, the layers that saw the highest increases were the applications and application development layers. The infrastructure layer saw a little bit of growth, but it was far from the level of growth seen in other layers.</p>

<h4 id="applications">Applications</h4>

<p>Not surprisingly, the most popular types of applications are coding, bots (e.g. role-playing, WhatsApp bots, Slack bots), and information aggregation (e.g. “let’s connect this to our Slack and ask it to summarize the messages each day”).</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Breakdown of popular AI applications" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/3-ai-applications.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<h4 id="ai_engineering">AI engineering</h4>

<p>2023 was the year of AI engineering. Since many of them are similar, it’s hard to categorize the tools. I currently put them into the following categories: prompt engineering, AI interface, Agent, and AI engineering (AIE) framework.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt engineering</strong> goes way beyond fiddling with prompts to cover things like constrained sampling (structured outputs), long-term memory management, prompt testing &amp; evaluation, etc.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="A list of prompt engineering tools" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/4-prompt-engineering.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<p><strong>AI interface</strong> provides an interface for your end users to interact with your AI application. This is the category I’m the most excited about. Some of the interfaces that are gaining popularity are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web and desktop apps.</li>
  <li>Browser extensions that let users quickly query AI models while browsing.</li>
  <li>Bots via chat apps like Slack, Discord, WeChat, and WhatsApp.</li>
  <li>Plugins that let developers embed AI applications to applications like VSCode, Shopify, and Microsoft Offices. The plugin approach is common for AI applications that can use tools to complete complex tasks (agents).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AIE framework</strong> is a catch-all term for all platforms that help you develop AI applications. Many of them are built around RAG, but many also provide other toolings such as monitoring, evaluation, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Agent</strong> is a weird category, as many agent toolings are just sophisticated prompt engineering with potentially constrained generation (e.g. the model can only output the predetermined action) and plugin integration (e.g. to let the agent use tools).</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="AI engineering stack over time" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/5-ai-engineering.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<h4 id="model_development">Model development</h4>

<p>Pre-ChatGPT, the AI stack was dominated by model development. Model development’s biggest growth in 2023 came from increasing interest in inference optimization, evaluation, and parameter-efficient finetuning (which is grouped under Modeling &amp; training).</p>

<p>Inference optimization has always been important, but the scale of foundation models today makes it crucial for latency and cost. The core approaches for optimization remain the same (quantization, low-ranked factorization, pruning, distillation), but many new techniques have been developed especially for the transformer architecture and the new generation of hardware. For example, in 2020, 16-bit quantization was considered state-of-the-art. Today, we’re seeing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09720">2-bit quantization</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764">even lower than 2-bit</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, evaluation has always been essential, but with many people today treating models as blackboxes, evaluation has become even more so. There are many new evaluation benchmarks and evaluation methods, such as comparative evaluation (see <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2024/02/28/predictive-human-preference.html#correctness_of_chatbot_arena_ranking">Chatbot Arena</a>) and AI-as-a-judge.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Model Development Stack Over Time" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/6-model-development.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<h4 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h4>

<p>Infrastructure is about managing data, compute, and toolings for serving, monitoring, and other platform work. Despite all the changes that generative AI brought, the open source AI infrastructure layer remained more or less the same. This could also be because infrastructure products are typically not open sourced.</p>

<p>The newest category in this layer is vector database with companies like Qdrant, Pinecone, and LanceDB. However, many argue this shouldn’t be a category at all. Vector search has been around for a long time. Instead of building new databases just for vector search, existing database companies like DataStax and Redis are bringing vector search into where the data already is.</p>

<h2 id="open_source_ai_developers">Open source AI developers</h2>

<p>Open source software, like many things, follows the long tail distribution. A handful of accounts control a large portion of the repos.</p>

<h3 id="the_rise_of_one_person_companies">One-person billion-dollar companies</h3>
<p>845 repos are hosted on 594 unique GitHub accounts. There are 20 accounts with at least 4 repos. These top 20 accounts host 195 of the repos, or 23% of all the repos on the list. These 195 repos have gained a total of 1,650,000 stars.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Most active GitHub accounts" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/7-top-accounts.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<p>On Github, an account can be either an organization or an individual. 19/20 of the top accounts are organizations. Of those, 3 belong to Google: <code>google-research</code>, <code>google</code>, <code>tensorflow</code>.</p>

<p>The only individual account in these top 20 accounts is lucidrains. Among the top 20 accounts with the most number of stars (counting only gen AI repos), 4 are individual accounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lucidrains">lucidrains</a> (Phil Wang): who can implement state-of-the-art models insanely fast.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ggerganov">ggerganov</a> (Georgi Gerganov): an optimization god who comes from a physics background.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lllyasviel">Illyasviel</a> (Lyumin Zhang): creator of Foocus and ControlNet who’s currently a Stanford PhD.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/xtekky">xtekky</a>: a full-stack developer who created gpt4free.</li>
</ul>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Most active GitHub accounts" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/8-top-accounts-stars.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<p>Unsurprisingly, the lower we go in the stack, the harder it is for individuals to build. Software in the infrastructure layer is the least likely to be started and hosted by individual accounts, whereas more than half of the applications are hosted by individuals.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Can you do this alone?" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/ai-oss/9-indie.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<p>Applications started by individuals, on average, have gained more stars than applications started by organizations. Several people have speculated that we’ll see many very valuable one-person companies (see <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/04/sam-altman-one-person-unicorn-silicon-valley-founder-myth/">Sam Altman’s interview</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ajwj5z/one_person_billion_dollar_company/">Reddit discussion</a>). I think they might be right.</p>

<h3 id="1_million_commits">1 million commits</h3>

<p>Over 20,000 developers have contributed to these 845 repos. In total, they’ve made almost a million contributions!</p>

<p>Among them, the 50 most active developers have made over 100,000 commits, averaging over 2,000 commits each. See the full list of the top 50 most active open source developers <a href="https://huyenchip.com/llama-devs">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the_growing_china_open_source_ecosystem">The growing China's open source ecosystem</h2>

<p>It’s been known for a long time that China’s AI ecosystem has diverged from the US (I also mentioned that in a <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html#mlops_china_vs_us">2020 blog post</a>). At that time, I was under the impression that GitHub wasn’t widely used in China, and my view back then was perhaps colored by China’s 2013 ban on GitHub.</p>

<p>However, this impression is no longer true. There are many, many popular AI repos on GitHub targeting Chinese audiences, such that their descriptions are written in Chinese. There are repos for models developed for Chinese or Chinese + English, such as <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen">Qwen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3">ChatGLM3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca">Chinese-LLaMA</a>.</p>

<p>While in the US, many research labs have moved away from the RNN architecture for language models, the RNN-based model family <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV</a> is still popular.</p>

<p>There are also AI engineering tools providing ways to integrate AI models into products popular in China like WeChat, QQ, DingTalk, etc. Many popular prompt engineering tools also have mirrors in Chinese.</p>

<p>Among the top 20 accounts on GitHub, 6 originated in China:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/THUDM">THUDM</a>: Knowledge Engineering Group (KEG) &amp; Data Mining at Tsinghua University.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenGVLab">OpenGVLab</a>: General Vision team of Shanghai AI Laboratory</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/OpenBMB">OpenBMB</a>: Open Lab for Big Model Base, founded by ModelBest &amp; the NLP group at Tsinghua University.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/InternLM">InternLM</a>: from Shanghai AI Laboratory.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/open-mmlab">OpenMMLab</a>: from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/QwenLM">QwenLM</a>: Alibaba’s AI lab, which publishes the Qwen model family.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="live_fast_die_young">Live fast, die young</h2>

<p>One pattern that I saw last year is that many repos quickly gained a massive amount of eyeballs, then quickly died down. Some of my friends call this the “hype curve”. Out of these 845 repos with at least 500 GitHub stars, 158 repos (18.8%) haven’t gained any new stars in the last 24 hours, and 37 repos (4.5%) haven’t gained any new stars in the last week.</p>

<p>Here are examples of the growth trajectory of two of such repos compared to the growth curve of two more sustained software. Even though these two examples shown here are no longer used, I think they were valuable in showing the community what was possible, and it was cool that the authors were able to get things out so fast.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even though I included only 845 repos in my analysis, I went through several thousands of repos. I found this helpful for me to get a big-picture view of the seemingly overwhelming AI ecosystem. I hope the <a href="https://huyenchip.com/llama-police">list</a> is useful for you too. Please do let me know what repos I’m missing, and I’ll add them to the list!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>The data privacy company <strong>Onerep.com</strong> bills itself as a Virginia-based service for helping people remove their personal information from almost 200 people-search websites. However, an investigation into the history of onerep.com finds this company is operating out of Belarus and Cyprus, and that its founder has launched dozens of people-search services over the years.</p>
<p>Onerep’s “Protect” service starts at $8.33 per month for individuals and $15/mo for families, and promises to remove your personal information from nearly 200 people-search sites. Onerep also markets its service to companies seeking to offer their employees the ability to have their data continuously removed from people-search sites.</p>
<div id="attachment_66754"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66754" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/onerep-permanente.png" alt="" width="250" height="436"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66754">A testimonial on onerep.com.</p></div>
<p>Customer case studies published on onerep.com state that it struck a deal to offer the service to employees of <strong>Permanente Medicine</strong>, which represents the doctors within the health insurance giant <strong>Kaiser Permanente</strong>. Onerep also says it has made inroads among police departments in the United States.</p>
<p>But a review of Onerep’s domain registration records and that of its founder reveal a different side to this company. Onerep.com says its founder and CEO is <strong>Dimitri Shelest</strong> from Minsk, Belarus, as does <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-shelest-183626174/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelest’s profile on LinkedIn</a>. Historic registration records indexed by <a href="https://www.domaintools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DomainTools.com</a> say Mr. Shelest was a registrant of onerep.com who used the email address <strong>dmitrcox2@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
<p>A search in the data breach tracking service <a href="https://constella.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constella Intelligence</a> for the name Dimitri Shelest brings up the email address <strong>dimitri.shelest@onerep.com</strong>. Constella also finds that Dimitri Shelest from Belarus used the email address <strong>d.sh@nuwber.com</strong>, and the Belarus phone number <strong>+375-292-702786</strong>.</p>
<p>Nuwber.com is a people search service whose employees all appear to be from Belarus, and it is one of dozens of people-search companies that Onerep claims to target with its data-removal service. Onerep.com’s website disavows any relationship to Nuwber.com, stating quite clearly, “Please note that OneRep is not associated with Nuwber.com.”</p>
<p>However, there is an abundance of evidence suggesting Mr. Shelest is in fact the founder of Nuwber. Constella found that Minsk telephone number (375-292-702786) has been used multiple times in connection with the email address <strong>dmitrcox@gmail.com</strong>. Recall that Onerep.com’s domain registration records in 2018 list the email address dmitrcox2@gmail.com.</p>
<p>It appears Mr. Shelest sought to reinvent his online identity in 2015 by adding a “2” to his email address. A search on the Belarus phone number tied to Nuwber.com shows up in the domain records for <strong>askmachine.org</strong>, and DomainTools says this domain is tied to both dmitrcox@gmail.com and dmitrcox2@gmail.com.</p>

<p>A search in DomainTools for the email address dmitrcox@gmail.com shows it is associated with the registration of at least 179 domain names, including dozens of mostly now-defunct people-search companies targeting citizens of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia and Mexico, among others.</p>
<p>Those include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324064030/https://nuwber.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>nuwber.fr</strong></a>, a site registered in 2016 which was identical to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160616212526/https://nuwber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the homepage of Nuwber.com at the time</a>. DomainTools shows the same email and Belarus phone number are in historic registration records for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170709170147/https://nuwber.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuwber.at</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804065746/https://nuwber.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuwber.ch</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160806212859/https://nuwber.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuwber.dk</a> (all domains linked here are to their cached copies at archive.org, where available).</p>

<p>A review of historic WHOIS records for onerep.com show it was registered for many years to a resident of Sioux Falls, SD for a completely unrelated site. But around Sept. 2015 the domain switched from the registrar GoDaddy.com to eNom, and the registration records were hidden behind privacy protection services. DomainTools indicates around this time onerep.com started using domain name servers from DNS provider constellix.com.&nbsp;Likewise, Nuwber.com first appeared in late 2015, was also registered through eNom, and also started using constellix.com for DNS at nearly the same time.</p>
<p>Listed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dzmitrybukuyazau/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on LinkedIn</a> as a former product manager at OneRep.com between 2015 and 2018 is <strong>Dimitri Bukuyazau</strong>, who says their hometown is Warsaw, Poland. While this LinkedIn profile (linkedin.com/in/<strong>dzmitry</strong>bukuyazau) does not mention Nuwber, a search on this name in Google turns up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200906155823/https://www.privacyduck.com/comparisons/privacyduck-vs-onerep-com-the-eastern-european-privacy-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2017 blog post from privacyduck.com</a>, which laid out a number of reasons to support a conclusion that OneRep and Nuwber.com were the same company.</p>
<p>“Any people search profiles containing your Personally Identifiable Information that were on Nuwber.com were also mirrored identically on OneRep.com, down to the relatives’ names and address histories,” Privacyduck.com wrote. The post continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Both sites offered the same immediate opt-out process. Both sites had the same generic contact and support structure. They were – and remain – the same company (even PissedConsumer.com advocates this fact: https://nuwber.pissedconsumer.com/nuwber-and-onerep-20160707878520.html).”</p>
<p>“Things changed in early 2016 when OneRep.com began offering privacy removal services right alongside their own open displays of your personal information. At this point when you found yourself on Nuwber.com OR OneRep.com, you would be provided with the option of opting-out your data on their site for free – but also be highly encouraged to pay them to remove it from a slew of other sites (and part of that payment was removing you from their own site, Nuwber.com, as a benefit of their service).”</p></blockquote>
<p>Reached via LinkedIn, Mr. Bukuyazau declined to answer questions, such as whether he ever worked at Nuwber.com. However, Constella Intelligence finds two interesting email addresses for employees at nuwber.com: d.bu@nuwber.com, and d.bu+figure-eight.com@nuwber.com, which was registered under the name “<strong>Dzmitry</strong>.”</p>
<p>PrivacyDuck’s claims about how onerep.com appeared and behaved in the early days are not readily verifiable because the domain onerep.com has been completely excluded from the Wayback Machine at archive.org. The Wayback Machine will honor such requests if they come directly from the owner of the domain in question.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Shelest’s name, phone number and email also appear in the domain registration records for a truly dizzying number of country-specific people-search services, including <strong>pplcrwlr.in</strong>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205232653/http://pplcrwlr.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pplcrwlr.fr</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206043953/http://pplcrwlr.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pplcrwlr.dk</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206005352/http://pplcrwlr.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pplcrwlr.jp</a>, <strong>peeepl.br.com</strong>, <strong>peeepl.in</strong>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307194029/http://peeepl.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peeepl.it</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320054902/http://peeepl.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peeepl.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The same details appear in the WHOIS registration records for the now-defunct people-search sites <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208014115/http://waatpp.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waatpp.de</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205232901/http://waatp1.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waatp1.fr</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120112131753/http://azersab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">azersab.com</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120507115825/http://ahavoila.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ahavoila.com</a>, a people-search service for French citizens.<span id="more-66752"></span></p>

<p>A search on the email address dmitrcox@gmail.com suggests Mr. Shelest was previously involved in rather aggressive email marketing campaigns. In 2010, an anonymous source <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/09/spam-affialite-program-spamit-com-to-close/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked to KrebsOnSecurity</a> the financial and organizational records of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/spamit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Spamit</strong></a>, which at the time was easily the largest Russian-language pharmacy spam affiliate program in the world.</p>
<p>Spamit paid spammers a hefty commission every time someone bought male enhancement drugs from any of their spam-advertised websites. Mr. Shelest’s email address stood out because immediately after the Spamit database was leaked, KrebsOnSecurity searched all of the Spamit affiliate email addresses to determine if any of them corresponded to social media accounts at <strong>Facebook.com</strong> (at the time, Facebook allowed users to search profiles by email address).</p>
<p>That mapping, which was done mainly by generous graduate students at my alma mater <strong>George Mason University</strong>, revealed that dmitrcox@gmail.com was used by a Spamit affiliate, albeit not a very profitable one. That same <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dmitry.shelest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook profile for Mr. Shelest</a> is still active, and it says he is married and living in Minsk (last update: 2021).</p>

<p>Scrolling down Mr. Shelest’s Facebook page to posts made more than ten years ago show him liking the Facebook profile pages for a large number of other people-search sites, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215164504/http://findita.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findita.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120611000147/http://findmedo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findmedo.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120202191444/http://folkscan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">folkscan.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120204021306/http://huntize.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huntize.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120201003010/http://ifindy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ifindy.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130209191213/http://jupery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jupery.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120214040919/http://look2man.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">look2man.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318231852/http://lookerun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lookerun.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217181822/http://manyp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manyp.com</a>, peepull.com, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130425195446/http://perserch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perserch.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140104023637/http://persuer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">persuer.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121001072151/http://pervent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pervent.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130116123555/http://piplenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piplenter.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215174246/http://piplfind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piplfind.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130302034909/http://piplscan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piplscan.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110210162153/http://popopke.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popopke.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210030201/http://pplsorce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pplsorce.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130215180627/http://qimeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qimeo.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125085744/http://scoutu2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scoutu2.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215092423/http://search64.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search64.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035144/http://searchay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">searchay.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120215082510/http://seekmi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seekmi.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120502175915/http://selfabc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selfabc.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120211043052/http://socsee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">socsee.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130116150616/http://srching.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">srching.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120204100134/http://toolooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toolooks.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120706142742/http://upearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upearch.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120306122418/http://webmeek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webmeek.com</a>, and many country-code variations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131103141811/http://viadin.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viadin.ca</a> (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130427065532/http://viadin.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viadin.hk</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130805064112/http://viadin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viadin.com</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130428035516/http://viadin.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viadin.de</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Shelest has not responded to multiple requests for comment. KrebsOnSecurity also sought comment from onerep.com, which likewise has not responded to inquiries about its founder’s many apparent conflicts of interest. In any event, these practices would seem to contradict the goal Onerep has stated on its site: “We believe that no one should compromise personal online security and get a profit from it.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-slug="/blog/execution-traces-2024">
    
    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime/trace">runtime/trace</a> package contains a powerful tool for understanding and
troubleshooting Go programs.
The functionality within allows one to produce a trace of each goroutine’s execution over some
time period.
With the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/cmd/trace"><code>go tool trace</code> command</a> (or the excellent open source
<a href="https://gotraceui.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">gotraceui tool</a>), one may then visualize and explore the data within these
traces.</p>
<p>The magic of a trace is that it can easily reveal things about a program that are hard to see in
other ways.
For example, a concurrency bottleneck where lots of goroutines block on the same channel might be
quite difficult to see in a CPU profile, because there’s no execution to sample.
But in an execution trace, the <em>lack</em> of execution will show up with amazing clarity, and the stack
traces of blocked goroutines will quickly point at the culprit.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/execution-traces-2024/gotooltrace.png" alt="">
</p>
<p>Go developers are even able to instrument their own programs with <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime/trace#Task">tasks</a>,
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime/trace#WithRegion">regions</a>, and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/runtime/trace#Log">logs</a> that
they can use to correlate their higher-level concerns with lower-level execution details.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the wealth of information in execution traces can often be out of reach.
Four big issues with traces have historically gotten in the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traces had high overheads.</li>
<li>Traces didn’t scale well, and could become too big to analyze.</li>
<li>It was often unclear when to start tracing to capture a specific bad behavior.</li>
<li>Only the most adventurous gophers could programmatically analyze traces, given the lack of a
public package for parsing and interpreting execution traces.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve used traces in the last few years, you’ve likely been frustrated by one or more of these
problems.
But we’re excited to share that over the last two Go releases we’ve made big progress in all four
of these areas.</p>
<h2 id="low-overhead-tracing">Low-overhead tracing</h2>
<p>Prior to Go 1.21, the run-time overhead of tracing was somewhere between 10–20% CPU for many
applications, which limits tracing to situational usage, rather than continuous usage like CPU
profiling.
It turned out that much of the cost of tracing came down to tracebacks.
Many events produced by the runtime have stack traces attached, which are invaluable to actually
identifying what goroutines where doing at key moments in their execution.</p>
<p>Thanks to work by Felix Geisendörfer and Nick Ripley on optimizing the efficiency of tracebacks,
the run-time CPU overhead of execution traces has been cut dramatically, down to 1–2% for many
applications.
You can read more about the work done here in <a href="https://blog.felixge.de/reducing-gos-execution-tracer-overhead-with-frame-pointer-unwinding/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Felix’s great blog
post</a>
on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="scalable-traces">Scalable traces</h2>
<p>The trace format and its events were designed around relatively efficient emission, but required
tooling to parse and keep around the state of the entirety of a trace.
A few hundred MiB trace could require several GiB of RAM to analyze!</p>
<p>This issue is unfortunately fundamental to how traces are generated.
To keep run-time overheads low, all events are written to the equivalent of thread-local buffers.
But this means events appear out of their true order, and the burden is placed on the trace
tooling to figure out what really happened.</p>
<p>The key insight to making traces scale while keeping overheads low was to occasionally split the
trace being generated.
Each split point would behave a bit like simultaneously disabling and reenabling tracing in one
go.
All the trace data so far would represent a complete and self-contained trace, while the new trace
data would seamlessly pick up from where it left off.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, fixing this required <a href="https://go.dev/issue/60773">rethinking and rewriting a lot of the foundation of
the trace implementation</a> in the runtime.
We’re happy to say that the work landed in Go 1.22 and is now generally available.
<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.22#runtime/trace">A lot of nice improvements</a> came with the rewrite, including some
improvements to the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.22#trace"><code>go tool trace</code> command</a> as well.
The gritty details are all in the <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/60773-execution-tracer-overhaul.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">design
document</a>,
if you’re curious.</p>
<p>(Note: <code>go tool trace</code> still loads the full trace into memory, but <a href="https://go.dev/issue/65315">removing this
limitation</a> for traces produced by Go 1.22+ programs is now feasible.)</p>
<h2 id="flight-recording">Flight recording</h2>
<p>Suppose you work on a web service and an RPC took a very long time.
You couldn’t start tracing at the point you knew the RPC was already taking a while, because the
root cause of the slow request already happened and wasn’t recorded.</p>
<p>There’s a technique that can help with this called flight recording, which you may already be
familiar with from other programming environments.
The insight with flight recording is to have tracing on continuously and always keep the most
recent trace data around, just in case.
Then, once something interesting happens, the program can just write out whatever it has!</p>
<p>Before traces could be split, this was pretty much a non-starter.
But because continuous tracing is now viable thanks to low overheads, and the fact that the runtime
can now split traces any time it needs, it turns out it was straightforward to implement flight
recording.</p>
<p>As a result, we’re happy to announce a flight recorder experiment, available in the
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/golang.org/x/exp/trace#FlightRecorder">golang.org/x/exp/trace package</a>.</p>
<p>Please try it out!
Below is an example that sets up flight recording to capture a long HTTP request to get you started.</p>
<div>
<pre>    
    fr := trace.NewFlightRecorder()
    fr.Start()

    
    var once sync.Once
    http.HandleFunc("/my-endpoint", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        start := time.Now()

        
        doWork(w, r)

        
        if time.Since(start) &gt; 300*time.Millisecond {
            
            once.Do(func() {
                
                var b bytes.Buffer
                _, err = fr.WriteTo(&amp;b)
                if err != nil {
                    log.Print(err)
                    return
                }
                
                if err := os.WriteFile("trace.out", b.Bytes(), 0o755); err != nil {
                    log.Print(err)
                    return
                }
            })
        }
    })
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
</pre>
</div>
<p>If you have any feedback, positive or negative, please share it to the <a href="https://go.dev/issue/63185">proposal
issue</a>!</p>
<h2 id="trace-reader-api">Trace reader API</h2>
<p>Along with the trace implementation rewrite came an effort to clean up the other trace internals,
like <code>go tool trace</code>.
This spawned an attempt to create a trace reader API that was good enough to share and that could
make traces more accessible.</p>
<p>Just like the flight recorder, we’re happy to announce that we also have an experimental trace reader
API that we’d like to share.
It’s available in the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/golang.org/x/exp/trace#Reader">same package as the flight recorder,
golang.org/x/exp/trace</a>.</p>
<p>We think it’s good enough to start building things on top of, so please try it out!
Below is an example that measures the proportion of goroutine block events that blocked to wait on
the network.</p>
<div>
<pre>    
    r, err := trace.NewReader(os.Stdin)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    var blocked int
    var blockedOnNetwork int
    for {
        
        ev, err := r.ReadEvent()
        if err == io.EOF {
            break
        } else if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }

        
        if ev.Kind() == trace.EventStateTransition {
            st := ev.StateTransition()
            if st.Resource.Kind == trace.ResourceGoroutine {
                id := st.Resource.Goroutine()
                from, to := st.GoroutineTransition()

                
                if from.Executing() &amp;&amp; to == trace.GoWaiting {
                    blocked++
                    if strings.Contains(st.Reason, "network") {
                        blockedOnNetwork++
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    p := 100 * float64(blockedOnNetwork) / float64(blocked)
    fmt.Printf("%2.3f%% instances of goroutines blocking were to block on the network\n", p)
</pre>
</div>
<p>And just like the flight recorder, there’s a <a href="https://go.dev/issue/62627">proposal issue</a> that would
be a great place to leave feedback!</p>
<p>We’d like to quickly call out Dominik Honnef as someone who tried it out early, provided great
feedback, and has contributed support for older trace versions to the API.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you!</h2>
<p>This work was completed, in no small part, thanks to the help of the those in the <a href="https://go.dev/issue/57175">diagnostics
working group</a>, started over a year ago as a collaboration between stakeholders from
across the Go community, and open to the public.</p>
<p>We’d like to take a moment to thank those community members who have attended the diagnostic
meetings regularly over the last year: Felix Geisendörfer, Nick Ripley, Rhys Hiltner, Dominik
Honnef, Bryan Boreham, thepudds.</p>
<p>The discussions, feedback, and work you all put in have been instrumental to getting us to where we
are today.
Thank you!</p>

Sure, that would be nice, but if you invented an invisibility cloak that required some mercury and neodymium to manufacture would you toss the recipe?</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg" width="302" height="267.51557093425606" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:578,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:302,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3962fbc5-f4f5-4a8d-b201-f6ca334e5863_578x512.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>I actually only use free-trade, organic, non-GMO invisibility cloaks</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In robotics, this mistake is based on a very true and very real observation: programming robots </span><em><strong>is</strong></em><span> super hard. Famously hard. It would be super-great if programming robots was easier. The issue is this: programming robots has two different kinds of hard parts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The first kind of hard part is that robots deal with the real-world, imperfectly sensed and imperfectly actuated. Global mutable state is bad programming style because it's really hard to deal with, but to robot software the entire physical world is global mutable state, and you only get to unreliably observe it and hope your actions approximate what you wanted to achieve. Getting robotics to work at all is often at the very limit of what a person can reason about, and requires the flexibility to employ whatever heuristic might work for your special problem. This is the </span><strong>intrinsic</strong><span> complexity of the problem: robots live in complex worlds, and for every working solution there are millions of solutions that don’t work, and finding the right one is hard, and often very dependent on the task, robot, sensors and environment.</span></p><p><span>Folks look at that challenge, see that it is super hard, and decide that, sure, maybe some fancy roboticist could solve it in one particular scenario, but what about “normal” people? “We should make this possible for non-roboticists” they say. I call these users “Mythical Non-Roboticists” because once they are programming a robot, I feel they </span><em>become</em><span> roboticists. Isn’t anyone programming a robot for a purpose a roboticist?

It was also a stepping stone on the path to horizontal sharding.</p></div><p>Figma’s database stack has grown almost 100x since 2020. This is a <em>good</em> problem to have because it means our business is expanding, but it also poses some tricky technical challenges. Over the past four years, we’ve made a significant effort to stay ahead of the curve and avoid potential growing pains. In 2020, we were running a single Postgres database hosted on AWS’s largest physical instance, and by the end of 2022, we had built out a distributed architecture with caching, read replicas, and a dozen vertically partitioned databases. We split groups of related tables—like “Figma files” or “Organizations”—into their own vertical partitions, which allowed us to make incremental scaling gains and maintain enough runway to stay ahead of&nbsp;our&nbsp;growth.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/"><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="One large database silo connected to two smaller ones." data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" loading="lazy" alt="One large database silo connected to two smaller ones." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?w=2120&amp;h=1000&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 1060w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 1590w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c8ad1394a1cf21fc39adf7ca3d9f317c8b98b80-2120x1000.png?q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 2120w"></a></p></div><p>Despite our incremental scaling progress, we always knew that vertical partitioning could only get us so far. Our initial scaling efforts had focused on reducing Postgres CPU utilization. As our fleet grew larger and more heterogeneous, we started to monitor a range of bottlenecks. We used a combination of historical data and load-testing to quantify database scaling limits from CPU and IO to table size and rows written. Identifying these limits was crucial to predicting how much runway we had per shard. We could then prioritize scaling problems before they ballooned into major reliability risks.</p><p>The data revealed that some of our tables, containing several terabytes and billions of rows, were becoming too large for a single database. At this size, we began to see reliability impact during Postgres vacuums, which are essential background operations that keep Postgres from running out of transaction IDs and breaking down. Our highest write tables were growing so quickly that we would soon exceed the maximum IO operations per second (IOPS) supported by Amazon’s Relational Database Service (RDS). Vertical partitioning couldn’t save us here because the smallest unit of partitioning is a single table. To keep our databases from toppling, we needed a&nbsp;bigger&nbsp;lever.</p><h2 id="scaffolding-for-scale"><a href="#scaffolding-for-scale">Scaffolding for scale</a></h2><p>We outlined a number of goals and must-haves to tackle short-term challenges while setting us up for smooth long-term growth. We&nbsp;aimed&nbsp;to:</p><ul><li><strong>Minimize developer impact: </strong>We wanted to handle the majority of our complex relational data model supported by our application. Application developers could then focus on building exciting new features in Figma instead of refactoring large parts of our&nbsp;codebase.</li><li><strong>Scale out transparently:</strong> As we scale in the future, we don’t want to have to make additional changes at the application layer. This means that after any initial upfront work to make a table compatible, future scale-outs should be transparent to our product&nbsp;teams.</li><li><strong>Skip expensive backfills:</strong> We avoided solutions that involve backfilling large tables or every table at Figma. Given the size of our tables and Postgres throughput constraints, these backfills would have taken&nbsp;months.</li><li><strong>Make incremental progress: </strong>We identified approaches that could be rolled out incrementally as we de-risked major production changes. This reduced the risk of major outages and allowed the databases team to maintain Figma’s reliability throughout the&nbsp;migration.</li><li><strong>Avoid one-way migrations: </strong>We maintained the ability to roll back even after a physical sharding operation is completed. This reduced the risk of being stuck in a bad state when unknown <em>unknowns</em> occur.</li><li><strong>Maintain strong data consistency: </strong>We wanted to avoid complex solutions like double-writes that are challenging to implement without taking downtime or compromising on consistency. We also wanted a solution that would allow us to scale out with near-zero downtime.</li><li><strong>Play to our strengths: </strong>Since we were operating under tight deadline pressure, whenever possible, we favored approaches that could be rolled out incrementally on our fastest growing tables. We aimed to leverage existing expertise and&nbsp;technology.</li></ul><h2 id="exploring-our-options"><a href="#exploring-our-options">Exploring our options</a></h2><p>There are many popular open source and managed solutions for horizontally sharded databases that are compatible with Postgres or MySQL. During our evaluation, we explored CockroachDB, TiDB, Spanner, and Vitess. However, switching to any of these alternative databases would have required a complex data migration to ensure consistency and reliability across two different database stores. Additionally, over the past few years, we’ve developed a lot of expertise on how to reliably and performantly run RDS Postgres in-house. While migrating, we would have had to rebuild our domain expertise from scratch. Given our very aggressive growth rate, we had only months of runway remaining. De-risking an entirely new storage layer and completing an end-to-end-migration of our most business-critical use cases would have been extremely risky on the necessary timeline. We favored known low-risk solutions over potentially easier options with much higher uncertainty, where we had less control over the&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>NoSQL databases are another common scalable-by-default solution that companies adopt as they grow. However, we have a very complex relational data model built on top of our current Postgres architecture and NoSQL APIs don’t offer this kind of versatility. We wanted to keep our engineers focused on shipping great features and building new products instead of rewriting almost our entire backend application; NoSQL wasn’t a viable solution.</p><p>Given these tradeoffs, we began to explore building a horizontally sharded solution on top of our existing vertically partitioned RDS Postgres infrastructure. It didn’t make sense for our small team to re-implement a generic horizontally sharded relational database in-house; in doing so, we’d be competing with tools built by the likes of large open source communities or dedicated database vendors. However, because we were tailoring horizontal sharding to Figma’s specific architecture, we could get away with providing a much smaller feature set. For example, we chose not to support atomic cross-shard transactions because we could work around cross-shard transaction failures. We picked a colocation strategy that minimized the changes required at the application layer. This allowed us to support a subset of Postgres that was compatible with the majority of our product logic. We also were able to easily maintain backwards compatibility between sharded and unsharded postgres. If we ran into unknown <em>unknowns</em>, we could easily <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/#the-logical-choice">roll back to unsharded</a> Postgres.</p><h2 id="the-path-to-horizontal-sharding"><a href="#the-path-to-horizontal-sharding">The path to horizontal sharding</a></h2><p>Even with these narrower requirements, we knew horizontal sharding would be our largest and most complex database project to date. Luckily, our incremental scaling approach over the past few years bought us the runway to make this investment. In late 2022, we set out to unlock nearly infinite database scalability, and horizontal sharding—the process of breaking up a single table or group of tables and splitting the data across multiple physical database instances—was the key. Once a table is horizontally sharded at the application layer, it can support any number of shards at the physical layer. We can always scale out further by simply running a physical shard split. These operations happen transparently in the background, with minimal downtime and no application level changes required. This capability would allow us to stay ahead of our remaining database scaling bottlenecks, removing one of the last major scaling challenges for Figma. If vertical partitioning let us accelerate to highway speeds, horizontal sharding could remove our speed limits and&nbsp;let&nbsp;us&nbsp;fly.</p><div><figure><div><p><img

sharding</figcaption></figure></div><p>Horizontal sharding was an order of magnitude more complex than our previous scaling efforts. When a table is split across multiple physical databases, we lose many of the reliability and consistency properties that we take for granted in ACID SQL databases. For&nbsp;example:</p><ul><li>Certain SQL queries become inefficient or impossible to&nbsp;support.</li><li>Application code must be updated to provide enough information to efficiently route queries to the correct shard(s) wherever possible.</li><li>Schema changes must be coordinated across all shards to ensure the databases stay in sync. Foreign keys and globally unique indexes can no longer be enforced by&nbsp;Postgres.</li><li>Transactions now span multiple shards, meaning Postgres can no longer be used to enforce transactionality. It is now possible that writes to some databases will succeed while others fail. Care must be taken to ensure product logic is resilient to these “partial commit failures” (imagine moving a team between two organizations, only to find half their data was&nbsp;missing!).</li></ul><p>We knew achieving full horizontal sharding would be a multi-year effort. We needed to de-risk the project as much as possible while delivering incremental value. Our first goal was to shard a relatively simple but very high traffic table in production as soon as possible. This would prove the viability of horizontal sharding while also extending our runway on our most loaded database. We could then continue building additional features as we worked to shard more complex groups of tables. Even the simplest possible feature set was still a significant undertaking. End to end, it took our team roughly nine months to shard our first&nbsp;table.</p><h2 id="our-unique-approach"><a href="#our-unique-approach">Our unique approach</a></h2><p>Our horizontal sharding work built on what many others do, but with some unusual design choices. Here are a few&nbsp;highlights:</p><ul><li><strong>Colos</strong>: We horizontally sharded groups of related tables into colocations (which we affectionately call “colos”), which shared the same sharding key and physical sharding layout. This provided a friendly abstraction for developers to interact with horizontally sharded&nbsp;tables.</li><li><strong>Logical sharding: </strong>We separated the concept of “logical sharding” at the application layer from “physical sharding” at the Postgres layer. We leveraged views to perform a safer and lower cost logical sharding rollout before we executed a riskier distributed physical failover.</li><li><strong>DBProxy query engine: </strong>We built a DBProxy service that intercepts SQL queries generated by our application layer, and dynamically routes queries to various Postgres databases. DBProxy includes a query engine capable of parsing and executing complex horizontally sharded queries. DBProxy also allowed us to implement features like dynamic load-shedding and request hedging.</li><li><strong>Shadow application readiness: </strong>We added a “shadow application readiness” framework capable of predicting how live production traffic would behave under different potential sharding keys. This gave product teams a clear picture of what application logic needed to be refactored or removed to prepare the application for horizontal sharding.</li><li><strong>Full logical replication</strong>: We avoided having to implement “filtered logical replication” (where only a subset of data is copied to each shard). Instead, we copied over the entire dataset and then only allowed reads/writes to the subset of data belonging to a&nbsp;given&nbsp;shard.</li></ul><h2 id="our-sharding-implementation"><a href="#our-sharding-implementation">Our sharding implementation</a></h2><p>One of the most important decisions in horizontal sharding is which shard key to use. Horizontal sharding adds many data model constraints that revolve around the shard key. For example, most queries need to include the shard key so that the request can be routed to the right shard. Certain database constraints, like foreign keys, only work when the foreign key is the sharding key. The shard key also needs to distribute data evenly across all shards to avoid hotspots that cause reliability issues or impact scalability.</p><div><p>Figma lives in the browser, and many users can collaborate in parallel on the same Figma file. This means that our product is powered by a fairly complex relational data model capturing file metadata, organization metadata, comments, file versions, and&nbsp;more.</p></div><p>We considered using the same sharding key for every table, but there was no single good candidate in our existing data model. To add a unified sharding key, we would have had to create a composite key, add the column to every table’s schema, run expensive backfills to populate it, and then substantially refactor our product logic. Instead, we tailored our approach to Figma’s unique data model and selected a handful of sharding keys like UserID, FileID, or OrgID. Almost every table at Figma could be sharded using one of&nbsp;these&nbsp;keys.</p><p>We introduced the concept of colos, which provide a friendly abstraction for product developers: Tables within a colo support cross-table joins and full transactions when restricted to a single sharding key. Most application code already interacted with the database this way, which minimized the work required by application developers to make a table ready for horizontal sharding.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;users table&quot; and &quot;user favorites table.&quot;" width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;users table&quot; and &quot;user favorites table.&quot;" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8610966e627e683caaff88094d9dd8b75efa1a3b-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption>Tables sharded by UserID and by FileID are each colocated together</figcaption></figure><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;files table&quot; and &quot;file comments table.&quot;" width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Three data silos, each containing blocks for &quot;files table&quot; and &quot;file comments table.&quot;" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/53ad07418b852f047bf1f19719c63dbf2d211cc3-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div></figure></div><p>Once we picked our sharding keys, we needed to ensure that there would be an even distribution of data across all backend databases. Unfortunately, many of the sharding keys that we had picked used auto-incrementing or Snowflake timestamp-prefixed IDs. This would have resulted in significant hotspots where a single shard contained the majority of our data. We explored migrating to more randomized IDs, but this required an expensive and time-consuming data migration. Instead, we decided to use the hash of the sharding key for routing. As long as we picked a sufficiently random hash function, we would ensure a uniform distribution of data. One downside of this is that range-scans on shard keys are less efficient, since sequential keys will be hashed to different database shards. However, this query pattern is not common in our codebase, so it was a trade-off we were willing to&nbsp;live&nbsp;with.</p><h3 id="the-logical-solution"><a href="#the-logical-solution">The “logical” solution</a></h3><p>To de-risk the horizontal sharding rollout, we wanted to isolate the process of preparing a table at the application layer from the physical process of running a shard split. To do this, we separated “logical sharding” from “physical sharding.” We could then decouple the two parts of our migration to implement and de-risk them independently. Logically sharding gave us confidence in our serving stack with a low-risk, percentage-based rollout. Rolling back logical sharding when we found bugs was a simple configuration change. Rolling back a physical shard operation is possible, but it requires more complex coordination to ensure data consistency.</p><p>Once a table is logically sharded, all reads and writes will act as if the table is already horizontally sharded. From a reliability, latency, and consistency perspective, we appear to be horizontally sharded, even though the data is still physically located on a single database host. When we are confident that logical sharding is working as expected, we then perform the physical sharding operation. This is the process of copying the data from a single database, sharding it across multiple backends, then re-routing read and write traffic through the new&nbsp;databases.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="Two data silos with blocks for logical and physical shards." width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="Two data silos with blocks for logical and physical shards." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/fc28f4926b31d5e5b9cc97a8fc622ac5788ca865-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption>Four logical shards on two physical shards</figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="the-query-engine-that-could"><a href="#the-query-engine-that-could">The query engine that&nbsp;could</a></h3><p>To support horizontal sharding, we had to significantly re-architect our backend stack. Initially, our application services talked directly to our connection pooling layer, PGBouncer. However, horizontal sharding required much more sophisticated query parsing, planning, and execution. To support this, we built out a new golang service, DBProxy. DBProxy sits between the application layer and PGBouncer. It includes logic for load-shedding, improved observability, transaction support, database topology management, and a lightweight query&nbsp;engine.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="The application layer flows to DB Proxy, PG Bouncer, and then to the database." width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="The application layer flows to DB Proxy, PG Bouncer, and then to the database." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/2af44a9d935f95fa08d003b61041270b30d1bb07-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/2af44a9d935f95fa08d003b61041270b30d1bb07-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/2af44a9d935f95fa08d003b61041270b30d1bb07-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/2af44a9d935f95fa08d003b61041270b30d1bb07-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/2af44a9d935f95fa08d003b61041270b30d1bb07-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/2af44a9d935f95fa08d003b61041270b30d1bb07-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The query engine is the heart of DBProxy.

Fun, but overdo it, and your speedy database starts feeling more like a snail, especially with complex queries.</p></div><p>Some queries are relatively easy to implement in a horizontally sharded world. For example, single-shard queries are filtered to a single shard key. Our query engine just needs to extract the shard key and route the query to the appropriate physical database. We can “push down” the complexity of the query execution into Postgres. However, if the query is missing a sharding key, our query engine has to perform a more complex <strong>“scatter-gather.”</strong> In this case, we need to fan out the query to all shards (the scatter phase) and then aggregate back results (the gather phase). In some cases, like complex aggregations, joins, and nested SQL, this scatter-gather can be very complex to implement<em>. </em>Additionally, having too many scatter-gathers would impact horizontal sharding scalability. Because the queries have to touch every single database, each scatter-gather contributes the same amount of load as it would if the database was&nbsp;unsharded.</p><p>If we supported full SQL compatibility, our DBProxy service would have begun to look a lot like the Postgres database query engine. We wanted to simplify our API to minimize DBProxy’s complexity, while also reducing the work required for our application developers, who would have to re-write any unsupported queries. To determine the right subset, we built out a “shadow planning” framework, which allowed users to define potential sharding schemes for their tables and then run shadow the logical planning phase on top of live production traffic. We logged the queries and associated query plans to a Snowflake database, where we could run offline analysis. From this data, we picked a query language that supported the most common 90% of queries, but avoided worst-case complexity in our query engine. For example, all range scan and point queries are allowed, but joins are only allowed when joining two tables in the same colo and the join is on the sharding&nbsp;key.</p><h3 id="a-view-of-the-future"><a href="#a-view-of-the-future">A view of the&nbsp;future</a></h3><p>We then needed to figure out how to encapsulate our logical shards. We explored partitioning the data using separate Postgres databases or Postgres schemas. Unfortunately, this would have required physical data changes when we logically sharded the application, which was just as complex as doing the physical shard&nbsp;split.</p><p>Instead, we chose to represent our shards with Postgres views. We could create multiple views per-table, each corresponding to the subset of data in a given shard. This would look like: <code>CREATE VIEW table_shard1 AS SELECT * FROM table WHERE hash(shard_key) &gt;= min_shard_range AND hash(shard_key) &lt; max_shard_range).</code> All reads and writes to the table would be sent through these&nbsp;views.</p><p>By creating sharded views on top of our existing unsharded physical databases, we could logically shard before we performed any risky physical reshard operations. Each view is accessed via its own sharded connection pooler service. The connection poolers still point to the unsharded physical instance, which gives the appearance of being sharded. We were able to de-risk the rollout of sharded reads and writes gradually via feature flags in the query engine and roll back at any time within seconds by just rerouting traffic back to the main table. By the time we ran our first reshard, we were confident in the safety of the sharded topology.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="An unsharded databases with views of four different shards." width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="An unsharded databases with views of four different shards." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/654e4ee15b6ee16b9208ad020eb2ae654b34d0a8-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption>By creating multiple views in an unsharded database, we can query the views as if the data was already physically sharded.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of course, relying on views also introduced added risks. Views add a performance overhead and in some cases could fundamentally change how the Postgres query planner optimizes queries. To validate that approach, we collected a query corpus of sanitized production queries and ran load tests with and without views. We were able to confirm that views would only add a minimal performance overhead in most cases, and less than 10% in the worst cases. We also built out a shadow reads framework which could send all live read traffic through views, comparing the performance and correctness of view versus non-view queries. We were then able to confirm that views were a viable solution with minimal performance impact.</p><h3 id="tackling-our-topology"><a href="#tackling-our-topology">Tackling our topology</a></h3><p>To perform query routing, DBProxy has to understand the topology of our tables and physical databases. Because we had separated the concept of logical versus physical sharding, we needed a way to represent these abstractions within our topology. For example, we need to be able to map a table (users) to its shard key (user_id). Similarly, we needed to be able to map a logical shard ID (123) to the appropriate logical and physical databases. With vertical partitioning, we relied on a simple, hard-coded configuration file that mapped tables to their partition. However, as we moved towards horizontal sharding, we required something more sophisticated. Our topology would change dynamically during shard splits and DBProxy needed to quickly update its state to avoid routing requests to the wrong database. Because every change to topology is backwards compatible, these changes are never in the critical path for our site. We built out a database topology that encapsulated our complex horizontal sharding metadata and could deliver real-time updates in under&nbsp;a&nbsp;second.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,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" alt="A topology library that leads to a square (S3) and a cylinder (ETCD)." width="804" height="536" data-lqip="true"><img data-loading="true" width="804" height="536" loading="lazy" alt="A topology library that leads to a square (S3) and a cylinder (ETCD)." src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;h=536&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/8db2e5fe21409fc4c47fc77909a0f8f8f33383e6-2160x1440.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w"></p></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Having a separate logical and physical topology allowed us to also simplify some of our database management. For example, in our non-production environments, we can keep the same logical topology as production, but serve the data from many fewer physical databases. This saves costs and reduces complexity without having too many changes across environments. The topology library also allowed us to enforce invariants across our topology (e.g. every shard ID should be mapped to exactly one physical database) that were critical to maintaining the correctness of our system as we built out horizontal sharding.</p><h3 id="the-physical-sharding-operation"><a href="#the-physical-sharding-operation">The physical sharding operation</a></h3><p>Once a table is ready for sharding, the last step is the physical failover from unsharded to sharded databases. We were able to reuse much of the same logic for horizontal sharding, but there were a few notable differences: Instead of moving data from 1 to 1 database, we were going from 1 to N. We needed to make the failover process resilient to new failure modes where the sharding operation could succeed on only a subset of our databases. Still, many of the riskiest components had already been de-risked during vertical partitioning. We were able to move much faster towards our first physical sharding operation than would have otherwise been&nbsp;possible.</p><h2 id="we-ve-come-a-long-way"><a href="#we-ve-come-a-long-way">We’ve come a&nbsp;long&nbsp;way</a></h2><p>When we started this journey, we knew that horizontal sharding would be a multi-year investment into Figma’s future scalability. We shipped our first horizontally sharded table in September 2023. We successfully failed over with only ten seconds of partial availability on database primaries and no availability impact on replicas. We saw no regressions in latency or availability after sharding. Since then we’ve been tackling relatively simple shards from our highest write rate databases. This year, we’ll shard increasingly complex databases, which have dozens of tables and thousands of code call-sites.</p><p>To remove our last scaling limits and truly take flight, we will need to horizontally shard every table at Figma. A fully horizontally sharded world will bring many other benefits: improved reliability, cost savings, and developer velocity. Along the way, we’ll need to solve all of these&nbsp;problems:</p><ul><li>Support for horizontally sharded schema&nbsp;updates</li><li>Globally unique ID generation for horizontally sharded primary&nbsp;keys</li><li>Atomic cross-shard transactions for business critical use-cases</li><li>Distributed globally unique indexes (currently unique indexes are only supported on indexes including the sharding&nbsp;key)</li><li>An ORM model that increases developer velocity and is seamlessly compatible with horizontal sharding</li><li>Fully automated reshard operations that can run shard splits with the click of&nbsp;a&nbsp;button</li></ul><p>Once we’ve bought ourselves sufficient runway, we will also reassess our original approach of in-house RDS horizontal sharding. We started this journey 18 months ago with extremely tight timeline pressure. NewSQL stores have continued to evolve and mature. We will finally have bandwidth to reevaluate the tradeoffs of continuing down our current path versus switching to an open source or managed solution.</p><p>We’ve made a lot of exciting progress on our horizontal sharding journey, but our challenges are just beginning<em>. </em>Stay tuned for more deep dives into different parts of our horizontal sharding stack.

<p dir="auto">hnsw-rust is a Rust implementation of The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm. HNSW is a notable advancement in Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional spaces, fundamentally altering our approach to these problems. The algorithm constructs a layered graph structure, where higher layers (less dense) are used for rapid global navigation, while lower layers (more dense) facilitate fine-grained local search. This structure mirrors the 'small world' phenomenon observed in social networks, where short path lengths exist between any two nodes (Watts and Strogatz, 1998).</p>
<p dir="auto">HNSW's search efficiency arises from its unique use of a greedy heuristic. It commences from a high layer and iteratively moves to the node closest to the target, transitioning down to denser layers until the nearest neighbors are refined. This method of layer traversal for nearest neighbor search finds its roots in earlier works like Kleinberg's small-world model, which also highlights efficient navigation in sparse, high-dimensional spaces (Kleinberg, 2000).</p>

<p dir="auto">New nodes are inserted starting from the lowest layer, with their inclusion in each subsequent higher layer governed by a probabilistic threshold. This strategy is influenced by earlier research in dynamic random graphs and scale-free networks, which also deal with node connections based on probabilistic models (Barabási and Albert, 1999). The probability of ascending to higher layers decreases exponentially, a method validated by research emphasizing the balance between exploration and exploitation in search algorithms (Arya et al., 1998).</p>

We knew we had a lot to fix.</p><p>As all software developers know, there’s always tension between two development paths - rebuild in-place or a full rewrite. We attempted to rebuild as much as we could, but we realized&nbsp;over time that our architecture design goals were fundamentally different from other Matrix clients. While those clients are primarily meant to be Slack or IRC alternatives (designed for large unencrypted group channels), our priority is to build a great consumer chat app for encrypted DMs&nbsp;and smaller group chats.</p><p>Last year, we made the tough decision to begin a complete rewrite of our entire Android app.</p><p>On the interface design side, our design team created a unified design language and re-imagined every surface of the app. We took care to mesh Beeper into Android OS, taking cues from Material design and deeply integrating with native Android features like Chat Bubbles, Material You and dual-pane view for foldables.</p><p><span>The technical architecture has been re-engineered from the ground up for speed and performance. We redesigned how incoming chat messages flow from the internet, through the app, to be displayed on screen. All chats are now cached locally on your phone. We swapped the old Matrix Android library for </span><a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go" rel="">mautrix-go</a><span>, the same open-source Go library that powers all of our Matrix bridges.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><b>"Don’t even bother," the upholsterer</b> told me. I was on the phone, asking for a theoretical quote to reupholster a five-year-old or so midrange sofa, which cost more than $1,000 when new. That task, the upholsterer told me, would run me several times more than the couch was originally worth, and, owing to its construction, it was now worth nowhere near its sale price. The upholsterer proceeded to lecture me, in a helpful, passionate, and sometimes kindly manner, about how sofas made in the past 15 years or so are absolute garbage, constructed of sawdust compressed and bonded with cheap glue, simple brackets in place of proper joinery, substandard spring design, flimsy foam, and a lot of staples.</p> <p>Until recently, people had no reason to suspect that a $1,200 sofa would be anything less than high quality; the vast majority of the stuff in stores was fairly well made, and you could sit on it to test it.

"I’ve seen a lot of change over the last fifteen years as it relates to the specific furniture vertical. All the suppliers to the industry have been here for a hundred years," says Houston. Today, the industry has spread out across multiple continents, with more products, and more philosophies, than ever before. Instead of a retail business with domestic construction and shipping performed by specialists, we’ve got drop shipping in containers from Southeast Asia, venture capital funding for Instagram photography, and, perhaps most distressingly, some really poorly made sofas.<br></p> <p>There are absolutely sturdy, beautifully made sofas constructed in the United States. There are custom designer pieces made here or in France or Italy or Scandinavia, which tend to be prohibitively expensive for the masses. But low- and mid-priced sofas are a relatively new phenomenon, and, frankly, they often suck. A middle-class family that wanted to buy a new couch in the 1980s, for example, might have gone to a department store or a local furniture store or traveled to one of the gigantic furniture markets scattered across the country for a product that would have been designed in-house and made domestically out of good leather, dense foam, and American solid wood: oak, maple, poplar, pine.</p> <p>Then, importantly, it would have been wrapped up and shipped via a specialist. "Fifteen years ago, you had to ship that on a furniture carrier, because when they finished the sofa, at a facility in Mississippi or North Carolina or something like that, they only trusted a furniture carrier to know how to blanket-wrap it, set it on there, and then they’re gonna move it throughout the country that way," says Houston. This was a slow, expensive, and delicate operation, requiring skilled labor and purpose-built materials.</p> <p>The big change in shipping logistics came when furniture manufacturers developed new ways of deconstructing and flat-packing their product, allowing sofas to be shipped via regular carriers, both more cheaply and more quickly. This innovation opened up new avenues for penny-pinching. Favorable tax situations, cheap labor, and a surging wood and wood-type-product industry in Asia made it suddenly very inexpensive to construct furniture there, and those new shipping tactics made transportation feasible.</p> </div><div><figure data-layout="wide" data-photo-id="7168088776037785600" id="photos-7168088776037785600"><div><p><a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/dtc-sofa-crisis-32304b9e/7168088776037785600"><img alt="They don't make them like they used to." data-photo-id="7168088776037785600" loading="lazy" height="1315" sizes="(min-width: 1120px) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=160" srcset="https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1760 1760w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1120 1120w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=960 960w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=800 800w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=640 640w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=480 480w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=320 320w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776037785600/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=160 160w" width="1972"></a></p></div><div><figcaption><p>They don't make them like they used to.</p></figcaption></div></figure></div><div><p>Starting in the late 1990s, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of Americans in the furniture-manufacturing industry plummeted, from nearly 700,000 in the year 2000 to below 500,000 just before the economic crash in 2008. After that, things only got worse: Today, they’re down at around 350,000—half the industry gone in two decades. Really great furniture is still out there, but labor is more expensive and harder to find, as are some of the raw materials. To fill its place is stuff that costs what a good sofa used to cost—but without the good part.</p> <p>Designs changed to accommodate the new location, new costs, and new workers. Wood was replaced with compressed wood, a wood-adjacent product made from sawdust, wood chips, and scrap and glued into the shape of a board, kind of like a McRib.<br></p> <p>Manufacturers realized they could cut all kinds of corners, from materials to process. One of those is a technique called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29zPNvL48_4" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29zPNvL48_4" data-ml-id="5" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1710454005358fea" data-xid="fr1710454005358fea">eight-way hand-tying</a>," a method of  attaching individual seating coils together and to the frame of a sofa for support, usually using twine. (The eight ways: front to back, side to side, and diagonally in each direction.) It’s a time-consuming process that requires training, but serious furniture folks love it: It allows for only the springs you sit on to mold around your body, without altering the position of the rest of the suspension—like a hammock, Houston says.</p> <p>In place of traditional joinery, backs and arms are attached to bases with brackets, which the consumer can assemble at home. The results of these changes are tangible: a lighter, flimsier sofa with maybe some wobble in the arms and legs, too stiff to sit on or lacking in support.</p> <p>This development created Wayfair-type sofas at absurdly cheap prices, a category that didn’t really exist before. It also forced the middle-tier manufacturers to start cutting corners as well, since their labor pool was shrinking and becoming more expensive. But it did not lead to a cheaper price for these middle-tier products. Today’s $1,000 sofa is not in the same league of construction as a $299 Sears sofa (about $1,100 today) from 1980. That thing was made of actual wood.</p> <p>So where are these profits going? Not to the low-cost labor in Vietnam. Not toward the materials or the shipping. "If you’ve figured out a good way to market and target the consumer and you become that marketing machine, that’s where the margin’s at," says Houston. "I’ve seen the P&amp;L [parts and labor costs] and I saw what they paid us [in shipping], and then you see what it’s sold for, and it’s like, wow."</p> </div><div><figure data-layout="wide" data-photo-id="7168088776439267328" id="photos-7168088776439267328"><div><p><a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/dtc-sofa-crisis-32304b9e/7168088776439267328"><img alt="Secondhand steals are still out there, and this Artifort classic from the 1990s is due for a comeback." data-photo-id="7168088776439267328" loading="lazy" height="1046" sizes="(min-width: 1120px) 75vw, 100vw" src="https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=160" srcset="https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1760 1760w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1280 1280w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=1120 1120w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=960 960w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=800 800w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=640 640w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=480 480w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=320 320w, https://images2.dwell.com/photos/6063391372700811264/7168088776439267328/original.jpg?auto=format&amp;q=35&amp;w=160 160w" width="1569"></a></p></div><div><figcaption><p>Secondhand steals are still out there, and this Artifort classic from the 1990s is due for a comeback.</p></figcaption></div></figure></div><div><p><b>Sofas are very much not immune </b>from the direct-to-consumer bonanza, and those brands make a compelling pitch. Why bother with an outdated, 20th-century concept like a brick-and-mortar store when you can cut out much of that overhead by moving to a <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/state-of-knock-off-furniture-e-commerce-direct-to-consumer-23d2e44f">direct-to-consumer (DTC) model</a>? DTC gives an illusion of control: You can customize every part rather than rely on what’s on hand at a local store. Of course, you’re also giving up the ultimate control: actually sitting on the sofa. These brands have been extremely aggressive and successful in their marketing, especially on social media, and in polishing the purchasing process to a fine sheen.</p> <p>A major reason for that success is that the design language for mass-market furniture these days is weirdly narrow. Simply put, the midcentury-modern aesthetic dominates all other styles. "The groundswell began around thirty years ago, and my theory is that, for lack of knowledge about other movements, and because so much of the midmodern stuff is American and therefore there’s more of it in the wild, it hasn’t really been overtaken," says Reiss. "It’s almost like these are the [Levi’s] 501 of furniture." The neutral or muted colors, unadorned wooden legs, and simple shapes have become the baseline for sofas. These items, at least in well-lit, well-staged, and beautifully edited photographs, look great and expensive—which is exactly the point.<br></p> <p>The other advantage of the DTC model is that you’re relying on those photos, which works to the manufacturer’s benefit. While a 30-day return policy comes standard with most DTC companies, that’s still a fair amount of work: You have to initiate the return, schedule a pickup, and go through the shopping and shipping procedure again for a new sofa. It’s understandable when people end up just dealing with something that they aren’t thrilled with.<br></p> <p>When you ship something via these common carriers, typically a manufacturer purchases space in a container, which then has to be filled to maximize profits. That leads to a sort of Taco Bell–style design: a lot of the same ingredients, just moved around. Take the tufted seat back from this sofa and put it on this one. Use the same wooden legs on 30 different sofas. Use the same brackets, the same compressed-wood platform. Midcentury modern is perfect for this: There aren’t very many details in the first place, so you can make what looks like a robust product line with very few variations.</p> <p>The politics of the midcentury-modern movement are well documented, especially its ties to postwar welfare states in Europe, affordable design for the masses, and warm and homey use of fabrics and woods. A sofa that looks just like those references but is designed by a company that exists only on Instagram, made cheaply and badly, and shipped around the world in order to satisfy the bottomless maws of investors in "the Netflix of couches" or whatever, that’s a change. Midcentury design was still a product to be made and sold in a capitalist system, but it wasn’t the grimmest possible expression of that system, the way contemporary sofas can be. "This is kind of the way it goes with all products," says Reiss. "They become more efficient, but it’s just about cutting costs. The incentives to have a great $2,000 couch—I mean, who’s going to fight for that?"</p> <p>This has also led to a resurgence of interest in vintage sofas, something Reiss knows well. "<a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/instagram-vintage-sellers-tips-213eea10">I’m a vintage proponent</a>, and it’s just out of my practical consumer experience," he says. My own shopping experience mirrored his. I hated every sofa that was being blasted into my eyeballs through social media, so I spent weeks, literally, on Craigslist and <a href="https://www.dwell.com/guide/facebook-marketplace-tips-d6b729cd">Facebook Marketplace</a> and Kaiyo and OfferUp, waiting for that perfect one. It came after six weeks of effort and required a mover with a pickup truck, a lot of research into how to wash 50-year-old wool cushion covers, and a new roll of foam to replace the cushions. I’m really happy with it, but it’s not realistic to expect everyone to have access to a big city’s selection of used sofas, nor would I want anybody else to have the specific kind of brain damage I have that encourages that kind of research and commitment.</p> <p>"I have people who come in all the time who have bought a sofa, and it looks great online. Then it shows up and doesn’t necessarily look as good in person. And then when they sit on it, it doesn’t feel as nice as they had expected," says Steve Heiss, the manager of <a href="https://sunbeamvintage.com/" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://sunbeamvintage.com/" data-ml-id="6" data-ml="true" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1710454005358adb" data-xid="fr1710454005358adb">Sunbeam Vintage</a>, a warehouse-y shop in Los Angeles that sells classic sofas (sometimes reupholstered in-house) as well as some new designer items. "I think that when it comes to quality—I hate to say it—but I don’t know that people really notice," he adds. "The buyers are not that educated." But education often comes only with time.</p> <p>And when the alternative is to just click something on your phone and have it show up in three to five days, it’s hard to blame anyone for making the easy choice. Even if it kind of stinks.</p> <p>—</p> <p><i>Top illustration by Matheus Castro.

<p><em>Left: Drawbench prompt "A rainbow penguin in a tuxedo". Right: SDXL output with SuperPrompt applied to the same input prompt.</em></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I've trained a 77M T5 model to expand prompts, and it meets or exceeds existing 1B+ parameter LLMs in quality and prompt alignment.</p>
<p>When DALL-E 3 was released, I was a) really impressed, and b) struck by how obviously good an idea the prompt augmentation it uses was. To that end, I've spent some time over the last few months playing around with some various approaches to emulate that functionality.</p>
<p>When viewed from a more general perspective, the problem of "take a user's intent, and generate an image that looks better than it would otherwise", without tuning the T2I model itself, has some interesting potential upsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>When tuning a model for aesthetics, it's very easy to overfit in strange ways; for example, biasing towards heavily saturated imagery, or smoothing out details; this leads to a model that can't reproduce those qualities when you want them to. An initial upsampling step leaves the original model intact but potentially gives the same benefits.</li>
<li>Large models have biases, that are notoriously hard to remove or tune. OpenAI partially solves this with the ChatGPT system prompt, which has lots of instruction related to content policy, protecting IP, etc. Changing a system prompt is much cheaper than tuning a T2I model!</li>
<li>Eventually, more T2I models will get better at following text prompts, like DALL-E 3 is; however, a lot of users (myself included) will still want to prompt for simple things like "a dog in a bucket hat", whereas the model is conditioned to generate images with captions like "A cute, fluffy dog wearing a colorful bucket hat. The dog is sitting in a sunny garden, surrounded by vibrant flowers. The hat is tilted slightly to one side, adding a playful touch to the dog's appearance." Just asking for a "a dog in a bucket hat" leaves a lot of potential detail and fidelity on the table!</li>
</ul>
<p>So here are the approaches I tried:</p>
<h3 id="clip-augmentation">CLIP augmentation<a href="#clip-augmentation" aria-label="Direct link to CLIP augmentation" title="Direct link to CLIP augmentation">​</a></h3>
<p>The idea here is that the existing model (in my experiments, SDXL 1.0) is conditioned on CLIP text embeddings; and within a CLIP embedding space, the existing prompt, and a better prettier prompt, both exist - so I'd train a ~20M parameter MLP to convert the CLIP embeddings (unpooled, as is used in the diffusion model) from an worse looking prompt to a nicer one. For the dataset, I'd use the DiffusionDB prompt dataset, and use Llama2 to rewrite the prompts to remove any descriptors that might improve the fidelity of the image.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Input</th><th>Target</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>beautiful porcelain biomechanical cyborg woman, close - up, sharp focus, studio light (...)</td><td>porcelain cyborg woman</td></tr><tr><td>two scientists wearing red high fashion hazmat suits in a glowing geometric nebula wormhole tunnel	(...)</td><td>two scientists wearing red hazmat suits in a tunnel</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><em>Example rows from the dataset.</em></p>
<p>This didn't work; I tried a number of things, from various model architectures / configs to different datasets and augmentation pipelines. The model would get frustratingly close at times; I'd watch it generate a much nicer or more coherent scene for one sample and totally whiff it with the next. I think there's potentially a solution here, but it might require some very sensitive hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting or model collapse. The existence of aesthetic predictors and other classifiers built atop CLIP implies that this should be possible, though such models don't have to account for the biases that the diffusion model contains towards the text encoder.</p>

<p><em>Left: baseline with prompt "A yellow colored giraffe" from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y7nAbmR4FREi6npB1u-Bo3GFdwdOPYJc617rBOxIRHY/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawbench</a>. Right: SDXL output with CLIP-augmented text embeddings.</em></p>
<h3 id="u-net-augmentation">U-Net augmentation<a href="#u-net-augmentation" aria-label="Direct link to U-Net augmentation" title="Direct link to U-Net augmentation">​</a></h3>
<p>Thinking about why the CLIP augmenter didn't work, I wondered if it might be easier to instead augment the latent during certain steps of the denoising process. Taking a page from SD Ultimate Upscale - which uses a secondary U-net to upscale a latent - I tried training a latent augmenter, while performing inference on prompts from the same DiffusionDB dataset.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://brianfitzgerald.xyz/assets/images/8_7_1_baseline-831ee2914173c48b1ba9068a7f159dce.png" width="1024" height="1024">
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://brianfitzgerald.xyz/assets/images/8_7_1_baseline3-41f356dc48aa89bd13ffb5a954a0fe8d.png" width="1024" height="1024"></p>
<p><em>Left: baseline with prompt "A white sheep driving a red car" . Right: SDXL output with Unet augmentation pass before sampling.</em></p>
<p>This <em>did</em> seem to work, though the U-net was fairly big - about 800M parameters, which is nearly the size of the smallest LLMs; and the results were still not great. It felt like the improvement in quality wasn't really worth how big the model was; as is often the case in ML, it's likely there <em>is</em> a way to get this to work well - though it might require a dataset or training regime that is radically different from what I tried. I spent a few weeks fiddling with this, before finally realizing I wasn't really making progress; and anyways, this approach has a few serious downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>When VAE or model architecture changes happen, the model would have to be at best tuned heavily, and at worst, trained again from scratch.</li>
<li>The model needs lots of data to train, as we're training a U-net from scratch. Decent quality output only started to appear after about 100k steps, and the model was still improving at 200k steps. Besides cost, this is also a fairly large-scale aesthetic dataset; even <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/yuvalkirstain/pickapic_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pick-a-Pic</a> which is ~600k samples would likely not be large enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know what doesn't have these issues? Language models.</p>
<h3 id="tinyllama">TinyLlama<a href="#tinyllama" aria-label="Direct link to TinyLlama" title="Direct link to TinyLlama">​</a></h3>
<p>As I was working on this, the first few TinyLlama Instruct checkpoints had been released. It seemed like a good fit; take the existing prompt dataset, reformat it to be compatible with Axolotl, and tune. Fortunately, this worked, almost immediately!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://brianfitzgerald.xyz/assets/images/sheep_lq-c0e4856e4a368cd34be5af18c5507443.jpg" width="768" height="768">

<p><em>Left: generated with the prompt "A white sheep driving a red car" . Right: generated with the upsampled prompt "a fluffy white sheep confidently drives a shiny red car along a scenic country road".</em></p>
<p>In fact - without any tuning the instruct model did a pretty good job of expanding prompts. However, thinking back to earlier projects like MagicPrompt, and how well that model performs with a fifth of the parameters (200M in GPT-2 vs 1B), it's actually a lot less impressive. To that end, I started looking at options for going smaller.</p>
<h3 id="sequence-to-sequence">Sequence to Sequence<a href="#sequence-to-sequence" aria-label="Direct link to Sequence to Sequence" title="Direct link to Sequence to Sequence">​</a></h3>
<p>The smallest T5 model available is 22 million parameters; for BERT, about 8 million. These are <em>absurdly</em> tiny for 2024 language model standards; roughly the same size as the MLP layers we used above! After writing some <a href="https://github.com/brianfitzgerald/smolmodels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">basic training code</a>, I fine-tuned a 77M T5 model using the same augmented DiffusionDB dataset as above, and got prompts like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a fleet, 8 k, starships, oil painting, detailed, cyberpunk colour palette, composition, lighting, masterpiece, by adrian ghenie and jenny saville and zhang jingna</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Promising - though not perfect. Cue more hyperparameter tuning, fixing implementation details in my training script, etc - before finally digging into. While this dataset was large - about 5 million rows - I was beginning to suspect that the augmentations and the quality of the data itself was limiting things; it included lots of prompts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mount epic mechanical dragons steamscale incinerator screenshot world of warcraft mounts worldboss, art gta 5 cover, official fanart behance hd artstation by jesper ejsing, by rhads, makoto shinkai and lois van baarle, ilya kuvshinov, ossdraws, that looks like it is from borderlands and by feng zhu and loish and laurie greasley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gundam head, v - fin, octane render, soft light, mekka, behance, vector, highly detailed illustration, realistic, black and gold metal design, dribbble. com, by secondsyndicate studio,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which are <em>nearly entirely</em> adjectives, and when filtered by the LLM, return maybe 1-2 words out of a 30-40 word prompt. This means that the model would have to associate lots of adjectives to relatively few subjects / nouns. So I tried a different strategy - generating synthetic hyper-detailed prompts following the upsampling prompt in the <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DALL-E 3 paper</a>, and the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/nateraw/parti-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PartiPrompts dataset</a>. Cue another training run on flan-T5-small, and we get prompts like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The storefront of "Hello World" is painted in vibrant shades of orange and yellow, with the words "Hello World" written in bold, cursive letters across the front. The storefront is surrounded by a bustling cityscape, with skyscrapers and neon signs lining the walls. The storefront is surrounded by a sea of people, all gazing up at the sky with a sense of excitement and excitement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the tranquil expanse of a picturesque countryside, where rolling green hills meet the azure sky, a fluffy white sheep confidently takes the helm of a shiny red car, navigating its way along a winding road with an air of determined curiosity and adventurous spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing! And the resulting images look great too.</p>

<p>The data is the most important thing. No model architecture, especially with smaller models, can correct for data that is fundamentally flawed in some way. I could have saved myself lots of time hopping between different model architectures and tweaking hyperparameters if I'd started with a cleaner, smaller dataset, and started with the simplest approach first. Again - something I've learned many times over, but it's still all too easy to reach for a shiny new architecture instead of reviewing data.</p>
<p>Taking a very general problem like this and tackling it by training models is a tough process, but I always learn a lot by doing so; and hopefully you learned something from this post, or use the resulting model to generate better images.</p>

This uses the CLIP distance of the generated image with SDXL, at 40 steps and the Euler sampler, from the original prompt as the metric.

<ul>
<li>With T5 fine-tuning, the common recommendation is to use Adafactor as an optimizer. Suprisingly, I found that AdamW worked better in my experiments; I suspect this is more to do with learning rate schedule, which I kept both longer and less aggressive than the recommended defaults, which meant that the aggressive beta updating Adafactor is meant to combat don't appear in my experiments.</li>
<li>You can find the rest of the code for prompt upsampling, and the other experiments in <a href="https://github.com/brianfitzgerald/superprompt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this repo</a>. Be warned, it's not very clean!</li>
<li>I filtered Drawbench for any overlap with my augmented dataset, and performed a basic deduplication (n-gram overlap) on the augmented dataset prior to training. The model only works in English, but shouldn't be hard to adapt to other languages. It also has a tendency to repeat itself when generating for long enough but I didn't observe this happening at or below the 77-token limit for SDXL prompts.</li>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.skyvern.com/" rel="nofollow">Skyvern</a> automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions.</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern/blob/main/images/geico_shu_recording_cropped.gif"><img src="https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern/raw/main/images/geico_shu_recording_cropped.gif" data-animated-image=""></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">Traditional approaches to browser automations required writing custom scripts for websites, often relying on DOM parsing and XPath-based interactions which would break whenever the website layouts changed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of only relying on code-defined XPath interactions, Skyvern adds computer vision and LLMs to the mix to parse items in the viewport in real-time, create a plan for interaction and interact with them.</p>
<p dir="auto">This approach gives us a few advantages:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Skyvern can operate on websites it’s never seen before, as it’s able to map visual elements to actions necessary to complete a workflow, without any customized code</li>
<li>Skyvern is resistant to website layout changes, as there are no pre-determined XPaths or other selectors our system is looking for while trying to navigate</li>
<li>Skyvern leverages LLMs to reason through interactions to ensure we can cover complex situations. Examples include:
<ol dir="auto">
<li>If you wanted to get an auto insurance quote from Geico, the answer to a common question “Were you eligible to drive at 18?” could be inferred from the driver receiving their license at age 16</li>
<li>If you were doing competitor analysis, it’s understanding that an Arnold Palmer 22 oz can at 7/11 is almost definitely the same product as a 23 oz can at Gopuff (even though the sizes are slightly different, which could be a rounding error!)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Skyvern was inspired by the Task-Driven autonomous agent design popularized by <a href="https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi">BabyAGI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT">AutoGPT</a> -- with one major bonus: we give Skyvern the ability to interact with websites using browser automation libraries like <a href="https://playwright.dev/" rel="nofollow">Playwright</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Each API request you sent to Skyvern is called a "task". Each task is made up of "steps" which are the individual actions Skyvern takes to complete the task. Each step is made up of "actions" which are the individual interactions Skyvern takes on a particular website.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every time you call the API, you will be given a task_id you can use to find a task within the visualizer. Within each task, you'll be able to interact with each step, and see the specific actions Skyvern took to complete the task.</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition to the actions suggested by the LLM in text form, Skyvern's visualizer also shows the state of the screen at the time of the action, with a 1:1 action to screenshot mapping.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2024/03/12/glassdoor-violates-privacy.html">https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2024/03/12/glassdoor-violates-privacy.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39705788">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I contacted Glassdoor for an account-related issue.  This led to them sending me email that I had to respond to.  <strong>Big mistake.</strong></p>

<p>The TL;DR is: Glassdoor now requires your real name <strong>and will add it to older accounts without your consent if they learn it</strong>, and your only option is to delete your account.  They do not care that this puts people at risk with their employers.  They do not care that this seems to run counter to their own data-privacy policies.</p>



<p>I created my Glassdoor account about ten years ago.  The only information they required at the time was an email address -- or you could sign in with Facebook or Google if you wanted, which I declined to do.  Early on I set some job alerts, including location, as one does on a site with job postings.  I didn't worry about that too much at the time.</p>

<p>After I responded to that support email last week, I found that they had <strong>updated my profile to add my real name and location</strong>, the name pulled from the email From line I didn't think to cloak because <em>who does that?</em>  I never gave consent for that change, and said so explicitly when I objected.  (In what follows, I was so fixated on my <em>name</em> that I didn't immediately notice my <em>city</em> was there too.  I don't know how long it's been there.)</p>

<p>For context, here are some quotes from <a href="https://help.glassdoor.com/s/privacyrequest?language=en_US">their own data policy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a global company, Glassdoor is subject to a variety of privacy laws that confer a range of privacy rights upon our users. We are committed to working to support compliance with the requirements of these global privacy laws and ensuring the rights and protections they offer are available to all of our users regardless of their location. [...]</p>
  
  <p>We allow you to learn about, access, and control the personal data that Glassdoor holds about you. This includes data related to your use of Glassdoor.com, Fishbowlapp.com, and our associated apps. Using the form at the bottom of this page, you can request that Glassdoor allows you to: [...] Rectify your personal data. [...] Delete your personal data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right to withdraw consent for certain specific uses of your personal data on Glassdoor. [...] If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the loophole there -- "if we collected it <em>with your consent</em>".  They haven't explicitly invoked that, but they could and it's slimy.  (I never gave consent, therefore the dependent clause doesn't apply, they could argue.)</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Now, on to the email discussion I had with, through escalations, three people over the course of six days.</p>

<p>First, they said that they are a "verified network" and "we require all users to verify their identity before giving them full access to our platform".  Which parts constitute "full access" were not specified; they seem to mean FishBowl, a Blind-inspired social-media thing they're now doing.  I don't care about that.</p>

<p>This requirement wasn't in place when I created the account -- demonstrably, as I was never required to provide a name.  Sometime since then they changed the rules and my profile was sitting there with a null required field, I guess, until some employee noticed and <em>edited it</em>.  I didn't find a notice of this changed requirement in my saved email, though it's possible I missed it or it got caught in a spam trap or something whenever it happened.  I have no idea how long they've required that.</p>

<p>I replied to that message saying, in part, that I withdraw consent for them to store my name, in accordance with their data policy that they had helpfully provided me a link to.  (Wasn't going to quibble over "withdraw" at that point.  I thought this would be straightforward.  How wrong I was.)</p>

<p>I got a reply from "lead, content and community team" -- I'm eliding employee names in this public post because I have more scruples than they do -- who informed me that though they were "required" to add my name to my profile, this would not affect the anonymous reviews I had posted in the past.  Well I would hope not!  But still, I said, them storing my name along with that data puts me at risk.  I pointed out that we've seen ample evidence that anybody with a juicy online database can be hacked, and the mere presence of that involuntary data was a problem.</p>

<p>The next reply contained this plot twist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So all users will now receive a Fishbowl account once they login to Glassdoor. Yours has already been created. All you need to do is download the Fishbowl app and login with either a social connection, your work email, or phone number to gain access to your account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say what now?  You created and stored my personal information in a <em>second account</em>, and I can only get access to delete it by giving up even more information?  Um, no.  I guess that unsolicited account will just sit there.</p>

<p>(I asked where this was disclosed and was told that would be forthcoming. !!!)</p>

<p>This message went on to tell me that it was "not possible" to edit my name and if I want it gone, my only option is to delete my account.  I responded that I planned to do that after I get my data dump, and in the meantime can they remove or anonymize my name -- reset to last week's level of privacy?  It obviously <em>is</em> possible for them to edit that field because <em>they did</em>.  Users, however, cannot edit it, so I can't fix it myself.</p>

<p>The reply came from "manager, content and community team":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I stand behind the decision that your name has to be placed on your profile and it cannot be reverted or nullified/anonymized from the platform. I am sorry that we disagree on this issue. We treat all users equally when it comes to what is eligible to be placed on the profile and what is not, but we know that there are times our users, such as yourself, may not always agree with us.</p>
  
  <p>If you are not willing to allow your name on your profile, you will again need to complete Data erasure once you are able to. However, we cannot remove this for you or make the changes you wish to see for your name.</p>
  
  <p>This is my final determination. I, as well as multiple members of my team, have reviewed your request several times, and I am considering this matter closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You heard it from the manager of Glassdoor's community team: they treat all users equally badly.  Soon my account will be gone.  If you have one, you might consider doing the same.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Engineers are hopeful that the veteran spacecraft Voyager 1 might have turned a corner after spending the last three months spouting gibberish at controllers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2024/03/13/nasa-engineers-make-progress-toward-understanding-voyager-1-issue/">On March 1</a>, the Voyager team sent a command, dubbed a "poke," to get the probe's Flight Data System (FDS) to try some other sequences in its software in the hope of circumventing whatever had become corrupted.</p>
<p>Readers of a certain vintage will doubtless have memories of <code>poke</code> sheets for various 1980s games. Not that this hack ever used a <code>poke</code> to get <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://skoolkit.ca/disassemblies/jet_set_willy/reference/pokes.html">infinite lives in Jet Set Willy</a>, of course.</p>

    

<p>While Voyager 1's lifespan is not infinite, it has endured far longer than anticipated and might be about to dodge yet another bullet. On March 3, the mission team saw something different in the stream of data returned from the spacecraft, which had been unreadable since December.</p>

        


        

<p>An engineer with the Deep Space Network (DSN) was able to decode it, and by March 10, the team determined that it contained a complete memory dump from the FDS.</p>
<p>The FDS memory read-out contains its code, variables, and science and engineering data for downlink.</p>

        

<p>Prior to NASA's announcement, Dr Suzanne Dodd, project manager for the Voyager Interstellar Mission, said in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2024/03/09/jpls-voyager-team-extremely-hopeful-after-ailing-faraway-craft-shows-signs-of-former-self/">Pasadena Star-News report</a> that the data being transmitted from the probe was "not exactly what we would expect, but they do look like something that can show us that the FDS is at least partially working."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/08/engineers_work_to_revive_voyager/">Work to resolve binary babble from Voyager 1 is ongoing</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/01/lessons_from_the_voyager_probes/">Space exploitation vs space exploration: Humanity has much to learn from the Voyager probes</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/voyager_2_jupiter_research/">44-year-old Voyager 2 data sheds light on solar system's magnetic personalities</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/engineers_work_to_fix_voyager/">NASA engineers scratch heads as Voyager 1 starts spouting cosmic gibberish</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Dodd was referring to the ones and zeroes streaming from the spacecraft. Previously, the probe's telemetry modulation unit (TMU) had begun in mid-December <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/engineers_work_to_fix_voyager/">transmitting</a> a repeating binary pattern as though it was somehow stuck. Engineers reckoned the issue was somewhere within the FDS.</p>
<p>The next step is to study the memory read-out and compare it to one transmitted before the problem arose. A solution to the issue could then be devised.</p>
<p>One of the original Voyager scientists, Garry Hunt, told <em>The Register</em> that engineers at JPL were determined to get communications with the stricken probe working again: "This requires both skills and patience with the long time between communication instructions and response."</p>
<p>The time lag is a problem. A command from Earth takes 22.5 hours to reach the probe, and the same period is needed again for a response. This means a 45-hour wait to see what a given command might have done.</p>

        

<p>The availability of skills is also an issue. Many of the engineers who worked on the project - Voyager 1 launched in 1977 - are no longer around, and the team that remains is faced with trawling through reams of decades-old documents to deal with unanticipated issues arising today. ®</p>

<p>Tufts, like Brown and many other colleges, uses a piece of software (protected under an <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6963857B1/">expired patent</a> that’s older than both of us) from a company called Atrium. Their marketing claims, in contrast to “legacy” systems, that it will “delight” users. As we will see, the irony of claiming Atrium’s software isn’t “legacy” is just too good.</p>
<p>Tufts calls their installation “JumboCash” and it can be accessed at <code>www.jumbocash.net</code>. (Don’t forget the <code>www.</code>—it won’t resolve without it.) However, the site that is ultimately loaded is determined by the <code>cid</code> (campus/college/customer ID?) parameter. Here’s Brown’s portal loaded through Tufts’ domain: <a href="https://www.jumbocash.net/index.php?cid=248"><code>www.jumbocash.net/index.php?cid=248</code></a>. You can even use the raw IP: <a href="http://3.131.28.213/index.php?cid=248"><code>3.131.28.213/index.php?cid=248</code></a> in all its <code>http://</code> glory.</p>

<p>The portal is really a wrapper around the reanimated corpse of much older software, its rotting flesh visible through nonsensical decisions and the occasional XML response.</p>
<p>The first thing Ben and I noticed when logging into the JumboCash portal is that the session key is stored as a URL parameter, just like the <code>cid</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>https://www.jumbocash.net/index.php?skey=20613b5ef40f04e15ecc5d5f56513b92&amp;cid=233</span></span></code></pre>
<p>While a cookie is set, it is ignored. You can copy the URL into a private browsing window (or change the domain to another school’s) and it will work just fine; remove the <code>skey</code> parameter and it won’t. Change to another IP address, and it…breaks? Clearly some attempt at security was made, and it feels a bit too complex to be the result of purely ignorance.</p>
<h2 id="guest-access">Guest access</h2>
<p>Because we can’t instruct students to copy-and-paste the URL (and thus their session key), we needed another way to access students’ transaction history. We turned our attention to JumboCash’s guest access feature.</p>
<p>Presumably intended for parents to reload their children’s accounts, it allows students to given an email address access and choose from a deceptively fine-grained set of permissions. I say “deceptively” because guests can change their own permissions and even add other guests. “Disabling” a guest’s access doesn’t actually restrict any features, and guests can re-enable themselves.</p>
<img src="https://jero.zone/_astro/add-guest.CRsawLLW_15bnN7.webp" alt="" width="2664" height="2016" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>Adding a new guest sends them an email with a password. We purchased the excellent domain <code>jumbo.cash</code> and had students add <code><a href="https://jero.zone/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="117664746265517b647c737e3f72706279">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> to their accounts. We intercepted the emails with Postmark and pulled out the password, running a job to log in and scrape the requisite information.</p>
<figure><img src="https://jero.zone/_astro/email.CY2KmnK-_wyoPW.webp" alt="The email from JumboCash is pretty much the same" width="1928" height="830" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><figcaption>The email from JumboCash is pretty much the same</figcaption></figure>
<p>When it came to scraping the transaction history itself, we finally caught a small break: the portal allowed CSV export, making our job a bit easier. However, an HTML table, which is essentially XML, wouldn’t have been much trouble.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-hurdle">The final hurdle</h2>
<p>At the time, we decided adding a guest to Atrium’s “delightful” portal was already enough friction and decided not to ask students for their email. In hindsight, we should have collected them at the beginning and given students a custom <code>@jumbo.cash</code> email address to keep things straight.</p>
<p>To achieve this ✨magical✨ experience, we needed to figure out students’ email addresses from their name, since that’s all the portal seems to have. After an unsuccessful attempt at scraping Tufts’ Outlook directory, we took a closer look at the <a href="https://directory.tufts.edu/">public directory</a>, which includes the names and emails of every student. Popping the hood, it makes a nice little request to a JSON API, which appears to be a wrapper around one or more LDAP directories. But unfortunately, it’s not allowed to be that easy.</p>
<p>The JumboCash portal displays students’ legal first and last names (e.g. Benjamin not Ben). The directory, on the other hand, can only be searched by students’ preferred names. Though not displayed in the interface, its API does return their legal names in <code>Lastname, Firstname M.</code> format.</p>
<p>Our first idea was to search the directory by last name and lazily use the PHP standard library’s <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.levenshtein.php">levenshtein() function</a> to find the closest match. However, this doesn’t work well with common or short last names—for example, “Li” is not only common but is included in lots of names like Julian and Colin and returns dozens of matches. Since the directory’s pagination was broken (while I have a theory as to why, it looks like it’s already been fixed), we couldn’t page through to find an exact match. Our gross solution was to try a bunch of formats: <code>Lastname</code>, <code>F. Lastname</code>, etc. and pick the closest name. This works…enough of the time.</p>
<h2 id="logging-in">Logging in</h2>
<p>Actually logging into JumboCash required two HTTP requests and four hours of reverse engineering. I spent so long on it that Ben, who had already scraped JumboCash for <a href="https://ben.page/swipes">a previous project</a>, started working on a Puppeteer solution in parallel.</p>
<p>But first, here’s how authentication actually works. A <code>POST</code> request is sent to <code>/login.php</code> with a <code>username</code> and <code>loginphrase</code>, which creates a session key. Then, second, a <code>GET</code> request to the same page “activates” the token. Failing to do this second request puts the UI into a weird “half-logged-in” state.</p>
<p>The first request returns, instead of a <code>Location</code> header, a snippet of JavaScript (<code>&lt;script type='JavaScript'&gt;</code> to be exact) to rediect to another page. The second page (also <code>/login.php</code>, just with some URL parameters) contains a loader and some nasty JavaScript.</p>

<p>While abnormal, this dance wouldn’t have taken the hours it did had one of our tools not <em>lied</em> to us. When using HTTPie to poke around the site, it would render the HTML returned by the first <code>POST</code> request, including executing the JavaScript it contained. However, while HTTPie’s webview still made the request (as a normal browser, without any of our headers), it didn’t show that it had.</p>
<p>We were baffled as to why session keys generated with requests from HTTPie worked, but those using even the cURL code it generated did not. As it turned out, HTTPie was secretly making the second “activation” request. HTTPie’s webview should probably not execute JavaScript, especially without showing the result. (It would also be nice if the webview stayed disabled instead of turning itself back on after every request.)</p>
<p>The JavaScript on the intermediary “loading” screen very responsibly checks if the browser supports the newfangled <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> API before polling an XML API for the status of the <code>skey</code>. While the concatenation in this script (included below) is out of control, I was luckily unable to find an XSS. That would have been quite fun, given the number of <code>.edu</code> domains this software runs on.</p>

<p>With all the reverse-engineering out of the way, we had a lot of fun designing the actual product. We went for a vivid and bold design, similar to Spotify Wrapped. Given how much time we spent on everything else (and a solid 8 hours of sleep!), I think it turned out alright.</p>
<figure><img src="https://jero.zone/_astro/screenshots.CFONoMTY_5THbR.webp" alt="The app&amp;#x27;s interface behaved like Instagram Stories" width="1494" height="939" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><figcaption>The app's interface behaved like Instagram Stories</figcaption></figure>
<p>We put posters up around campus and, as Ben details in <a href="https://ben.page/wrapped">his post</a>, made a few anonymous posts on Sidechat pretending to be users. They went (relatively) viral, and because we’d conspicuously included the URL on every slide, hundreds of students flocked to try it for themselves.</p>
<p>Overall, JumboHack was a lot of fun! Taking the train down from Providence (<a href="https://www.mbta.com/fares/commuter-rail-weekends">for just 10 bucks!</a>), hanging out with Ben, and taking home some AirPods was a great way to spend my Presidents’ Day weekend.</p>

<article id="post-1758">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>My post a couple of months ago about the long lunch break that French kids get (between one and a half and two hours) elicited a lot of great responses. By Ministry of Education regulation, French children spend a minimum of 30 minutes eating (it’s often more), and then usually have at least an hour to play, if not more. Read the original post <a href="http://wp.me/p2fsgD-8q">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we’re back in Vancouver, my daughter’s lunch period is one hour long, including 10 minutes to eat. Yep, 10 minutes (from 12:00 to 12:10 in the school schedule, to be precise). Call me crazy, but I don’t think this is enough time.</p>
<p>Learning doesn’t stop in the lunchroom, in my opinion. If we are giving our children a slow lunch break, we are teaching them that food is an inconvenience, and eating is an interruption in the day. We encourage them to gobble their food, when the research shows that eating more slowly is healthier. In fact, the French spend longer eating, but eat less–in part because that ‘fullness feeling’  (satiety signal) needs about 20 minutes to get from your stomach to your brain. But the French also spend longer eating because they believe that it’s important to teach kids to eat well – it’s a life skill, like reading.</p>
<p>They also believe that eating is a wonderful social time which kids can enjoy (and that eating together creates a ‘positive peer pressure’ environment in which kids are more likely to eat well, and try new foods). Here’s a lovely quote from the school website in the town of Versailles (yes, home of the castle):</p>
<p><em>“Mealtime is a particularly important moment in a child’s day. Our responsibility is to provide children with healthy, balanced meals; to develop their sense of taste; to help children, complementing what they learn at home, to make good food choices without being influenced by trends, media, and marketing; and to teach them the relationship between eating habits and health. But above all else, we aim to enable children to spend joyful, convivial moments together, to learn a ‘savoir-vivre’ (which roughly translates as ‘know-how about life’, or ‘life skill’), to make time for communication, social exchange, and learning about society’s rules–so that they can socialize and cultivate friendships.”<br>
</em></p>
<p>Food for thought.</p>
<p>After chatting with Amber Strocel, she posted a <a href="http://www.strocel.com/short-school-lunch-periods/#comment-120911">thoughtful discussion of school lunches</a> on her blog. She included some great ideas and examples of strategies that schools are using. Should we put playtime before lunchtime, so kids aren’t rushing out the door to the playground? Should we extend the lunch hour, or count part of the lunch break as instructional time for teachers? Check out her blog for some great ideas about what we might be doing differently. My next blog post will explore what we might do about this, focusing on what the Slow Food movement and the school reform movements might learn from one another.</p>
<p>I’d also love to hear your thoughts, and hopefully inspiring examples about what innovative things schools are doing to make that kids are learning <em>how</em> to eat well, as well as what to eat.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-433833">


<h3>from the <i>fix-your-own-shit</i> dept</h3>

<p>Oregon has officially become the seventh state (behind New York, California, Massachusetts, Colorado, Maine, and Minnesota) to <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2024/03/oregon-passes-expansive-right-to-repair-law-defying-tech-industry-concerns.html#:~:text=Oregon%20became%20the%20fourth%20state,required%20to%20repair%20their%20gadgets.">pass “right to repair” legislation</a>, making it easier and more affordable for consumers to independently repair their own electronics. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Measures/Overview/SB1596">bill</a>, which passed the Oregon Senate last month 25-5 and the House on Monday 42-13, is a bit more robust than the versions passed in earlier states. Among other things, the bill requires that device manufacturers make parts, tools and repair manuals available to consumers and third-party repair shops on “fair and reasonable terms.”</p>
<p>But it also takes aim at “<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a>,” or the practice of preventing you from replacing device parts without the approval of a company or its restrictive software. Apple, which <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/21/despite-some-progress-ifixit-says-apples-dedication-to-right-to-repair-still-sucks/">routinely uses this practice to try and monopolize repair</a>, lobbied <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-is-lobbying-against-right-to-repair-again/">extensively against the Oregon bill</a>. As usual, under the (false) claim that eliminating parts pairing would put public safety and security at risk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We remain very concerned about the risk to consumers imposed by the broad parts-pairing restrictions in this bill,” John Perry, principal secure repair architect for Apple, said at a legislative hearing last month.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reality, Apple is concerned that the crackdown on “parts pairing” will further erode the company’s lucrative efforts to monopolize repair and slow down the rate of shiny new phone sales. Apple has generally tried to pretend than its done a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/16/apples-180-on-right-to-repair-was-more-of-a-90-degree-bend/">complete 180 on right to repair</a>, when it’s generally been more of a 40 degree turn toward <em>slightly</em> more reasonable policies. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Google supported Oregon’s legislation, and has more genuinely been <a href="https://www.404media.co/youtube-commenters-and-the-grassroots-movement-pushed-google-to-support-right-to-repair/">migrating away from the practice of parts pairing</a>. Activist and consumer groups like iFixit praised the bill’s passage in a statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I’m beyond proud of my home state for passing the strongest-yet electronics Right to Repair bill,” Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, said in a statement. “By applying to most products made after 2015, this law will open up repair for the things Oregonians need to get fixed right now. And by limiting the repair-restricting practices of parts pairing, it protects fixing for years to come. We won’t stop fighting until everyone, everywhere has these rights.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oregon’s bill is notable because it wasn’t aggressively watered down post-passage like some right to repair legislation (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/17/more-details-on-how-tech-lobbyists-lobotomized-nys-right-to-repair-law-with-governor-kathy-hochuls-help/">See: New York</a>). It’s expected the bill will face industry lawsuits. Still, right to reform remains one reform bright spot in a country where consumer protection has been on the chopping block for the better part of the last quarter century. </p>

        <p><em>(The following is a post by Helen Fedor, Reference Specialist in the European Division.)</em></p>
<p>The most famous work by Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek (1883-1923), and probably the best known work of Czech literature, is “Osudy dobrého vojáka Švejka za světové války” (The adventures of the good soldier Švejk during the world war), or as it is known in its English translation, “The Good Soldier Švejk.” The most translated Czech novel—read in some 60 languages—it satirizes bureaucracy, the military, and war.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4105"><a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/54025327?loclr=blogint" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://blogs.loc.gov/international-collections/files/2018/03/SvejkGoodii-300x272.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="272" srcset="https://blogs.loc.gov/international-collections/files/2018/03/SvejkGoodii-300x272.jpg 300w, https://blogs.loc.gov/international-collections/files/2018/03/SvejkGoodii.jpg 761w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption>Jaroslav Hašek. “Osudy dobrého vojáka Švejka za světové války.” Prague: K. Synek, 1948-49. Illustration by Josef Lada. Švejk rubs ointment into his knee while the cleaning lady tells him of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand—an event that triggered World War I and brought about Švejk’s many adventures.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Set in Austria-Hungary, the book opens with the 1914 news that Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria (1863-1914) has been assassinated in Sarajevo, an event that would trigger World War I. Josef Švejk, the antihero, enlists in the army and spends the war blundering from one ludicrous adventure to another. He seems earnest in his desire to carry out his orders, yet takes them to extremes and frustrates his superiors. For example, when Švejk is assigned to the barracks in České Budějovice (in southern Bohemia) as a prelude to going to the front, he manages to miss all the trains heading there. In his ‘zeal’ to reach the barracks and join the rest of his battalion, Švejk meanders all over southern Bohemia, vainly searching for České Budějovice, gets arrested as a suspected spy and deserter, and is escorted to the barracks.</p>
<p>Švejk bears more than a passing resemblance to the author, Hašek, who loved practical jokes, had a checkered career, and was himself drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army. Hašek’s pretended suicide attempt (by jumping off Charles Bridge into the Vltava River in Prague) ended with the police taking him to a mental institution. Also, during elections to the Austro-Hungarian parliament, Hašek ran for office as a member of his own newly founded Party of Moderate and Peaceful Progress Within the Limits of the Law. He eventually joined the anarchist movement and was arrested and imprisoned more than once.</p>

Synek, 1948-49. Illustration by Josef Lada. Two soldiers escorted Švejk to the home of the chaplain for “spiritual consolation” before his hanging. By the time Švejk and his escorts got there, the soldiers were drunk, and Švejk ended up guarding them while the chaplain (himself drunk) unsuccessfully tried to telephone the barracks, mistaking a coat rack for his nonexistent telephone.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Hašek planned to write the Švejk story in six parts. The first three were published 1921-23, but Hašek died in 1923, while working on part four. After his death, his publisher asked journalist and humorist Karel Vaněk to complete the work. Vaněk finished part four and later also wrote about Švejk’s adventures in Russian captivity and during the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>The most famous illustrator of Švejk’s adventures was Josef Lada. His classic illustrations are instantly recognizable and have come to define Švejk, even though Hašek apparently never saw Lada’s drawings. A more recent illustrator is the delightful Petr Urban whose artwork is shown here.</p>
<p>Two other sequels to the Švejk story were set in the Nazi-controlled Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (1939-45); both were written in the 1940s by anonymous authors. The first was the English-language “Švejk in the Protectorate,” published in London, 1942, by the exile publishing house The Czechoslovak. This small booklet begins with an account of the 1939 assassination attempt on Hitler: “So they’ve nearly killed our Adolf…,” echoing the opening words of Hašek’s novel. The preface of this work describes it as “a cruel and bitter satire where laughter is mingled with the fighting spirit of revenge and hatred.”</p>

<p>The other work, “Loyální občan Josef Švejk v protektoráte Čechy a Morava” (Loyal citizen Josef Švejk in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia), was published in Prague by the unknown ‘Medius,’ in 1948. Only part one of this work was ever issued. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was established on March 16, 1939, after Germany had occupied Czechoslovakia. Germany had already annexed the Sudetenland, composed of territory in the northern, southern, and western parts of the Czech Lands (Bohemia and Moravia), in October 1938; an independent Slovak Republic had been established on March 14, 1939.</p>
<p>The first English translation of Švejk was published by Paul Selver in 1930, but it was an abridged version that reduced the book to less than two-thirds of the original. Perhaps the best known English-language translation of Hašek’s book is &nbsp;by Cecil Parrott, originally published in 1973. His translation used Lada’s original drawings, and included maps showing Švejk’s travels.</p>

<p>The very first translation of Hašek’s book however, was into German, by Grete Reiner, in 1926. “Die Abenteuer des braven Soldaten Schwejk während des Weltkrieges” (The adventures of the good soldier Švejk during the world war) was published in Prague, which had a large German-speaking population.</p>
<p>Ms. Reiner, a native of Prague who was later killed at Auschwitz, was the executive editor of the anti-fascist magazine, “Deutsche Volkszeitung,” (German’s people daily ), and was largely responsible for spreading Švejk’s fame throughout Europe. Her translation, burned by the Nazis in 1933, was said to be one of playwright Bertolt Brecht’s favorite books. In 1927, Brecht himself wrote a stage adaptation based on the first three parts of the Švejk story. The songs for this production were written by Hanns Eisler, an Austrian who later composed the national anthem of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).</p>

<p>Since then, Švejk has inspired further plays, films, comic books, several restaurants (in Prague, throughout the Czech Republic, and abroad), statues, an opera, TV adaptations, a BBC radio broadcast, an animated film, and books such as Joseph Heller’s “Catch-22.” No doubt Švejk will continue to inspire future generations.</p>

          <p>
            I’ve had the curiosity to explore radio communication protocols for
            a few years now, ever since I’ve started fiddling around with an
            RTL-SDR dongle. I always had the goal of figuring out how data is
            transmitted in remote controls (car key fobs particularly), trying
            replay attacks, and other possible attack vectors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite capturing some car key fob signals over the years, I haven’t
            had the chance of doing meaningful analysis on them, and that’s
            mainly due to the limited access I had to cars I could test on.
          </p>

          <p>
            This blog post aims to bring the uninitiated through my journey of
            having successfully reverse engineered and replayed a car’s key fob
            signal last year, starting from the very basic concepts of radio
            frequency and going all the way through my entire thought process
            while I was working on this project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another goal I guess is to also prove that most cars are definitely
            not that easy to steal using replay attacks (unless it’s a
            <a href="https://rollingpwn.github.io/rolling-pwn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Honda</a>, lol), despite Canada’s recent ban of the Flipper Zero, and them
            claiming the risk warrants the ban of a device made of very cheap
            and accessible wireless modules.
          </p>

          <h3 id="hardware-used">Hardware used</h3>

          <h4 id="rtl-sdr">RTL-SDR</h4>

          <p>
            I’ve had my first dive into the world of radio frequency back in
            2016 when I learned that a very cheap (~$10) terrestrial TV/radio
            USB dongle can easily be turned into a multi-purpose RF receiver to
            inspect and decode pretty much anything happening in the range of 24
            to 1750 MHz - this device is widely known as ‘RTL-SDR’:
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/rtl-sdr.png" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            The secret why this cheap device is very powerful, is the simple
            fact that it uses a chip which allows the use of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SDR (software defined radio)</a>. It turns out that this chip (RTL2832U) allowed skipping the
            signal processing that usually happens on the hardware-level which
            converts the raw signal into ‘meaningful’ data to be used by the
            host device (a TV/radio feed in the case of this device).
          </p>

          <p>
            By having direct access to the raw I/Q data, we can receive,
            visualize and save pretty much any signal in raw format, without
            needing to know the specifics of the RF configuration used to
            transmit (modulation, bandwidth, data rate, etc.), since we can
            analyze/process the raw data ourselves. This effectively gives us a
            window to scan for virtually any activity on the radio spectrum
            under the 1.7 GHz frequency.
          </p>

          <h4 id="flipper-zero">Flipper Zero</h4>

          <p>
            The Flipper Zero is an electronic gadget which attracted a lot of
            attention lately for being a hacker/troll’s ultimate Swiss knife,
            since it hosts a bunch of wireless hardware modules that allow
            ‘interacting with’ everyday electronics and consumer appliances.
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/flipper-zero.jpg" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            The module that’s interesting to us in the Flipper is the Sub-GHz
            one, which is essentially a
            <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/CC1101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CC1101</a>
            chip that supports frequencies that are typically used in wireless
            consumer devices, and that are under 1 GHz, hence the name of the
            module.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s important to note, however, that one could just buy the CC1101
            module separately ($5+) and make it work with an Arduino/Raspberry
            Pi or simply a USB-to-TTL adapter, but the Flipper is definitely
            cooler and more practical. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
          </p>

          <h4 id="cc1101-vs-rtl2832u">CC1101 vs RTL2832U</h4>

          <p>
            The CC1101 chip in the Flipper Zero, unlike the RTL2832U chip that’s
            on the RTL-SDR, is actually a transceiver module (supports sending
            and receiving), which means the Flipper Zero is the device we’ll be
            using to send signals.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the CC1101 chip doesn’t support SDR, which means that it
            would only send back data that it had completely processed. In other
            terms, the CC1101 will only be useful to us if we set the right RF
            configuration of the transmitted signal.
          </p>

          <h3 id="radio-frequency-signal-basics-oversimplified">
            Radio frequency signal basics (<em>oversimplified</em>)
          </h3>

          <p>
            Now that we know a bit about the hardware we’ll be using, let’s go
            through some minimum basic concepts that are needed to tackle this
            subject.
          </p>

          <h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>

          <p>
            Radio frequency transmissions use radio waves, which are a type of
            electromagnetic radiation, in order to send signals.
          </p>

          <p>
            These waves are of a typically higher frequency than the original
            signal we’re transmitting and this is to ensure reliability in
            sending data, since signals can have varying characteristics that
            make sending them as radio waves impractical and susceptible to
            interference and weak travel distance.
          </p>

          <p>
            These waves are called carrier waves, since they are essentially
            modified to carry the original signal reliably through the air (more
            on this below).
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s take a look at <em>some</em> of the basic information needed
            to send/receive a radio signal:
          </p>

          <h4 id="frequency">Frequency</h4>

          <p>
            This one is self-explanatory, it’s the number of times a second a
            carrier wave occurs. Frequency affects the wavelength (the higher
            the frequency the shorter the waves). This parameter is also
            typically used to define the communication channel.
          </p>

          <h4 id="modulation">Modulation</h4>

          <p>
            This refers to the way a signal is represented in the radio waves.
            The two most common modulation types, which I’m sure most people
            already know of, are:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>AM</strong> (<em>amplitude</em> modulation) and
            <strong>FM</strong> (<em>frequency</em> modulation).
          </p>

          <p>
            The difference between these is simply the fact that for AM, the
            signal is modulated (encoded) in <em>amplitude</em> (or strength),
            which roughly means that the <em>change</em> in signal
            <em>strength</em> on the carrier waves is how the data is
            represented.
          </p>

          <p>
            For FM, as one can guess, the data is rather modulated in
            <em>frequency</em>. So, changes in the frequency of the waves are
            used here to determine the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is well visualized in this animation I found on Wikipedia (the
            ‘signal’ graph represents the data we’re trying to transmit):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/radio-fm-vs-am-anim.gif" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            Modulations can also have different subtypes and characteristics
            which we’ll talk about later on.
          </p>

          <h4 id="bandwidth">Bandwidth</h4>

          <p>
            This refers to the range of frequencies occupied by a modulated RF
            signal, or in other words, the difference between the highest and
            the lowest frequency a modulated signal can have. This essentially
            dictates the amount of data a signal can carry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the rest of the radio characteristics are not terribly
            important for us to know at this stage, let’s move on to the fun
            stuff!
          </p>

          <h3 id="visual-analysis">Visual analysis</h3>

          <h4 id="sdr">SDR#</h4>

          <p>
            <a href="https://airspy.com/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SDR#</a>
            is a free, intuitive, computer-based DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
            application for SDR written in C# with a focus on performance. It
            allows visualizing the radio spectrum in real time, and supports the
            demodulation of some common modulations. It also supports
            third-party plugins for custom modulations and integrations.
          </p>

          <p>
            We’ll be using this software for our signal discovery and initial
            analysis phase.
          </p>

          <h4 id="signal-discovery">Signal discovery</h4>

          <p>
            By tuning into the 433.92 MHz frequency with our RTL-SDR dongle
            plugged in (using the WinUSB driver instead of the stock DVB-T one),
            we can watch the activity of most remote controls in close proximity
            (433.92 MHz being the standard unregulated frequency in the EU and
            other neighboring countries, including Morocco, where I live).
          </p>

          <p>
            On each car key fob button press we instantly notice that there’s 3
            successive short bursts generated, as can be seen on the waterfall
            view under the spectrum visualizer:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/sdrsharp-key-fob-433.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            <small>SDR# visualizing the key fob signal (X axis = frequency, Y axis =
              signal intensity)</small>
          </p>

          <p>
            We can also notice that the signal has two major ‘peaks’ on both
            sides of the 433.92&nbsp;MHz frequency (the red line in the middle is the
            exact tuning frequency).
          </p>

          <p>
            Doing some research on common modulation schemes, we come across
            2-FSK that sounds interesting:
          </p>

          <h4 id="2-fsk">2-FSK</h4>

          <p>
            FSK stands for Frequency-Shift Keying, which is a frequency
            modulation scheme in which data is encoded on a carrier signal by
            periodically shifting the frequency of the carrier between several
            discrete frequencies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pretty straightforward so far, sounds like we’re dealing with FM
            here.
          </p>

          <p>
            The interesting part is the ‘2’ however, which here stands for the
            number of channels used in the encoding. So, we’re actually encoding
            binary data in two separate frequencies here, one for the
            <strong>0</strong> and the other for the <strong>1</strong>, which
            would explain the two peaks we’re noticing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> One might wonder what the other
            smaller ‘peaks’ are in that screen capture - those are basically
            unwanted frequencies that are generated accidentally by the emitter
            chip, due to the cheap nature of the hardware, and due to the very
            close proximity of the remote and the antenna. So, it’s just a bunch
            of ‘noise’ that we can safely ignore.
          </p>

          <h3 id="practical-analysis">Practical analysis</h3>

          <p>
            Now that we checked what the signal looks like visually, let’s
            explore how we can work on analyzing it in order to read the bits
            from the RF waves in hopes to spot some sort of
            structure/consistency.
          </p>

          <h4 id="universal-radio-hacker">Universal Radio Hacker</h4>

          <p>
            As the README of its repository states, the
            <a href="https://github.com/jopohl/urh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Universal Radio Hacker (URH)</a>
            is a complete open-source suite for wireless protocol investigation
            with native support for many common SDRs. URH allows easy
            demodulation of signals combined with an automatic detection of
            modulation parameters making it a breeze to identify the bits and
            bytes that fly over the air.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is precisely the software we need to decode radio waves into
            bits.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we open URH, we’re invited to either open a file or record
            directly from a device.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before recording, we have to select the source device, and set some
            basic radio parameters (I actually only made sure to put the right
            frequency and left everything else as default):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-record-dialog-rtlsdr.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            After recording a signal, URH will try to autodetect the right
            configuration to use when decoding the radio waves.
          </p>

          <p>
            On my initial recordings, I wasn’t able to get URH to find the right
            parameters for me, which gave me wrong results. I have however later
            figured out that recording multiple repetitive signals in one go
            increases the chance that URH will figure out the right
            configuration, which turned out to be in my case: 50 samples/symbol,
            FSK.
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-interpretation.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            Zooming in on one of the signals, we notice the 3 bursts we
            identified on SDR# (the second of which is made of 3 separate ones -
            so we have 5 sections to analyze now):
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-zoom-in.png" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            For each of these sections, a bit sequence is automatically
            extracted, which we can also convert to hex for a better
            visualization:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-signal-zoom-in-hex.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            We can already notice a lot of consistency and repeating patterns in
            the bytes, which is a sign that we’re on the right path.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, to my eyes, we’re still missing something here, because we
            notice the same 5&nbsp;hex digits being repeated, with a lot of 0x55
            bytes (01010101) also, which is pretty intriguing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Going over to the next tab labeled ‘Analysis’, we can see the bytes
            we’ve just extracted from each burst, each represented in a line,
            and there’s a decoding option that shows up with a bunch of curious
            algorithms:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-analysis-decoding-options.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            By brute forcing my way and trying them consecutively, I noticed
            that one of them (Manchester II) converted all the 0x55 bytes to
            null ones, and without producing any decoding errors:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-manchester-decoded.png" alt="">

          <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Manchester</a>
            is a very simple digital modulation scheme that ensures that the
            signal never remains at logic low or logic high for an extended
            period of time, and also converts the data signal into a
            data-plus-synchronization signal (for
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_recovery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clock recovery</a>).
          </p>

          <p>
            These characteristics are very useful when sending digital data over
            analog mediums that tend to be susceptible to noise and
            interference.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Manchester, binary data is encoded in two opposite bits,
            therefore:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>0</strong> becomes <strong>01</strong> and
            <strong>1</strong> becomes <strong>10</strong> (or the other way
            around, depending on the convention):
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>Let’s go back and continue our investigation.</p>

          <p>
            By doing some manual examination and comparison of the different
            captures, we’re able to note that each button press generates a
            signal with the following characteristics:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              A <span>long burst</span> with no data
              (decodes to 100 null bytes).
            </li>
            <li>
              3 bursts which look very similar with only 2 bytes partially
              <span>changing</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <span>final burst</span> which is
              shorter but still looks fairly similar to the previous 3 bursts.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-initial-signal-structure-highlight.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            I decided to look more closely at the 3 bursts (let’s call them
            packets) in the middle since they seem to be the important part of
            the signal, and I was quickly able to spot what seems to be an
            <span>incremental ID</span> which
            increases by 1 on each new signal:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-incremental-id-spotted.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            To be able to move forward with our analysis, we must learn about a
            very important remote control security mechanism:
          </p>

          <h4 id="rolling-codes">Rolling codes</h4>

          <p>
            A rolling code is used in keyless entry systems to prevent a simple
            form of replay attack, where an eavesdropper records the
            transmission and replays it at a later time to cause the receiver to
            ‘unlock’. Such systems are typical in garage door openers and
            keyless car entry systems. More on
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The gist of this system is that the key and the car both ‘agree’ on
            a cryptographically secure algorithm in order to generate rolling
            codes that are used to authenticate the remote.
          </p>

          <p>
            These keys are generated and tracked using a <em>counter</em> which
            has to stay in sync between the remote and the car. This ensures
            that the car doesn’t reuse an old key, and that the remote always
            generates fresh keys.
          </p>

          <p>
            An example of a rolling code implementation is pictured below
            <small>(credits:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P_Wgl89jPU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RuhrSec 2017</a>)</small>:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/rolling-code-explanation.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>uid</strong>: ID of the car/remote link</li>
            <li>
              <strong>enc<sub>k</sub></strong>: Implementation of the rolling code algorithm
            </li>
            <li><strong>ctr</strong>: The car’s counter</li>
            <li><strong>ctr’</strong>: The remote’s counter</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The validity window permits the remote to not go out of sync if the
            car doesn’t happen to receive the signal (typically with a max of
            255 out-of-range button presses on most implementations, after which
            the remote has to be manually resynchronized).
          </p>

          <p>Alright, let’s go back to the drawing board.</p>

          <p>
            Since we now know that rolling codes are
            <em>cryptographically</em> secure, it becomes easy for us to spot
            the
            <span>part of the signal</span>
            responsible for this implementation (which would be the one with the
            highest entropy):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-rolling-code-spotted.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            We can also make the assumption that the
            <span>incremental ID</span> we’ve
            identified earlier is the counter for the rolling code system. As it
            also conveniently sits right next to the code.
          </p>

          <p>
            By comparing lock and unlock signals, I was also able to quickly
            spot <span>the byte</span> responsible for the
            command (8 = unlock, 4 = lock):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-command-byte-spotted.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            Now all that’s left for us to guess from the signal’s ‘variable
            parts’ are the two <span>red changes</span> we
            marked earlier:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>1)</strong> For the first one, we notice that the same
            values repeat themselves across the other captured signals.
          </p>

          <p>Converting the 3 values to binary, we notice the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x6: <strong>01</strong>10</li>
            <li>0xA: <strong>10</strong>10</li>
            <li>0xE: <strong>11</strong>10</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Interesting, looks as if it’s packing some sort of sequence number
            for the packets.
          </p>

          <p>And what if we check the final (4th) packet as well?</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x13: <strong>100</strong>11</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Yup, our theory seems to check out
            <small>(ignore the lowest bit that changed here)</small>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>2)</strong> Let’s guess the last byte now.</p>

          <p>
            We can notice that this one not only changes for each packet, but it
            does so completely across all signals as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seeing that this is the last byte on the packet and that it changes
            pretty randomly, leads me to suspect this being a checksum.
          </p>

          <p>
            One thing we can try doing is a XOR of this byte with the other byte
            we just analyzed, to see if we can end up with a static value (since
            pretty much <em>everything</em> besides these two bytes actually
            stays <em>static</em> when it comes to the 3 rolling code packets).
          </p>

          <p>Let’s try with these two examples:</p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-checksum-theory-test.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>Example 1:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x06 ^ 0xB9 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
            <li>0x0A ^ 0xB5 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
            <li>0x0E ^ 0xB1 = <strong>0xBF</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Example 2:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>0x06 ^ 0xCC = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
            <li>0x0A ^ 0xC0 = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
            <li>0x0E ^ 0xC4 = <strong>0xCA</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Bingo. This is definitely a XOR checksum.</p>

          <p>
            By applying XOR on all the bytes of the packets, we notice that the
            value always ends up being off by 1:
          </p>

          <p><img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-bad-checksum.png" alt=""></p>

          <p>
            This leads us to conclude that the first 2 bytes of the packet are
            likely excluded from the checksum (which is where the 1 is coming
            from):
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-synchronization-bytes.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>
            And this actually makes sense, since these bytes would act here as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncword" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">syncword</a>
            to synchronize the receiver and indicate the beginning of the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you’re wondering about the utility of the
            initial <span>long burst</span> highlighted in
            yellow in the captures - that one serves to basically wake up the
            radio receiver and prepare it to start receiving data (since it goes
            in an idle low power state on inactivity). And if you’re also
            wondering why the remote sends 3 packets with roughly the same data,
            it’s simply to insure some sort of reliability. In case one of the
            packets gets corrupted on the way (which we saw happen on an earlier
            screenshot).
          </p>

          <h4 id="final-result">Final result</h4>

          <p>
            After labeling the rest of the bytes to my best guess, this is the
            result I ended up with:
          </p>

          <p>
            <img src="https://i.0x44.cc/b/urh-final-labelization.png" alt="">
          </p>

          <p>Neat. We’ve just reverse engineered a car key fob signal.</p>

          <p>
            Tune in next time when I (hopefully) write about how I integrated
            support for this signal format on the Flipper Zero in order to be
            able to read, re-serialize, and replay it.
          </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Closing arguments in the trial between various people and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright">Craig Wright</a> over whether he's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> are wrapping up today, amongst a bewildering array of presented evidence. But one utterly astonishing aspect of this lawsuit is that expert witnesses for <em>both</em> sides agreed that much of the digital evidence provided by Craig Wright was unreliable in one way or another, generally including indications that it wasn't produced at the point in time it claimed to be. And it's fascinating reading through the subtle (and, in some cases, not so subtle) ways that that's revealed.</p><p>One of the pieces of evidence entered is screenshots of data from <a href="https://myob.com/">Mind Your Own Business</a>, a business management product that's been around for some time. Craig Wright relied on screenshots of various entries from this product to support his claims around having controlled meaningful number of bitcoin before he was publicly linked to being Satoshi. If these were authentic then they'd be strong evidence linking him to the mining of coins before Bitcoin's public availability. Unfortunately the screenshots themselves weren't contemporary - the metadata shows them being created in 2020. This wouldn't fundamentally be a problem (it's entirely reasonable to create new screenshots of old material), as long as it's possible to establish that the material shown in the screenshots was created at that point. Sadly, well.</p><p>One part of the disclosed information was an email that contained a zip file that contained a raw database in the format used by MYOB. Importing that into the tool allowed an audit record to be extracted - this record showed that the relevant entries had been added to the database in 2020, shortly before the screenshots were created. This was, obviously, not strong evidence that Craig had held Bitcoin in 2009. This evidence was reported, and was responded to with a couple of additional databases that had an audit trail that was consistent with the dates in the records in question. Well, partially. The audit record included session data, showing an administrator logging into the data base in 2011 and then, uh, logging out in 2023, which is rather more consistent with someone changing their system clock to 2011 to create an entry, and switching it back to present day before logging out. In addition, the audit log included fields that didn't exist in versions of the product released before 2016, strongly suggesting that the entries dated 2009-2011 were created in software released after 2016. And even worse, the order of insertions into the database didn't line up with calendar time - an entry dated before another entry may appear in the database afterwards, indicating that it was created later. But even more obvious? The database schema used for these old entries corresponded to a version of the software released in 2023.</p><p>This is all consistent with the idea that these records were created after the fact and backdated to 2009-2011, and that after this evidence was made available further evidence was created and backdated to obfuscate that. In an unusual turn of events, during the trial Craig Wright introduced further evidence in the form of a chain of emails to his former lawyers that indicated he had provided them with login details to his MYOB instance in 2019 - before the metadata associated with the screenshots. The implication isn't entirely clear, but it suggests that either they had an opportunity to examine this data before the metadata suggests it was created, or that they faked the data? So, well, the obvious thing happened, and his former lawyers were asked whether they received these emails. The chain consisted of three emails, two of which they confirmed they'd received. And they received a third email in the chain, but it was different to the one entered in evidence. And, uh, weirdly, they'd received a copy of the email that was submitted - but they'd received it a few days earlier. In 2024.</p><p>And again, the forensic evidence is helpful here! It turns out that the email client used associates a timestamp with any attachments, which in this case included an image in the email footer - and the mysterious time travelling email had a timestamp in 2024, not 2019. This was created by the client, so was consistent with the email having been sent in 2024, not being sent in 2019 and somehow getting stuck somewhere before delivery. The date header indicates 2019, as do encoded timestamps in the MIME headers - consistent with the mail being sent by a computer with the clock set to 2019.</p><p>But there's a very weird difference between the copy of the email that was submitted in evidence and the copy that was located afterwards! The first included a header inserted by gmail that included a 2019 timestamp, while the latter had a 2024 timestamp. Is there a way to determine which of these could be the truth? It turns out there is! The format of that header changed in 2022, and the version in the email is the new version. The version with the 2019 timestamp is anachronistic - the format simply doesn't match the header that gmail would have introduced in 2019, suggesting that an email sent in 2022 or later was modified to include a timestamp of 2019.</p><p>This is by no means the only indication that Craig Wright's evidence may be misleading (there's the whole argument that the Bitcoin white paper was written in LaTeX when general consensus is that it's written in OpenOffice, given that's what the metadata claims), but it's a lovely example of a more general issue.</p><p>Our technology chains are complicated. So many moving parts end up influencing the content of the data we generate, and those parts develop over time. It's fantastically difficult to generate an artifact now that precisely corresponds to how it would look in the past, even if we go to the effort of installing an old OS on an old PC and setting the clock appropriately (are you sure you're going to be able to mimic an entirely period appropriate patch level?). Even the version of the font you use in a document may indicate it's anachronistic. I'm pretty good at computers and I no longer have any belief I could fake an old document.</p><p>(References: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4y3gdele4foy15006z8ch/h?rlkey=scs42wew1o3vwfv0nduhc43dm&amp;dl=0">this Dropbox</a>, under "Expert reports", "Patrick Madden".
