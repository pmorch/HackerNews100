<p dir="auto">Since the release of <code>Gnome 43.0</code>, more and more built-in apps use <code>libadwaita</code> now, and libadwaita does not support custom themes, which means we cannot change the appearance of app using libadwaita through <code>gnome-tweaks</code> or <code>dconf-editor</code>. For users who love custom themes, it’s really sucks!</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway if anybody who still want to custom themes we can only do this way:</p>
<p dir="auto">that is to use the <code>theme file</code> to overwrite the <code>gtk-4.0 configuration file</code>. The result is that only Fixed making all gtk4 apps use one theme and cannot be switched (even can not switch to dark mode) If you want to change a theme, you can only re-overwrite the <code>gtk-4.0 configuration file</code> with a new theme, I know this method is not perfect, But at the moment it is only possible to continue using themes for libadwaita's apps ...</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  
  

  <div>
  <blockquote>
<p>The very short version: it is madness to continue transferring the running of European societies and governments to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd">American clouds</a>. Not only is it a terrible idea given the kind of things the “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912">King of America</a>” keeps saying, the legal sophistry used to justify such transfers, like the <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D07118">nonsense letter the Dutch cabinet sent last week</a>, has now been <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-s-sacking-of-pclob-members-threatens-data-privacy">invalidated</a> by Trump himself. And why are we doing this? Convenience. But it is very scary to make yourself 100% dependent on the goodwill of the American government merely because it is convenient. So let’s not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used to think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">grieving went through five stages</a>: denial, protest, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. We no longer really believe in that theory, but when it comes to dealing with the US, many Europeans are however currently busily negotiating with reality.</p>
<p>Some of my more activist friends are already further along in their thinking, and clearly see that it is ridiculous to move our governments over to the American clouds at this stage. They rightly accused me of <a href="https://mastodon.nl/@bert_hubert/114015060901981839">fooling myself</a> by aiming for ‘<a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/communicating-without-musk-and-trump-cloud-kootwijk/">at least not moving EVERYTHING to America</a>’, while accepting that we’d still relinquish the majority of our systems.</p>
<p>Acknowledging painful changes <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bert_hubert/111402692560132040">is not easy</a>. In the 1930s, the Netherlands realized the world was becoming pretty dangerous, and therefore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_1047_battlecruiser">planned to buy weapons</a> and ammunition from Germany (!). However, the ordered weaponry was not delivered on time, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_bombing_of_Rotterdam">at least not in the way you’d want</a>.</p>
<p>“Negotiating with reality” is for example <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D07118">the letter three Dutch government ministers sent last week</a>. Is it wise to report every applicant to your secret service directly to Google, just to get some statistics? The answer the government sent: even if we do that, we don’t, because “<a href="https://mastodon.nl/@bert_hubert/114031686141633446">Google cannot see the IP address</a>”. This is complete nonsense of course, but it’s the kind of thing you tell yourself (or let others tell you) when you don’t want to face reality (or can’t).</p>
<center>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/google-ip.png"><br>
Live image of IP addresses that, according to the Dutch government, don’t go to Google, <a href="https://cookie-script.com/blog/ip-anonymization/amp">but actually do go to Google</a></p>
</center>
<p>And why are we reporting all these job applicants to America? Because it’s <em>cheaper</em>, they say. The European alternative statistical software, which is already paid for and actually running on the government job site, isn’t as user-friendly either, they say. Nonsense.</p>
<p>With all sorts of magic legal spells  like “<a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/basic-gdpr/gdpr-in-practice/data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia">DPIAs</a>” and “<a href="https://highberg.com/insights/how-do-you-conduct-a-dtia">DTIAs</a>,” organizations attempt to justify transferring our data and processes to the US. <a href="https://www.privacycompany.eu/">There is a whole industry that has been aiding and abetting this process for years</a>. People also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/servers-in-de-eu-eigen-sleutels-helpt-het/">fool themselves that special keys and “servers in the EU”</a> will get you “<a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2022/augustus/16/cloud-act-memo/Cloud+Act+Memo+Final.pdf">a safe space</a>” within the American cloud. <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/promises-unkept-the-eu-us-data-privacy-framework-under-fire/">It won’t</a>.</p>
<p>All these efforts are not about whether it is <em>wise</em> to hand over control of our data to the US. It is all about if it is <em>lawful</em>.</p>
<p>But it won’t be lawful either — the legal basis for sharing personal data with American companies is dead since Donald Trump has neutered the special court <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/us-cloud-soon-illegal-trump-punches-first-hole-eu-us-data-deal">that would make such transfers legal</a>.</p>
<center>

Donald Trump signing executive orders for the review of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opcl/executive-order-14086">the EO which underlies</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU%E2%80%93US_Data_Privacy_Framework">EU-US Data Privacy Framework</a></p>

</center>
<p>We now have the bizarre situation that anyone with any sense can see <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/02/19/macron-holds-second-day-of-emergency-talks-on-ukraine_6738336_7.html">that America is no longer a reliable partner</a>, and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd">the entire US business world bows to Trump’s dictatorial will</a>, but we STILL are doing <a href="https://www.utoday.nl/news/75233/waarom-mag-chatgpt-reclame-maken-bij-surf">everything we can</a> to transfer entire governments and most of our own businesses to their clouds.</p>
<p>Not only is it scary to have all your data available to US spying, it is also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/publicspaces-digitale-autonomie-7-juni-2024/">a huge risk for your business/government continuity</a>. From now on, all our business processes can be brought to a halt <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/digitale-soevereiniteit-rijksoverheid-13-februari-2025/">with the push of a button in the US</a>. And not only will everything then stop, will we ever get our data back? <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/ransom-cloud.jpeg">Or are we being held hostage</a>? This is not a theoretical scenario, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/servers-in-de-eu-eigen-sleutels-helpt-het/#wat-als-er-ruzie-is">something like this has already happened</a>.</p>
<p>Here and there, some parts of at least the Dutch government are deciding <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D06767">not to <em>migrate EVERYTHING</em> to the US</a> (kudos to the government workers who are fighting for this!).</p>
<p>But even here, the details of Dutch policy are that our data will only ‘<a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D06768">for now</a>’ stay on our own servers. Experts are also doubtful whether it’s actually possible with the current “partial cloud” plan to keep the data here <em>exclusively</em>.</p>
<p>And then we come to the apparent reason why <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/de-hele-overheid-naar-de-cloud-dat-is-een-politiek-besluit/">we are putting our head on Trump’s chopping block</a>: “American software is just so easy to use”.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t know many fans of MS Teams, Office, and Outlook. We are, however, very <em>used</em> to these software products. We’ve become quite good at using them.</p>
<p>But this brings us to the unbearable conclusion that we are entrusting all our data and business processes to the new <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912">King of America</a>… because we can’t be bothered to <em>get used to</em> a <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">different word processor</a>, or make an effort to <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/open-source-by-itself-is-no-alternative-for-big-tech/">support other software</a>.</p>
<p>Written down like this, it seems pretty bizarre, and that’s because it is. It’s also not easy to realize that <a href="https://www.vpro.nl/buitenhof/lees/in-de-uitzending/2025/26-januari.html">our relationship with America is over after 80 years</a>. It took time for me as well to accept that.</p>
<p>But it really is over. Stop the nonsense of complicated and long-winded legal arguments about why it would be legal to put our citizens’ data in the US. These arguments are not only naïve—they are also no longer true. The US has dismantled the official privacy framework. <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bert_hubert/114032472494922878">The deal is dead</a>.</p>
<p>So stop surrendering our society to America. Have the courage to use <a href="https://opendesk.eu/en/ueber/">different software</a> and services. <a href="https://opendesk.eu/en/">Even if it takes some getting used to</a>.</p>
<p>And maybe, once in a while, European governments should have the guts to actually attempt to buy something else. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/is-europe-just-not-good-at-innovating/">Innovation doesn’t just happen without the promise of revenues</a>. Spending just 1% on alternatives would mean billions of euros.</p>
<p>That’s a very small price to pay for a society that isn’t 100% dependent on “MAGA”, Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The world is <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">far too dangerous</a> for that.</p>

                <p>There's a cute math puzzle that can be interesting to folks on very
different levels:</p>
<blockquote>
Given exactly four instances of the digit 2 and some target natural number,
use any mathematical operations to generate the target number with these 2s,
using no other digits.</blockquote>
<p>Some examples can be done by elementary school kids:</p>
<p>In middle school, kids learn about exponents, factorials, etc. which expands the
range considerably:</p>
<p>Then come the tricks; for example, the number 22 (twenty two) can be seen as
a valid use of two 2s, and so on; so we can have:</p>
<p>Getting to 7 is notoriously difficult, but if you allow even more mathematical
tools like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>,
it becomes easy:</p>
<p>The more math skill people have, the more numbers they can make. See
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1034122/get-the-numbers-from-0-30-by-using-the-number-2-four-times">this thread</a>
for some fun concoctions using integrals, repeating fractions and combinatorial
operators. One of my favorite examples involves complex numbers:</p>
<p>So the fun doesn't end even after one graduates from university! In fact, this
seems to have been a favorite pastime for mathematicians in the 1920s. Until
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac">Paul Dirac</a> ruined it for everyone
by finding a general solution for every number.</p>
<p>It's all about nested square roots:</p>
<p>If the square root is applied <em>n</em> times:</p>
<p>All that's left now is some base-2 logarithms:</p>
<p>And another:</p>
<p>This leads to the general formula:</p>
<p>There's just one small wrinkle: it uses <em>three</em> instances of the digit 2, not
four. This is easy to amend, however; since , we can replace
any single digit with that and get exactly four:</p>
<p>One may claim this is cheating, but it seems to be in line with the rules of
the puzzle! Note that the entity <em>n</em> doesn't actually appear anywhere - it's
just a helper to count the number of repeated square roots. For example, another
way to express 7 is:</p>
<p>There are exactly four 2s, and this uses only reasonable, elemental math
operations to do the calculation. It's clear that <em>any</em> number can be expressed
this way; the only challenge is properly drawing all those square roots!</p>

      <p>A man who has been released from prison after 30 years for a crime he says he never committed has been readjusting to life - and getting used to just how connected people are now. </p><p>Gordon Cordeiro was jailed in 1994 over the murder of Timothy Blaisdell on the island of Maui, but due to new DNA evidence his conviction was overturned on Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking about his first impression of the outside world following his release from Maui Community Correctional Center, Mr Cordeiro, who has always maintained his innocence, said he has been trying to get used to how connected people are.</p><p>"Everybody is looking at their phones," he said, during his first Zoom interview since leaving prison.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro also commented on the new DNA evidence which led to his release, telling the Associated Press news agency: "Thank God for new DNA. Technology is awesome."</p>

<p>The first thing he did after he was freed was visit his mother's grave as he said he had constantly thought about her during his time behind bars.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro's mother, Paulette, died aged 49 in September 1994 from ALS, often called Lou Gehrig's disease. Her son was arrested the following month.</p><p>"Thanks for looking over me. Keeping me safe," Mr Cordeiro recalled saying at her grave.</p><p>In a picture provided by his sister, he can be seen kneeling graveside, with a garland of flowers he was given upon release draped over the headstone.</p>

<p>Announcing her decision to free him, Judge Kirstin Hamman ruled new evidence, including DNA test results, would likely change the outcome of another trial.</p><p>Maui County Prosecuting Attorney Andrew Martin said he plans to appeal against the decision and seek to have bail imposed on Mr Cordeiro's release.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro's first trial ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him.</p><p>But he was later found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.</p>

<p>While I’m usually blogging about triathlon, today I want to discuss one of my other hobbies, scuba diving. Diving in the UK usually requires diving in a dry suit (not always, but trust me, it’s a LOT more comfortable). One of the biggest concerns that many have is about how to deal with the bladder situation. My good friend <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/DavidCAllen1979" target="_blank">Dave Allen</a> and I, get approached often about diving with a pee valve. Dave is a dive instructor with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rec2tecdiving.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rec2Tec</a> and we’ve co-authored this topic, you can head over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rec2tecdiving.co.uk/fluid-dynamics/" target="_blank">here</a> to see how the boys do it….</p>



<p>I’ve been scuba diving for over 25 years, mostly in wetsuits or semi-dry suits. Back in the 90s, my first introduction to a dry suit involved VERY cold water. In fact, it was an ice dive. Since then, I’ve dove in various places: cold water, dark water, deep dives…but chose locations that were a bit more tropical or avoided winter diving, using wetsuits or even a semi-dry suit. In a wetsuit, when you have to pee, the solution is easy… you just go. In a dry suit, not so much. Back in the 90’s there wasn’t a convenient solution for women using dry suits, except for holding it and dehydrating yourself in hopes you could complete a dive without peeing yourself.</p>



<p>For some years there were some solutions for men (a zip at the front of the dry suit) or even just an external catheter system. For women though, there had been a major gap in the market. It was in 2015 that I learned about the ability to install a P-valve for women. I turned my ‘never again’ approach into ‘okay, let’s try this!’</p>



<p>I just want to start off and say, I have a bladder the size of a walnut. More than that, I drink A LOT of water and I have had some surgeries on my girl parts, so I do not have a bladder made of steel (although, I envy people that do). Cold water accelerates that for me, so I have to pee even more.</p>



<p>On most recreational dives I’m okay without a pee valve (anything under and hour). I am, admittedly, usually the first person to head to the toilets (or head) when exiting the water. UK diving really requires a dry suit and in 2015, I went to the dive show and got fitted for my new dry suit and pee valve. I was soooo excited. But… I was not sure how to use it, or really anything about peeing in dry suit. I did a lot of research, had some ‘interesting’ trial and error moments, so I thought I share this with you in hopes that it helps not only educate you on how to use a p-valve, but also helps you decide which path to take.</p>



<h2><strong>Why the p-valve?</strong></h2>



<p>For those of you asking, what are my options for diving in a dry suit? Well… you can just hold it (again, if you have a bladder of steel), nappies/diapers, the p-valve, or just pee in the suit (which is gross and defeats the whole purpose of the dry suit, right?). I am personally not inclined to use a diaper, the thought of sitting in my own urine does not appeal to me. Also, they leak. Again, not appealing. I have done too many dives where I’m sprinting for the toilets post-dive (usually ripping a wrist seal), not being able to get out of my suit fast enough.</p>



<p>When I am diving in a dry suit I intake much less water than I normally would, this isn’t healthy as it can lead to DCI (decompression sickness, etc). Hydration is important when diving repetitive dives and I also have a bit of anxiety as well about having to pee on a dive. I don’t know about you, but when I have to pee, it really distracted me on my dives and getting into more technical diving, this was not ideal. I needed a solution that eased my mind and my bladder.</p>



<p>So…enter in the P-valve.</p>



<p>The P-valve (in theory) allows you to dive without a diaper, eliminates bladder discomfort by enabling a person to glue (yes, glue – we’ll come to that in a minute) an external catheter to their lady parts, hooked into a tube that exits out the dry suit leg using a one-way valve. It’s a pretty awesome invention, but it’s not quite as simple as ‘plug it in and go’.</p>



<h2><strong>Which p-valve/catheter system should I buy?</strong></h2>



<p>If you don’t have a P-valve installed in your dry suit, you can have one installed at any time by the manufacturer or a local professional. While in theory you can do it yourself, I highly recommend allowing an experienced professional to install the valve itself to avoid leaking. I personally had mine installed at the time of ordering my Hollis dry suit, they used a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.sitech.se/home.aspx" target="_blank">SI TECH one-way valve</a>. At the time of writing this I have an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.othree.co.uk/" target="_blank">O3 custom dry suit</a> on order and they use <a href="https://www.othree.co.uk/apv-care-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their own custom valv</a>e. Regardless of the brand, get the one-way P-valve installed in your suit.</p>

<p>There are various options for external catheters for ladies on the market today. The one that I found that got the best reviews (and seemed the most logical for me) is the <a href="https://www.she-p.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She-P system.</a> The She-P system is made from silicone and each one is made by hand and of fantastic quality.</p>



<p>At the time of purchase the She-P Classic was the one recommended. I bought the whole kit for it, which includes medical grade adhesive, removal wipes and the tubing required to attach it to the P-valve in my dry suit. You can find the classic version <a href="https://www.she-p.com/product/ready-to-pee-kit-with-she-p-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>I would honestly consider the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.she-p.com/product/ready-to-pee-kit-with_she-p_3-0/" target="_blank">She-P version 3.0</a>. This will be my next upgrade soon. I explain why down below.</p>



<h2><strong>Preparing for the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>This is the area that where I had the most questions (and also, where most people ask me how this whole thing works). This article can be a delicate subject (no pun intended!), so let’s talk about the configuration of the She-P itself:</p>

<p>The She-P needs to adhere from the perineum to the front of you, with the tube sticking out the front. Keep this in mind when reading the below in terms of which area to prep.</p>



<p>Whether you’re using the She-P Classic or She-P 3.0 the preparation for attachment is the same.</p>



<ul><li>Remove the hair from your lady parts. I recommend shaving, waxing or laser hair removal. Shaving can cause irritation, if that is the case, look into waxing or laser. You don’t want to irritate the skin as you’re about to put some glue onto it. How much hair to remove? Think Brazilian, you need to clear the hair from the perineum to the front of your pubic bone. <em>You can attach the device with stubble, but it does not make for a pleasant removal experience, and could potentially cause a leak when in use.</em></li></ul>



<ul><li>My advice, just go bald down there ladies…. I personally went with laser hair removal years ago and that’s paying off tenfold now.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Make sure there are not any moisturizers or oil on your skin. Taking a shower on the morning when you’re going to attach the device is recommended. Use a non-oily soap to make sure the glue can adhere to your skin.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Attaching the She-P</strong></p>



<p>The first time you attach She-P I recommend that you have someone witness attaching it, it provides a great amount of humor. It wasn’t my first time, but I was still experimenting with my device, and I was with my friend Sandi, she wanted to see how I did it in person. So, in the middle of the car park at Stoney Cove, we attempted to attach the catheter in the middle of December. Not only was it cold out, but we couldn’t stop laughing. Definitely ensure your first attempt is at home and test it in the shower.</p>



<p>To ready the device to be attached, I do honestly recommend a mirror setup below you to see where you are attaching it, else you’ll end up like me, thinking you glued your butthole (true story). Since there is glue involved, I would highly recommend a pair of gloves to keep your hands from getting glue on them.</p>



<ul><li>Make sure the device itself is clean, remember where you’re attaching it to.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Get out the glue for the device. The She-P kit I purchased comes with Hollister medical spray glue or you can use Urobond. As I’m not coordinated enough to use the little brush with the Urobond, I highly recommend the Hollister spray. As you’ll be spraying the She-P, I recommend placing the catheter on something that can be discarded (paper towel, piece of paper or parchment paper), but be careful not to glue the device to anything.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Apply TWO layers of glue to the She-P. Spray the first layer of glue onto the outer flaps, avoiding the reservoir. I like to keep the glue towards the outside of the flaps, avoiding the very inner area by the reservoir (remember, this is medical grade glue, you don’t want to glue your lips together – or anything else that is down there). I’ve highlighted in red the area I aim to spray with the glue.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="723" data-permalink="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/she-p_img1/" data-orig-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg" data-orig-size="441,442" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="she-p_img1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=441" loading="lazy" width="441" height="442" src="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=441" alt="" srcset="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg 441w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px"><figcaption>Spray coverage on the She-P</figcaption></figure></div>



<ul><li>Apply your first layer of glue onto the device, allow to dry for a few minutes (this is a good time to go have a cup of coffee – because you can!). I have heard others doing the first layer the night before, just make sure you don’t knock the device, get fluff on it, or some other disaster before the morning – hence why I do mine in the morning.</li></ul>



<ul><li>After about 10 minutes I apply the second layer of glue, allowing that to dry to just where if you touch the glue at the slightest, it’s almost thick and sticky. Now, you’re ready to adhere it to you. Note: you can use one layer of glue if you’re only doing one dive, but I don’t find it adheres well enough for me.</li></ul>



<ul><li>This is the fun part… Stand over your mirror or bring a friend. Line up the reservoir under you, meaning, aligned under your urethra (if you don’t know where that is, it’s where the urine comes out), with the hose pointing forward and press on from the front over the lips, then onto the sides and pressing through to the perineum. I personally have cyclists’ thighs, so I make sure just to have my legs open a bit and ensure the catheter is glued to the sides of my undercarriage. Note: You want to avoid getting glue onto your thighs (as I have done) and get a pretty good seal.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Press the catheter onto you, don’t squat or go for a run. Press the device on and keep some pressure on it. If I let go, I find the catheter drops a bit from the weight of it…don’t do that. The weight of the tube will pull it down, hold it up so the seal doesn’t break or pull the skin (yes, it’s uncomfortable). Ensure the seal is glued on, for myself I find the area by the perineum to be the most difficult. I then don some spandex shorts over top. For me personally, this applies some pressure to the device, holds the tube up and keeps everything in place.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Once the device is in place, I HIGHLY suggest going for a test pee. The first time you do this, get in the tub or shower. Trust me. While standing, do a SLOW pee, like VERY VERY SLOW pee, remember, that little reservoir is catching the urine and going down the tube, which can be a bit of a bottleneck. If you’ve never peed standing up as a female, it’s a very novel experience. I giggled continuously, until I realized it was like a firehose and I peed everywhere. Learn to aim.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Since I’ve used the She-P a few times now, I ensure I pee as much as possible before attaching the device. I then pee before my dive in the toilets or before boarding the boat. Finding the right position to pee standing up is difficult. As mentioned, I find the point of attachment to the perineum the point of leaking for me. Others have found the front to be an issue. When I’m using a toilet with the She-P attached I find I have to face the toilet when standing, bend at the waist and allow the urine to go down the tube. Think of an awkward squat but facing forwards, pushing the hose towards the toilet bowl. I have tried standing in various positions to pee, and that is what works for me. Since you’re not using the device much on dry land this shouldn’t be your focus, but I find a test pee a good way of checking for leaks.</li></ul>



<ul><li>There are various ways to ensure the device gets some extra security in place. I personally, use a pair of tight spandex shorts. I also pull the front adapter up towards my belly button as that’s how I wear it in my suit (will explain that below). Many people have tried various ways to give the catheter extra security:<ul><li>Two thongs – one over each leg, holding the She-P in place on the inner thigh. For me, this didn’t work, it was too restrictive, but go ahead and give it a shot.</li></ul><ul><li>Rubber/latex underwear – Some women swear by this. I searched for rubber/latex underwear, which brings up some interesting results on the internet. I did acquire a pair and when trying them, they were soooo uncomfortable and shifted a bit. I’ve tossed that idea out, but again, it may work for you.</li></ul><ul><li>Nappies/Diapers/sanitary pads – Some women will still wear a nappy/diaper to catch any drippage. I have a severe aversion to this…I’d risk the leak. You can also use a good sanitary pad in your underwear, probably the better option.</li></ul><ul><li>Waterproof medical tape – put this in your kit bag. If you find a leak on your trial pee, you can add some tape over the leaking area (see, this is why you want to get rid of all of your hair).</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>I hate to say it, but this is all going to be trial and error. The best part is, you can pee while diving and avoid the discomfort. The downside is that you might not make any friends if they know you’ve accidentally peed yourself. Try this all out in the shower the first time, and maybe use the pads/diapers on the first few dives until you’re comfortable.</p>



<h2><strong>Diving with the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>Once I get the She-P catheter attached I’m ready to go diving…woohoo!</p>



<p>Above I mentioned that I wear a pair of tight shorts, I take the hose and point it up towards my belly button. The shorts hold it in place and keep everything fairly pressed against the skin. I have tried pointing the catheter in a more downwards position, but I caused a kink in the hose, which caused a little backflow, so just try out what works best for you. I find sitting down with the catheter attached is interesting… i.e., driving in a car, sitting on a bench – heck, even walking, I feel a bit like a cowboy. It’s okay, it’s normal and as the day goes on, you get more comfortable with it.</p>



<p>When I’m getting dressed to dive, I have my shorts on, then I wear (sometimes) a thermal layer that goes on as normal. On top of that I wear my under suit. I currently have a<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fourthelement.com/product-category/drysuit-underwear/arctic/" target="_blank"> Fourth Element Arctic two-piece suit.</a> If you’ve ever seen a mens under suit when using a P-valve, they have a hole cut for their hose down the leg. I cut along the front of my under suit and had some Velcro sewn either side of the crotch. This provides an easy way to attach my She-P to my P-valve.</p>



<p>When I get into my dry suit I take the tube from my p-valve, run it up through the Velcro hole in the front of my under suit, also running that straight up the front of me to the other end of the catheter. I have the quick connector system that came with my She-P kit, I can easily plug the two ends together and voila!</p>



<p>I am routing both tubes up towards my belly button, I create an ‘S’ or ‘C’ bend, in the tubes, without actually causing a kink, I use the shorts to hold the catheter in place and the tube routes down through my under suit. You will need to find the position of the tubing that works best for you. For me, I found that when I’m diving, this is absolute best position, it also means that pesky perineum area doesn’t leak.</p>



<p>I’m all plumbed in and ready to go!</p>



<p>For my specific P-valve, I find that I have to ensure it’s closed, or it leaks. Most valves don’t do that, but mine does (hopefully my new one won’t). Also, if you keep the valve closed, you can get a reverse pressure that you’ll feel in the chamber, so open and close the valve a bit to release that pressure (especially if you feel it when diving).</p>



<p>Peeing on the actual dive takes practice. I have devised a specific hand signal that I’ve used with various dive buddies to say, ‘I need to pee’. It usually creates a laugh, a bit of mask flooding, then they awkwardly stare at you when you’re trying to pee. Again, you’re going to need to practice peeing. Personally, I cannot be swimming and peeing. I have to stop kicking. I usually hang out on a wreck and do my thing, but I usually find a deco/safety stop is the best place. I mean, what else are you going to do? Like I mentioned before, I keep my valve closed. My buddy can see me reach for the valve to open it, so I don’t even need a hand signal…yeah, it’s about as subtle as a brick to the face…so they know… I’m peeing. They usually make faces at me and cause again, more laughter.</p>



<p>No matter where you choose to pee with your P-valve, PEE SLOWLY. The urine should exit down the tube and all is good. I would highly suggest having a pee before exiting the water (again, for me it’s on a deco stop). I stay plumbed in all day, I’m usually okay between dives, but if you find yourself on a long surface interval or stuck in your dry suit. Just go stand in a quiet corner, open your valve and pee standing up. All the boys do it!</p>



<h2><strong>Removing the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>When you’re done diving for the day, un-clasp your hose from the P-valve, FLUSH OUT your P-valve asap if you can. Use a bottle with a small nose to flush out the P-valve. I use Milton with water to flush down the tube to my suit (and don’t forget to open your valve on your leg). I then rinse thoroughly with water and blow into the end of the tube with my mouth to get the liquid out.</p>



<p>I use the cap that came with the kit and close off the hose on the catheter after I’ve taken off my suit for the day. If I have to travel home or somewhere in a car, I just leave my shorts on, and the catheter is still attached. I have removed the catheter in different ways, each with varying levels of success…</p>



<ul><li>Wait until you’re near a hot shower and gently peel (be careful to not rip the catheter) it off of you.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Peel back the catheter from your body and remove from wherever you are. I tend to go with this method, but I’ve had interesting results. One time I peeled it off too fast, my skin felt raw for a couple of days, and I spent the evening with an ice pack on my raw skin. Usually, I just get residual glue.</li></ul>



<ul><li>No matter how I remove the She-P I end of up with glue on it and myself. I use the wipes to get off the excess.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Wash the She-P with warm water and soap, wash the device all over and ensure that you run the soap/water through the hose. Hang the device up to dry, I have a little hook that I hang it from (with the hose pointing down, allowing it to drip dry).</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you’re diving for multiple days in a row, clean the device after each day (and yourself). Travel with whatever cleaning fluids that work and stick to those.</li></ul>



<ul><li>I’ve never taken off my She-P during a day of diving, I leave it on all day, but I’ve heard of people taking it off between dives. I would only recommend that if your dives are fairly far apart and you’re on a liveaboard. If you can survive with it on all day, that might be the easier option (if you’re not doing any other activities for the day).</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Diving while on your period</strong></h2>



<p>While I don’t want to go too deep on this topic, it will happen. Up until that last 2 years, I had been on birth control for 20 years, so if I had a trip coming up I could just skip my period using my birth control. Since then, I’ve opted to go off birth control (that’s a whole other story) and have had to face what to do with my period, diving and the P-valve. Firstly, it all depends on your flow, if you have a heavy period, a diaper/nappy might be best. Second, it depends on what you usually use on your period to deal with the flow. I personally, gave up tampons several years ago and dive with a menstrual cup. I made the change due to several factors: reusability, better for the environment, easier to manage, better for endurance sports (and diving). The only downside is that it pushes on my bladder when diving (just a bit, but it’s noticeable).</p>



<p>I tend to keep the menstrual cup in and attach my She-P as I normally would. I can leave the menstrual cup in for over 8 hours if needed, so this method works really really well for me. If your flow is really light, you could potentially get away with nothing at all, as the reservoir would catch it, you just want to make sure that it doesn’t ‘overload the system’.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Diving with a She-P is awesome and a total game changer!&nbsp; I’ve tried to make this blog as comprehensive as possible to cover off my experience and others that have tried diving with a P-valve. &nbsp;As with anything, it all comes down to personal preference and a bit of trial and error.</p>



<p>Don’t let your bladder keep you from diving. There are several Facebook groups out there aimed at this, as well as Scubaboard.</p>



<p>Good luck and dive deep my friends! </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to Chinese media, Sun Huajun, CTO of BYD’s battery business, stated at a forum event on solid-state batteries that the company had already produced its first solid-state cells with 20 Ah and 60 Ah on its pilot production line in 2024. The portals <em>CN EV Post </em>and <em>Car News China</em> reported on this based on a video recording of the presentation.</p><p>According to the battery business CTO, BYD expects to start “mass demonstration” of solid-state batteries around 2027. However, he did not provide any information on the number of prototype cells produced to date. And even after the demonstration applications, there are no plans to start series production in the near future: A truly large-scale introduction of solid-state batteries could possibly only take place after 2030, Sun is quoted in the reports.</p><p>Sun also does not expect the technology to be used by its competitors any earlier than this. “Looking at the industry as a whole, different players are making about the similar progress,” Huajun said. In fact, Wu Kai, Chief Scientist at CATL, stated at an event <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2024/04/29/catl-expects-to-produce-its-own-solid-state-batteries-in-small-series-by-2027/">in April 2024 </a>that battery market leader CATL plans to produce the first solid-state cells in small quantities in 2027 – similar to BYD. However, there will still be problems with producing large quantities, including in terms of costs, according to Wu.</p><p>In the technical presentation, Sun also announced that BYD is focussing on sulphide electrolytes in the development of solid-state cells – apparently driven by “cost and process stability considerations.” According to the BYD manager, the costs for solid-state cells with sulphide electrolytes could theoretically reach a comparable level to today’s NCM cells with liquid electrolyte level of scale of use. However, the quantities are still too small – especially for sulphide electrolytes: “It doesn’t really make a lot of sense to talk about cost in the absence of volume.” Other technology paths for solid-state cells are oxides and polymers. According to a report <a href="https://www.electrive.com/2024/11/07/catl-start-trial-production-of-20-ah-solid-state-cells/">from November 2024</a>, CATL is also said to have opted for sulphides.</p><p>In theory, replacing the current liquid electrolyte in a battery cell with a solid offers a number of advantages. As the flammable liquid electrolyte is no longer required, solid-state cells are generally safer. At the same time, higher energy densities and more power are possible, resulting in a longer range and shorter charging times. Although many companies and institutions have been working on the technology for years due to these advantages, battery cells with ‘real’ solid electrolyte are still very rare – as BYD’s timetable also suggests. A semi-solid, gel-like electrolyte, also known as a solid, is already being used in some cases. However, this is actually a so-called ‘semi-solid-state battery’ (SSSB), while BYD and CATL use ‘all-solid-state batteries’ (ASSB) with an actual solid electrolyte.</p><p>BYD is best known today for its blade batteries with LFP cell chemistry. These lithium iron phosphate cells are considered to be more robust and cheaper than cell chemistries based on nickel and cobalt, but generally have a lower energy density. In its report, <em>Car News China</em> quotes Sun as well as Lian Yubo, BYD’s chief scientist, chief engineer for motor vehicles and dean of the Automotive Engineering Research Institute. ““Solid-state batteries will be mainly used in high-end models, empowering each other with lithium iron phosphate batteries, and used in vehicles of different levels,” said Lian, who expects LFP cells to be used for at least another 15 to 20 years.</p><p><a href="https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/15/byd-demonstration-use-all-solid-state-batteries-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cnevpost.com</a>, <a href="https://carnewschina.com/2025/02/15/byd-will-start-mass-installation-of-all-solid-state-batteries-around-2027-company-cto-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">carnewschina.com</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

We don’t have philosophically satisfying insights into the universe at subatomic scales. We have quantum mechanics: a set of equations that are good at predicting the behavior of elementary particles, but that don’t line up with our intuition about the macroscopic world. We don’t know if the equations are a crude approximation of some deeper, yet-unseen reality; or if the fabric of the universe is just weird math. In fact, the harder we try to come up with intuitive analogies, the more off-base we get. For example, despite what most YouTube educators claim, there’s no straightforward explanation of what a bound electron actually does: it’s not orbiting the nucleus or spinning around its own axis in any conventional sense. Most simply, it just </span><em>exists</em><span> as a particular distribution of an electrostatic field in space.</span></p><p>In any case, the shape of orbitals is of relatively little significance to electronics; it matters in chemistry because it helps model chemical reactions and predict the properties of materials. For our purposes, it suffices to say that each atom or molecule has a certain number of electrons and that they are organized into a certain number of shells.</p><p><span>In the same vein, we don’t need to dwell on the structure of the nucleus. In brief, the nucleus is held together by a powerful but extremely short-range field known as the </span><em>residual strong force</em><span>. This force is thought to be a consequence of the make-up of protons and neutrons, each of which appears to be made out of three more exotic elementary particles known as quarks. Pay no mind: it’s enough to say that most nuclei on Earth were formed through nuclear fusion in stars and won’t undergo any change on the timescales of interest to electronics — or to terrestrial life.</span></p><p><span>A more pertinent observation is that the structure of the atom is also shaped by a weaker but far-reaching </span><em>electrostatic force. </em><span>The force acts only on certain subatomic particles; these particles are said to be charged. In this specific context, the “charge” is an intrinsic property of a given type of particles and not something they can gain or lose: a proton is always positive, an electron is always negative, and a neutron just doesn’t play along. Similar charges repel and dissimilar charges attract, so protons in the nucleus can pull in an equal number of electrons. The electrons are then captured — </span><em>bound</em><span> — by the electrostatic field extending from the nucleus. The result is a stable atom with no net charge.</span></p><p><span>Another important insight from quantum mechanics is that the parameters that describe the state of a bound electron appear to be quantized — that is to say, they only take specific values or change in discrete increments. Once again, we don’t have a satisfying explanation why. We know that these quantum numbers correspond to standing-wave solutions of a three-dimensional wave function that we pulled out of thin air. We also know that the model works better than any alternatives. But we don’t know what any of it </span><em>really</em><span> means — or if it means anything. Either way, the bottom line is that there are specific energy levels that an electron in an atom can hop across, with no option to dwell halfway between. This is why we see a progression distinct electron shells, from lowest to highest energies.</span></p><p><span>The remaining conundrum is why don’t all the electrons settle in the most energetically-favorable, innermost shell. The relevant constraint is known as the </span><em>Pauli exclusion principle</em><span>. The state of a bound electron is seemingly fully described by a handful of parameters, and the electrons must remain distinct — i.e., their quantum parameters can’t be all the same. This means that each shell has a limited seating capacity: once all the combinations of “lesser” quantum numbers are exhausted, the next electron needs to bump up the remaining variable: the principal quantum number that corresponds to the shell it occupies.</span></p><p>In most cases, the electrons that populate innermost shells do relatively little: they have low energy, are bound tightly to the nucleus, and tend to be shielded from outside influence. The story is different for higher-energy valence electrons; for example, chemistry as we know it arises from atoms exchanging or sharing these weakly-attached particles. In a covalent bond, some electrons from both participating atoms shift to a newly-formed, energetically-favorable multi-atom orbital. In ionic bonding, one or more electrons migrate from one atom to another. In the latter case, the new molecule is held together by the resulting electrostatic field.</p><p>Even without chemical bonding, it’s not difficult to temporarily dislodge some valence electrons. The most familiar example is the triboelectric effect that’s responsible for the harmless zaps of static electricity we sometimes feel around the home. The effect isn’t fully understood, but we know that depending on the shape and orientation of molecules, different surfaces exhibit variable affinity to electrons. In part because of this, when two dissimilar materials are brought together, there can be a slight imbalance in the number of electrons that randomly migrate across the boundary. If the pieces are then quickly pulled apart, some charge carriers end up getting stuck where they don’t belong.</p><p><span>It should be noted that the scale of this imbalance is minuscule: the displacement of about 10</span><sup>11</sup><span> electrons is enough to give you a good zap. This might seem like a big number, but consider that there are roughly 81,000,000,000,000 times as many</span><sup> </sup><span>electrons in a single ounce of table salt. In other words, the magnitude of the phenomenon is comparable to taking a bucket of water out of Lake Erie.</span></p><p>This brings us to solid-state insulators: in such materials, valence electrons can still be pulled off or deposited onto the surface with relative ease, but the resulting charges stay in place and can’t propagate through the bulk of the substrate. This is often because there are no suitable vacancies in the shells of nearby molecules. To move around, the electrons would need to be knocked into a higher-energy state.</p><p><span>This situation is different in metals. The atoms form a dense, homogeneous lattice with sparsely-populated orbitals that essentially merge together, extending throughout the material and no longer exhibiting clearly-quantized energy levels that are characteristic of electrons bound to a single nucleus.

<p>Around twenty years ago, people would have laughed if you told them that videogames would end up at the Smithsonian, but the Half-Life team really did want to make games that were more than just throwaway toys. The rule against cinematics — which made our jobs much harder and also ended up leaving a lot of my favorite work out of the game — was a kind of ideological stake in the ground: we really did want the game and the story to be the same thing. It was far from flawless, but it was really trying to push the boundaries of a young medium.</p>
<p>— Valve artist Steve Theodore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 1998, the first-person shooter was nearing its pinnacle of popularity. In June of that year, <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine could list fourteen reasonably big-budget, high-profile FPS’s earmarked for release in the next six months alone. And yet the FPS seemed rather to be running to stand still. Almost all of the innovation taking place in the space was in the realm of technology rather than design.</p>
<p>To be sure, progress in the former realm was continuing apace. Less than five years after <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/05/the-shareware-scene-part-3-the-id-boys">id Software</a> had shaken the world with <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-4-doom"><em>DOOM</em></a>, that game’s low-resolution 2.5D graphics and equally crude soundscapes had become positively quaint. Aided and abetted by a fast-evolving ecosystem of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-2-three-dimensions-in-hardware">3D-graphics hardware</a> from <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/05/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-3-software-meets-hardware">companies like 3Dfx</a>, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/04/the-next-generation-in-graphics-part-1-three-dimensions-in-software-or-quake-and-its-discontents">id’s <em>Quake</em> engine</a> had raised the bar enormously in 1996; ditto <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/405/quake-ii/"><em>Quake II</em></a> in 1997. These were the cutting-edge engines that everyone with hopes of selling a lot of shooters scrambled to license. Then, in May of 1998, with <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/649/quake-iii-arena/"><em>Quake III</em></a> not scheduled for release until late the following year, Epic MegaGames came along with their own <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/330/unreal/"><em>Unreal</em></a> engine, boasting a considerably longer bullet list of graphical effects than <em>Quake II</em>. In thus directly challenging id’s heretofore unquestioned supremacy in the space, <em>Unreal</em> ignited a 3D-graphics arms race that seemed to promise even faster progress in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Yet whether they sported the name <em>Quake</em> or <em>Unreal</em> or something else on their boxes, single-player FPS’s were still content to hew to the “shooting gallery” design template laid out by <em>DOOM</em>. You were expected to march through a ladder-style campaign consisting of a set number of discrete levels, each successive one full of more and more deadly enemies to kill than the last, perhaps with some puzzles of the lock-and-key or button-mashing stripe to add a modicum of variety. These levels were joined together by some thread of story, sometimes more elaborate and sometimes — usually — less so, but so irrelevant to what occurred inside the levels that impatient gamers could and sometimes did skip right over the intervening cutscenes or other forms of exposition in order to get right back into the action.</p>
<p>This was clearly a model with which countless gamers were completely comfortable, one which had the virtue of allowing them maximal freedom of choice: follow along with the story or ignore it, as you liked. Or, as id’s star programmer John Carmack famously said: “Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It’s expected to be there, but it’s not that important.”</p>
<p>But what if you could build the story right into the gameplay, such that the two became inseparable? What if you could eliminate the artificial division between exposition and action, and with it the whole conceit of a game as a mere series of levels waiting to be beaten one by one? What if you could drop players into an open-ended space where the story was taking place all around them?</p>
<p>This was the thinking that animated an upstart newcomer to the games industry that went by the name of Valve L.L.C. The game that resulted from it would prove the most dramatic conceptual advance in the FPS genre since <em>DOOM</em>, with lessons and repercussions that reached well beyond the borders of shooter country.</p>

<p>The formation of Valve was one of several outcomes of a dawning realization inside the Microsoft of the mid-1990s that computer gaming was becoming a very big business. The same realization led a highly respected Microsoft programmer named Michael Abrash to quit his cushy job in Redmond, Washington, throw his tie into the nearest trashcan, and move to Mesquite, Texas, to help John Carmack and the other scruffy id boys make <em>Quake</em>. It led another insider named Alex St. John to put together the internal team who made DirectX, a library of code that allowed game developers and players to finally say farewell to creaky old MS-DOS and join the rest of the world that was running <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/11/doing-windows-part-10-chicago">Windows 95</a>. It led Microsoft to buy an outfit called Ensemble Studios and their promising real-time-strategy game <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/03/age-of-empires-or-how-microsoft-got-in-on-games"><em>Age of Empires</em></a> as a first wedge for levering their way into the gaming market as a publisher of major note. And it led to Valve Corporation.</p>
<p>In 1996, Valve’s future co-founders Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington were both valued employees of Microsoft. Newell had been working there in project-management roles since 1983; he had played an important part in the creation of the <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/doing-windows-part-1-ms-dos-and-its-discontents">early versions of Windows</a> before moving on to Microsoft Office and other high-profile applications. Harrington was a programmer whose tenure had been shorter, but he had made significant contributions to Windows NT, Microsoft’s business- and server-oriented operating system.</p>
<p>As Newell tells the tale, he had an epiphany when he was asked to commission a study to find out just how many computers were currently running Microsoft Windows in the United States. The number of 20 million that he got back was impressive. Yet he was shocked to learn that Windows wasn’t the most popular single piece of software to be found on American personal computers; that was rather a game called <em>DOOM</em>. Newell and Harrington had long enjoyed playing games. Now, it seemed, there were huge piles of money to be earned from making them. Doing so struck them as a heck of a lot more fun than making more operating systems and business software. It was worth a shot, at any rate; both men were wealthy enough by now that they could afford to take a flier on something completely different.</p>
<p>So, on August, 24, 1996, the pair quit Microsoft to open an office for their new company Valve some five miles away in Kirkland, Washington. At the time, no one could have imagined — least of all them — what a milestone moment this would go down as in the history of gaming. “On the surface, we should have failed,” says Gabe Newell. “Realistically, both Mike and I thought we would get about a year into it, realize we’d made horrible mistakes, and go back to our friends at Microsoft and ask for our jobs back.”</p>
<p>Be that as it may, they did know what kind of game they wanted to make. Or rather Newell did; from the beginning, he was the driving creative and conceptual force, while Harrington focused more on the practical logistics of running a business and making quality software. Like so many others in the industry he was entering, Newell wanted to make a shooter. Yet he wanted his shooter to be more immersive and encompassing of its player than any of the ones that were currently out there, with a story that was embedded right into the gameplay rather than standing apart from it. Valve wasted no time in licensing id’s <em>Quake</em> engine to bring these aspirations to life, via the game that would come to be known as <em>Half-Life</em>.</p>
<p>As the id deal demonstrates, Newell and Harrington had connections and financial resources to hand that almost any other would-be game maker would have killed for; both had exited Microsoft as millionaires several times over. Yet they had no access to gaming distribution channels, meaning that they had to beat the bush for a publisher just like anyone else with a new studio. They soon found that their studio and their ambitious ideas were a harder sell than they had expected. With games becoming a bigger business every year, there were a lot of deep-pocketed folks from other fields jumping into the industry with plans to teach all of the people who were already there what they were doing wrong; such folks generally had no clue about what it took to do games right. Seasoned industry insiders had a name for these people, one that was usually thoroughly apt: “Tourists.” At first glance, the label was easy to apply to Newell and Harrington and Valve. Among those who did so was Mitch Lasky, then an executive at Activision, who would go on to become a legendary gaming venture capitalist. He got “a whiff of tourism” from Valve, he admits. He says he still has “post-traumatic stress disorder” over his decision to pass on signing them to a publishing deal — but by no means was he the only one to do so.</p>
<p>Newell and Harrington finally wound up pitching to Sierra, a publisher known primarily for point-and-click adventure games, a venerable genre that was now being sorely tested by all of the new FPS’s. In light of this, Sierra was understandably eager to find a horse of the new breed to back. The inking of a publishing deal with Valve was one of the last major decisions made by <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/ken-and-roberta">Ken Williams</a>, who had <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/on-line-systems-is-born">founded Sierra</a> in his living room back in 1980 but was now in the process of selling the business he had built from the ground up. As a man with such deep roots in adventure games, he found Valve’s focus on story both refreshing and appealing. Still, there was a lot of wrangling between the parties, mainly over the ultimate disposition of the rights to the <em>Half-Life</em> name; Williams wanted them to go to Sierra, but Newell and Harrington wanted to retain them for themselves. In the end, with no other publishers stepping up to the plate, Valve had to accept what Sierra was offering, a capitulation that would lead to a lengthy legal battle a few years down the road. For now, though, they had their publisher.</p>
<p>As for Ken Williams, who would exit the industry stage left well before <em>Half-Life</em> was finished:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that I’m retired, people sometimes ask me what I used to do. I usually just say, “I had a game company back in the old days.” That inevitably causes them to say, “Did you make any games I might have heard of?” I answer, “<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/08/leisure-suit-larry-in-the-land-of-the-lounge-lizards">Leisure Suit Larry</a>.” That normally is sufficient, but if there is no glimmer of recognition I pull out the heavy artillery and say, “Half-Life.” Unless they’ve been sleeping under a rock for the last couple of decades, that always lights up their eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can imagine worse codas to a business career…</p>
<p>In what could all too easily be read as another sign of naïve tourism, Newell and Harrington agreed to a crazily optimistic development timeline, promising a finished game for the Christmas of 1997, which was just one year away. To make it happen, they hired a few dozen level designers, programmers, artists, and other creative and technical types, many of whom had no prior professional experience in the games industry, all of whom recognized what an extraordinary opportunity they were being handed and were willing to work like dogs to make the most of it. The founders tapped a fertile pool of recruits in the online <em>DOOM</em> and <em>Quake</em> modding scenes, where amateurs were making names for themselves by bending those engines in all sorts of new directions. They would now do the same on a professional basis at Valve, even as the programmers modified the <em>Quake</em> engine itself to suit their needs, implementing better lighting and particle effects, and adding scripting and artificial-intelligence capabilities that the straightforward run-and-shoot gameplay in which id specialized had never demanded. Gabe Newell would estimate when all was said and done that 75 percent of the code in the engine had been written or rewritten at Valve.</p>
<p>In June of 1997, Valve took <em>Half-Life</em> to the big E3 trade show, where it competed for attention with a murderers’ row of other FPS’s, including early builds of <em>Unreal</em>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/322/sin/"><em>SiN</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/1678/john-romeros-daikatana/"><em>Daikatana</em></a>, <em>Quake II</em>, and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/04/jedi-knight-plus-notes-on-an-expanded-universe"><em>Jedi Knight</em></a>. Valve didn’t even have a booth of their own at the show. Nor were they to be found inside Sierra’s; <em>Half-Life</em> was instead shown in the booth of 3Dfx. Like so many of Valve’s early moves, this one was deceptively clever, because 3Dfx was absolutely huge at the time, with as big a buzz around their hardware as id enjoyed around their software. <em>Half-Life</em> walked away from the show with the title of “Best Action Game.”</p>
<p>The validation of E3 made the unavoidable moment of reckoning that came soon after easier to stomach. I speak, of course, about the moment when Valve had to recognize that they didn’t have a ghost of a chance of finishing the game that they wanted to make within the next few months. Newell and Harrington looked at the state of the project and decided that they could probably scrape together a more or less acceptable but formulaic shooter in time for that coming Christmas. Or they could keep working and end up with something amazing for the <em>next</em> Christmas. To their eternal credit, they chose the latter course, a decision which was made possible only by their deep pockets. For Sierra, who were <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online">notorious</a> for releasing <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/quest-for-glory-iii-and-iv">half-finished games</a>, certainly did not intend to pay for an extra year of development time. The co-founders would have to foot that bill themselves. Nevertheless, to hear Gabe Newell tell it today, it was a no-brainer: “Late is just for a little while. Suck is forever.”</p>
<p>The anticipation around <em>Half-Life</em> didn’t diminish in the months that followed, not even after the finished <em>Unreal</em> took the world by storm in May of 1998. Despite being based on a two-plus-year-old engine in a milieu that usually prized the technologically new and shiny above all else, Valve’s “shooter with a story” had well and truly captured the imaginations of gamers. During the summer of 1998, a demo of the game consisting of the first three chapters — including the now-iconic opening scenes, in which you ride a tram into a secret government research facility as just another scientist on the staff headed for another day on the job — leaked out of the offices of a magazine to which it had been sent. It did more to promote the game than a million dollars worth of advertising could have; the demo spread like wildfire online, raising the excitement level to an even more feverish pitch. <em>Half-Life</em> was different enough to have the frisson of novelty in the otherwise homogeneous culture of the FPS, whilst still being readily identifiable <em>as</em> an FPS. It was the perfect mix of innovation and familiarity.</p>
<p>So, it was no real surprise when the full game turned into a massive hit for Valve and Sierra after its release on November 19, 1998. The magazines fell all over themselves to praise it. <em>Computer Gaming World</em>, normally the closest thing the hype-driven journalism of gaming had to a voice of sobriety, got as high on <em>Half-Life’</em>s supply as anyone. The magazine’s long-serving associate editor Jeff Green took it upon himself to render the official verdict.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything you’ve heard, everything you’ve hoped for — it’s all true. Half-Life, Valve Software’s highly anticipated first-person shooter, is not just one of the best games of the year. It’s one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and, in its single-player form, is the best shooter since DOOM. Plus, despite the fact that it’s “just” a shooter, Half-Life provides one of the best examples ever of how to present an interactive movie — and a great, scary movie at that.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> sold its first 200,000 copies in the United States before Christmas — i.e., before glowing reviews like the one above even hit the newsstands. But this was the barest beginning to its success story. In honor of its tenth birthday in 2008, Guinness of world-records fame would formally anoint <em>Half-Life</em> as the best-selling single FPS in history, with total sales in the neighborhood of 10 million copies across all platforms and countries. For Newell and Harrington, it was one hell of a way to launch a game-development studio. For Sierra, who in truth had done very little for <em>Half-Life</em> beyond putting it in a box and shipping it out to stores, it was a tsunami of cash that seemed to come out of nowhere, the biggest game they had ever published almost by an order of magnitude.

<p><em>Half-Life</em> has come to occupy such a hallowed, well-nigh sacrosanct position in the annals of gaming that any encounter with the actual artifact today seems bound to be slightly underwhelming. Yet even when we take into account the trouble that any game would have living up to a reputation as elevated as this one’s, the truth is that there’s quite a lot here for the modern skeptical critic to find fault with — and, Lord knows, this particular critic has seldom been accused of lacking in skepticism.</p>
<p>Judged purely as a shooter, the design shows its age. It’s sometimes amazingly inspired, but more often no better than average for its time. There’s a lot of crawling through anonymous vents that serve no real purpose other than to extend the length of the game, a lot of places where you can survive only by dying first so as to learn what’s coming, a lot of spots where it’s really not clear at all what the game wants from you. And then there are an <em>awful</em> lot of jumping puzzles, shoehorned into a game engine that has way more slop in it than is ideal for such things. I must say that I had more unadulterated fun with LucasArts’s <em>Jedi Knight</em>, the last shooter I played all the way through for these histories, than I did with <em>Half-Life</em>. There the levels are constructed like thrill rides straight out of the <em>Star Wars</em> films, with a through-line that seems to just intuitively come to you; looking back, I’m still in awe of their subtle genius in this respect. <em>Half-Life</em> is not like that. You really have to work to get through it, and that’s not as appealing to me.</p>
<p>Then again, my judgment on these things should, like that of any critic, be taken with a grain of salt. Whether you judge a game good or bad or mediocre hinges to a large degree on what precisely you’re looking for from it; we’ve all read countless negative reviews reflective not so much of a bad game as one that isn’t the game that that reviewer wanted to play. Personally, I’m very much a tourist in the land of the FPS. While I understand the appeal of the genre, I don’t want to expend too many hours or too much effort on it. I want to blast through a fun and engaging environment without too much friction. Make me feel like an awesome action hero while I’m at it, and I’ll probably walk away satisfied, ready to go play something else. <em>Jedi Knight</em> on easy mode gave me that experience; <em>Half-Life</em> did not, demanding a degree of careful attention from me that I wasn’t always eager to grant it. If you’re more hardcore about this genre than I am, your judgment of the positives and negatives in these things may very well be the opposite of mine. Certainly <em>Half-Life</em> is more typical of its era than <em>Jedi Knight</em> — an era when games like this were still accepted and even expected to be harder and more time-consuming than they are today. <em>C’est la vie et vive la différence!</em></p>
<p>But of course, it wasn’t the granular tactical details of the design that made <em>Half-Life</em> stand out so much from the competition back in the day. It was rather its brilliance as a storytelling vehicle that led to its legendary reputation. And don’t worry, you definitely won’t see me quibbling that said reputation isn’t deserved. Even here, though, we do need to be sure that we understand exactly what it did and did not do that was so innovative at the time.</p>
<p>Contrary to its popular rep then and now, <em>Half-Life</em> was by no means the first “shooter with a story.” Technically speaking, even <em>DOOM</em> has a story, some prattle about a space station and a portal to Hell and a space marine who’s the only one that can stop the demon spawn. The story most certainly isn’t <em>War and Peace</em>, but it’s there.</p>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> wasn’t even the shooter at the time of its release with the inarguably best or most complicated story. LucasArts makes a strong bid for the title there. Both <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/500/star-wars-dark-forces/"><em>Dark Forces</em></a> and the aforementioned <em>Jedi Knight</em>, released in 1995 and 1997 respectively, weave fairly elaborate tales into the fabric of the existing <em>Star Wars</em> universe, drawing on its rich lore, inserting themselves into the established chronology of the original trilogy of films and the “Expanded Universe” series of <em>Star Wars</em> novels.</p>
<p>Like that of many games of this era, <em>Half-Life’</em>s story betrays the heavy influence of the television show <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/09/the-truth-is-out-there-part-1-the-will-to-believe"><em>The X-Files</em></a>, which enjoyed its biggest season ever just before this game was released. We have the standard nefarious government conspiracy involving extraterrestrials, set in the standard top-secret military installation somewhere in the Desert Southwest. We even have a direct equivalent to Cancer Man, <em>The X-Files’</em>s shadowy, nameless villain who is constantly lurking behind the scenes. “G-Man” does the same in <em>Half-Life</em>; voice actor Michael Shapiro even opted to give him a “lizard voice” that’s almost a dead ringer for Cancer Man’s nicotine-addled croak.</p>

<p>All told, <em>Half-Life’</em>s story is more of a collection of tropes than a serious exercise in fictional world-building. To be clear, the sketchiness is by no means an automatically bad thing, not when it’s judged in the light of the purpose the story actually needs to serve. Mark Laidlaw, the sometime science-fiction novelist who wrote the script, makes no bones about the limits to his ambitions for it. “You don’t have to write the whole story,” he says. “Because it’s a conspiracy plot, everybody knows more about it than you do. So you don’t have to answer those questions. Just keep raising questions.”</p>
<p>Once the shooting starts, plot-related things happen, but it’s all heat-of-the-moment stuff. You fight your way out of the complex after its been overrun by alien invaders coming through a trans-dimensional gate that’s been inadvertently opened, only to find that your own government is now as bent on killing you as the aliens are in the name of the disposal of evidence. Eventually, in a plot point weirdly reminiscent of <em>DOOM</em>, you have to teleport yourself onto the aliens’ world to shut down the portal they’re using to reach yours.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that, while <em>Half-Life</em> may be slightly further along the continuum toward <em>War and Peace</em> than <em>DOOM</em> is, it’s only slightly so. Countless better, richer, deeper stories were told in games before this one came along. When people talk about <em>Half-Life</em> as “the FPS with a story,” they’re really talking about something more subtle: about its way of <em>presenting</em> its story. Far from diminishing the game, this makes it more important, across genres well beyond the FPS. The best way for us to start to come to grips with what <em>Half-Life</em> did that was so extraordinary might be to look back to the way games were deploying their stories before its arrival on the scene.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, story in games was largely confined to the axiomatically narrative-heavy genres of the adventure game and the CRPG. Then, in 1990, Origin Systems released <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/04/from-squadron-to-wingleader">Chris Roberts’s <em>Wing Commander</em></a>, a game which was as revolutionary in the context of its own time as <em>Half-Life</em> was in its. In terms of gameplay, <em>Wing Commander</em> was a “simulation” of outer-space dog-fighting, not all that far removed in spirit from the classic <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2013/12/elite"><em>Elite</em></a>. What made it stand out was what happened when you weren’t behind the controls of your space fighter. Between missions, you hung out in the officers’ lounge aboard your mother ship, collecting scuttlebutt from the bartender, even flirting with the fetching female pilot in your squadron. When you went into the briefing room to learn about your next mission, you also learned about the effect your last one had had on the unfolding war against the deadly alien Kilrathi, and were given a broader picture of the latest developments in the conflict that necessitated this latest flight into danger. The missions themselves remained shooting galleries, but the story that was woven around them gave them resonance, made you feel like you were a part of something much grander. Almost equally importantly, this “campaign” provided an easy way to structure your time in the game and chart your improving skills; beat all of the missions in the campaign and see the story to its end, and you could say that you had mastered the game as a whole.</p>
<p>People <em>loved</em> this; <em>Wing Commander</em> became by far the most popular computer-gaming franchise of the young decade prior to the smashing arrival of <em>DOOM</em> at the end of 1993. The approach it pioneered quickly spread across virtually all gaming genres. In particular, both the first-person-shooter and the real-time strategy genres — the two that would dominate over all others in the second half of the decade — adopted it as their model for the single-player experience. Even at its most rudimentary, a ladder-style campaign gave you a goal to pursue and a framework of progression to hang your hat on.</p>
<p>Yet the same approach created a weirdly rigid division between gameplay and exposition, not only on the playing side of the ledger but to a large extent on the development side as well. It wasn’t unusual for completely separate teams to be charged with making the gameplay part of a game and all of the narrative pomp and circumstance that justified it. The disconnect could sometimes verge on hilarious; in <em>Jedi Knight</em>, which went so far as to film real humans acting out a B-grade <em>Star Wars</em> movie between its levels, the protagonist has a beard in the cutscenes but is clean-shaven during the levels. By the late 1990s, the pre-rendered-3D or filmed-live-action cutscenes sometimes cost more to produce than the game itself, and almost always filled more of the space on the CD.</p>
<p>As he was setting up his team at Valve, Gabe Newell attempted to eliminate this weird bifurcation between narrative and gameplay by passing down two edicts to his employees, the only non-negotiable rules he would ever impose upon them. <em>Half-Life</em> had to have a story — not necessarily one worthy of a film or a novel, but one worthy of the name. And at the same time, it couldn’t ever, under any conditions, from the very first moment to the very last, take control out of the hands of the player. Everything that followed cascaded from these two simple rules, which many a game maker of the time would surely have seen as mutually contradictory. To state the two most obvious and celebrated results, they meant no cutscenes whatsoever and no externally imposed ladder of levels to progress through — for any sort of level break did mean taking control out of the hands of the player, no matter how briefly.</p>
<p>Adapting to such a paradigm the <em>Quake</em> engine, which had been designed with a traditional FPS campaign in mind, proved taxing but achievable. Valve set up the world of <em>Half-Life</em> as a spatial grid of “levels” that were now better described as zones; pass over a boundary from one zone into another, and the new one would be loaded in swiftly and almost transparently. Valve kept the discrete zones small so as to minimize the loading times, judging more but shorter loading breaks to be better than fewer but longer ones. The hardest part was dealing with the borderlands, so to speak; you needed to be able to look into one zone from another, and the enemies and allies around you had to stay consistent before and after a transition. But Valve managed even this through some clever technical sleight of hand — such as by creating overlapping areas that existed in both of the adjoining sets of level data — and through more of the same on the design side, such as by placing the borders whenever possible at corners in corridors and at other spots where the line of sight didn’t extend too far. The occasional brief loading message aside — and they’re <em>very</em> brief, or even effectively nonexistent, on modern hardware — <em>Half-Life</em> really does feel like it all takes place in the same contiguous space.</p>

Every detail of <em>Half-Life</em> has been analyzed at extensive, exhaustive length over the decades since its release. Such analysis has its place in fan culture, but it can be more confusing than clarifying when it comes to appreciating the game’s most important achievements. The ironic fact is that you can learn almost everything that really matters about <em>Half-Life</em> as a game design just by playing it for an hour or so, enough to get into its third chapter. Shall we do so together now?</p>

<em>Half-Life</em> hews to Gabe Newell’s guiding rules from the moment you click the “New Game” button on the main menu and the iconic tram ride into the Black Mesa Research Center begins. The opening credits play over this sequence, in which you are allowed to move around and look where you like. There are reports that many gamers back in the day didn’t actually realize that they were already in control of the protagonist — reports that they just sat there patiently waiting for the “cutscene” to finish, so ingrained was the status quo of bifurcation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_1/" rel="attachment wp-att-6188"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_1.jpg 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>The protagonist himself strikes an artful balance between being an undefined player stand-in — what <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/06/the-last-days-of-zork"><em>Zork: Grand Inquisitor</em></a> called an “AFGNCAAP,” or “Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally Ambiguous Adventure Person” — and a fully fleshed-out character. As another result of Newell’s guiding rules, you never see him in the game unless you look in a mirror; you only see the world through his eyes. You do, however, hear security guards and colleagues refer to him — or, if you like, to you — as “Gordon” or “Mr. Freeman.” The manual and the intertitles that appear over the opening sequence of the game explain that his full name is indeed Gordon Freeman, and that he’s a 27-year-old theoretical physicist with a PhD from MIT who has been recently hired to work at Black Mesa. The game’s loading screen and its box art show us a rather atypical FPS protagonist, someone very different from the muscle-bound, cigar-chomping Duke Nukem or the cocky budding Jedi knight Kyle Katarn: a slim, studious-looking fellow with Coke-bottle eyeglasses and a token goatee. The heart of the computer-gaming demographic being what it was in 1998, he was disarmingly easy for many of the first players of <em>Half-Life</em> to identify with, thus adding just that one more note of immersion to the symphony. Small wonder that he has remained a favorite with cosplayers for decades. In fact, cipher though he almost entirely is, Gordon Freeman has become one of the most famous videogame characters in history.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6189"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>The tram eventually arrives at its destination and a security guard welcomes you to the part of the complex where you work: “Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you’re running late.” Passing through the double blast doors, you learn from your colleagues inside that it’s already been a rough morning: the main computer has crashed, which has thrown a wrench into an important test that was planned for today. Mind you, you don’t learn this through dialog menus, which Valve judged to qualify as taking control away from the player. You can’t speak at all, but if you approach the guards and scientists, they’ll say things to you, leaving you to imagine your own role in the conversation. Or you can stand back and listen to the conversations they have with one another.</p>
<p>You can wander around as you like in this office area. You can look in Gordon’s locker to learn a little bit more about him, buy a snack from the vending machine, even blow it up by microwaving it for too long. (“My God!” says your colleague in reaction. “What are you doing?”) All of this inculcates the sense of a lived-in workspace better than any amount of external exposition could have done, setting up a potent contrast with the havoc to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_3/" rel="attachment wp-att-6190"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_3-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>When you get bored fooling around with lockers and microwaves, you put on your hazardous-environment suit and head down to where the day’s test is to be conducted. It isn’t made clear to you the player just what the test is meant to accomplish; it isn’t even clear that Gordon himself understands the entirety of the research project to which he’s been assigned. All that matters is that the test goes horribly wrong, creating a “resonance cascade event” that’s accompanied by a lot of scary-looking energy beams flying through the air and explosions popping off everywhere. You’ve now reached the end of the second chapter without ever touching a weapon. But that’s about to change, because you’re about to find out that hostile alien lifeforms are now swarming the place. “Get to the surface as soon as you can and let someone know we’re stranded down here!” demand your colleagues. So, you pick up the handy crowbar you find lying on the floor and set off to batter a path through the opposition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_4/" rel="attachment wp-att-6191"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_4-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>This was a drill with which 1990s shooter fans were a lot more familiar, but there are still plenty of new wrinkles. The scientists and guards who were present in the complex before all hell broke loose don’t just disappear. They’re still around, mostly cowering in the corners in the case of the former, doing their best to fight back in that of the latter. The scientists sometimes have vital information to share, while the guards will join you as full-blown allies, firing off their pop-gun pistols at your side, although they tend not to live very long. Allies were a new thing under the FPS sun in 1998, an idea that would quickly spread to other games. (Ditto the way that the guards here are almost better at shooting you in the back than they are at shooting the rampaging aliens. The full history of “allies” in the FPS genre is a fraught one…)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_5/" rel="attachment wp-att-6192"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5.jpg 800w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_5-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>As you battle your way up through the complex, you witness plenty of pre-scripted scenes to go along with the emergent behavior of the scientists, guards, and aliens. Ideally, you won’t consciously notice any distinction between the two. You see a scientist being transformed into a zombie by an alien “head crab” behind the window of his office; see several hapless sad sacks tumbling down an open elevator shaft; see a dying guard trying and just failing to reach a healing station. These not only add to the terror and drama, but sometimes have a teaching function. The dying guard, for example, points out to you the presence of healing stations for ensuring that you don’t come to share his fate.</p>
<p>It’s the combination of emergent and scripted behaviors, on the part of your enemies and even more on that of your friends, that makes <em>Half-Life</em> come so vividly alive. I’m tempted to use the word “realism” here, but I know that Gabe Newell would rush to correct me if I did. Realism, he would say, is boring. Realistically, a guy like Gordon Freeman — heck, even one like Duke Nukem — wouldn’t last ten minutes in a situation like this one. Call it verisimilitude instead, a sign of a game that’s absolutely determined to stay true to its fictional premise, never mind how outlandish it is. The world <em>Half-Life</em> presents really is a living one; Newell’s rule of thumb was that five seconds should never pass without something happening near the player. Likewise, the world has to react to anything the player does. “If I shoot the wall, the wall should change, you know?” Newell said. “Similarly, if I were to throw a grenade at a grunt, he should react to it, right? I mean, he should run away from it or lay down on the ground and duck for cover. If he can’t run away from it, he should yell ‘Shit!’ or ‘Fire in the hole!’ or something like that.” In <em>Half-Life</em>, he will indeed do one or all of these things.</p>
<p>The commitment to verisimilitude means that most of what you see and hear is, to use the language of film, diegetic, or internal to the world as Gordon Freeman is experiencing it. Even the onscreen HUD is the one that Gordon is seeing, being the one that’s built into his hazard suit. The exceptions to the diegetic rule are few: the musical soundtrack that plays behind your exploits; the chapter names and titles which flash on the screen from time to time; those credits that are superimposed over the tram ride at the very beginning. These exceptions notwithstanding, the game’s determination to immerse you in an almost purely diegetic sensory bubble is the reason I have to strongly differ with Jeff Green’s description of <em>Half-Life</em> as an “interactive movie.” It’s actually the polar opposite of such a stylized beast. It’s an exercise in raw immersion which seeks to eliminate any barriers between you and your lived experience rather than making you feel like you’re doing anything so passive as watching or even guiding a movie. One might go so far as to take <em>Half-Life</em> as a sign that gaming was finally growing up and learning to stand on its own two feet by 1998, no longer needing to take so many of its cues from other forms of media.</p>
<p>We’ve about reached the end of our hour in <em>Half-Life</em> now, so we can dispense with the blow-by-blow. This is not to say that we’ve seen all the game has to offer. Betwixt and between the sequences that I find somewhat tedious going are more jaw-dropping dramatic peaks: the moment when you reach the exit to the complex at long last, only to learn that the United States Army wants to terminate rather than rescue you; the moment when you discover a tram much like the one you arrived on and realize that you can drive it through the tunnels; the moment when you burst out of the complex completely and see the bright blue desert sky above. (Unfortunately, it’s partially blotted out by a big Marine helicopter that also wants to kill you).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/__trashed/half-life_6/" rel="attachment wp-att-6193"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_6.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_6.jpg 1024w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life_6-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, <em>Half-Life</em> could have been an even better game if it had been about half as long, made up of only its most innovative and stirring moments — “all killer, no filler,” as they used to say in the music business. Alas, the marketplace realities of game distribution in the late 1990s militated against this. If you were going to charge a punter $40 or $50 for a boxed game, you had to make sure it lasted more than six or seven hours. If <em>Half-Life</em> was being made today, Valve might very well have made different choices.</p>
<p>Again, though, mileages will vary when it comes to these things. The one place where <em>Half-Life</em> does fall down fairly undeniably is right at the end. Your climactic journey into Xen, the world of the aliens, is so truncated by time and budget considerations as to be barely there at all, being little more than a series of (infuriating) jumping puzzles and a couple of boss fights. Tellingly, it’s here that <em>Half-Life</em> gives in at last and violates its own rules of engagement, by delivering — perish the thought! — a cutscene containing the last bits of exposition that Valve didn’t have time to shoehorn into their game proper. The folks from Valve almost universally name the trip to Xen as their biggest single regret, saying they wish they had either found a way to do it properly or just saved it for a sequel. Needless to say, I can only concur.</p>
<p>Yet the fact remains that <em>Half-Life</em> at its best is so audacious and so groundbreaking that it almost transcends such complaints. Its innovations have echoed down across decades and genres. We’ll be bearing witness to that again and again in the years to come as we continue our journey through gaming history. Longtime readers of this site will know that I’m very sparing in my use of words like “revolutionary.” But I feel no reluctance whatsoever to apply the word to this game.</p>

People who boast about their IQ are losers."</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Now, it’s worth noting that if you want to know your own IQ, and you’ve never taken an official test, just think about whatever your SAT scores were. The two are </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x?casa_token=NQuQDI9kSFkAAAAA%3A39BR8cUxFZhJ_fatyxDyXmAIv1xff0vlZmUW1uB9tQ1rgaqzJHv6_SWn0FdDCD6i6avf4jNMv_xwrA" rel="">very well-correlated</a><span>. If you “test well” then you probably have a high IQ (and people are quite comfortable </span><a href="https://theuntangler.wordpress.com/2023/03/25/estimating-scott-alexanders-iq/" rel="">estimating</a><span> IQ off of test scores in the modern age).</span></p><p><span>But this gives us an easy question: did Einstein and other great geniuses of the past “test well?” If they did, then they probably had a high IQ. This method isn’t perfect, but since we lack any actual IQ data on the majority of historical geniuses, it can at least point us in the right direction. E.g., </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/02/11/was-albert-einstein-really-a-bad-student-who-failed-math/" rel="">Einstein</a></p><blockquote><p><span>did flunk the entrance exam to the Zurich Polytechnic when he first took it — when he was about 1 1/2 years away from graduating high school, at age 16, and hadn’t had a lot of French, the language in which the exam was given. He did fine on the math section but failed the language, botany and zoology sections, </span><a href="http://www.history.com/topics/einsteins-life-facts-and-fiction" rel="">according to history.com</a><span>. A 1984 </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/14/science/einstein-revealed-as-brilliant-in-youth.html?pagewanted=all" rel="">New York Times story</a><span> says that the essay Einstein wrote for this exam was “full of errors” but pointed to his later interests.</span></p></blockquote><p>And yes, he was taking it in a second language, and trying to get into college early, but still, failing botany and zoology? Just “fine” on the math section? Hard to imagine most AP students now-a-days getting those sort of scores. While we can’t possibly know if the standardized tests at the time are as closely correlated to IQ as SAT scores are today, surely they correlate to some degree?</p><p><span>What about Einstein’s grades? Current evidence tells us that grades are “</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127298/#" rel="">strongly positively correlated</a><span>” with IQ. If someone gets very high grades, we’d expect them to score high on an IQ test. And while there certainly may be differences between now and then, Einstein was not getting top grades. Here’s his high school report card, with grades spanning from 1-6 (not all sixes):</span></p><p>One reply might be that Einstein was merely a mathematical genius, and so of course he didn’t score well on other subjects. Yet, his grades in college, when he could take mostly mathematical subjects, are around the same—in fact he didn’t get a single maximum grade. This is again on a 1-6 scale:</p><p>Einstein seemed to be a mostly B+ student in college, even in math. My guess is this holds for most historical figures now widely considered geniuses, and only in rare cases would the historical record show them consistently acing tests and getting extremely high GPAs in their high schools, things which are, in the modern day, strongly associated with very high IQ.</p><p>If we play this game of hypothetical oval-filling, just based on his actual academic record I would estimate that Einstein would get in the 700s on the math section of the SATs, and maybe in the 600s on the verbal section. Ball-parking it, as one must, I think Einstein’s IQ was therefore probably more around 120 or 130 than 160. Indeed very high! But maybe not even “genius level.” He would have scored similarly to Feynman, one of the few geniuses we for sure have a modern IQ for, which was “merely” 125. This conclusion fits well with how</p><p><span>Consider a book from the 1950s, </span><em>The Making of a Scientist</em><span> by psychologist and Harvard professor </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Roe" rel="">Anne Roe</a><span>, in which she supposedly measured the IQ of Nobel Prize winners. The book is occasionally </span><a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/07/annals-of-psychometry-iqs-of-eminent.html" rel="">dug up</a><span> and used as evidence that Nobel Prize winners have an extremely high IQ, like 160 plus. But it’s really an example of how many studies of genius are methodologically deeply flawed. In the book, the claims and numbers verge on the obviously ridiculous (e.g., Roe cites someone who claims that Goethe had an IQ of 210, noting that this beat out Leibniz at 205).</span></p><p>Yet, Roe never used an official IQ tests on her subjects, the Nobel Prize winners. Rather, she made up her test, simply a timed test that used SAT questions of the day. Why? Because most IQ tests have ceilings (you can only score like a 130 or 140 on them) and Roe thought—without any evidence or testing—that would be too low for the Nobel Prize winners. And while she got some help with this from the organization that created the SATs, she admits:</p><blockquote><p>The test I used is not one that has been used before, at least in this form.</p></blockquote><p>And furthermore:</p><blockquote><p>I was not particularly concerned at the outset over the fact that I had no norms for this test. That is, I had no idea what any other population would do on the same test.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, she had an untested set of SAT questions that she gave to Nobel prize winners not knowing how anyone else would do on them. This is pretty problematic. Normally IQ tests try to achieve some form of group-level neutrality; e.g., many of the major modern IQ tests are constructed from the outset so as not show any average difference between male and female takers, to be as culturally-invariant as possible, etc. And while Roe didn’t publish without any comparison group to her chosen geniuses whatsoever, the comparison that she did use was only a graduating class of PhD students (sample size unknown, as far as I can tell) who also took some other more standard IQ tests of the day, and she basically just converted from their scores on the other tests to scores on her make-shift test of SAT questions. Yet, here are the raw numbers of how the Nobel-prize winners do on the test she created:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png" width="422" height="196.51960784313727" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:380,&quot;width&quot;:816,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:422,&quot;bytes&quot;:269376,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff69e20ca-cccc-4819-b46e-54acdd404bf8_816x380.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Notice anything? The Nobel Prize winners all scored rather average. In fact, pretty low, in some cases.

Nevertheless I believe that they are meaningful and a fair guide to what the situation is. The median score of this group on this verbal test is approximately equivalent to an IQ of 166.</p></blockquote><p>Wait a minute. How did this conversion to a median IQ of 166 take place? After all, the scientists are scoring in the middle of the range on the test. They are getting a lot of questions wrong. E.g., Biologists who won the Nobel Prize got a 56.6 on the Verbal but we know that was far from the maximum score, Experimental Physicists got an even lower 46.6, etc. How then did she arrive at the group altogether having an astoundingly-high median verbal IQ of 166? Assuming that those at the upper range of scoring got close to most of the questions right (she mentions this is true, some only missed 4-10 questions at the maximum range), then how can getting only roughly two-thirds of the questions right translate to an IQ in the 160s?</p><p>Perhaps these SAT questions were just impossibly hard? Judge for yourself. Here’s one of the two examples she gives of the type of questions the Nobel Prize winners answered:</p><blockquote><p>In each item in the first section, four words were given, and the subject had to pick the two which were most nearly opposite in meaning and underline them.</p><p><span>Here is one of the items: </span><strong>1.</strong><span> Predictable </span><strong>2.</strong><span> Precarious </span><strong>3.</strong><span> Stable </span><strong>4.</strong><span> Laborious.</span></p></blockquote><p>This. . . isn’t very hard (spoiler: 2 &amp; 3). So the conclusion of a median verbal IQ of 166 is deeply questionable, and totally reliant on this mysterious conversion she performed.</p><p>This sort of experimental setup would never fly today (my guess is the statistical conversion had all sorts of problems, e.g., Roe mentions extraordinarily high IQ numbers for PhD students at the time that don’t make sense, like an avg. IQ of 140). A far more natural reading of her results is to remove the mysterious conversion and look at the raw data, which is that the Nobel-prize-winning scientists scored well but not amazingly on SAT questions, indicating that Nobel Prize winners would get test scores above average but would not ace the SATs, since the average was far below the top of the possible range.</p><p><span>Now that I’ve finished being hard on poor Anne Roe, long deceased and unable to defend herself, an interesting woman who lived and worked when science was more of a Wild West, and who was the 9th tenured female professor at Harvard, it’s worth pointing out that a lot of the other stuff in her book is fascinating, like her examination of Nobel Prize winners’ habits and backgrounds. So to be fair to those once here and now gone, I’ll let Anne end this section in her own words, written in a footnote of </span><em>The Making of a Scientist</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>It is now being considered whether we might not do better to work at the problem in a different way and try to include other factors such as motivation. I strongly endorse this. For some time I have been convinced that there is no such thing as “creative ability” as a unit factor which some people have and some do not, and I strongly suspect that I will soon come to the conclusion that the same thing applies to intellectual ability as a thing apart.</p></blockquote><p>Anne was right, because we now know that</p><p><span>Practice works wonders for IQ tests, just as it does the SATs. There is a limited set of types of questions IQ tests ask, always variations on a theme. The more you familiarize yourself with Raven’s Progressive Matrices, the better you’ll do on them. Even just practice in general problem solving can boost IQ scores. Consider an </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0160289686900164" rel="">experiment</a><span> conducted by R. Kvashchev in former Yugoslavia:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>In an effort to improve performance of high school students on intelligence tests, a large-scale study involving 296 students was carried out. Members of the experimental group (</span><em>N</em><span> = 149) were given exercises in creative problem solving 3 to 4 times a week over a period of 3 years and performance was assessed on four occasions. . . The test battery contained 28 measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In a reanalysis of the data published in 2020 in the </span><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709590/pdf/jintelligence-08-00041.pdf" rel="">Journal of Intelligence</a></em><span> the authors argued that</span></p><blockquote><p>with the properly defined measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, the experimental group showed a 15 IQ points higher increase than the control group. We concluded that prolonged intensive training in creative problem-solving can lead to substantial and positive effects on intelligence during late adolescence (ages 18–19).</p></blockquote><p><span>Regardless of if IQ numbers really are this changeable so late in development, I think people who supposedly score incredibly high on specialized IQ tests, like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WKsr4b_7NY" rel="">Chris Langan</a><span>, a bouncer with an “IQ of 200,” are simply people who practice IQ tests and know them in and out, treating such IQ tests much the way Jeopardy contests treat the show—as a subject of obsession and study. And just like how being a good Jeopardy contestant has no connection to real genius, so too with those who score extremely high on IQ tests. Because what’s important to keep in mind is that</span></p><p><span>You can find all over the internet sites giving some form of this claim: “IQ is one of the most valid and reliable psychological constructs.” And this is true. . . </span><em>by the standards of psychology. </em><span>Don’t mistake this for being what a normal person would refer to as “reliable.” In the field of psychology, almost nothing is reliable. Effects regularly cannot be replicated, and those that can inevitably decrease in their effect size, often shrinking to the barely observable. Psychology </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/replication-crisis" rel="">struggles</a><span> as a discipline to achieve even close to the same tensile strength in its hypotheses as other scientific fields, like physics or biology. Yet, sometimes IQ is treated as if it rises, miraculously, above these problems.</span></p><p>It doesn’t. As IQ gets higher, it gets less definite. Rankings of Person A and B will swap places depending on what test they take. Meaning that IQ is “valid and reliable” at the level that psychologists care about, which is being able to get significant values for their p-values across large data sets. But here’s how actual scores look for individuals if they take different IQ tests:</p><p><span>J, who received a 101 on one test and an 86 on another, is either completely average or so dumb he almost cannot serve in the army (where the IQ cutoff is 83). L is either ready for her PhD at 124, or, alternatively, she and J are identical (102 vs. 101). There are a few people who are surprisingly stable, like F, but the majority vary by big point spreads. According to </span><a href="https://www.questarai.com/resources-docs/briefs/Assessment-Brief-Test-Reliability-Indicates-More-than-Just-Consistency.pdf" rel="">some estimates</a><span>, the standard error of measurement of IQ tests is around seven points, meaning you should regularly expect things like 10-20 point spreads, just as we see here. (Broadly we can think of this error as being either across tests or upon re-taking the same test. The exact error might not even be a definable thing, but what’s relevant is that it can lead to large two-digit spreads, like J’s 15-point spread or L’s 22-point spread or B’s 20-point spread).</span></p><p><span>The situation is even worse for IQs of 140 plus. First, the number of tests that have higher ceilings and can reach stratospheric numbers is low. Which means the tests are not as well-established or researched, and instead are often ad hoc or not appropriately normed. The consequence is that the amount of uncertainty, the 20-point spreads, is for the normal range of scores, e.g., for scores below 125 or 130. Once you start climbing beyond that the variation in scores get larger and larger. It doubles. No, it quadruples! This effect has been known for a very long time, at least since </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#cite_note-TermanMerrill1937p44-106" rel="">1937</a><span>. Here’s from the more recent “</span><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315055952/https://faculty.education.uiowa.edu/docs/default-source/dlohman/ability-testing-and-talent-identification.pdf?sfvrsn=0" rel="">Identification of Students for Gifted and Talented Services: Theory into Practice</a></em><span>:”</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The concerns associated with SEMs [standard errors of measurement] are actually substantially worse for scores at the extremes of the distribution, especially when scores approach the maximum possible on a test. . . when students answer most of the items correctly. In these cases, errors of measurement for scale scores will increase substantially at the extremes of the distribution. </span><strong>Commonly the SEM is from two to four times larger for very high scores than for scores near the mean.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Two to four times larger?! This means that spreads of 20-40 points should be the norm, and could get truly crazy beyond that. So we should expect Jack taking a high-ceiling IQ test and getting a 160, and then taking another high-ceiling IQ test and getting a 120. And there’s not an infinite battery of high-ceiling IQ tests we can throw at people to narrow this down (especially since small changes to the tests themselves will likely catapult us along some other axis of variance). This increasing incoherence of higher scores shows up in studies of the real-world impact of IQ, where the</p><p><span>This was precisely Nassim Taleb’s point when he wrote the anti-IQ screed “</span><a href="https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39" rel="">IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle</a><span>.” Taleb, never afraid to praise Taleb, recently </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1645735174410231809" rel="">said</a><span> in a Tweet that “No piece in history has been more influential in fighting racism, eugenism, &amp; racial mandarinism” (these debates are long-standing and significantly predate Taleb’s essay). In the piece itself he argued, in traditional swing-for-the-fences fashion, that IQ tests are</span></p><blockquote><p><em>via negativa</em><span> not </span><em>via positiva</em><span>. Designed for learning disabilities. . . it ends up selecting for exam-takers, paper shufflers, obedient IYIs (intellectuals yet idiots), ill adapted for “real life”.</span></p></blockquote><p>This means that Taleb, instead of defending the motte (IQ at high levels doesn’t tell us about genius, in fact, high-IQ differentials don’t matter much if at all, and are immeasurable anyways) Taleb ended up defending the easily-attackable bailey (IQ tells us nothing!). The more tenable position is to be a believer in the first, and a disbeliever in the second. Yet most of Taleb’s critics took him at his word, and considered it a satisfying rebuttal that IQs above 100 scaled in correlation with anything at all—grades, income, whatever—no matter how weakly.</p><p><span>But given its known measurement variance, IQs mattering less and less at higher scales almost has to be true, since the variance alone injects huge amounts of noise into any study. From a statistical level it would be shocking to get really clear results differentiating any real-world factor between IQs of 130 vs. 150, simply because the error is so large, and the number of people even satisfying those conditions is so small (in fact, it’s quite likely that, due to variance and practice, the average Mensa member is </span><a href="https://cremieux.substack.com/p/mensa-the-above-average-iq-society" rel="">far under</a><span> the actual IQ requirement). Consider a recent example: the debate over a big modern study published this January tracking 59,000 men.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png" width="530" height="671.5598290598291" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1186,&quot;width&quot;:936,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:530,&quot;bytes&quot;:479962,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64a3237b-8d54-475d-b302-d45b50506517_936x1186.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The problem with these debates, and leaning too much on one study, is that there is a huge literature on IQ, which means that people on either side of the debate can pull up a dozen studies showing whatever they want (there are a lot of fields like this). Yet, from what I can tell, the issue of test variance appears a barrier impossible to overcome. E.g., one might counter the above study showing that IQ ceases to matter for income with another, earlier study, that claims to answer “</span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691620964122?casa_token=hlwkSw6yKHAAAAAA%3A4ym66ghFVKNkqjdoUT7pVgOIPpqZiZAgoMp-HGxAsstJJu2mUjmUyU7EX36B4adkERIKao70blm8iQ&amp;journalCode=ppsa" rel="">Can You Ever Be Too Smart for Your Own Good?</a><span>” in the negative. In that earlier study they correlated 214 life outcomes (things like educational achievement and income) to IQ, and find that</span></p><blockquote><p>Given these results, greater cognitive ability does not cease to remain beneficial for individuals with above average ability or with scores greater than IQ = 120.</p></blockquote><p>Well, that settles it, right? Nope. Because as usual, there’s a lot of motte and bailey switching here. What they actually find is that the difference in the hundreds of life outcomes gets tiny at the upper echelons of IQ.</p><blockquote><p>Finally, to check the possibility that only very high intelligence is detrimental, we tested for outcome differences between individuals within the top 10% and top 20% of ability scores. . . We performed a median split within each group (top 10% and top 20%) and compared outcome scores for individuals above or below the median using a simple t test or χ2 test of proportions. In only a minority of cases did we detect a significant difference (p &lt; .05) within the top 10% (20 out of 214 comparisons, 9%) or top 20% (48 out of 214 comparisons, 22%) of cognitive ability scores.</p></blockquote><p>So if we actually look at the numbers, there are statistically significant differences in only 48 out of 214 life outcomes in the top 20%, and only 20 out of 214 in the top 10%—and the effects are small too (despite starting from with a very large data set of ~50,000 individuals). Some of the effects are even negative! But this attenuating effect of IQ differentials correlating less and less to outcomes is papered over—instead, victory is declared that there is any detectable difference for IQs above 120 whatsoever.</p><p>If we put the increasingly absurd measurement error together with the lack of clear and replicable real-world difference, the simplest explanation when it comes to IQs of, e.g., 150, 160, 170, is that they simply aren’t real. At higher levels, Jack and Jill swap places endlessly, a game of musical chairs as they jump around 30-point spreads with no way to reliably reduce the variance. And what chair they happen to be sitting in for a particular test, ahead or behind, matters not at all to their life outcomes.</p><p>So if someone regularly talks about IQs significantly above 140 like these were actual measurable and reliable numbers that have a real-world effect, know that they are talking about a fantasy. And if they make claims that various historical figures possessed such numbers, then they’re talking unscientific nonsense. If they’re bragging about themselves, well. . . it’s like someone talking about their astrological sign. Stratospheric IQs are about as real as leprechauns, unicorns, mermaids—they’re fun to tell tales about, but the evidence for them being a repeatedly measurable phenomenon that matters in any meaningful sense of the word is zip, zero, zilch.</p><p><span>In fact, on re-reading it after originally planning to cite it for this essay, I was struck by Gould’s weak and judgy arguments in his </span><em>The Mismeasure of Man</em><span>, a book that supposedly takes down research on IQ. I don’t think that IQ is like measuring skull circumference, nor do I think just talking about IQ, or researching it, is bad, or evil, or inherently racist, or dumb, or whatever other accusation one can throw. I would definitely never say something like “IQ doesn’t matter at all.” I wouldn’t even say “IQ is unimportant.” I think it is important, in that it’s one of the only measurements we have that does an okay job at capturing intelligence, in that it’s not too bad at this when it comes to the center of the distribution, although it gets increasingly bad at it at the tails.</span></p><p><span>And, from a practical perspective, there is a sense in which I’m actually very pro-IQ tests! I recently bemoaned the quiet dropping of the SAT and GRE from college admissions, </span><a href="https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/i-owe-my-career-to-the-sat" rel="">writing that</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>This nation-wide change being officially enshrined this year troubles me in particular because it’s now no longer possible to get a middling high school GPA at a public school, get a top-notch SAT score, get to choose between a couple good colleges, and then have a successful career afterward. Which is how my life went. Of course, no one can really know the true counterfactuals, but it’s likely that the SAT is why I have a career as a scientist and author at all.</p></blockquote><p>But holding that opinion that doesn’t mean that I think really high IQ numbers are actually real, or that IQ is determinate past a certain point in judging “academic potential.”</p><p><span>A simple way of saying it: When I read Tolstoy, what I think is that the man was a genius. If he scored a 120 on an IQ test, that would reflect on IQ tests, not Tolstoy. This holds true in my personal experience as well. I’ve known a couple people in life who got perfect or near-perfect SAT scores and went on to places like Harvard and MIT. I would consider none of them geniuses. They just didn’t have </span><em>it</em><span>. On the other hand, I’ve also been lucky enough to be able to meet, and occasionally work alongside, people I would consider scientific geniuses. Yet never once did I feel that an IQ test would capture these people operating at the highest level of intellectual output (who I will avoid the embarrassment of name dropping). Many of these intellectual stars were not even quick-witted. Sure, all of them were smart, obviously so, and all of them would score above average, likely well above average, on an IQ test. But their individual rankings on those tests, when compared to each other, would mean absolutely nothing. It would just be dead information. Far more important was how they were deep creative thinkers with good instincts for what questions were fecund, coupled with an obsessive drive to pursue those questions. They had elegant minds, deep pools of expertise, and often voracious cultural knowledge outside their chosen discipline. They were people on fire with thought. So if you only did pretty good on the SAT, don’t worry too much. The evidence says you can still win the Nobel Prize.</span></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <!-- content -->
<p>Thailand will cut electricity, oil supplies, and internet services to five locations in Myanmar at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, citing security concerns over suspected Chinese-operated call center scams. The sites, located in Payathonzu, Tachileik, and Myawaddy townships along the border, have been linked to fraudulent operations targeting victims in Thailand, China, and other countries. Authorities estimate that these scams have cost Thailand alone over 80 million baht per day, amounting to 86 billion baht in total.</p>



<p>The move was decided during an urgent meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister for security affairs Phumtham Wechayachai. The meeting included Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, National Security Council Secretary-General Chatchai Bangchuad, Interior Permanent Secretary Orasit Samphantharat, and Deputy Governor of the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) Prasit Chanprasit. Phumtham stressed that national security concerns outweigh economic interests, warning that government officials failing to act could face reassignment.</p>



<p>Authorities have identified unusually high electricity consumption at the targeted sites, reinforcing suspicions that these locations are central to large-scale scam operations. Under the Provincial Electricity Authority Act and a 1996 Cabinet Resolution, the PEA has the authority to cut power to sites found to be non-compliant with contractual agreements. Phumtham emphasized that the decision does not require additional government approval and ordered immediate action.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://offload-bangkoklocal.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Thailand-to-cut-power-oil-and-.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Photos Courtesy
thaipbs</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are concerns about potential retaliation from Myanmar, particularly regarding natural gas supplies to Thailand. However, Phumtham remained non-committal on the matter, instead reiterating the significant financial and social harm caused by scam operations based in Myanmar.</p>



<p>These fraudulent networks are known to operate primarily from two locations in Myawaddy township: Shwe Kokko and KK Park, both notorious for criminal activities. Thai authorities have previously cut power to three locations in Myanmar in similar efforts to disrupt illegal call centers.</p>



<p>The crackdown comes just before Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s visit to China, where she will participate in events marking 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. The issue of transnational crime, particularly online scams, is expected to be a topic of discussion between Thai and Chinese officials.</p>



<p>Officials attending the security meeting emphasized that action against the call centers falls within Myanmar’s jurisdiction, though Thailand has formally communicated its concerns. A Thai security officer noted that up to 100,000 people, including individuals of various nationalities and a hospital, could be affected by the power cuts in Myawaddy. Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul stated that the PEA must have a formal order from Phumtham before proceeding, and that the exact areas to be affected had been clearly identified.</p>



<p>Thailand’s latest move signals a shift from previous reluctance in tackling cross-border electricity supplies to suspected scam hubs. By cutting power and internet access, Thai authorities aim to disrupt these operations and mitigate the financial damage caused to victims both domestically and internationally.</p>

                                        <p>Amid uncertainty about frozen research aid from the National Institutes of Health, the University of Pittsburgh has put its Ph.D. admissions on ice. The school confirmed Friday that there would be no new Ph.D. offers of admission while Pitt works to understand how reduced federal aid could impact the institution.</p><p>The move comes as research universities across the country battle against the National Institutes of Health over a policy to <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-10/pitt-cmu-national-institute-health-funding" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">reduce the funding cap for ancillary research expenses</a> like building construction and maintenance as well as support staff.</p><p>The policy would reduce the cap for those indirect research costs to 15%. Pitt’s current rate is 59%. A federal judge <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-21/nih-funding-indirects-judge-stay" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">extended a temporary pause</a> on implementation of that policy Friday. But Pitt’s decision to halt admissions was made earlier in the week.</p><p>"After the announcement that NIH indirect costs would be capped at 15%, the University’s Office of the Provost temporarily paused additional Ph.D. offers of admission until the impacts of that cap were better understood,” a Pitt spokesperson said in a statement to WESA.</p><p>The pause applies to all Pitt departments, not just medical and scientific research programs. University leadership is evaluating how reduced funding could impact the school, and it’s not clear when Ph.D. offers will resume.</p><p>“The University is in the process of completing that analysis and expects to be in a position to resume offers soon," the spokesperson said.</p><p>Emails obtained by WESA show Pitt faculty informing a Ph.D. applicant about the pause, explaining that the timeline and decision-making process is unclear. The email indicates that the applicant had upcoming plans to tour the campus and was highly recommended by the department for admission.</p><p>Pitt is not the first research university to take such a drastic measure as it tries to find its financial footing amid the Trump administration’s first month. The University of Southern California paused admissions in some of its departments last week, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/19/trump-funding-freeze-grad-student-postdoc-acceptances-paused-nih-research/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">according to STAT</a>.</p><p>And <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2025/02/15/graduate-student-admissions-temporarily-paused-as-university-monitors-federal-funding/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">according to the Vanderbilt Hustler</a>, the student newspaper at Vanderbilt University, a dean at the Tennessee school announced a pause on graduate student admissions last week. The school later told the paper that admissions were not paused but steps were being taken to “balance program admissions with current student needs.”</p><p>The NIH announced the cuts earlier this month, sending shockwaves through Pittsburgh’s life sciences sector. The University of Pittsburgh said in a statement shortly after the announcement that such cuts would harm the institution's mission “irreparably.”</p><p>A <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-21/nih-grants-indirects-trump-pittsburgh" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">WESA analysis</a> found that if the indirect cost cuts were implemented for the 2024 fiscal year, the University of Pittsburgh would have seen a $115 million drop in indirect funds. Carnegie Mellon University, another major research hub in Pittsburgh, would have seen a $3 million drop. It’s unclear how the cuts would impact the schools’ 2025 budget.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite the courts holding off implementation of the funding cuts, WESA has found grants from the NIH are <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/health-science-tech/2025-02-21/nih-funding-indirects-judge-stay" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">already lagging significantly behind this year compared to the first few weeks of 2024</a>. Between Inauguration Day and Feb. 15, roughly $781 million have been awarded to projects at research institutions nationwide. That’s a nearly 56% decrease compared to the same period in 2024 when $1.8 billion was awarded.</p><p>And with almost all grant review meetings on indefinite hold at NIH, former staffers tell WESA the plunge in funding is likely to continue.</p>

      <h2>Understand what people need</h2>

      <p>We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service</li>
  <li>Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent</li>
  <li>Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible</li>
  <li>Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences</li>
  <li>Share findings with the team and agency leadership</li>
  <li>Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as “user stories”</li>
  <li>As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Who are your primary users?</li>
  <li>What user needs will this service address?</li>
  <li>Why does the user want or need this service?</li>
  <li>Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?</li>
  <li>Which research methods were used?</li>
  <li>What were the key findings?</li>
  <li>How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?</li>
  <li>How often are you testing with real people?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 2</h6>
      <h2>Address the whole experience, from start to finish</h2>

      <p>We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter — whether it’s online or offline — should move the user closer towards their goal.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person</li>
  <li>Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs</li>
  <li>Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service</li>
  <li>Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?</li>
  <li>Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?</li>
  <li>Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?</li>
  <li>What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 3</h6>
      <h2>Make it simple and intuitive</h2>

      <p>Using a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting. It’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the service. Use the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards">U.S. Web Design System</a> as a default</li>
  <li>Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services</li>
  <li>Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process</li>
  <li>Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service</li>
  <li>Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process</li>
  <li>Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand</li>
  <li>Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?</li>
  <li>Is the language as plain and universal as possible?</li>
  <li>What languages is your service offered in?</li>
  <li>If a user needs help while using the service, how do they go about getting it?</li>
  <li>How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 4</h6>
      <h2>Build the service using agile and iterative practices</h2>

      <p>We should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users’ hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust based on user feedback about the service. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed</li>
  <li>Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made</li>
  <li>Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely using techniques such as launch meetings, strategy rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools</li>
  <li>Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners</li>
  <li>Release features and improvements multiple times each month</li>
  <li>Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”</li>
  <li>Use a source code version control system</li>
  <li>Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system</li>
  <li>Use code reviews to ensure quality</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it hasn’t shipped yet, when will it?</li>
  <li>How long does it take for a production deployment?</li>
  <li>How many days or weeks are in each iteration/sprint?</li>
  <li>Which version control system is being used?</li>
  <li>How are bugs tracked and tickets issued? What tool is used?</li>
  <li>How is the feature backlog managed? What tool is used?</li>
  <li>How often do you review and reprioritize the feature and bug backlog?</li>
  <li>How do you collect user feedback during development? How is that feedback used to improve the service?</li>
  <li>At each stage of usability testing, which gaps were identified in addressing user needs?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 5</h6>
      <h2>Structure budgets and contracts to support delivery</h2>

      <p>To improve our chances of success when contracting out development work, we need to work with experienced budgeting and contracting officers. In cases where we use third parties to help build a service, a well-defined contract can facilitate good development practices like conducting a research and prototyping phase, refining product requirements as the service is built, evaluating open source alternatives, ensuring frequent delivery milestones, and allowing the flexibility to purchase cloud computing resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://techfarhub.cio.gov/handbook/">The TechFAR Handbook</a> provides a detailed explanation of the flexibilities in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that can help agencies implement this play.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities</li>
  <li>Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones</li>
  <li>Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables</li>
  <li>Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves</li>
  <li>Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made</li>
  <li>Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law</li>
  <li>Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like “pay-for-what-you-use” services</li>
  <li>Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government</li>
  <li>Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is the scope of the project? What are the key deliverables?</li>
  <li>What are the milestones? How frequent are they?</li>
  <li>What are the performance metrics defined in the contract (e.g., response time, system uptime, time period to address priority issues)?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 6</h6>
      <h2>Assign one leader and hold that person accountable</h2>

      <p>There must be a single product owner who has the authority and responsibility to assign tasks and work elements; make business, product, and technical decisions; and be accountable for the success or failure of the overall service. This product owner is ultimately responsible for how well the service meets the needs of its users, which is how a service should be evaluated. The product owner is responsible for ensuring that features are built and managing the feature and bug backlogs.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>A product owner has been identified</li>
  <li>All stakeholders agree that the product owner has the authority to assign tasks and make decisions about features and technical implementation details</li>
  <li>The product owner has a product management background with technical experience to assess alternatives and weigh tradeoffs</li>
  <li>The product owner has a work plan that includes budget estimates and identifies funding sources</li>
  <li>The product owner has a strong relationship with the contracting officer</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Who is the product owner?</li>
  <li>What organizational changes have been made to ensure the product owner has sufficient authority over and support for the project?</li>
  <li>What does it take for the product owner to add or remove a feature from the service?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 7</h6>
      <h2>Bring in experienced teams</h2>

      <p>We need talented people working in government who have experience creating modern digital services. This includes bringing in seasoned product managers, engineers, and designers. When outside help is needed, our teams should work with contracting officers who understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so our teams can be paired with contractors who are good at both building and delivering effective digital services. The makeup and experience requirements of the team will vary depending on the scope of the project.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience building popular, high-traffic digital services</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience designing mobile and web applications</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience using automated testing frameworks</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience with modern development and operations (DevOps) techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment</li>
  <li>Member(s) of the team have experience securing digital services</li>
  <li>A Federal contracting officer is on the internal team if a third party will be used for development work</li>
  <li>A Federal budget officer is on the internal team or is a partner</li>
  <li>The appropriate privacy, civil liberties, and/or legal advisor for the department or agency is a partner</li>
</ol>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 8</h6>
      <h2>Choose a modern technology stack</h2>

      <p>The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services</li>
  <li>Whenever possible, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types</li>
  <li>Ensure that each project has clear, understandable instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/memotociostechnologyneutrality.pdf">Consider open source software solutions</a> at every layer of the stack</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What is your development stack and why did you choose it?</li>
  <li>Which databases are you using and why did you choose them?</li>
  <li>How long does it take for a new team member to start contributing?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 9</h6>
      <h2>Deploy in a flexible hosting environment</h2>

      <p>Our services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet spikes in traffic and user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers that market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Resources are provisioned on demand</li>
  <li>Resources scale based on real-time user demand</li>
  <li>Resources are provisioned through an API</li>
  <li>Resources are available in multiple regions</li>
  <li>We only pay for resources we use</li>
  <li>Static assets are served through a content delivery network</li>
  <li>Application is hosted on commodity hardware</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Where is your service hosted?</li>
  <li>What hardware does your service use to run?</li>
  <li>What is the demand or usage pattern for your service?</li>
  <li>What happens to your service when it experiences a surge in traffic or load?</li>
  <li>How much capacity is available in your hosting environment?</li>
  <li>How long does it take you to provision a new resource, like an application server?</li>
  <li>How have you designed your service to scale based on demand?</li>
  <li>How are you paying for your hosting infrastructure (e.g., by the minute, hourly, daily, monthly, fixed)?</li>
  <li>Is your service hosted in multiple regions, availability zones, or data centers?</li>
  <li>In the event of a catastrophic disaster to a datacenter, how long will it take to have the service operational?</li>
  <li>What would be the impact of a prolonged downtime window?</li>
  <li>What data redundancy do you have built into the system, and what would be the impact of a catastrophic data loss?</li>
  <li>How often do you need to contact a person from your hosting provider to get resources or to fix an issue?</li>
</ul>

    </div>
  
    <div>
      <h6>PLAY 10</h6>
      <h2>Automate testing and deployments</h2>

      <p>Today, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times a day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance are still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality</li>
  <li>Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components</li>
  <li>Run tests automatically as part of the build process</li>
  <li>Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques</li>
  <li>Conduct load and performance tests at regular intervals, including before public launch</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What percentage of the code base is covered by automated tests?</li>
  <li>How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a typical bug fix?</li>
  <li>How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a new feature into production?</li>
  <li>How frequently are builds created?</li>
  <li>What test tools are used?</li>
  <li>Which deployment automation or continuous integration tools are used?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated maximum number of concurrent users who will want to use the system?</li>
  <li>How many simultaneous users could the system handle, according to the most recent capacity test?</li>
  <li>How does the service perform when you exceed the expected target usage volume? Does it degrade gracefully or catastrophically?</li>
  <li>What is your scaling strategy when demand increases suddenly?</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Manage security and privacy through reusable processes</h2>

      <p>Our digital services have to protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, how long it is kept, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.</p>

<p>The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted</li>
  <li>Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept</li>
  <li>Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach</li>
  <li>Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service</li>
  <li>“Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP</li>
  <li>Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Does the service collect personal information from the user?  How is the user notified of this collection?</li>
  <li>Does it collect more information than necessary? Could the data be used in ways an average user wouldn’t expect?</li>
  <li>How does a user access, correct, delete, or remove personal information?</li>
  <li>Will any of the personal information stored in the system be shared with other services, people, or partners?</li>
  <li>How and how often is the service tested for security vulnerabilities?</li>
  <li>How can someone from the public report a security issue?</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Use data to drive decisions</h2>

      <p>At every stage of a project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with it in real-time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to find issues and identify which bug fixes and improvements should be prioritized. Along with monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time</li>
  <li>Monitor system performance in real-time (e.g. response time, latency, throughput, and error rates)</li>
  <li>Ensure monitoring can measure median, 95th percentile, and 98th percentile performance</li>
  <li>Create automated alerts based on this monitoring</li>
  <li>Track concurrent users in real-time, and monitor user behaviors in the aggregate to determine how well the service meets user needs</li>
  <li>Publish metrics internally</li>
  <li>Publish metrics externally</li>
  <li>Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What are the key metrics for the service?</li>
  <li>How have these metrics performed over the life of the service?</li>
  <li>Which system monitoring tools are in place?</li>
  <li>What is the targeted average response time for your service? What percent of requests take more than 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds?</li>
  <li>What is the average response time and percentile breakdown (percent of requests taking more than 1s, 2s, 4s, and 8s) for the top 10 transactions?</li>
  <li>What is the volume of each of your service’s top 10 transactions? What is the percentage of transactions started vs. completed?</li>
  <li>What is your service’s monthly uptime target?</li>
  <li>What is your service’s monthly uptime percentage, including scheduled maintenance? Excluding scheduled maintenance?</li>
  <li>How does your team receive automated alerts when incidents occur?</li>
  <li>How does your team respond to incidents? What is your post-mortem process?</li>
  <li>Which tools are in place to measure user behavior?</li>
  <li>What tools or technologies are used for A/B testing?</li>
  <li>How do you measure customer satisfaction?</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Default to open</h2>

      <p>When we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly, we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the public’s access to government services and information, allow the public to contribute easily, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.</p>

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports</li>
  <li>Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)</li>
  <li>Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver</li>
  <li>Catalog data in the agency’s enterprise data inventory and add any public datasets to the agency’s public data listing</li>
  <li>Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public</li>
  <li>Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost</li>
  <li>When appropriate, create a versioned API for third parties and internal users to interact with the service directly</li>
  <li>When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online</li>
  <li>When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How are you collecting user feedback for bugs and issues?</li>
  <li>If there is an API, what capabilities does it provide? Is it versioned? Who uses it? How is it documented?</li>
  <li>If the codebase has not been released under an open source license, explain why.</li>
  <li>What components are made available to the public as open source?</li>
  <li>What datasets are made available to the public?</li>

	<p>Penn directed department chairs to significantly reduce admissions rates across graduate programs in the face of federal research funding cuts, multiple faculty members told The Daily Pennsylvanian.
</p>
<p>On Friday, Penn notified department chairs that it will cut admissions across graduate programs, a decision faculty members say was made after programs had already accepted students. Professors expressed frustration over the lack of transparency from the University, with some attributing the cuts to broader funding issues — including a proposed $240 million <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/02/penn-uncertainty-remains-nih-funding-lawsuit-research" target="_blank">funding reduction</a> from the National Institutes of Health — and warned that the decision will impact Penn’s research and educational mission, particularly within the School of Arts and Sciences.

<p>Requests for comment were left with a University spokesperson and a spokesperson from the Office of the Provost.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A Penn professor, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution, told the DP that the decision appeared to be “last minute” and came after departments had already informed the University of the students who were selected for graduate programs.&nbsp;
				</p>

	
	
<p>“We go through hundreds of applications, we interviewed dozens of finalists, and basically all that work was just for naught,” the professor said. “We just wasted half of those people’s time because our list just got cut by more than half.”
</p>
<p>The professor added that the University “pulled the rug out” from many faculty members, some of whom had already offered acceptances to students they had thought were admitted — only to now face the possibility of having to cut those students from the program. The professor said that their department — which submitted its choices for admits to its graduate program on Feb. 14 — will be forced to rescind the acceptances of 10 of the 17 students.
	</p>

</center>
	<hr>

			  		
<p>“This whole thing about rescinding offers is just absolutely deplorable,” the professor said.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The DP could not confirm how many schools and departments will be affected by these cuts to admissions at the time of publication. In statements and interviews with the DP, SAS faculty members said that all departments within the school have been notified to reduce the size of their graduate programs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Another Penn professor — who also requested anonymity due to a fear of retribution — wrote in a statement to the DP that SAS called an emergency meeting on Friday evening to address the admissions cuts and “decide on collective action.”
</p>
<p>“On the whole, people were very upset, complaining about lack of transparency and consultation and about decisions being imposed by the [Penn] administration without proper explanation,” the professor wrote.
</p>
<p>The professor noted that many faculty members voiced concerns about how the University’s actions will impact Penn’s “educational mission” and were upset about a “lack of proportionality between the relatively small percentage of the lost income versus the large 35% cut in [graduate] programs.”
</p>
<p>While the University did not inform the departments why it was instituting funding cuts, a professor noted that it could be a response to 1968 Wharton graduate and President Donald Trump’s executive actions, <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/01/penn-graduate-worker-union-rally-contract" target="_blank">graduate students’ unionization efforts</a>, or simply because “[Penn doesn’t] believe in the humanities.”
</p>
<p>While some graduate chairs at the Friday meeting expressed concerns over graduate programs “being punished for unionization,” the majority of faculty members did not “seem to agree” that the cuts were in response to organized labor efforts, according to a professor who attended the meeting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Penn has seen a recent uptick in campus union organizing. In May 2024, Penn’s graduate student workers <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2024/05/penn-graduation-issue-graduate-workers-union-roundup" target="_blank">voted to unionize</a> by an overwhelming majority. Last month, following continued engagement from union groups, around 200 people gathered at a <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/01/penn-graduate-worker-union-rally-contract" target="_blank">rally in front of College Hall</a> in support of securing a graduate student worker contract with the University.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A Perelman School of Medicine professor, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution, said that the school was told to make cuts to Ph.D. programs prior to the NIH funding cuts, but additional cuts have been implemented following executive actions from the Trump administration. The professor expressed concern that Penn may have to cut other programs within the school to account for the loss of federal funding.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>On Feb. 7, the NIH<a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/02/penn-uncertainty-remains-nih-funding-lawsuit-research" target="_blank"> proposed a funding cut</a> that could cost Penn $240 million. While a judge temporarily halted the changes following Penn and 12 other universities bringing a lawsuit against the NIH, the cut — a 15% cap on indirect costs — could stunt the development of graduate programs.
		</p>

		
<p>Indirect funding typically covers overhead research expenses, including equipment, facilities, and administrative expenditures that cannot be claimed as direct costs. Although the NIH does not fund individual graduate programs, indirect grants support academic staff, and cuts could spread departmental resources thin.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In a Feb. 11 <a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2025/02/penn-jameson-addresses-lawsuit-nih-funding-cuts" target="_blank">statement</a> responding to the NIH funding cut, Interim Penn President Larry Jameson reiterated the University’s commitment to ongoing research.
</p>
<p>“I want to emphasize that Penn has long been a leader in research, resilience, and adaptation,” Jameson wrote in an email to the Penn community. “Our community is strong, and we will continue our groundbreaking research, advocate forcefully, and take the steps needed to sustain our mission.”

 		<p>I think it is important to have a bias for action. Like anything else, this is something you can make a habit of. Moving forward allows you to make progress. I don’t know about you, but I’ve frozen up in the past not knowing what the right path was for me. Moving forward, even the smallest possible step, helped break that stasis.</p>
<p>One habit I like is to ask for no, not yes. Note that this is based on my experience at small companies (&lt; 200 employees) where a lot of my experience has been. I’m not sure how it’d work in a big company, non-profit, or government.</p>
<p>When you have something you want to do and that you feel is in scope for your position, but you want a bit of reassurance or to let the boss know what you are up to, it’s common to reach out and ask them for permission. Don’t. Don’t ask for a yes. Instead, <strong>offer a chance to say no, but with a deadline</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this works.</p>
<p>Suppose I want to set up a new GitHub action that I feel will really improve the quality of our software. This isn’t whimsy, I’ve done some research and tested it locally. I may have even asked a former colleague how they used this GitHub action.</p>
<p>But I’m not quite sure. I want to let my boss know that I’ll be modifying the repository.</p>
<p>I could say “hey, boss, can we install action X? It’ll help with the XYZ problems we’ve been having.”</p>
<p>If you have a busy boss (and most people do), this is going to require a bit of work on their part to say “yes”.</p>
<p>They’ll want to review the XYZ problem, think about how X will solve it and maybe do some thinking or prioritization about how this fits in with other work. Or maybe they’ll want you to share what you know. It may fall off their plate. You will probably have to remind them a few times to get around to saying “yes”. It might be a more pressing issue for you</p>
<p>Now, let’s take the alternative approach.”Hey, boss, I am going to install action X, which should solve the XYZ problems we’ve been having. Will take care of this on Monday unless I hear differently from you.”</p>
<p>Do you see the change in tone?</p>
<p>You are saying (without being explicit) that you “got it” and are going to handle this issue. The boss can still weigh in if they want to, but they don’t have to. If they forget about it or other issues pop up, you still proceed. This lets you keep moving forward and solving problems while keeping the boss informed and allowing them to add their two cents if it is important enough.</p>
<p>You can also use this approach with a group of people.</p>
<p>By the way, the deadline is critical too. Which would you respond to more quickly, if it was Jan 15, all other things being equal and assuming a response was needed?</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m going to do task X.”</li>
<li>“I’m going to do task X on Jan 17.”</li>
<li>“I’m going to do task X on Feb 15.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I would respond to the second one, which has a deadline in the near future. I think that is the way most folks work.</p>
<p>Again, pursue this approach for problems you feel are in the scope of your role but that you want to inform the boss about. It’s great when you want to <strong>offer</strong> a chance for feedback, but you are confident enough in the course of action that you don’t <strong>need</strong> feedback.</p>

<p>
    This is a list of software and ideas developed or maintained by the OpenBSD
    project, sorted in order of approximate introduction. Some of them are
    explained in detail in our <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/events.html">research papers</a>.
</p><hr>

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.4">ipsec(4)</a>:
	Started by John Ioannidis, Angelos D. Keromytis, Niels Provos, and
	Niklas Hallqvist, imported February 20, 1997.  OpenBSD was the first
	free operating system to provide an IPSec stack.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/inet6.4">inet6(4)</a>:
	First complete integration and adoption of IPv6 led by
	"Itojun" (Dr. Junichiro Hagino) [WIDE/KAME], Craig Metz [NRL], and
	Angelos D. Keromytis starting Jan 6, 1999.
	Almost fully operational Jun 6, 1999 during the
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/hackathons.html">first OpenBSD hackathon</a>.
	OpenBSD 2.7.
    </li><li><strong>Privilege separation</strong>:
	First implemented by
	<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html">Niels Provos</a>
	and Markus Friedl in OpenSSH in March 2002, released with OpenBSD 3.2.
	The concept is now used in many OpenBSD programs, for example
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dvmrpd.8">dvmrpd(8)</a>,

    </li><li><strong>Privilege revocation</strong>:
	Related to the work on privilege separation, some programs were refactored
	to drop privileges while holding onto a tricky resource such as a raw socket,
	reserved port, or modification-locked bpf(4) descriptor,
	for example
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ping.8">ping(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/traceroute.8">traceroute(8)</a>,
	etc.
    </li><li><strong>Stack protector</strong>:
	Developed since 2001 as "propolice" by Hiroaki Etoh. Integrated, and
	implemented for additional hardware platforms, by Federico G. Schwindt,
	Miod Vallat and Theo de Raadt.  OpenBSD 3.3 was the first operating
	system to enable it systemwide by default.
    </li><li><strong>W^X</strong>:
	First used for sparc, sparc64, alpha, and hppa in OpenBSD 3.3.
	Strictly enforced by default since OpenBSD 6.0: a program can only
	violate it if the executable is marked with <code>PT_OPENBSD_WXNEEDED</code>
	and it is located on a filesystem mounted with the <code>wxallowed</code>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount.8">mount(8)</a> option.
    </li><li><strong>GOT and PLT protection</strong> by ld.so:
	first done as part of the W^X work in OpenBSD 3.3, by Dale Rahn and
	Theo de Raadt. The GOT and PLT regions are read-only outside of ld.so
	itself. Extended to the .init/.fini sections (constructors and
	destructors) in OpenBSD 3.4.
    </li><li><strong>ASLR</strong>:
	OpenBSD 3.4 was the first widely used operating system to
	provide it by default.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gcc-local.1">gcc-local(1)</a>
	__attribute__((__bounded__)) static analysis annotation
	and checking mechanism:
	Started by Anil Madhavapeddy on June 26, 2003
	and ported to GCC 4 by Nicholas Marriott.
	First released with OpenBSD 3.4.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
	randomization implemented by Thierry Deval. Guard pages and randomized (delayed) free added by Ted Unangst.
	Reimplemented by <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/eurobsdcon2009/otto-malloc.pdf">Otto Moerbeek</a>
	for OpenBSD 4.4.
    </li><li><strong>Position-independent executables (PIE)</strong>:
	OpenBSD 5.3 was the first widely used operating system to enable it
	globally by default, on seven hardware platforms.
	Implemented in November 2008 by
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/nycbsdcon08-pie/">Kurt Miller</a>
	and enabled by default by
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/asiabsdcon2015-pie-slides.pdf">Pascal Stumpf</a>
	in August 2012.
    </li><li><strong>Random-data memory</strong>:
	the ability to specify that a variable should be initialized
	at load time with random byte values (placed into a new ELF
	<b>.openbsd.randomdata</b> section) was implemented in
	OpenBSD 5.3 by Matthew Dempsky.
    </li><li><strong>Stack protector per shared object</strong>:
	using the random-data memory feature, each shared object was given its
	own stack protector cookie in OpenBSD 5.3 by Matthew Dempsky.
    </li><li><strong>Static-PIE</strong>:
	Position-independent static binaries for /bin, /sbin and ramdisks.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 5.7 by Kurt Miller and Mark Kettenis.
    </li><li><strong>SROP</strong>
	(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sigreturn.2">sigreturn(2)</a>
	oriented programming) mitigation: attacks researched by
	<a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~herbertb/papers/srop_sp14.pdf">Eric Bosman</a>
	and Herbert Bos in 2014, solution implemented by Theo de Raadt in May 2016,
	enabled by default since OpenBSD 6.0.
    </li><li><strong>Library order randomization</strong>:
	In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a>, re-link
	<code>libc.so</code>, <code>libcrypto</code>, and <code>ld.so</code>
	on startup, placing the objects in a random order.
	Theo de Raadt and Robert Peichaer, May 2016,
	enabled by default since OpenBSD 6.0 and 6.2.
    </li><li>Kernel-assisted lazy-binding for W^X safety in multi-threaded programs.
	A new syscall <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kbind.2">kbind(2)</a>
	permits lazy-binding to be W^X safe in multi-threaded programs.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 5.9 by Philip Guenther in July 2015.
    </li><li>Process layouts in memory tightened to remove execute permission from
	all segmented, non-instruction data and to remove write permission from
	data that is only modified during loading and relocation.
	By combining the RELRO (Read-Only after Relocation) design from the
	GNU project with the original ASLR work from OpenBSD 3.3 and
	strict lazy-binding work from OpenBSD 5.9, this is applied to not
	just a subset of programs and libraries but rather to all programs
	and libraries.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 6.1 by Philip Guenther in August 2016.
    </li><li>Use of <strong>fork+exec in privilege separated programs</strong>. The
	strategy is to give each process a fresh &amp; unique address space for
	ASLR, stack protector -- as protection against address space discovery attacks.
	Implemented first by
	Damien Miller (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> 2004),
	Claudio Jeker (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>, 2015),
	Eric Faurot (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>, 2016),
	Rafael Zalamena (various, 2016), and others.
    </li><li><strong>trapsleds</strong>:
	Reduction of incidental NOP instructions/sequences in the instruction
	stream which could be useful potentially for ROP attack methods to
	inaccurately target gadgets. These NOP sequences are converted into
	trap sequences where possible. Todd Mortimer and Theo de Raadt, June
	2017.
    </li><li><strong>Kernel relinking at boot</strong>:
	the .o files of the kernel are relinked in random order from a
	link-kit, before every reboot. This provides substantial interior
	randomization in the kernel's text and data segments for layout and
	relative branches/calls.  Basically a unique address space for each
	kernel boot, similar to the userland fork+exec model described above
	but for the kernel.  Theo de Raadt, June 2017.
    </li><li>Rearranged i386/amd64 register allocator order in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	to reduce polymorphic RET instructions:
	Todd Mortimer, November 20, 2017.
    </li><li>Reencoding of i386/amd64 instruction sequences to avoid
	embedded polymorphic RET instructions.  Enhancements to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	Todd Mortimer, April 28, 2018 and onwards.
    </li><li><b>MAP_STACK</b> addition to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>
	allows opportunistic verification that the stack-register
	points at stack memory, therefore catching pivots to non-stack
	memory (sometimes used in ROP attacks).
	Theo de Raadt, April 12, 2018.
    </li><li><b>RETGUARD</b> is a replacement for the <b>stack-protector</b>
	which uses a per-function random cookie (located in the read-only ELF
	<b>.openbsd.randomdata</b> section) to consistency-check the
	return address on the stack.  Implemented for amd64 and arm64
	by Todd Mortimer in OpenBSD 6.4, for mips64 in OpenBSD 6.7, and
	powerpc/powerpc64 in OpenBSD 6.9.  amd64 system call stubs also
	protected in OpenBSD 7.3.
    </li><li><b>MAP_CONCEAL</b> addition to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>
	disallows memory pages to be written to core dumps, preventing
	accidental exposure of private information.
	Theo de Raadt, Mark Kettenis and Scott Soule Cheloha,
	February 2, 2019.
    </li><li>Similar to the opportunistic verification in <b>MAP_STACK</b>,
	system-calls can no longer be performed from PROT_WRITE memory.
	Theo de Raadt, June 2, 2019.
    </li><li>System calls may only be performed from selected code regions
        (main program, ld.so, libc.so, and sigtramp).  The libc.so region
	is setup by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2">msyscall(2)</a>.
	Theo de Raadt, November 28, 2019.<br>
	This mechanism was removed because later work on immutable memory +
	pinned system calls was even better.
    </li><li>Permissions (RWX, MAP_STACK, etc) on address space regions can be
	made immutable, so that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mprotect.2">mprotect(2)</a> or
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/munmap.2">munmap(2)</a> fail with
	EPERM. Most of the program static address space is now automatically
	immutable (main program, ld.so, main stack, load-time shared libraries,
	and dlopen()'d libraries mapped without RTLD_NODELETE).  Programmers
	can request non-immutable static data using the "openbsd.mutable" section,
	or manually bring immutability to (page aligned heap objects) using
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2">mimmutable(2)</a>.
	Theo de Raadt, Dec 4, 2022.
    </li><li>sshd random relinking at boot. Theo de Raadt. Jan 18, 2023.
    </li><li>Some architectures now have non-readable code ("xonly"), both from
	the perspective of userland reading its own memory, or the kernel
	trying to read memory in a system call.  Many sloppy practices in
	userland code had to be repaired to allow this.  The linker option
	<b>--execute-only</b> is enabled by default. In order of
	development: arm64, riscv64, hppa, amd64,
	powerpc64, powerpc (G5 only), octeon.
	sparc64 (sun4u only, unfinished).
	Mark Kettenis, Theo de Raadt, Visa Hankala, Miod Vallat,
	Dave Voutila, George Koehler in kernel and base, and
	Theo Buehler, Robert Nagy, Christian Weisgerber in ports.
	Dec 2022 - Feb 2023, still ongoing.
    </li><li>On all architectures which lack hardware-enforcement of xonly,
	system calls are now prevented from reading (via copyin/copyinst)
	inside the program's main text, ld.so text, sigtramp text, or
	libc.so text.
	Theo de Raadt, Jan 2023.
    </li><li>Architectures which lack xonly mmu-enforcement can still benefit
	from switching to --execute-only binaries if the cpu generates
	different traps for instruction-fetch versus data-fetch.  The
	VM system will not allow memory to be read before it was
	executed which is valuable together with library relinking.
	Architectures switched over include loongson.
	Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023.
    </li><li>ld.so and crt0 register the location of the
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a>
	libc syscall stub with the kernel using
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscall.2">pinsyscall(2)</a>,
	after which the kernel only accepts an execve call from that
	specific location. Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023. Made redundant by
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a>
        which handles all system calls.
    </li><li>Mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets (BTI on arm64,
        IBT on Intel amd64), unless a linker flag (-Wl,-z,nobtcfi) requests
        no enforcement.
    </li><li>The kernel and ld.so register the precise entry location of
	every system call used by a program, as described in the
	new ELF section <b>.openbsd.syscalls</b> inside ld.so and
	libc.so.  ld.so uses the new syscall
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a>
        to tell the kernel the precise entry location of system calls in libc.so.
	Since all syscall entries are now known to the kernel, the
	pininsyscall(SYS_execve) interface becomes redundant.
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2">msyscall(2)</a> mechanism
	also becomes redundant (and is removed a bit later), because immutable
	memory + pinsyscalls together are cheaper and more effective targeting.
	Theo de Raadt, Jan 2024.
    </li><li><b>-fret-clean</b> is a clang extension that, upon return from a function
	cleans the return value off the stack (one of many information leaks which
	can be used to determine where functions in a different DSO reside).
	The kernel, libc, libcrypto, and ld.so(1) are compiled with this option.
	amd64 only, for now.

<h2>
Why Icons Alone Aren’t Enough
</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_a7eb7cf1ab024efcb17c380ef69c53f4/_image_cache/8b6170ad-2d4d-4c3b-ade6-6f278b48b825.svg" width="800" height="650">
</p>
<p>
I’m a firm believer in text labels.
</p>
<p>
Interfaces are over-stuffed with icons. The more icons we have to scan over, the more brain power we put toward making sense of them rather than using the tools they represent. This slows us down, not just once, but over and over again.
</p>
<p>
While it may feel duplicative to add a text label, the reality is that few icons are self-sufficient in communicating meaning.
</p>
<h2>
The Problems that Icons Create
</h2>
<p>
<b>1. Few icons communicate a clear, singular meaning immediately</b>
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to say that a <i>good</i> icon will communicate meaning — or that if an icon needs a text label, it’s not doing its job. But that doesn’t take into consideration the burden that icons — <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> — put on people trying to navigate interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Even the simplest icons can create ambiguity. While a trash can icon reliably communicates “delete,” what about the common pencil icon. Does it mean create? Edit? Write? Draw? Context can help with disambiguation, but not always, and that contextual interpretation requires additional cognitive effort.

When an icon’s meaning isn’t immediately clear, it slows down our orientation within an interface and the use of its features. Each encounter requires a split-second of processing that might seem negligible but accumulates across interactions.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. The more icons within an interface, the more difficult it can be to navigate.</b>
</p>
<p>
As feature sets grow, we often resort to increasingly abstract or subtle visual distinctions between icons. What might have worked with 5-7 core functions becomes unmanageable at 15-20 features. Users must differentiate between various forms of creation, sharing, saving, and organizing - all through pictorial representation alone.
</p>
<p>
The burden of communication increases for each individual icon as an interface’s feature set expands. It becomes increasingly difficult to communicate specific functions with icons alone, especially when distinguishing between similar actions like creating and editing, saving and archiving, or uploading and downloading.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Icons function as an interface-specific language within a broader ecosystem.</b>
</p>
<p>
Interfaces operate within other interfaces. Your application may run within a browser that also runs within an operating system. Users must navigate multiple levels of interface complexity, most of which you cannot control. When creating bespoke icons, you force users to learn a new visual language while still maintaining awareness of established conventions.
</p>
<p>
This creates particular challenges with standardized icon sets. When we use established systems like Google’s Material Design, an icon that represents one function in our interface might represent something entirely different in another application. This cross-context confusion adds to the cognitive load of icon interpretation.

Why Text Labeling Helps Your Interface
</h2>

<p>
<b>1. Text alone is usually more efficient.</b>
</p>
<p>
Our brains process familiar words holistically rather than letter-by-letter, making them incredibly efficient information carriers. We’ve spent our lives learning to recognize words instantly, while most app icons require new visual vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
Scanning text is fundamentally easier than scanning icons. A stacked list of text requires only a one-directional scan (top-to-bottom), while icon grids demand bi-directional scanning (top-to-bottom and left-to-right). This efficiency becomes particularly apparent in mobile interfaces, where similar-looking app icons can create a visually confusing grid.
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Text can make icons more efficient.</b>
</p>
<p>
The example above comes from <a href="http://www.magnolia-made.com/" target="_blank">Magnolia</a>, an application I designed. On the left is the side navigation panel without labels. On the right is the same panel with text labels. Magnolia is an extremely niche tool with highly specific features that align with the needs of research and planning teams who develop account briefs. Without the labels, the people who we created Magnolia for would likely find the navigation system confusing.
</p>
<p>
Adding text labels to icons serves two purposes: it clarifies meaning and provides greater creative freedom. When an icon’s meaning is reinforced by text, users can scan more quickly and confidently. Additionally, designers can focus more on the unity of their interface’s visual language when they’re not relying on icons alone to communicate function.
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Icons are effective anchors in text-heavy applications.</b>
</p>
<p>
Above is another example from <a href="http://www.magnolia-made.com/" target="_blank">Magnolia</a>. Notice how the list of options on the right (Export, Regenerate, and History) stands out because of the icons, but the text labels make it immediately clear what these things do.
</p>
<p>
See, this isn’t an argument for eliminating icons entirely. Icons serve an important role as visual landmarks, helping to differentiate functional areas from content areas. Especially in text-heavy applications, icons help pull the eye toward interactive elements.
</p>
<p>
The combination of icon and text label creates clearer affordances than either element alone.
</p>
<h2>
Finding the Balance
</h2>
<p>
Every time we choose between an icon and a text label, we’re making a choice about cognitive load. We’re deciding how much mental energy people will spend interpreting our interfaces rather than using them. While a purely iconic interface might seem simple and more attractive, it often creates an invisible tax on attention and understanding.
</p>
<p>
The solution, of course, isn’t found in a “perfect” icon, nor in abandoning icons entirely. Icons remain powerful tools for creating visual hierarchy and differentiation. Instead, we need to be more thoughtful about when and how we deploy them. The best interfaces recognize that icons and text aren’t competing approaches but complementary tools that work best in harmony.
</p>
<p>
This means considering not just the immediate context of our own interfaces, but the broader ecosystem in which they exist. Our applications don’t exist in isolation — they’re part of a complex digital environment where users are constantly switching between different contexts, each with its own visual language.
</p>
<p>
The next time you’re tempted to create yet another icon, or to remove text labels, remember: the most elegant solution isn’t always the one that <i>looks</i> simple — it’s the one that makes communication and understanding <i>feel</i> simple.
