<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve long been struggling to describe why e-ink is so much fun for me, but I
think I’ve finally realized what it is: <strong>e-ink is just so so so retropunk</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8760cI9.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>An e-ink device is a hacker’s dream - or at least, this hacker’s dream.  They
are a return to the magical feeling of computers of the 80s and 90s. It’s a
world where Microsoft and Apple never existed and we don’t have to suffer with
abstractions on top of abstractions.  It’s DOS for the 2020s. It’s graphing
calculators for grown-ups.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The e-ink devices I favor are low powered ARM devices running linux without a
display server or gigabytes of RAM. Let’s break down why that’s so awesome:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low Powered: They can last for weeks on a single charge</li>
  <li>ARM is a simple architecture with a low instruction count and even lower cost</li>
  <li>Linux: as much as I like it, Android is a complicated mess</li>
  <li>Apps are simple: they talk to the kernel to read input and draw directly to the framebuffer</li>
  <li>Low RAM and slow CPUs: There’s no room to build complicated stacks of software, which means no window managers, no browsers and definitely no electron apps</li>
</ul>

<p>As similar as they are to the computers of the early 90s, they are different in
some tangible ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The resolution is much higher than an old computer - The PPI is between 200 - 300</li>
  <li>All devices supports touch events, some even support a pen stylus</li>
  <li>They are super portable, weighing between 200 - 400 grams, with displays ranging from 6” to 10”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>Since the devices are niche, the software ecosystem is way more
<strong>homebrew</strong> (as in the Homebrew Computing Club): people write and share their
apps and the community is tight knit. The people who use eink devices are
enthusiasts: they’ve given up the joys of color displays to work on these
under-powered devices that are devoid of app stores, tracking pixels, pay to
play features and constant distractions. There’s no email on these devices,
there’s no chat or social networks, there’s only simple applications.</p>

<p>Don’t be fooled though: the device constraints lead to interesting and quirky
software. In the <a href="https://toltec-dev.org/">reMarkable eco-system</a>, there’s dozens of
applications, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>multi-tasking application launchers like <a href="https://github.com/Eeems/oxide/">oxide</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rmkit-dev/rmkit/tree/master/src/remux">remux</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/timower/rM2-stuff">terminal emulators</a></li>
  <li>an <a href="https://github.com/bkirwi/folly">interactive fiction interpreter</a></li>
  <li>an <a href="https://github.com/bkirwi/sill">experimental shell that you can write into</a></li>
  <li>alternative ebook readers like <a href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader/">koreader</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LinusCDE/plato/">plato</a></li>
  <li>a <a href="https://rmkit.dev/apps/sas">simple app script that follows the unix philosphy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LinusCDE/chessmarkable">a chess board</a></li>
  <li>even a <a href="https://github.com/LinusCDE/doomarkable">port of doom</a></li>
  <li>and so <a href="https://rmkit.dev/">much more</a> - like <a href="https://toltec-dev.org/stable/">much, much, more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Since eink is currently niche, it also means green fields: there are lots of
opportunities to write applications that fills out the ecosystem. In short, a
hacker’s playground.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2>

<p>Convinced that you should hack on eink devices? Grab a reMarkable or Kobo and
get hacking ;) Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/hAKFTcuu">reMarkable discord
server</a> or browse the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=247">Mobile Read Kobo
Forums</a>.</p>

<p>For reMarkable, the toltec repository is a good place to get started - one of
the maintainers, Eeems, <a href="https://eeems.website/toltec/">has written a great
tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>If you want more specific advice, feel free to directly <a href="https://rmkit.dev/about">get in touch</a></p>

<h2 id="why-write-a-post-now">Why write a post now?</h2>

<p>Several years ago, I started hacking on e-ink devices and had an enormous
amount of fun writing applications and seeing what others have built.
Unfortunately, I’ve had several false starts with writing about e-ink: whether
it was about what I’ve actually done, or the lessons learned along the way or
even a set of things to consider when developing e-ink apps, the posts would
lay half finished because they just never felt compelling - my enthusiasm for
e-ink just wasn’t coming through.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to push any of those posts to completion, I’ve decided to try
to articulate what is so cool about e-ink to me.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-hacker-unfriendly-devices">Appendix: Hacker unfriendly devices</h2>

<h4 id="kindles">Kindles</h4>

<p>The Kindle requires a jailbreak to use and is running a modified version of
Kindle Fire. The Kindle Scribe is still secured, though. For this reason, I don’t
particularly recommend the Kindle devices.</p>

<h4 id="onyx">Onyx</h4>

<p>In every eink thread that comes up, the Onyx is brought up as not following the
GPL: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/p9ztru/lets_help_onyx_become_a_better_company/">they use a modified linux kernel and haven’t published the source for it</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pine">Pine</h4>

<p>The Pine Note is cool and open, but it’s software is still in development. Use
only if you are willing to take on an <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineNote#State_of_the_software">early product aimed at early adopters and
developers</a> - In other words,
maybe the Pine Note is too hacker friendly.</p>

GitHub</a>. See the
<a href="#building">Building</a> section for instructions.</p>
<a name="user-content-running-fish"></a>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running fish</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once installed, run <code>fish</code> from your current shell to try fish out!</p>
<a name="user-content-dependencies"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3>
<p dir="auto">Running fish requires:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>curses or ncurses (preinstalled on most *nix systems)</li>
<li>some common *nix system utilities (currently <code>mktemp</code>), in
addition to the basic POSIX utilities (<code>cat</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>dirname</code>,
<code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mkfifo</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>tee</code>, <code>tr</code>,
<code>uname</code> and <code>sed</code> at least, but the full coreutils plus <code>find</code> and
<code>awk</code> is preferred)</li>
<li>The gettext library, if compiled with
translation support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The following optional features also have specific requirements:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>builtin commands that have the <code>--help</code> option or print usage
messages require <code>nroff</code> or <code>mandoc</code> for
display</li>
<li>automated completion generation from manual pages requires Python 3.5+</li>
<li>the <code>fish_config</code> web configuration tool requires Python 3.5+ and a web browser</li>
<li>system clipboard integration (with the default Ctrl-V and Ctrl-X
bindings) require either the <code>xsel</code>, <code>xclip</code>,
<code>wl-copy</code>/<code>wl-paste</code> or <code>pbcopy</code>/<code>pbpaste</code> utilities</li>
<li>full completions for <code>yarn</code> and <code>npm</code> require the
<code>all-the-package-names</code> NPM module</li>
<li><code>colorls</code> is used, if installed, to add color when running <code>ls</code> on platforms
that do not have color support (such as OpenBSD)</li>
</ul>
<a name="user-content-switching-to-fish"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Switching to fish</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to use fish as your default shell, use the following
command:</p>
<pre>chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
</pre>
<p dir="auto"><code>chsh</code> will prompt you for your password and change your default
shell. (Substitute <code>/usr/local/bin/fish</code> with whatever path fish was
installed to, if it differs.) Log out, then log in again for the changes
to take effect.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use the following command if fish isn’t already added to <code>/etc/shells</code>
to permit fish to be your login shell:</p>
<pre>echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
</pre>
<p dir="auto">To switch your default shell back, you can run <code>chsh -s /bin/bash</code>
(substituting <code>/bin/bash</code> with <code>/bin/tcsh</code> or <code>/bin/zsh</code> as
appropriate).</p>
<a name="user-content-building"></a>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2>
<a name="user-content-id1"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3>
<p dir="auto">Compiling fish from a tarball requires:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>a C++11 compiler (g++ 4.8 or later, or clang 3.3 or later)</li>
<li>CMake (version 3.5 or later)</li>
<li>a curses implementation such as ncurses (headers and libraries)</li>
<li>PCRE2 (headers and libraries) - optional, this will be downloaded if missing</li>
<li>gettext (headers and libraries) - optional, for translation support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Sphinx is also optionally required to build the documentation from a
cloned git repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, running the test suite requires Python 3.5+ and the pexpect package.</p>
<a name="user-content-dependencies-git-master"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies, git master</h3>
<p dir="auto">Building from git master currently requires, in addition to the dependencies for a tarball:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Rust (version 1.67 or later)</li>
<li>libclang, even if you are compiling with GCC</li>
<li>an Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">fish is in the process of being ported to Rust, replacing all C++ code, and as such these dependencies are a bit awkward and in flux.</p>
<p dir="auto">In general, we would currently not recommend running from git master if you just want to <em>use</em> fish.
Given the nature of the port, what is currently there is mostly a slower and buggier version of the last C++-based release.</p>
<a name="user-content-building-from-source-all-platforms-makefile-generator"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building from source (all platforms) - Makefile generator</h3>
<p dir="auto">To install into <code>/usr/local</code>, run:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install"><pre>mkdir build<span>;</span> <span>cd</span> build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The install directory can be changed using the
<code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> parameter for <code>cmake</code>.</p>
<a name="user-content-build-options"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build options</h3>
<p dir="auto">In addition to the normal CMake build options (like <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>), fish has some other options available to customize it.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>BUILD_DOCS=ON|OFF - whether to build the documentation. This is automatically set to OFF when Sphinx isn't installed.</li>
<li>INSTALL_DOCS=ON|OFF - whether to install the docs. This is automatically set to on when BUILD_DOCS is or prebuilt documentation is available (like when building in-tree from a tarball).</li>
<li>FISH_USE_SYSTEM_PCRE2=ON|OFF - whether to use an installed pcre2. This is normally autodetected.</li>
<li>MAC_CODESIGN_ID=String|OFF - the codesign ID to use on Mac, or "OFF" to disable codesigning.</li>
<li>WITH_GETTEXT=ON|OFF - whether to build with gettext support for translations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note that fish does <em>not</em> support static linking and will attempt to error out if it detects it.</p>
<a name="user-content-help-it-didnt-build"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Help, it didn’t build!</h3>
<p dir="auto">If fish reports that it could not find curses, try installing a curses
development package and build again.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Debian or Ubuntu you want:</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential cmake ncurses-dev libncurses5-dev libpcre2-dev gettext
</pre>
<p dir="auto">On RedHat, CentOS, or Amazon EC2:</p>
<pre>sudo yum install ncurses-devel

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.teamshares.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teamshares</a> is a low-flying, New York-based startup with big ambitions to capitalize on an opportunity in plain sight: that of small businesses without a succession plan.</p>
<p>It’s not a small market. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99.7% of U.S. employer firms and 64% of private-sector jobs. Meanwhile, just 15% or so of small business owners pass along their company to a family member, with many others simply closing up shop at some point.</p>
<p>With an aging population in the U.S., Teamshares is betting this market will grow even bigger, which is why since 2018, it has snapped up 84 small businesses from retiring owners. These owners like its pitch. Though Teamshares says that it sometimes pays below market price for a company, it installs a new president that it trains and grants 10% of the business’s stock to its employees. <span>Moreover</span>, it promises to increase those employees’ ownership to 80% within 20 years. It sounds almost valiant, like when KKR bought out a door company in 2015 and promised every employee a payout of at least $15,000 if the company met its targets when sold. When in 2022, KKR sold the company for 10 times what it paid, its 800 employees saw a payout of <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-kkr-got-more-by-giving-ownership-to-the-factory-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$360 million</a>.</p>
<p>But Teamshares isn’t in the private equity business. It’s a fintech company that has raised $245 million in venture capital to date, including from QED Investors, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures, Inspired Capital, Khosla Ventures and Slow Ventures. It has also secured another $150 million in debt.</p>
<p>Those backers aren’t funding Teamshares so that it can grow and resell the businesses it acquires. In fact, according to co-founder and CEO Michael Brown, Teamshares doesn’t want to sell the companies it is buying — ever. The plan instead is to generate revenue from a growing array of fintech products that it sells to the businesses it buys. Think insurance, think credit cards. If everything goes as planned, Teamshares will eventually replace the majority of vendors these companies use — and become a brand known to many others outside of its immediate sphere. Certainly, it’s among the more unique fintech models this reporter can recall. More below, edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Other than some exceptions like KKR, which is focused in part on employee ownership because owners tend to be better employees, I don’t know of another venture-backed company doing what you’re doing. How did you settle on this broader idea?</strong></p>
<p>MB:&nbsp; I spent the first seven years of my career in investment banking. And that’s where I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Eu</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinshiiba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Shiiba</a>, the other two founders. Kevin decided he wanted to join the tech industry very early [and joined the] coding bootcamp General Assembly; Alex and I went and bought one, and then eventually eight, small businesses. We transitioned from being financial spreadsheet people to being operators and later entrepreneurs; learning how to operate a businesses informs [our work] today.</p>
<p><strong>How did you exit those businesses?</strong></p>
<p>We still own the ones in Canada; they’re running themselves today. There’s a president, a vice president. They’re just sort of like a dormant legacy business, but they’ve started the employee ownership journey, too, and that’s continuing on.</p>
<p><strong>You make money off those businesses through dividends? Is this how you’ll make money at Teamshares?</strong></p>
<p>How Teamshares makes money is we buy businesses, we dilute ourselves voluntarily to get employee ownership jump-started. We [carve out] 10% for all the employees and an additional 5% for [a president who we hire to run each business], and that stock is a gift — it’s earned over time through service.</p>
<p>From a financial standpoint, we’re [structured] just like Berkshire Hathaway, so if we buy a business with $5 million in revenue, then that becomes our revenue the next day. We profit from the profits of the business that was acquired, proportionate to our ownership, and we sell our stock back over time to the companies until it becomes 80% employee owned. We also have new revenue streams that we’ve just started launching. We built a neobank, we’re soon to launch credit cards, and we’re building an insurance business as well, so there’s a secondary layer of financial products that will basically replace the vendors that the companies used to use.</p>
<p><strong>These products are going to be available exclusively to Teamshares companies or you start there and expand out?</strong></p>
<p>The hope is the latter. We only build something if a product doesn’t exist for our exact use case, which is some combination of really traditional small business or employee ownership. And there’s not a lot of stuff [out there]. When we set out, we didn’t think we’d build a neobank, but there just wasn’t something that existed to our satisfaction, in part because small businesses still unfortunately receive a lot of checks. But the hope would be that in the future — let’s call it in the next five years — we could scale up and open these products up and have small businesses generally get to know Teamshares.</p>
<p><strong>What do the companies you’ve acquired so far have in common?</strong></p>
<p>Where <em>we</em> have commonality in the companies is around employee ownership, financial education, the president program and financial infrastructure. So, we’re audited by KPMG, for example, and we help these companies go from mom-and-pop accounting to having real financial infrastructure and being able to produce statement financials every month that are in accordance with GAAP. But we really believe in the companies [operating as] independently as possible. We provide support, and we work closely with the presidents. But we don’t think that it’s a good idea to try and integrate all the companies.</p>
<p><strong>So you aren’t trying to roll up similar companies, or swaths of similar companies?</strong></p>
<p>There are some exceptions where, for example, we’ve been buying pizza shops in a state back East, and those are being integrated to create one larger company that’s going to create more employee ownership wealth than could a stand-alone set of pizza shops. We’re doing this again in pool maintenance, where a lot of the businesses are really [small] and actually [buying] a first one that’s small but big enough to support the cost of a president, and then you can add smaller ones. So there’s a roll-up-esque element of certain companies we work with, but in general, we think these are really high-quality businesses that can operate fairly independently and we actually make a very devout customer promise that the companies are going to become 80% employee owned, or never for sale again.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your investing criteria?</strong></p>
<p>There are over 40 specific industries [represented in Teamshares’ current portfolio], but they really fall into about six categories, which are business services, consumer services, distribution, manufacturing, restaurants, and retail. So they’re all traditional businesses that are, on average, 30 years old, with annual revenue of between $2 million and $10 million generally.</p>
<p>We have a belief that employee ownership works in every industry, and our actual final decision — amongst the 70,000 leads we get every year — is all done on a case-by-case basis. But we start off by filtering the companies on what we call our structural criteria. So is it a true retirement sale? Are the owners of that age? Are there two or more managers? Is there low customer concentration? Do the earnings show up on the tax returns?</p>
<p><strong>You’re planning to sell these companies your products. Are there other ways the companies in the Teamshares ecosystem can work together?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. We’re now getting to the size where we’re starting to organize the companies, around industry groups. So there’s talk of the restaurant companies all kind of banding together [toward the goal of] common purchasing. The presidents [sometimes] share knowledge about what’s the best sort of ERP system and other software to use? Then there’s other things that don’t make sense for us to build but we can arrange large, corporate vendor partnerships. So, for example, you know, lots of these companies need vehicles, so having a national account with one of the major vehicle lessors is going to make sense.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Berkshire Hathaway early on. Is that what you aspire to build? Do you want Teamshares to go public?</strong></p>
<p>The most probable outcome is we go public, but there are ways to stay private, too. We do not plan to ever sell Teamshares; we would want it to be independent.</p>
<p>In terms of the Berkshire Hathaway piece, we subscribe to a lot of their philosophy about being very long-term minded and being pretty efficient in our underwriting and keeping things simple. But we’re not a one-for-one translation of the model. Their model is to have the permanent ownership forever, whereas our model has employee ownership as a twist, so we’re actually forgoing some amount of future growth by making employee ownership happen. And we believe that’s the right thing to do. And we believe the companies will be bigger and better for it.</p>
<p>Also Berkshire Hathaway can only buy companies that already have a CEO in place, whereas that’s not a luxury you can have in small business. We realized we had to build up a new generation of people, generally in their 30s and 40s, who were ready for something more entrepreneurial and ready for something really mission aligned. And so we recruit people from some really great companies — McKinsey, USAA, Tesla and Amazon — and train them to run these small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>How many employees do you have, and how big is your tech team?</strong></p>
<p>We have about 140 people altogether, and a 70-person tech team, so we’ve closed seven companies a month with two people. We’ve created a lot of leverage through building a lot of software for ourselves and for the companies.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) has officially gone into effect. Starting on August 25th, 2023, tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more must comply with sweeping legislation that holds online platforms legally accountable for the content posted to them.</p><p>Even though this new law was passed in the EU, we’ll likely see far-reaching global effects as companies adjust their policies to comply. Here’s what exactly the DSA does and how the EU plans on enforcing it.</p><p><h3>What is the Digital Services Act?</h3></p><p>The overarching goal of the DSA is to foster safer online environments. Under the new rules, online platforms must implement ways to prevent and remove posts containing illegal goods, services, or content while simultaneously giving users the means to report this type of content.</p><p>Additionally, the DSA bans targeted advertising based on a person’s sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs and puts restrictions on targeting ads to children. It also requires online platforms to provide more transparency on how their algorithms work. </p><p>The DSA carves out additional rules for what it considers “very large online platforms,” forcing them to give users the right to opt out of recommendation systems and profiling, share key data with researchers and authorities, cooperate with crisis response requirements, and perform external and independent auditing. </p><p>The European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220701IPR34364/digital-services-landmark-rules-adopted-for-a-safer-open-online-environment">passed the DSA in July 2022</a>. While the EU doesn’t require smaller companies to comply with the DSA just yet, it asked very large online platforms to comply four months after their designation as such, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2413">which occurred in April</a>.</p><p><h3>Which online platforms are affected?</h3></p><p>The EU considers very large online platforms (or very large online search engines) as those with over 45 million monthly users in the EU. So far, the EU has designed 19 platforms and search engines that fall into that category, including the following:</p><div><ul><li>Alibaba AliExpress</li><li>Amazon Store</li><li>Apple App Store</li><li>Booking.com</li><li>Facebook</li><li>Google Play</li><li>Google Maps</li><li>Google Shopping</li><li>Instagram</li><li>LinkedIn</li><li>Pinterest</li><li>Snapchat</li><li>TikTok</li><li>Twitter</li><li>Wikipedia</li><li>YouTube</li><li>Zalando</li><li>Bing</li><li>Google Search</li></ul></div><p>The EU will require each of these platforms to update their user numbers at least every six months. If a platform has less than 45 million monthly users for an entire year, they’ll be removed from the list.</p><p><h3>What are online platforms doing to comply?</h3></p><p>Many of these companies have already outlined the ways in which they’re going to comply with the DSA. Here’s a brief overview of the most notable ones.</p><p><h4>Google</h4></p><p>While Google says it already complies with some of the policies envisioned by the DSA, including the ability to give YouTube creators to appeal video removals and restrictions, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23845117/google-expanding-ads-transparency-center-comply-eu-dsa">Google announced that it’s expanding</a> its Ads Transparency Center to meet the requirements outlined by the legislation.</p><p>The company also committed to expanding data access to researchers to provide more information about “how Google Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Play and Shopping work in practice.” It will also improve its transparency reporting and analyze potential “risks of illegal content dissemination, or risks to fundamental rights, public health or civic discourse.”</p><p><h4>Meta</h4></p><p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is working to expand its Ad Library, which currently compiles the ads shown on its platforms. The company will soon start displaying and archiving all the ads that target users in the EU while also including the parameters used to target the ads, as well as who was served the ad.</p><div><p>In June, Meta released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778068/meta-facebook-instagram-social-media-algorithms-ai-transparency">a lengthy report about how its algorithm works</a> across Facebook and Instagram as part of its push toward transparency. It will also start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841173/instagram-facebook-meta-chronological-feed-stories-reels-european-union-digital-services-act">allowing European users to view content chronologically on Reels</a>, Stories, and Search on both Facebook and Instagram — without being subject to its personalization engine.</p></div><p><h4>TikTok</h4></p><p>Similar to the measures Meta is rolling out, TikTok has also announced that it’s making its algorithm optional for users in the EU. When the algorithm is disabled, users will see videos from “both the places where they live and around the world” in their For You and Live feeds instead of videos based on personal interests. </p><p>It will also enable users to view content chronologically on their Following and Friends feeds. TikTok is making some changes to its advertising policies as well. For European users aged 13 to 17, TikTok will stop showing personalized ads based on their activity in the app.</p><p><h4>Snap</h4></p><p>Snapchat will also give users in the EU the option to opt out of personalized feeds on its Discover and Spotlight pages and <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/17338132910484-Personalisation-on-Snapchat?_ga=2.55027560.2100881955.1692971960-1974149196.1692971960">has also published reports</a> on how it ranks the posts on these feeds. The company has committed to providing users with more information about why their posts or account has been removed and will give them the tools they need to appeal the decision.</p><p>In addition, Snapchat will no longer serve personalized ads to European Snapchat users aged 13 to 17. It will also create an archive of targeted advertisements it shows in the EU and will give European Snapchat users over the age of 18 more control over the ads they see.</p><p><h3>What happens if these platforms don't comply?</h3></p><p>Online platforms that don’t comply with the DSA’s rules could see fines of up to 6 percent of their global turnover. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2348">According to the EU Commission</a>, the Digital Services Coordinator and the Commission&nbsp;will have the power to “require immediate actions where necessary to address very serious harms.” A platform continually refusing to comply could result in a temporary suspension in the EU.</p><p>The EU is already seeing some companies push back on the DSA. In July, Amazon filed a petition that asks the EU to reevaluate its classification as a very large online platform, claiming that it’s getting “unfairly singled out.” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/zalando-sues-eu-commission-over-landmark-online-content-rules-2023-06-27/">German retailer Zalando also filed a lawsuit</a> against the EU Commission, similarly claiming that it doesn’t meet the definition of a very large online platform.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dbohdan.com/clean-mount-lists">https://dbohdan.com/clean-mount-lists</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37271611">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Default installations of Linux distributions mount more filesystems than they used to. This is because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device">loop devices</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a>, and, in Ubuntu, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)">snaps</a>. As a result, the output from GNU df(1) as well as from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Util-linux">lsblk(8) and mount(8)</a> is more difficult to understand at a glance.</p>
<p>It is possible to make the output of these commands more readable by removing some of the “noise” devices. The following is a list of command arguments that remove irrelevant devices. After the list, I show how to replace the default commands in <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>. You can adapt the replacement script for other shells.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<nav id="TOC" role="doc-toc">
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#df">df</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#lsblk">lsblk</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#mount">mount</a>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#include-list">Include list</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#exclude-list">Exclude list</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#fish">fish configuration</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#findmnt">findmnt instead of df and mount</a>
</li>
</ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="df">df</h2>
<p>GNU df(1) allows you to exclude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs">tmpfs</a> with a simple option. In Ubuntu 22.04, this removes <code>/dev/shm</code>, <code>/run</code>, <code>/run/user/*</code>, and other mount points from its output. In an improvement from Ubuntu 20.04, df(1) is already <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1756595">patched</a> to exclude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS">Squashfs</a> (snaps).</p>
<p>Command:</p>
<pre><code>df -x tmpfs</code></pre>
<p>The improvement on my system is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; df | wc -l
25
&gt; df -x tmpfs | wc -l
19</code></pre>
<h2 id="lsblk">lsblk</h2>
<p>The command lsblk(8) can exclude devices by major device type. Snaps are loopback devices. According to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt"><code>devices.txt</code></a> in the Linux kernel admin guide, the device type for loopback devices is 7.</p>
<p>Command:</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -e 7</code></pre>
<p>Improvement:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; lsblk | wc -l
56
&gt; lsblk -e 7 | wc -l
28</code></pre>
<h2 id="mount">mount</h2>
<p>We can simplify the output of GNU mount(8) by either excluding certain filesystem types or only including certain filesystem types.</p>
<h3 id="include-list">Include list</h3>
<p>Example command:</p>
<pre><code>mount -l -t btrfs,fat,exfat,ext2,ext4,iso9660,ntfs3,ufs,vfat,xfs,zfs</code></pre>
<p>Choose the type based on what filesystems you work with. For a list of supported filesystem type, look in <code>/proc/filesystems</code> and <code>/lib/modules/"$(uname -r)"/kernel/fs/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="exclude-list">Exclude list</h3>
<p>This is a little more involved, since mount(8) seems to lack a built-in “exclude” option. We can filter the output by the type column with awk.</p>
<p>Example command:</p>
<pre><code>mount | awk '$5 !~ /(autofs|binfmt_misc|bpf|cgroup2|configfs|debugfs|devpts|devtmpfs|fuse|hugetlbfs|mqueue|nfsd|nsfs|proc|pstore|ramfs|rpc_pipefs|securityfs|squashfs|sysfs|tmpfs|tracefs)/'</code></pre>
<p>The improvement with the exclude list is,</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mount | wc -l
77
&gt; mount | awk '...' | wc -l
19</code></pre>
<h3 id="fish">fish configuration</h3>
<p>This configuration script replaces commands with wrappers that use arguments from the previous sections by default. They only use the arguments if you do not give arguments of your own. To ignore the wrapper and run, for example, <code>mount</code> without any arguments, use <code>command mount</code> or <code>mount --</code>.</p>
<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>
<pre><code>cd ~/.config/fish/conf.d/
curl -O https://dbohdan.com/clean-mount-lists.fish

</code></pre>
<h2 id="findmnt">findmnt instead of df and mount</h2>
<p><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/findmnt">findmnt(8)</a> from util-linux is an alternative to df(1) and mount(8) with better options for filtering. For example,</p>
<pre><code>findmnt --df --options rw --real</code></pre>
<p>produces output like <code>df -h</code>, but only for real and read-write filesystems.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37271611">HN discussion thread</a> for suggesting findmnt(8) and the <code>--options rw --real</code> invocation.</p>

Several countries offer even more by law before paid public holidays come into play, which can add up to more than a month of business days in vacation time per year.</p><p>But not all U.S. workers say they'd welcome longer vacation policies: 21% of Americans say companies should not adopt extended PTO policies in their workplace, while the remaining respondents say they don't know or don't have an opinion.</p><p>The survey didn't specifically address the concerns of those against extended time off work, says Ellyn Briggs, brands analyst at Morning Consult. However, in responses to a separate question about people's attitudes toward a four-day workweek, roughly half of American workers say they'd use their extra time to catch up on work or learn a work-related skill.</p><p>Separately, 41% of U.S. workers report being more satisfied in their career today than before, which is nearly double the share of those who feel less satisfied in their career today, according to Morning Consult data. "These data points suggest a portion of employed U.S. adults generally enjoy their work and seek new opportunities to improve upon it," Briggs says. "Extended periods off may hold little appeal for this group."</p><p>That being said, generous vacations aren't the only European practice that Americans say should become the norm here: 65% of U.S. workers would like to see extended lunch breaks, 62% want workweeks shorter than 40 hours, and 51% support slower employee response time outside of work hours, similar to many labor laws common throughout Europe.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work &amp; life?&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/makeitnewsletter/?__source=makeit%7Cnlarticleteaser"><em><strong>Sign up for our new newsletter</strong></em></a><em><strong>!</strong></em></p><p><em>Get CNBC's free&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/buffett-whitepaper/">Warren Buffett Guide to Investing</a><em>, which distills the billionaire's No. 1 best piece of advice for regular investors, do's and don'ts, and three key investing principles into a clear and simple guidebook.</em></p><p><em><strong>Check out: </strong></em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/09/how-a-norway-28-year-old-prepares-for-required-3-week-summer-vacation.html"><em><strong>28-year-old social media manager in Norway is required to take 3 weeks of vacation in summer</strong></em></a></p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107268190" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000306846" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107268190"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107268257-mm-torres-still.jpg?v=1688993102&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="How a Gen Z couple earning $43,000 in Nashville, Tennessee spends their money"><span></span><span><span data-test="PlayButton"></span></span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NLRB sign. Image Credit: Getty Images</p></div><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling on Friday that <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-issues-decision-announcing-new-framework-for-union-representation" target="_blank"><span>changes the framework</span></a> for unionizations, making it easier for workers to organize and harder for companies to fight back against them.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The new process comes as part of a decision in the case between Cemex Construction Materials Pacific, LLC and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, where the Board found that the employer had committed over 20 “instances of objectionable or unlawful misconduct” between the filing of the union election petition and the election itself, intending to dissuade workers from organizing.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The decision requires that if a majority of workers ask a company for voluntary recognition of their union, the company must either immediately recognize them or promptly file a petition asking the Board to hold a union election.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“However, if an employer who seeks an election commits any unfair labor practice that would require setting aside the election, the petition will be dismissed, and—rather than re-running the election—the Board will order the employer to recognize and bargain with the union,” an <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-issues-decision-announcing-new-framework-for-union-representation" target="_blank"><span>NLRB press release stated</span></a>. If the company neither recognizes the union nor files a petition, the Board will issue a bargaining order forcing the company to come to the table.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“This is a very important ruling that will help workers to be able to unionize free of coercion, especially at companies like Trader Joe's, Starbucks and Amazon,” said Seth Goldstein, a partner at Julien, Mirer, Singla and Goldstein, who has represented workers at those companies attempting to unionize and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/opinion/starbucks-union-strikes-labor-movement.html" target="_blank"><span>facing union-busting efforts</span></a>. “This has been the law of the land for 80 years, so it really goes back to what should have been all along.”&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Goldstein was referring to a 1949 Supreme Court decision known as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/07/the-lie-that-helped-kill-the-labor-movement-00037459" target="_blank"><span>Joy Silk</span></a>, which stated that an employer had to voluntarily recognize and bargain with a majority of workers who wanted a union, and could only contest the unionization if it had “good faith doubt” about the union’s majority status. Joy Silk was <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/575/" target="_blank"><span>abandoned in 1969</span></a> in favor of giving companies more leverage in the unionization process.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo issued a memo earlier this year <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/nlrb-general-counsel-calls-for-4375993/" target="_blank"><span>demanding that the Board revive Joy Silk</span></a>, something that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/07/the-lie-that-helped-kill-the-labor-movement-00037459" target="_blank"><span>labor activists have been fighting</span></a> for since it was overturned. The Cemex decision issued on Friday is a partial step in that direction.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“What this new decision does is, it's a compromise,” said Eric Blanc, an assistant professor of labor studies at Rutgers University. “It's not a return to ‘card check,’” the unionization process in the 1930s and ‘40s that said if a majority of workers signed cards stating they wanted a union, the company was obligated to recognize and bargain with them—which Joy Silk had upheld.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“If there's intense illegal union busting, as is very often the case, the NLRB can force the employers to immediately recognize the union rather than have to go through another union election,” Blanc said. “But it's far short of what many union organizers were hoping for. By not making ‘card check’ the norm, [it] still opens up the process to all sorts of legal appeals and delays, which is ultimately one of the main tactics of employers—to delay the union first and then hold things up in endless appeals. This unfortunately doesn't avoid that dynamic, but it does get the NLRB more powers to require employers to recognize unions, and that should be at least a partial deterrent on employers’ willingness to break the law.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Goldstein said that despite the incomplete return to Joy Silk, he thought it was a “big step forward.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The Board is taking a proactive stance, that unfair labor violations are going to be challenged,” he said. “We haven’t seen this kind of activism from the Board since the 1940s. I think this is going to really help workers.”</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The camera zooms in on the person’s arm to reveal the cells, then a cell nucleus. A DNA strand grows on the screen. The camera focuses on a single atom within the strand, dives into a frenetic cloud of rocketing particles, crosses it, and leaves us in oppressive darkness. An initially imperceptible tiny dot grows smoothly, revealing the atomic nucleus. The narrator lectures that the nucleus of an atom is tens of thousands of times smaller than the atom itself, and poetically concludes that we are made from emptiness.</p>
<p>How often have you seen such a scene or read something equivalent to it in popular science? I am sure plenty, if you are fans of this genre like me. However, the narrative is wrong. Atomic nuclei in a molecule are not tiny dots, and there are no empty spaces within the atom.</p>
<p>The <em>empty atom</em> picture is likely the most repeated mistake in popular science. It is unclear who created this myth, but it is sure that Carl Sagan, in his classic TV series <em>Cosmos</em> (1980), was crucial in popularising it. After wondering how small the nuclei are compared with the atom, Sagan concluded that</p>
<blockquote>[M]ost of the mass of an atom is in its nucleus; the electrons are by comparison just clouds of moving fluff. Atoms are mainly empty space. Matter is composed chiefly of nothing.</blockquote>
<p>I still remember how deeply these words spoke to me when I heard them as a kid in the early 1980s. Today, as a professional theoretical chemist, I know that Sagan’s statements failed to recognise some fundamental features of atoms and molecules.</p>
<p>Yet his reasoning is still influential. While preparing this essay, I ran a poll on Twitter asking whether people agreed with Sagan’s quote above. Of the 180 voters, <span>43 per</span> cent answered that they mostly agreed, and <span>27 per</span> cent fully agreed. Google ‘atoms empty space’, and you will find tens of essays, blog posts and YouTube videos concluding that atoms are <span>99.9 per</span> cent empty space. To be fair, you will also find a reasonable share of articles debunking the idea.</p>
<p>Misconceptions feeding the idea of the empty atom can be dismantled by carefully interpreting quantum theory, which describes the physics of molecules, atoms and subatomic particles. According to quantum theory, the building blocks of matter – like electrons, nuclei and the molecules they form – can be portrayed either as waves or particles. Leave them to evolve by themselves without human interference, and they act like delocalised waves in the shape of continuous clouds. On the other hand, when we attempt to observe these systems, they appear to be localised particles, something like bullets in the classical realm. But accepting the quantum predictions that nuclei and electrons fill space as continuous clouds has a daring conceptual price: it implies that these particles do not vibrate, spin or orbit. They inhabit a motionless microcosmos where time only occasionally plays a role.</p>
<p>Most problems surrounding the description of the submolecular world come from frustrated attempts to reconcile conflicting pictures of waves and particles, leaving us with inconsistent chimeras such as particle-like nuclei surrounded by wave-like electrons. This image doesn’t capture quantum theory’s predictions. To compensate, our conceptual reconstruction of matter at the submolecular level should consistently describe how nuclei and electrons behave when not observed – like the proverbial sound of a tree falling in the forest without anyone around.</p>
<p><span>H</span>ere’s a primer on how to think of the fundamental components of matter: a molecule is a stable collection of nuclei and electrons. If the collection contains a single nucleus, it is called an atom. Electrons are elementary particles with no internal structure and a negative electric charge. On the other hand, each nucleus is a combined system composed of several protons and a roughly equal number of neutrons. Each proton and neutron is 1,836 times more massive than an electron. The proton has a positive charge of the same magnitude as an electron’s negative charge, while neutrons, as their name hints, have no electric charge. Usually, but not necessarily, the total number of protons in a molecule equals the number of electrons, making molecules electrically neutral.</p>
<p>The interior of the protons and neutrons is likely the most complex place in the Universe. I like to consider each of them a hot soup of three permanent elementary particles known as quarks boiling along inside, with an uncountable number of virtual quarks popping into existence and disappearing almost immediately. Other elementary particles called gluons hold the soup within a pot of <span>0.9 femtometres</span> radius. (A femtometre, abbreviated fm, is a convenient scale that measures systems tens of thousands of times smaller than an atom. Corresponding to <span>10</span><span><sup>‑15</sup></span><span> m,</span> we must juxtapose <span>1 trillion</span> femtometres to make one millimetre.)</p>
<p>Instead of localised bullets in empty space, matter delocalises into continuous quantum clouds</p>
<p>Particles with the same electric charge sign repel each other. So additional interactions are required to hold protons close-packed in the nucleus. These interactions arise from quark and antiquark pairs called pions that constantly spill out of each proton and neutron to be absorbed by another such particle nearby. The energy exchanged in this transfer is big enough to compensate for the electric repulsion between protons and, thus, bind together protons and neutrons, storing the immense energy that may be released in nuclear fission processes.</p>
<p>However, the extremely short lifetime of the pions limits how far protons and neutrons may be from each other, curbing the nucleus size to a 1 to <span>10 fm</span> radius. Thus, from a particle perspective, the nucleus is tiny compared with an atom. A nitrogen nucleus, composed of seven protons and seven neutrons, has a radius of about <span>3 fm.</span> In contrast, nitrogen’s atomic <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201602949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radius</a> is <span>179,000 fm.</span> At the scale of atoms and molecules, nuclei are no more than heavy, point-like positive charges without any apparent internal structure. So are the electrons: they are just light, point-like negative charges.</p>
<p>If atoms and molecules remained a collection of point-like particles, they <em>would</em> be mostly empty space. But at their size scale, they must be described by quantum theory. And this theory predicts that the wave-like picture predominates until a measurement disturbs it. Instead of localised bullets in empty space, matter delocalises into continuous quantum clouds.</p>
<p><span>M</span>atter is fundamentally quantum. Molecules cannot be assembled under the rules of classical physics. The classical electrical interactions between nuclei and electrons are insufficient to build a stable molecule. Due to the electric attraction of charges of opposite signs, the negatively charged electrons would quickly spiral toward the positively charged nuclei and glue to them. The resulting combined particles with no net charge would fly apart, preventing any molecule from forming.</p>
<p>Two quantum properties avoid this bleak fate.</p>
<p>The first property arises from the Heisenberg <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/our-simple-magic-free-recipe-for-quantum-entanglement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncertainty principle</a>, which holds that a quantum particle cannot simultaneously be at a precise position and also have zero speed. This implies that an electron cannot glue to a nucleus because both particles would be in a well-defined place and at rest to each other – defying a central rule of the quantum world.</p>
<p>The second quantum property is the Pauli exclusion principle. The fundamental components of matter are split into two types, bosons and fermions. The gluons inside the proton are examples of bosons. We can have as many of them as we want, sharing the same position simultaneously. On the other hand, fermions – such as electrons, quarks, protons and neutrons – obey a much more restrictive rule named the Pauli exclusion principle: no two identical fermions can simultaneously occupy the same space and have the same spin (a quantum property analogous to a classical rotation of a particle about its axis).</p>
<p>In the quantum world, the wave function represents more than a mere lack of knowledge</p>
<p>With all those effects encoded into the Schrödinger equation, the master equation of quantum theory, it predicts that our point-like nuclei and electrons must, in fact, behave like waves. They delocalise in quantum clouds much bigger than their particle-picture size to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, with electrons shaped into different clouds to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. The lighter the particles are, the bigger the delocalisation. Thus, a single electron cloud may spread over multiple nuclei, forming a chemical bond and stabilising the molecule.</p>
<p>Take an ammonia molecule, NH<sub>3</sub>, illustrated below. The small blue smudge in the middle is the nitrogen nucleus cloud, while the three green blobs are the proton (hydrogen nuclei) clouds. The 10 electrons of the ammonia molecule delocalise into the fat yellow cloud, tying the party together.</p>

<p>A particle-like nitrogen nucleus has a <span>3 fm</span> radius. However, in the ammonia molecule, the nitrogen nucleus grows to a respectable <span>3,000 fm</span> radius due to delocalisation. The delocalisation of the hydrogen nuclei is even more impressive. They grow from a radius of <span>0.9 fm</span> when seen as particles to clouds of about <span>23,000 fm.</span> But the electrons take the cake. Due to their tiny mass, they grow from particles much smaller than a nucleus into a cloud that defines the molecular volume.</p>
<p>Nuclei and electrons, however, are not atomic giants. If the nitrogen nucleus is measured (for instance, by throwing fast electrons against it and observing them bounce back), the nuclear cloud would immediately collapse into the initial <span>3 fm</span> dot. The same is true for each electron.</p>
<p>Indeed, quantum theory prescribes a precise relationship between the wave and particle pictures. The clouds of the wave picture are mathematically described by a wave function, essentially an equation that attributes an intensity to every point in space and how these intensities change with time. The wave function is analogous to mathematical functions describing conventional sound or water waves, but with the peculiarity that it has an <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-imaginary-numbers-describe-the-fundamental-shape-of-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imaginary-number component</a>, which is negative when squared.</p>
<p>The square of the wave function modulus (a mathematical operation that always yields positive numbers) gives the probability of finding the particle at each point in space if we attempt to observe it. The denser the cloud, the bigger the odds of observing the particle there. Thus, if we try to measure the point-like nitrogen nucleus, we are sure that it will be somewhere in the region of the delocalised nitrogen nucleus cloud, the blue smudge in the figure.</p>
<p>However, interpreting the quantum cloud as probability does not mean it is just a measure of a lack of knowledge about the system. If I left my keys in one of my jacket’s two pockets, but I am unsure which one, I may write a probability function with a <span>50 per</span> cent value at each pocket and zero value at every other point of my office. This function obviously does not imply that my keys are delocalised over the two pockets. It just states my ignorance, which can be easily fixed by checking the jacket.</p>
<p>In the quantum world, the wave function represents more than a mere lack of knowledge. Delocalised systems – like nuclear and electronic clouds – cause phenomena that localised particles cannot explain. The existence of chemical bonds forming molecules is a direct example of the effect of electronic delocalisation. In the case of nuclear delocalisation, one of its main effects is to boost the chances of a hydrogen nucleus (a single proton) flowing from one molecule to another nearby. This kind of enhanced proton transfer has dramatic biological consequences, like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1417923111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing</a> the acidity of specific enzymes compared with how acidic they would be if hydrogen nuclei behaved as particles.</p>
<p><span>A</span>lthough electron clouds are commonly depicted in popular science and chemistry, delocalisation of the nucleus is often interpreted as vibrations and rotations. But these are only classical, albeit helpful, analogies. From a quantum perspective and for conceptual consistency, nuclei should be depicted on the same footing as electrons, as clouds as well.</p>
<p>Yet another misconception is that atoms are empty because their mass is in their nucleus. The atomic mass is indeed highly localised. In an ammonia molecule, <span>82 per</span> cent of the mass is in the blue smudge of the nitrogen nucleus shown in <span>Figure 1</span> above. If we add the masses of the three green proton clouds, they account for <span>99.97 per</span> cent of the total. Thus, the big yellow cloud of the electrons carries only <span>0.03 per</span> cent of the mass.</p>
<p>The association between this mass concentration and the idea that atoms are empty stems from a flawed view that mass is the property of matter that fills a space. However, this concept does not hold up to close inspection, not even in our human-scale world. When we pile objects on top of each other, what keeps them separated is not their masses but the electric repulsion between the outmost electrons at their touching molecules. (The electrons cannot collapse under pressure due to the Heisenberg uncertainty and Pauli exclusion principles.) Therefore, the electron’s electric charge ultimately fills the space.</p>
<p>Anyone taking Chemistry 101 is likely to be faced with diagrams of electrons orbiting in shells</p>
<p>In atoms and molecules, electrons are everywhere! Look how the yellow cloud permeates the entire molecular volume in <span>Figure 1.</span> Thus, when we see that atoms and molecules are packed with electrons, the only reasonable conclusion is that they are filled with matter, not the opposite.</p>
<p>Despite all this, anyone taking Chemistry 101 is likely to be faced with diagrams of electrons orbiting in shells, like concentric and separated layers with empty space between them. The idea that these diagrams represent physical reality is a third common misconception. Electrons do not literally orbit around the atomic nucleus in the shape of these shells.</p>
<p>In atoms and molecules, electrons must have specific energies, each energy associated with a particular cloud shape. Consider, for example, an atom with a single electron. In the lowest possible energy, the ground energy level, this electron delocalises into a spherical cloud, dense at the centre of the atom and gradually fading out. The single-electron wave functions describing these clouds are called orbitals.</p>
<p>At higher energy levels, the single electron delocalises into more complex clouds with nested spheres, multiple blobs or even doughnut shapes. Thus, when speaking of atoms and molecules, electrons are not little particles chaotically rocketing around the nuclei until they become a fuzzy cloud, as often depicted. And electrons are not <em>in</em> the orbitals, nor do they <em>populate</em> them. Electrons <em>are</em> the orbitals. They are delocalised clouds.</p>
<p><span>W</span>ith multiple electrons, which have been terra incognita in popular science, things get much more complicated. This is hardly a surprise since even professional theoretical chemists are uncomfortable describing them, despite their exceptional competence in predicting the properties of multi-electron systems.</p>
<p>Like ill-fitting clothes, chemistry vernacular is filled with awkward analogies and descriptions. Chemists may say that an electron <em>occupies</em> or <em>populates</em> an orbital as if orbitals were pre-existing places where electrons are put. Chemists often draw diagrams where orbitals are represented as short horizontal lines and electrons as small vertical arrows on those lines, like objects on shelves. All these verbal and visual metaphors fail to translate what quantum theory tells us about atoms and molecules.</p>
<p>When dealing with multi-electron systems (encompassing virtually all molecules), quantum theory no longer distinguishes between each electron; they are all described by a single wave function, a single cloud. Nevertheless, single electron orbitals are still a valid approximation that chemists constantly use to rationalise chemical reactions. The multi-electron wave function resembles a composition of these individual clouds overlapping within the volume defining the molecule. They feel each other; they recombine into new shapes; some bulge and others shrink; the clouds skew, stretch and twist until they comfortably adapt, occupying every available space. It may look like a messy sock drawer.</p>
<p>For a fraction of a picosecond, the tempest rages and reshapes the molecular landscape until stillness is restored</p>
<p>A molecule is a static object without any internal motion. The quantum clouds of all nuclei and electrons remain absolutely still for a molecule with a well-defined energy. Time is irrelevant. Quantum theory does not predict vibrating nuclei or orbiting and spinning electrons; those dynamic features are classical analogues to intrinsic quantum properties. Angular momentum, for instance, which in classical physics quantifies rotational speed, manifests as blobs in the wave function. The more numerous the blobs, the bigger the angular momentum, even though nothing rotates.</p>
<p>Time, however, comes into play when a molecule collides with another one, triggering a chemical reaction. Then, a storm strikes. The quantum steadiness bursts when the sections of the electronic cloud pour from one molecule upon another. The clouds mix, reshape, merge, and split. The nuclear clouds rearrange to accommodate themselves within the new electronic configuration, sometimes even migrating between molecules. For a fraction of a picosecond <span>(10</span><span><sup>-12</sup></span><span> seconds</span> or a billionth of a millisecond), the tempest rages and reshapes the molecular landscape until stillness is restored in the newly formed compounds.</p>
<p>In the Flammarion engraving <span>(Figure 2</span> below), a person at the edge of Earth dares to look beyond the firmament dome to uncover the marvellous machinery of clouds controlling the heavens. They could well be looking at a molecule instead. Then, this non-disturbing observer would find that nuclei and electrons are majestic, stable, structured, closed-packed clouds, driving every aspect of matter as we <span>know it.</span></p>

<p><span>M</span>y criticism of the <em>empty atom</em> picture isn’t meant to shame people’s previous attempts to describe atoms and molecules to the public. On the contrary, I applaud their effort in this challenging enterprise. Our common language, intuitions and even basic reasoning processes are not adapted to face quantum theory, this alien world of strangeness surrounded by quirky landscapes we mostly cannot make <span>sense of.</span></p>
<p>And there is so much we do not understand. We have yet to learn how to reconcile the dual wave-like and particle-like behaviour of matter. We do not even know whether wave functions have objective reality. Our brains melt, facing the multiple potential interpretations of quantum theory to the point that outstanding scientists seemingly <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/materialism-alone-cannot-explain-the-riddle-of-consciousness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave up hope</a> that we may reach a scientific consensus. We turn a blind eye to the dirty tricks we carry from the conceptual construction of quantum theory to the actual predictions.</p>
<p>The account of the quantum molecular world I presented is on comfortably safe grounds</p>
<p>We could conform to the unsatisfying ‘Shut up and calculate!’ attitude that has accompanied the increasingly weird predictions of quantum theory, which enabled the outstanding technological advancements of the past <span>100 years,</span> from lasers to microprocessors. However, we do not want to make only useful predictions. Our ultimate goal is to tell stories about our Universe. Thus, we calculate but <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/shut-up-and-calculate-does-a-disservice-to-quantum-mechanics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not shut up</a>. Generations of scientists and science popularisers do their best to translate all this strangeness into friendly metaphors of a theoretical body still full of mystery. We build new mental images of the quantum world one step at a time, even under the risk of tripping up here and there.</p>
<p>The account of the quantum molecular world I presented is on comfortably safe grounds. It is based on a quantum theory domain that is highly consensual among specialists. It is the town square of what the Nobel laureate <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/perspective-is-a-lesson-in-how-science-collaborates-with-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Wilczek</a> called the Core Theory, the physics framework describing fundamental particles, their interactions and Albert Einstein’s general relativity. Physicists are so confident about this core’s stability that they believe it should persist within any new theories of matter developed in the future.</p>
<p>Breathing this confidence and realising we are not made of empty space may be a soothing thought.</p>

<p>Inflammation is a standard part of our bodies’ immune system response. But sometimes this response becomes hyperactivated in our lungs, causing inflammation to continue unchecked, which can be fatal. Many deaths from COVID-19 have been due to excessive inflammation, which results in acute lung injury.</p>



<p>A group of researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago have investigated how lungs counterbalance inflammation. Their work points to cells in the lung that reduce inflammation by removing cellular debris, ingesting harmful bacteria and releasing anti-inflammatory proteins. What’s more, these cells can be trained by an initial infection to do this job even better during a subsequent infection.</p>

<p>The scientists demonstrated that injecting these trained cells into mice helped keep them alive after an infection with pneumonia. These results suggest that such trained cells could become part of a cell therapy that prevents excessive inflammation. The research <a href="https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20221388">is published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>The researchers found that after an initial exposure to a bacterial toxin, lung immune cells called alveolar macrophages helped reduce the severity of inflammation brought on by a second exposure to the bacterial toxin one week later. The benefit of this “memory” or “training” was present even when the second exposure occurred a month later, explained senior author <a href="https://bcmg.com.uic.edu/faculty/rehman_jalees.html">Dr. Jalees Rehman</a>, Benjamin Goldberg Professor and head of the UIC Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.</p>



<p>The cells appear to become particularly good at removing post-infection debris — such as cellular debris from immune cells that fought the infection or from one’s damaged tissue — Rehman explained. “Clearing out this debris is important because its persistence can trigger the immune system to continue to react, thus increasing inflammation,” Rehman said. Because this debris isn’t specific to one type of infection, these trained macrophages might help reduce the risk of acute lung injury from subsequent infections that arise from a different disease. The researchers found that the molecules involved in the removal of cell debris were higher in the trained alveolar macrophages.</p>



<p>Alveolar macrophages are unusual cells in that we are born with them and they stay in our lungs into adulthood. During infections, alveolar macrophages die but they can regenerate from surviving alveolar macrophages. They also pass along epigenetic information to their cellular progeny, which means new macrophages could retain a memory of previous infections, Rehman explained. All of this combines to make them very effective in helping to reduce acute lung injury.</p>



<p>Many other organs have macrophages, so future research could explore whether those cells could be trained by an initial infection as well or by directly increasing the levels of the molecules that help with debris removal, said Rehman, who is also a member of the University of Illinois Cancer Center.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

<p>The Yann LeCun et al. (1989) paper <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition</a> is I believe of some historical significance because it is, to my knowledge, the earliest real-world application of a neural net trained end-to-end with backpropagation. Except for the tiny dataset (7291 16x16 grayscale images of digits) and the tiny neural network used (only 1,000 neurons), this paper reads remarkably modern today, 33 years later - it lays out a dataset, describes the neural net architecture, loss function, optimization, and reports the experimental classification error rates over training and test sets. It’s all very recognizable and type checks as a modern deep learning paper, except it is from 33 years ago. So I set out to reproduce the paper 1) for fun, but 2) to use the exercise as a case study on the nature of progress in deep learning.</p>

<p><img src="http://karpathy.github.io/assets/lecun/lecun1989.png" width="100%"></p>

<p><strong>Implementation</strong>. I tried to follow the paper as close as possible and re-implemented everything in PyTorch in this <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/lecun1989-repro">karpathy/lecun1989-repro</a> github repo. The original network was implemented in Lisp using the Bottou and LeCun 1988 <a href="https://leon.bottou.org/papers/bottou-lecun-88">backpropagation simulator SN</a> (later named Lush). The paper is in french so I can’t super read it, but from the syntax it looks like you can specify neural nets using higher-level API similar to what you’d do in something like PyTorch today. As a quick note on software design, modern libraries have adopted a design that splits into 3 components: 1) a fast (C/CUDA) general Tensor library that implements basic mathematical operations over multi-dimensional tensors, and 2) an autograd engine that tracks the forward compute graph and can generate operations for the backward pass, and 3) a scriptable (Python) deep-learning-aware, high-level API of common deep learning operations, layers, architectures, optimizers, loss functions, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Training</strong>. During the course of training we have to make 23 passes over the training set of 7291 examples, for a total of 167,693 presentations of (example, label) to the neural network. The original network trained for 3 days on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-4">SUN-4/260</a> workstation. I ran my implementation on my MacBook Air (M1) CPU, which crunched through it in about 90 seconds (~<strong>3000X naive speedup</strong>). My conda is setup to use the native arm64 builds, rather than Rosetta emulation. The speedup may have been more dramatic if PyTorch had support for the full capability of the M1 (including the GPU and the NPU), but this seems to still be in development. I also tried naively running the code on an A100 GPU, but the training was actually <em>slower</em>, most likely because the network is so tiny (4 layer convnet with up to 12 channels, total of 9760 params, 64K MACs, 1K activations), and the SGD uses only a single example at a time. That said, if one really wanted to crush this problem with modern hardware (A100) and software infrastructure (CUDA, PyTorch), we’d need to trade per-example SGD for full-batch training to maximize GPU utilization and most likely achieve another ~100X speedup of training latency.</p>

<p><strong>Reproducing 1989 performance</strong>. The original paper reports the following results:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 2.5e-3. error 0.14%. misses: 10
eval: split test . loss 1.8e-2. error 5.00%. misses: 102
</code></pre></div>

<p>While my training script repro.py in its current form prints at the end of the 23rd pass:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 4.073383e-03. error 0.62%. misses: 45
eval: split test . loss 2.838382e-02. error 4.09%. misses: 82
</code></pre></div>

<p>So I am reproducing the numbers <em>roughly</em>, but not exactly. Sadly, an exact reproduction is most likely not possible because the original dataset has, I believe, been lost to time. Instead, I had to simulate it using the larger MNIST dataset (hah never thought I’d say that) by taking its 28x28 digits, scaling them down to 16x16 pixels with bilinear interpolation, and randomly without replacement drawing the correct number of training and test set examples from it. But I am sure there are other culprits at play. For example, the paper is a bit too abstract in its description of the weight initialization scheme, and I suspect that there are some formatting errors in the pdf file that, for example, erase dots “.”, making “2.5” look like like “2 5”, and potentially (I think?) erasing square roots. E.g. we’re told that the weight init is drawn from uniform “2 4 / F” where F is the fan-in, but I am guessing this surely (?) means “2.4 / sqrt(F)”, where the sqrt helps preserve the standard deviation of outputs. The specific sparse connectivity structure between the H1 and H2 layers of the net are also brushed over, the paper just says it is “chosen according to a scheme that will not be discussed here”, so I had to make some some sensible guesses here with an overlapping block sparse structure. The paper also claims to use tanh non-linearity, but I am worried this may have actually been the “normalized tanh” that maps ntanh(1) = 1, and potentially with an added scaled-down skip connection, which was trendy at the time to ensure there is at least a bit of gradient in the flat tails of the tanh. Lastly, the paper uses a “special version of Newton’s algorithm that uses a positive, diagonal approximation of Hessian”, but I only used SGD because it is significantly simpler and, according to the paper, “this algorithm is not believed to bring a tremendous increase in learning speed”.</p>

<p><strong>Cheating with time travel</strong>. Around this point came my favorite part. We are living here 33 years in the future and deep learning is a highly active area of research. How much can we improve on the original result using our modern understanding and 33 years of R&amp;D? My original result was:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 4.073383e-03. error 0.62%. misses: 45
eval: split test . loss 2.838382e-02. error 4.09%. misses: 82
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first thing I was a bit sketched out about is that we are doing simple classification into 10 categories, but at the time this was modeled as a <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html">mean squared error</a> (MSE) regression into targets -1 (for negative class) or +1 (for positive class), with output neurons that also had the tanh non-linearity. So I deleted the tanh on output layers to get class logits and swapped in the standard (multiclass) <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html">cross entropy loss</a> function. This change dramatically improved the training error, completely overfitting the training set:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 9.536698e-06. error 0.00%. misses: 0
eval: split test . loss 9.536698e-06. error 4.38%. misses: 87
</code></pre></div>

<p>I suspect one has to be much more careful with weight initialization details if your output layer has the (saturating) tanh non-linearity and an MSE error on top of it. Next, in my experience a very finely-tuned SGD can work very well, but the modern <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html">Adam optimizer</a> (learning rate of 3e-4, of course :)) is almost always a strong baseline and needs little to no tuning. So to improve my confidence that optimization was not holding back performance, I switched to AdamW with LR 3e-4, and decay it down to 1e-4 over the course of training, giving:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 0.000000e+00. error 0.00%. misses: 0
eval: split test . loss 0.000000e+00. error 3.59%. misses: 72
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gave a slightly improved result on top of SGD, except we also have to remember that a little bit of weight decay came in for the ride as well via the default parameters, which helps fight the overfitting situation. As we are still heavily overfitting, next I introduced a simple data augmentation strategy where I shift the input images by up to 1 pixel horizontally or vertically. However, because this simulates an increase in the size of the dataset, I also had to increase the number of passes from 23 to 60 (I verified that just naively increasing passes in original setting did not substantially improve results):</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 8.780676e-04. error 1.70%. misses: 123
eval: split test . loss 8.780676e-04. error 2.19%. misses: 43
</code></pre></div>

<p>As can be seen in the test error, that helped quite a bit! Data augmentation is a fairly simple and very standard concept used to fight overfitting, but I didn’t see it mentioned in the 1989 paper, perhaps it was a more recent innovation (?). Since we are still overfitting a bit, I reached for another modern tool in the toolbox, <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html">Dropout</a>. I added a weak dropout of 0.25 just before the layer with the largest number of parameters (H3). Because dropout sets activations to zero, it doesn’t make as much sense to use it with tanh that has an active range of [-1,1], so I swapped all non-linearities to the much simpler <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html">ReLU</a> activation function as well. Because dropout introduces even more noise during training, we also have to train longer, bumping up to 80 passes, but giving:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 2.601336e-03. error 1.47%. misses: 106
eval: split test . loss 2.601336e-03. error 1.59%. misses: 32
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which brings us down to only 32 / 2007 mistakes on the test set! I verified that just swapping tanh -&gt; relu in the original network did not give substantial gains, so most of the improvement here is coming from the addition of dropout. In summary, if I time traveled to 1989 I’d be able to cut the rate of errors by about 60%, taking us from ~80 to ~30 mistakes, and an overall error rate of ~1.5% on the test set. This gain did not come completely free because we also almost 4X’d the training time, which would have increased the 1989 training time from 3 days to almost 12. But the inference latency would not have been impacted. The remaining errors are here:</p>

<p><img src="http://karpathy.github.io/assets/lecun/errors32.png" width="100%"></p>

<p><strong>Going further</strong>. However, after swapping MSE -&gt; Softmax, SGD -&gt; AdamW, adding data augmentation, dropout, and swapping tanh -&gt; relu I’ve started to taper out on the low hanging fruit of ideas. I tried a few more things (e.g. weight normalization), but did not get substantially better results. I also tried to miniaturize a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">Visual Transformer (ViT)</a>) into a “micro-ViT” that roughly matches the number of parameters and flops, but couldn’t match the performance of a convnet. Of course, many other innovations have been made in the last 33 years, but many of them (e.g. residual connections, layer/batch normalizations) only become relevant in much larger models, and mostly help stabilize large-scale optimization. Further gains at this point would likely have to come from scaling up the size of the network, but this would bloat the test-time inference latency.</p>

<p><strong>Cheating with data</strong>. Another approach to improving the performance would have been to scale up the dataset, though this would come at a dollar cost of labeling. Our original reproduction baseline, again for reference, was:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 4.073383e-03. error 0.62%. misses: 45
eval: split test . loss 2.838382e-02. error 4.09%. misses: 82
</code></pre></div>

<p>Using the fact that we have all of MNIST available to us, we can simply try scaling up the training set by ~7X (7,291 to 50,000 examples). Leaving the baseline training running for 100 passes already shows some improvement from the added data alone:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 1.305315e-02. error 2.03%. misses: 60
eval: split test . loss 1.943992e-02. error 2.74%. misses: 54
</code></pre></div>

<p>But further combining this with the innovations of modern knowledge (described in the previous section) gives the best performance yet:</p>

<div><pre><code>eval: split train. loss 3.238392e-04. error 1.07%. misses: 31
eval: split test . loss 3.238392e-04. error 1.25%. misses: 24
</code></pre></div>

<p>In summary, simply scaling up the dataset in 1989 would have been an effective way to drive up the performance of the system, at no cost to inference latency.</p>

<p><strong>Reflections</strong>. Let’s summarize what we’ve learned as a 2022 time traveler examining state of the art 1989 deep learning tech:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First of all, not much has changed in 33 years on the macro level. We’re still setting up differentiable neural net architectures made of layers of neurons and optimizing them end-to-end with backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. Everything reads remarkably familiar, except it is smaller.</li>
  <li>The dataset is a baby by today’s standards: The training set is just 7291 16x16 greyscale images. Today’s vision datasets typically contain a few hundred million high-resolution color images from the web (e.g. Google has JFT-300M, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">OpenAI CLIP</a> was trained on a 400M), but grow to as large as a small few billion. This is approx. ~1000X pixel information per image (384*384*3/(16*16)) times 100,000X the number of images (1e9/1e4), for a rough 100,000,000X more pixel data at the input.</li>
  <li>The neural net is also a baby: This 1989 net has approx. 9760 params, 64K MACs, and 1K activations. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04560">Modern (vision) neural nets</a> are on the scale of small few billion parameters (1,000,000X) and O(~1e12) MACs (~10,000,000X). Natural language models can reach into trillions of parameters.</li>
  <li>A state of the art classifier that took 3 days to train on a workstation now trains in 90 seconds on my fanless laptop (3,000X naive speedup), and further ~100X gains are very likely possible by switching to full-batch optimization and utilizing a GPU.</li>
  <li>I was, in fact, able to tune the model, augmentation, loss function, and the optimization based on modern R&amp;D innovations to cut down the error rate by 60%, while keeping the dataset and the test-time latency of the model unchanged.</li>
  <li>Modest gains were attainable just by scaling up the dataset alone.</li>
  <li>Further significant gains would likely have to come from a larger model, which would require more compute, and additional R&amp;D to help stabilize the training at increasing scales. In particular, if I was transported to 1989, I would have ultimately become upper-bounded in my ability to further improve the system without a bigger computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose that the lessons of this exercise remain invariant in time. What does that imply about deep learning of 2022? What would a time traveler from 2055 think about the performance of current networks?</p>

<ul>
  <li>2055 neural nets are basically the same as 2022 neural nets on the macro level, except bigger.</li>
  <li>Our datasets and models today look like a joke. Both are somewhere around 10,000,000X larger.</li>
  <li>One can train 2022 state of the art models in ~1 minute by training naively on their personal computing device as a weekend fun project.</li>
  <li>Today’s models are not optimally formulated, and just changing some of the details of the model, loss function, augmentation or the optimizer we can about halve the error.</li>
  <li>Our datasets are too small, and modest gains would come from scaling up the dataset alone.</li>
  <li>Further gains are actually not possible without expanding the computing infrastructure and investing into some R&amp;D on effectively training models on that scale.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the most important trend I want to comment on is that the whole setting of training a neural network from scratch on some target task (like digit recognition) is quickly becoming outdated due to finetuning, especially with the emergence of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">foundation models</a> like GPT. These foundation models are trained by only a few institutions with substantial computing resources, and most applications are achieved via lightweight finetuning of part of the network, prompt engineering, or an optional step of data or model distillation into smaller, special-purpose inference networks. I think we should expect this trend to be very much alive, and indeed, intensify. In its most extreme extrapolation, you will not want to train any neural networks at all. In 2055, you will ask a 10,000,000X-sized neural net megabrain to perform some task by speaking (or thinking) to it in English. And if you ask nicely enough, it will oblige. Yes you could train a neural net too… but why would you?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is a story consisting of several little building blocks and they occurred spread out in time and in different places. It is a story that shows with clarity how our current system with CVE Ids and lots of power given to NVD is a completely broken system.</p>







<p>On August 25 2023, we get <a href="https://curl.se/mail/lib-2023-08/0031.html">an email to the curl-library mailing list</a> that informs us that “someone” has recently created a CVE, a security vulnerability identification number and report really, for a curl problem.</p>



<pre>I wanted to let you know that there's a recent curl CVE published and it doesn't look like it was acknowledged by the curl authors since it's not mentioned in the curl website: CVE-2020-19909</pre>



<p>We can’t tell who filed it. We just know that it is now there.</p>



<h2>We own our curl issues</h2>



<p>In the curl project we work hard and fierce on security and we always work with security researchers who report problems. We file our own CVEs, we document them and we make sure to tell the world about them. <a href="https://curl.se/docs/security.html">We list over 140 of them</a> with every imaginable detail about them provided. We aim at providing gold-level documentation for <em>everything</em> and that includes our past security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>That someone else suddenly has submitted a CVE for curl is a surprise. We have not been told about this and we would <em>really</em> have liked to.  Now there is a new CVE out there reporting a curl issue and we have no details to say about it on the website. Not good.</p>



<p>I bet curl users soon would like to know the details about this.</p>



<h2>Wait 2020?</h2>



<p>The new CVE has an ID containing 2020 and that is weird. When you register a CVE you typically get it with the year you request it. Unless you get an ID for an <em>old</em> problem of the past. Is that what they did?</p>



<p>Sources seem to indicate that this was published just days ago.</p>



<h2>What is this CVE?</h2>



<p>Of course the top link when you search for this CVE is to NVD. <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/06/12/nvd-damage-continued/" data-type="post" data-id="22645">Not the most reliable organization</a>, but now we can’t be too picky. On their site <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-19909">they explain this</a> with very few details:</p>



<pre>Integer overflow vulnerability in tool_operate.c in curl 7.65.2 via crafted value as the retry delay.</pre>



<p>And then the craziest statement of the year. They grade it a <strong>9.8 CRITICAL</strong> issue. With 10 as a maximum, this is close to the worst case possible, right?</p>



<h2>The code</h2>



<p>Let’s pause NVD in their panic state for a moment because I immediately recognized this description. Brief as it is.</p>



<p>I spend a lot of time in the curl security team receiving reports, reviewing reports, reviewing source code, assessing claims and figuring out curl security issues.<em> I had seen this claim before!</em></p>



<p>On July 27, 2019, a Jason Lee file an <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/661847">issue on hackerone</a>, where he reported that there was an integer overflow problem in curl’s <code>--retry-delay</code> command line option. The option accepts number of seconds and then internally converts to milliseconds by multiplying the value by 1000. The option sets how long time curl should wait until it makes a retry if the previous transfer failed with a transient error.</p>



<p>This means that on a 64 bit machine, if you write </p>



<pre>curl --retry-delay 18446744073709552 ...</pre>



<p>The number will overflow the math and instead of waiting until the end of the universe, it might retry again within the next few seconds. The above example apparently made it 384 seconds instead. On Windows, which uses 32 bit longs, you can get the problem already by asking for more than two million seconds (roughly 68 years).</p>



<p>A bug, sure. Security problem? No. I told Jason that in 2019 and then we closed the security report. I then filed <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/4166">a pull-request and fixed the bug</a>. Credits to Jason for the report. We moved on. The fix was shipped in curl 7.66.0, released in September 2019.</p>



<h2>Grading issues</h2>



<p>In previous desperate attempts from me to reason with NVD and stop their scaremongering and their grossly inflating the severity level of issues, they have insisted that they take in all publicly available data about the problem and make an assessment.</p>



<p>It was obvious already before that NVD really does not try very hard to actually understand or figure out the problem they grade. In this case it is quite impossible for me to understand how they could come up with this severity level. It’s like they saw “integer overflow” and figure that <em>wow, yeah that is the most horrible flaw we can imagine</em>, but clearly nobody at NVD engaged their brains nor looked at the “vulnerable” code or the patch that fixed the bug. Anyone that looks can see that this is not a security problem.</p>



<p>The issue listed by NVD even links to <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/4166">my pull request</a> I mention above. There is no doubt that it is the exact same bug they refer to.</p>



<h2>Spreading like a virus</h2>



<p>NVD hosts a CVE database and there is an entire world and eco system now that pulls the records from them.</p>



<p>NVD now has this CVE-2020-19909 entry in there, rated 9.8 CRITICAL and now this disinformation spreads across the world. Now when we search for this CVE number we find numerous sites that repeats the same data. “This is a 9.8 CRITICAL problem in curl” – when it is not.</p>



<h2>I will object</h2>



<p>I learned about this slap in my face just a few hours ago, but I intend to do what I can to reject this CVE.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-418955">


<h3>from the <i>never-mind-the-precedent</i> dept</h3>

<p>In 2014, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/06/25/supreme-court-says-law-enforcement-cant-search-mobile-phones-without-warrant/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/06/25/supreme-court-says-law-enforcement-cant-search-mobile-phones-without-warrant/">the Supreme Court made it clear</a>: phone searches require warrants. While it did note the case involved a search “incident to an arrest,” the precedent was undeniable. If a phone search attached to an arrest requires a warrant, it would logically follow that <em>any</em> phone search by law enforcement — even those not subsequent to an arrest — requires a warrant. </p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/04/22/court-border-search-warrant-exception-beats-riley-constitution-free-zone/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/04/22/court-border-search-warrant-exception-beats-riley-constitution-free-zone/">multiple federal courts</a> have come to the opposite conclusion in cases involving searches of phones at borders or international airports. According to these judges, the <em>Riley</em> decision simply doesn’t apply when border security is in play. And it doesn’t matter whether the searched device belongs to an American citizen or a resident of a foreign country.</p>
<p>The law shouldn’t be unsettled, but it is. There’s no consensus at the appellate level. Nor is there one at the lower levels. All we have is a lack of clarity to work with. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/23/federal-judge-says-riley-applies-at-border-warrants-are-needed-for-some-cell-phone-searches/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/23/federal-judge-says-riley-applies-at-border-warrants-are-needed-for-some-cell-phone-searches/">One federal judge</a> (Jed Rakoff) said warrants are needed for “some” border phone searches — specifically “forensic” searches in which the government makes itself a copy of <em>all</em> data on a person’s phone. </p>
<p>The Fourth Circuit Appeals Court also made a limited finding in favor of <em>Riley’s</em> warrant requirement, stating that border law enforcement officers must have at least articulable suspicion to engage in forensic searches. That’s still a long way from probable cause, but it’s more than the “nothing at all” standard CBP and Border Patrol officers have been held to. </p>
<p>The Seventh Circuit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/04/01/7th-circuit-punts-border-smartphone-searches-says-riley-decision-doesnt-affect-anything/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/04/01/7th-circuit-punts-border-smartphone-searches-says-riley-decision-doesnt-affect-anything/">had a chance to set precedent</a> in another border device search case, but instead chose to save the question for a later day, leaving the “because border security” rationale for warrantless searches undisturbed.</p>
<p>This indecision has led to a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/08/23/border-device-searches-continue-to-increase-threatening-more-than-just-4th-amendment/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/08/23/border-device-searches-continue-to-increase-threatening-more-than-just-4th-amendment/">steady increase</a> in <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170314/08063936914/phone-searches-now-default-mode-border-more-searches-last-month-than-all-2015.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170314/08063936914/phone-searches-now-default-mode-border-more-searches-last-month-than-all-2015.shtml">border device searches</a>, driven by the ubiquity of smartphones and no one at the judicial level willing to decisively tell border officers a warrant is needed.</p>
<p>Texas immigration lawyer Adam Malik has given the Fifth Circuit a chance to set precedent more aligned with the Supreme Court’s 2014 <em>Riley</em> decision. Unfortunately, the Fifth Circuit has decided a forensic search of Malik’s device (which was held by the CBP for three weeks) isn’t a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (via <a href="http://fourthamendment.com/?p=55616" data-type="link" data-id="http://fourthamendment.com/?p=55616">FourthAmendment.com</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/02/texas-immigration-lawyer-sues-dhs-cbp-over-seizure-search-his-work-phone/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/02/texas-immigration-lawyer-sues-dhs-cbp-over-seizure-search-his-work-phone/">Malik sued the DHS and CBP</a> in early 2021, after his phone was seized, searched, and held by the CBP. One of Malik’s many concerns was the government’s warrantless access to privileged attorney-client information. This is what happened during the search Malik sued over. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In response to Mr. Malik’s assertion of privilege, Officer Sullivan informed Mr. Malik that DHS was seizing the iPhone and that the digital contents would be searched. Officer Sullivan did not disconnect the iPhone from the internet or the communications network. He failed to take action that would protect the iPhone from accessing the internet or a communications network. Officer Sullivan ordered Mr. Malik to leave the deferred inspection area without the iPhone while the iPhone still was connected to the internet and a communications network.</em></p>
<p><em>Neither Officer Sullivan nor any other employee of Defendants asked Mr. Malik to disable connectivity of the iPhone to the internet or to any network. Had Officer Sullivan or any employee of Defendants offered to permit Mr. Malik to place the iPhone in airplane mode upon or after seizure of the iPhone, Mr. Malik would have done so immediately.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of not preventing the phone from continuing to collect data and communications, the DHS held on to Malik’s phone for five months. According to this, from the Fifth Circuit’s <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23919671/riley-border-search-5th.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23919671/riley-border-search-5th.pdf">decision</a> [PDF], part of that time was given over to the government’s efforts to avoid accessing privileged information. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The phone’s passcode feature prevented the border officers from accessing the phone, and thus from searching it, so they sent it to a forensics lab. The lab bypassed the phone’s security features, extracted the phone’s data, and returned the phone and the data to DHS. All of that took about three months. DHS then used a “filter team” to screen the extracted data for any privileged materials. That took about two more months. Once the filter team had finished, they provided the border officers in Dallas with “two thumb drives . . . consisting of the data that the filter team determined [the officers] were authorized to search.” DHS then conducted a border search of that data, and DHS returned the phone to Malik on May 21, 2021.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s not explained here is <em>what</em> the DHS was searching <em>for</em>. That it has the power to engage in warrantless searches of devices doesn’t automatically create reasons for it to do so. Very little was explained to Malik, other than that the officers <em>could</em> do this and, therefore, they were going to do this. All of this happened despite Malik being a government-approved member of the CBP’s Global Entry Trusted Traveler Program, which should have seen him subjected to less scrutiny when crossing borders, rather than what he was actually subjected to.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/02/23/sen-wyden-wants-answers-new-dhs-head-introducing-legislation-to-create-warrant-requirement-border-phone-searches/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/02/23/sen-wyden-wants-answers-new-dhs-head-introducing-legislation-to-create-warrant-requirement-border-phone-searches/">some</a><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/15/sen-ron-wyden-catches-ice-illegally-collecting-americans-financial-data/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/02/23/sen-wyden-wants-answers-new-dhs-head-introducing-legislation-to-create-warrant-requirement-border-phone-searches/"> </a><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/02/23/sen-wyden-wants-answers-new-dhs-head-introducing-legislation-to-create-warrant-requirement-border-phone-searches/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/02/23/sen-wyden-wants-answers-new-dhs-head-introducing-legislation-to-create-warrant-requirement-border-phone-searches/">hard questions</a> posed to the DHS by Senator Ron Wyden, Malik sought to obtain more information to use in his lawsuit against the agency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Discovery closed on February 11, 2022. Malik moved to reopen discovery a few weeks later, citing a public letter that United States Senator Ron Wyden sent to DHS’s Inspector General. Among other things, the letter alleges that DHS conducted “bulk surveillance of Americans’ financial records” by collecting troves of “transaction data” from Western Union. While the letter asks DHS to investigate these allegations, it does not address individual border searches, phone records, decryption, or DHS’s data-retention policies. The district court denied Malik’s motion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court denied this motion. Then it decided in favor of the DHS, ruling it had not violated Malik’s rights with this search of his phone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court (which splits the US-Mexico border with the Ninth Circuit) agrees with the lower court. No rights violation here, not when border security is on the line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Malik argues that we should extend Riley v. California to border searches. Yet, for “[routine] cell phone searches at the border, our sister circuits have uniformly held that Riley does not require either a warrant or reasonable suspicion.” We have held the same. Even for non-routine searches, our sister circuit “have differed only as to whether reasonable</em> <em>suspicion is required.” We are not aware of any circuit court that has extended Riley’s warrant requirement to the border.</em></p>
<p><em>“Ordinarily, we would expect a party encouraging us to adopt a new constitutional [theory] to convincingly distinguish adverse authorities” and “to discuss the contours of the doctrine [he] wishes us to adopt. Malik has not done any of that. He has not even attempted to argue that the search was anything other than routine. He also has not discussed or analyzed Riley at any length, nor has he addressed the fact that “[e]very circuit that has faced this question has agreed that Riley does not mandate a warrant requirement for border searches of electronic devices, whether basic or advanced. </em></p>
<p><em>Instead, Malik has asked us to “intervene” and hold “that a judicial warrant is required at this time for the search of an attorney’s confidential client files and communications at the border.” Malik’s request for our “intervention” is itself a tacit concession that our precedent does not currently require a warrant for cell-phone searches at the border. We express no view on how the border-search exception may develop or be clarified in future cases, but we do expressly decline to address it further here.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, like the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit decides analyzing <em>Riley</em> in terms of border searches is a question for another day. And, by passing on this opportunity, it ensures the next time someone asks the same question, it will be able to refer to its previous punt to kick the constitutional can further down the road.</p>
<p>That being said, the lawsuit isn’t entirely dead. Malik also wants to ensure the DHS destroys all the data it pulled from his phone, which includes plenty of privileged material. Not only were there attorney-client communications, but likely information dealing with ongoing immigration litigation against the government — work product that is likewise shielded from government snooping.</p>
<p>The Fifth Circuit agrees Malik is right to demand this form of expungement and the DHS is wrong to refuse to destroy this seized data <em>unless</em> Malik drops his lawsuit. (All emphasis in the original.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the district court, DHS argued that “the information is being retained <strong>only</strong> because Malik requested a litigation hold,” and that Malik cannot not rely on this self-inflicted injury to show standing. And, on appeal, DHS has represented that it will “destroy the remaining data in its possession and will be happy to provide an appropriate certification to Malik that <strong>all</strong> data in the government’s possession has been destroyed and that <strong>no data was transferred</strong> to any other governmental or nongovernmental entity or person” as soon as these “proceedings” conclude. DHS made similar representations to the district court. In other words, DHS argues that this lawsuit is the only obstacle separating Malik from the expungement that he seeks.</em></p>
<p><em>We do not agree that Malik’s injury is self-inflicted. The injury is that DHS still possesses privileged information that it unlawfully seized from his phone. Malik did not volunteer that data to DHS, and he has no control over how DHS handles it. That is why Malik came to court. DHS argues that it will delete the data if Malik non-suits this case. But while the possibility of an alternate form of relief confirms that Malik has suffered an injury, it does not mean that he caused the injury. That is especially true here, where Malik lacks any power to redress his injury. Instead, the most he can do is non-suit this case and trust DHS to delete the data. Where redress cannot be self-actuated, we are hesitant to conclude that an injury is self-inflicted.</em></p>
<p><em>We also do not agree that DHS can moot Malik’s suit merely by promising to delete the data once the suit is over. By its very nature, a promise of some future action cannot redress Malik’s injury <strong>now</strong>. DHS’s promise, then, supports no more than a prediction that this case could be moot in the future. But it is not presently moot. Rather, DHS still has Malik’s data. Just as we will not rely on “conjectural or hypothetical” facts to find that standing</em> <em>is present, so too we will not rely on predictions and what-ifs to find that standing is absent. We hold that Malik has standing to seek expungement.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s great but there’s nothing in here for Malik, other US citizens, or their constitutional rights. When it comes to the border, the house always wins. What Malik is being given here is nothing more than existing precedent regarding expungement of privileged material. What <em>no one</em> is being given is any more protection from their own government just because they cross borders or seek to board international flights. When it comes to anything the government calls a “border,” the rights we were guaranteed are mostly null and void.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



					



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ipad-macbook-travel-6c.jpg?ssl=1" alt="MacBook and iPad" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every time any of us packs a bag, we are making some very specific tech-focused decisions. It starts with what devices we need (or can live without) and cascades into charging bricks and cords and anything else that will keep us powered up and not feeling regret about having left an essential device behind.</p>
<p>I’m spending a few days this week visiting my mom, and it’s the fourth or fifth time this summer I’ve needed to pack a bag as a part of a busy travel schedule. For many years, I tried very hard to travel with only an iPad. (Why bring two devices? And I’m not leaving my iPad at home.) Since the arrival of Apple silicon, however, I’ve gone back to traveling with both an iPad and a MacBook Air.</p>
<p>As the Mac picked up speed (and the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/07/m2-macbook-air-review-a-new-era/">M2 MacBook Air</a> packed even more power into a delightful new design), the iPad seemed to evolve slowly when it evolved at all. I’ve noticed that a lot of my colleagues who were previously working hard to integrate the iPad into their professional work have backed off, retreating to the more flexible and powerful Mac side of the house.</p>
<p>In the battle between iPad and Mac, I’m a longtime member of <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2016/02/ipad-vs-mac-im-on-team-both/">Team Both</a>—I use my Mac most of the day at my desk, but when I write elsewhere in the house or backyard, I switch to an iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard case. And that iPad (in a regular case) is my primary computing device when I’m not in work mode.</p>
<p>I’m not at all ready to declare the “use iPad to get work done” experiment dead. With the forthcoming release of iPadOS 17, Stage Manager has thrown in a bunch of improvements that suggest the iPad’s progression to more functional status continues, albeit at a pace that’s a bit too slow for my liking.</p>
<p>But here I sit at my mother’s dining room table, typing on a MacBook Air. Something has changed in my approach to travel, and I’m trying to understand just what it is and what it tells me about the trajectory of the iPad as a productivity tool.</p>
<p>My productivity needs are clearly unlike those of most people, but the truth is that everyone’s got different productivity needs. The problem with the iPad continues to be that as it builds functionality, it has failed to build in flexibility—or at least the flexibility offered by a platform like macOS. If the iPad doesn’t support it, you’ve hit a brick wall. Your choices are to find a workaround or give up.</p>
<p>As I’ve <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/">written about</a> for the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/recording-a-podcast-locally-on-ios-without-a-mac/">better part of a decade</a>, I’ve tried endlessly to find a solid workflow to record podcasts on the iPad. Oh, sure, there are plenty of workarounds, but the bottom line is still this: the iPad’s audio system is so inflexible that it just can’t do the job.</p>
<p>Sure, it would be swell if a utility like <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/03/audio-hijack-4-arrives-the-definitive-mac-audio-utility-just-got-better/">Audio Hijack</a> could run on the iPad. But even a simpler solution, like being able to record microphone audio in one app while simultaneously using Zoom to have a conversation, would make this approach viable. Speaking of Zoom, that app’s built-in recording feature will save a recording of your local microphone audio… on every platform <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Enabling-and-starting-local-recordings">except on iOS and iPadOS</a>.</p>
<p>But it’s not just podcasting. Take the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/05/a-year-with-the-elgato-stream-deck/">Stream Deck</a>, a clever external device that lets you press buttons to kick off all sorts of tasks. I’ve come to rely on it, so much so that in a moment of weakness, I bought a <em>second</em> Stream Deck (for travel and potential use in a backup office I’m setting up) on Prime Day the other month.</p>
<p>While there’s an iPad app for Stream Deck, it’s not what you think. It turns the iPad <em>into</em> a Stream Deck, so you can tap on its screen and execute macros on a Mac or PC. If you connect a Stream Deck to an iPad directly, nothing happens. The Stream Deck software on Mac and Windows runs in the background, looks for button presses, and then runs macros. That kind of software just doesn’t fit how Apple envisions the iPad experience.</p>
<p>Sure, the iPad has the Shortcuts app, and many of my Keyboard Maestro macros really just execute shortcuts… but this very useful accessory just doesn’t work with it. How could it? Even if there were a market for it, I don’t think the platform is robust enough to support it.</p>
<p>This is where the iPad is today. It’s good enough for what it does. If it doesn’t do it, it doesn’t do it. This is the fundamental difference between the Mac (a platform that basically lets developers and users do anything they want) and the iPad (where if Apple doesn’t specifically allow it, it can’t be done).</p>
<p>The beauty of the Mac as a platform is that Apple doesn’t have to think of every use case and doesn’t have to build out every single esoteric detail in order to enable new features. It empowers developers and users to build what they need, and by extending the Mac’s functionality, they incrementally increase the Mac’s value as a computing platform.</p>
<p>On the iPad, advancement doesn’t work like that. Instead, it’s decided in various meetings inside Apple where specific features will get prioritized or deprioritized for the next operating system cycle. Once every year or two, we will hear about some (legitimately exciting!) new features that will extend the usability of the platform. And that will basically be it. The waiting begins again.</p>
<p>I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of creating more inconvenience for myself in order to push the iPad past the boundaries Apple has set for it. For the cost of an extra 2.75 pounds in my backpack, I can travel with a MacBook Air knowing that more or less anything I need to do while on the road can be accomplished without requiring weird workarounds or risking a catastrophic tech failure.</p>
<p>I <em>want</em> to do it all on my iPad. I hope that one day I’ll be able to. But for now, I’m done pushing the envelope. Apple will determine what I can do with my iPad, and when that changes, I’m sure they’ll let me know. Until then, all any of us can do is wait.</p>
