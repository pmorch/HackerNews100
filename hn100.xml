Allow me to read this whole chapter to you…”</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Speaking of holes, in my weird, nerdy corner of the Internet, there’s recently been a hubbub around an anticavity probiotic, Lumina Probiotic, coming straight from the Bay Area. In the literal sense, this probiotic is meant to prevent holes (in teeth). In the more metaphorical sense, though, it fits in well with previous Bay Area fads, tunneling not only through the dentistry industry but also through the FDA approval process. You see, despite this being clearly a drug and thus under FDA/CDER purview, the founder of Lumina, Aaron Silverbook, has decided to sell this directly to the public as a cosmetic product without doing the requisite safety and efficacy tests.</p><p>In case you can’t tell by the title of the post, I think this is a terrible idea, as well as probably illegal. Unlike most people in the Bay Area, I think formalized safety and efficacy trials are a must for health products. In fact, I told Aaron Silverbook this when he asked me for my advice about his product last fall. No, the FDA is not a perfect institution, and yes, it can be improved in many, many ways. But the history of health product regulation is written in blood. There’s a reason why we need some sort of regulation, even if that form of regulation can be improved.</p><p><span>I’ve been annoyed for some months now to see Lumina sell their product directly to the public without FDA approval or even human trials. I’ve also been disappointed for some months to see how many people I respect (and some I don’t respect) have been using it/promoting it. Taking unapproved drugs is a bad idea, no matter what rationalist bloggers with MDs, porn star/escort/sex researchers, Twitter guys, or </span><a href="https://manifold.markets/Reddit/will-richard-hanania-find-out-his-r" rel="">conservative firebrands who get sick immediately after taking the unapproved drug</a><span> tell you.</span></p><p>Despite my annoyance, I had resigned myself to just grumbling about Lumina to my friends. That is, until last week, when I randomly started looking more deeply into some of Lumina’s claims as part of an unrelated project. As I looked more deeply, I became convinced that many of Lumina’s claims are unfounded, and it is, in fact, simultaneously a more dangerous and less effective drug than Lumina or its boosters have been publicly saying that it is. So, I thought it’d be best to write a blog post and share my criticisms to stop people from getting sick from a bad drug.</p><p><span>Also, before I start, I did only think it fair to ask Aaron Silverbook for his comments on this blog post before publishing. So far, I haven’t heard back</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-1-144660269" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>, but I will update this post if I do. With that in mind, let’s begin.</span></p><p><span>Your mouth has a bunch of bacteria in it all the time. In a healthy mouth, these bacteria are useful insofar as they prevent other, worse bacteria from taking up residence in your mouth. However, these bacteria, like the bacteria in your </span><a href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/ground-squirrel-microbiomes-are-neat/comments" rel="">gut</a><span> or </span><a href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/bacterial-vaginosis-we-contain-multitudes?r=3ege4" rel="">vagina</a><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-2-144660269" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> (assuming you have one) are only “good” insofar as your body can keep them in check, mostly through flushing the bacteria from your mouth to your stomach via swallowing, at which point they get destroyed by stomach acid.</span></p><p>Sometimes your body can’t keep these bacteria in check, like when defense mechanisms fail (e.g. persistent lack of saliva) or the mouth becomes more hospitable for the bacteria (e.g. excess of sugar). The bacteria start to overgrow. And when you give bacteria an inch, they take a mile, fortifying their position. The most important way they do that in the mouth is by forming biofilms on the teeth (dental plaque), which are “bacterial cities”. These biofilms are mutual aid pacts, in which bacteria share defenses, nutrients, and swap useful genes.</p><p><span>In the mouth, the biofilms also help the bacteria produce a more hospitable habitat for themselves. These bacteria, specifically </span><em>Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, </em><span>and lactobacilli produce lactic acid through their metabolism. This not only changes the local environment to be a more preferable pH, but it also lets them create pits in teeth by demineralizing the teeth to live in. These pits, if they don’t get remineralized by the saliva, become cavities.</span></p><p>This is all pretty settled science. Brushing your teeth with a fluoride-enhanced toothpaste, like you’ve probably done your entire life, is meant to disrupt these biofilms and promote remineralization of these pits. The newer, less settled science mostly revolves around ways to combat these cavity-causing bacteria directly. There have been various attempts to create vaccines or antibiotics for these bacteria, none of which have been amazingly successful.</p><p>One inventor who’s tried repeatedly to address this issue is a guy named Jeffrey Hillman, who’s technically a dentist by training. Starting in the 80s and continuing through the 2000s, he tried to make an idea work where he would genetically engineer safe bacteria to outcompete the bacteria in the mouth that cause cavities and then permanently reside in the mouth. The result would be a mouth permanently full of safe bacteria that couldn’t possibly cause cavities and would beat up any dangerous bacteria that would.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg" width="634" height="356" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:356,&quot;width&quot;:634,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Wonka's Origins Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, 40% OFF&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Wonka's Origins Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, 40% OFF" title="Wonka's Origins Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, 40% OFF" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd15edb2e-1a05-4af8-b8ab-72683260b31c_634x356.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Pictured: Jeffrey Hillman’s origin story.

Ignore the Warner Bros. copyright in the corner. </span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>His ideas around this went through several iterations, a lot of money (definitely tens of millions and possibly more), and several companies, most notably Oragenics. After a number of rat trials (which </span><a href="https://twitter.com/natalia__coelho/status/1778537436446117985?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" rel="">weren’t entirely successful</a><span>), one or two aborted human trials</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-3-144660269" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>, and two bouts of self-experimentation, the idea died on the vine in the 2000s. Then, it was reborn in a less exciting way as </span><a href="https://probiorahealth.com/patented-formula/" rel="">ProBiora</a><span>, a formulation of specially picked, non-genetically engineered bacteria that would also outcompete dangerous oral bacteria. This product </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26427036/" rel="">then failed its one-and-only human trial</a><span>, an outcome Hillman apparently ignored. You can now buy ProBiora today at all participating retailers.</span></p><p><span>Fast-forward to last year, when rationalist Aaron Silverbook came across Hillman’s original work with the genetically modified bacteria. Aaron, based on his previous work as </span><a href="https://manifund.org/projects/recreate-the-cavity-preventing-gmo-bacteria-bcs3-l1-from-precursor-" rel="">guy at a rationalist nonprofit, videogame producer, and porn producer</a><span>, decided to recreate Hillman’s work</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-4-144660269" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>. First, he applied for funding from FTX. He got it, but then FTX collapsed. Then, he applied for funding from alternative rationalist funding source Manifund, got that, and failed to recreate Hillman’s work. However, </span><a href="https://manifold.markets/Austin/if-funded-will-lantern-bioworks-suc" rel="">Aaron declared mission success anyways</a><span> in that he negotiated with Oragenics to acquire a sample of BCS3L-1, one of Hillman’s later strains</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-5-144660269" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span>, in exchange for $50k and promise of royalties, although </span><a href="https://www.oragenics.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/163/oragenics-enters-into-agreement-with-lantern-bioworks-for" rel="">he didn’t get any intellectual property rights</a><span> .</span></p><p>Aaron then went on an intellectual journey where he tried to figure out what exactly to do with this genetically modified bacteria. After all, he was faced with basically the same daunting FDA journey as Hillman, but without Hillman’s scientific background or financial resources. After talking to a bunch of people, including me, he eventually decided on a very rationalist, very Bay Area, very strange approach:</p><p>1. Sell the genetically modified bacteria as-is for a one time payment of $20,000 in a libertarian charter city in Honduras</p><p>2. Give a bunch of rationalist-adjacent celebrities free samples of the GMO bacteria as-is in exchange for positive press, including Scott Alexander, Aella (the porn star/escort/sex researcher who he’s the business manager for), Richard Hanania, Cremieux, and Bryan Caplan</p><p>3. Take preorders for $200 a piece from the general public</p><p>It’s worth noting that, regardless of what I think of this plan (i.e. it’s bad and maybe unethical), I’m pretty sure this plan is also illegal. While Lantern claims to be marketing this probiotic as a cosmetic, it is meant to prevent and cure tooth decay. According to the WHO, tooth decay is a disease. A product meant to cure and prevent a disease is a drug, and legally needs to go through the drug approval process. But, you know, whatever.</p><p>Anyhow, enough about Lumina as a company. Let’s talk about Lumina’s science.</p><div><p><span>It’s a little hard to say. Jeffrey Hillman created a bunch of different versions of his genetically modified bacteria with a confusing naming structure. But, as far as I can tell, BCS3L-1 was/is a genetically modified </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> bacteria with </span><a href="https://sci-hub.gupiaoq.com/10.1023/a:1020695902160" rel="">four main features</a><span>:</span></p><p><span>1. It produced mutacin-1140, a naturally occurring antibiotic in the bacteriocin family.</span></p></div><p>2. It was resistant itself to mutacin-1140.</p><p>3. It produced alcohol instead of lactic acid.</p><p><span>4. It has a deleted </span><em>comE</em><span> gene, which was intended to prevent genetic transformation by wildtype, existing </span><em>S. mutans</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The first 2 features are natural and occur with some frequency in </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> population. Specifically, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC205644/" rel="">there are at least 3 </a><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC205644/" rel="">S. mutans</a></em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC205644/" rel=""> groups which both secrete and are resistant to mutacin</a><span> including the group that BCS3L-1 comes from.</span></p><p><span>The second 2 features are engineered. BCS3L-1 has its </span><em>ldh</em><span> gene replaced by an alcoholic dehydrogenase gene, and has, as mentioned, a deleted </span><em>comE </em><span>gene.</span></p><p><span>The lack of an </span><em>ldh</em><span> gene means that BCS3L-1 does not produce lactic acid. The alcoholic dehydrogenase gene means that it produces ethanol instead. I don’t think this is the safest way to replace lactic acid, although I don’t think this is the biggest problem with BCS3L-1</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-6-144660269" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The lack of a </span><em>comE </em><span>gene is hard for me to evaluate. As of the early 2000s, when Hillman was creating BCS3L-1,</span><em> </em><span>deleting </span><em>comE </em><span>seemed like a definitive way to prevent BCS3L-1 from forming effective biofilms or taking up helpful genes (like, say, regaining the </span><em>ldh</em><span> gene). </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/8/1/15" rel="">As of 2017</a><span>, this picture is much more complicated. </span><em>comE</em><span> is involved in many different things, and some of its functions are redundant.</span></p><p><span>So, deletion of </span><em>comE</em><span> would definitely make it more difficult for BCS3L-1 to be transformed, but it would likely not make it impossible. It would definitely make it harder for BCS3L-1 to survive in the mouth and compete against wildtype </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> who are resistant to mutacin-1140. And it definitely would not make it impossible for BCS3L-1 to transform other </span><em>S. mutans</em><span>, like by autolysis, which is basically bacterial self-detonation. This releases bacterial DNA in the biofilm, so it could result in wildtype </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> getting some of the genes of BCS3L-1 (like resistance to mutacin 1140).</span></p><p><span>Putting this all together, putting BCS3L-1 in your mouth results in your teeth being colonized by whatever bacteria are resistant to mutacin-1140. Ideally, this would be some mixture of BCS3L-1 and harmless bacteria. However, if any other bacteria are in the mouth that are resistant to mutacin-1140 and can live on your teeth (e.g. naturally occurring mutacin-resitant </span><em>S. mutans</em><span>), they will become the dominant species in your mouth, as BCS3L-1 has several fitness-decreasing mutations. Or, it’s entirely possible that BCS3L-1 will start off by being the dominant species in your mouth, then, at some point, will just transform the existing </span><em>S. mutans</em><span> into mutacin-1140 resistant </span><em>S. mutans</em><span>, at which point these wildtype </span><em>S. mutans </em><span>will, again, become the dominant species in your mouth.</span></p><p>But let’s say BCS3L-1 becomes the dominant species in your mouth. What then? Are there any health risks? I’m glad you asked.</p><p>When I talk about the health risks of BCS3L-1, there are really two categories of health risks to discuss: the health risks if BCS3L-1 works as intended, and the health risks if it doesn’t. You see, one of the main functions of the FDA is to not only outline the health risks of products working as intended, but to minimize the health risks of products not working as intended. Like, say, the health risks involved with the product being contaminated.</p><p><span>BCS3L-1 is a probiotic, which is a bacteria that you ingest. This puts it in the same category as kombucha or yogurt. And, like </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/a3pxz7/my_homemade_kombucha_which_i_swore_by_was_making/" rel="">kombucha</a><span> or </span><a href="https://japantoday.com/category/national/students-hospitalized-after-eating-teacher%E2%80%99s-homemade-yogurt-in-nagoya" rel="">yogurt</a><span>, improper manufacturing of BCS3L-1 could introduce any number of contaminants into the product, including foreign bacteria or fungi (like mold). These can make you incredibly sick or even kill you.</span></p><p><span>The FDA has strict manufacturing standards when it comes to probiotics, known as </span><a href="https://internationalprobiotics.org/wp-content/uploads/IPA-Probiotic-Manufacturing-Guidelines-2019.pdf" rel="">GMP standards</a><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-7-144660269" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span><span>. These include making sure your factory is clean and free from contaminants, your protocol reliably produces safe probiotics and is followed closely by your employees, and your end product is regularly tested. These standards aren’t just paper standards, either. The FDA regularly goes and inspects factories to make sure they follow GMP standards. Because these standards are so strict, most smaller drug developers, like my companies, find it cost-prohibitive to manufacture drugs ourselves, and rely on contract factories to do so.</span></p><p>If you are a Bay Area type, you might think that it’s unfair that the FDA regulates who can manufacture drugs. You’d probably be tempted to manufacture the drug by yourself. In fact, that’s what I suspect Lumina has done, because I really doubt a contract factory would be ok making an unapproved drug for them to sell to the public, as that would get the contract factory in trouble.</p><p>But, again, these standards are written in blood. As the links above suggest, even “safe” probiotics like yogurt or kombucha can make you incredibly sick or kill you if improperly manufactured. BCS3L-1 definitely could make someone sick or kill them if improperly manufactured. If Lumina is not following GMP standards, as I suspect they’re not, they are at risk of seriously injuring or killing their customers through contamination.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg" width="682" height="408" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:408,&quot;width&quot;:682,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Food Poisoning: Symptoms and Treatment | Allina Health&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Food Poisoning: Symptoms and Treatment | Allina Health" title="Food Poisoning: Symptoms and Treatment | Allina Health" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe23618a8-3f1c-48ae-acfd-facf88a326da_682x408.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Pictured: you after ingesting contaminated, improperly manufactured probiotics.

They certainly aren’t following </span><a href="https://www.chpa.org/public-policy-regulatory/voluntary-codes-guidelines/best-practices-voluntary-guidelines-probiotics" rel="">the Best Practices Guidelines for Probiotics</a><span>, which require you to state how much of each strain in CFUs is in each batch that you send out on your packaging. So, when Lumina claims that you are receiving BCS3L-1, which has the modifications above, they actually have no idea what you’re receiving.&nbsp;</span></p><p>You could be receiving:</p><p>1) Just BCS3L-1</p><p>2) Random contaminants</p><p>3) Mutated BCS3L-1 (like one that regained the ability to produce lactic acid)</p><p>4) Dangerous bacteria or fungi that have taken over your batch</p><p>5) Some combination of 1 through 4</p><p><span>So, that’s what I mean when I say the first category of health risks when taking BCS3L-1 are the unknown health risks. </span><strong>Neither you, nor Lumina, have any idea what you’re infecting your mouth with.</strong></p><p>Onto the next category: the known health risks.</p><p>BCS3L-1, if you remember, produces two main byproducts by design: alcohol and mutacin-1140. Now the alcohol that BCS3L-1 produces can definitely be a health risk (see footnote 6), but I want to discuss mutacin-1140.</p><p><span>Mutacin-1140 is an antibiotic in the lantibiotic class. Oragenics has spent the past 20 years or so trying to develop it and related antibiotics commercially, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30479173/" rel="">most notably for </a><em><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30479173/" rel="">C. difficile</a></em><span>, an infection of the digestive tract. They’ve struggled in part because, although mutacin-1140 can be effective against </span><em>C. difficile</em><span>, it’s </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00415/full" rel="">somewhat cytotoxic</a><span> (i.e. is somewhat dangerous to the body) and</span><a href="https://sci-hub.gupiaoq.com/10.1517/17425255.2011.573478" rel=""> caused a hypersensitivity reaction in a rat when given through IV at a high dose</a><span>. It also has difficult pharmacokinetics, because </span><a href="https://sci-hub.gupiaoq.com/10.1517/17425255.2011.573478" rel="">it binds strongly to blood and plasma</a><span>, meaning that it tends to go everywhere that blood goes, making it hard to target specific infections.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>On the plus side, it is very effective at surviving the digestive tract, in that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5864910/" rel="">it survives for greater than 240 minutes in simulated gastric fluid and for 72 minutes in simulated intestinal fluid</a><span>. This stability in the stomach is probably why Oragenics keeps trying to develop it for infections of the digestive tract.</span></p><p>Now, given that information, think about the wisdom of infecting your mouth with a bacteria that is designed to continually produce mutacin-1140. You are continually producing an antibiotic in your mouth that:</p><p>1) Can be dangerous</p><p>2) Goes everywhere that blood goes</p><p>3) Is not inactivated by stomach acid</p><p>4) Kills other bacteria very effectively</p><p>At the very least, this is a great way to give yourself the digestive equivalent of continually taking antibiotics (i.e. diarrhea and indigestion). This also might be a good way to give yourself a hypersensitivity reaction like that poor rat. It’s hard to say, because making a safety equivalence between taking an IV antibiotic one time at a high dose and taking an antibiotic orally at a low dose for potentially decades is really difficult. This is why the FDA requires safety studies.</p><p><span>What I can say for sure is that this would be exceptionally dangerous for infants and immunocompromised people. </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-raises-concerns-about-probiotic-products-sold-use-hospitalized-preterm-infants#:~:text=The%20FDA%20is%20aware%20that,the%20United%20States%20since%202018." rel="">Infants have died from hospital-grade probiotics before</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024039392#:~:text=Yet%2C%20probiotics%20themselves%20may%20also,localized%20and%20opportunistic%20infections%20(Fig." rel="">immunocompromised people have gotten seriously sick</a><span>. That’s from normal, “healthy” probiotics. How do you think your infant (who does not yet have a fully colonized microbiome) will respond if you infect them with a bacterium that nukes all other bacteria in their system? Better hope you don’t kiss your baby or share food or drinks with them!</span></p><p><span>I hope I’ve conclusively proven, at this point, that Lumina has messed up big time. They have put a lot of people at risk, including everyone who they’ve non-consensually infected by introducing a genetically modified bacteria into the wild. They messed with things they didn’t understand, put profit and “acceleration” before safety, and, in one of the worst sins that a rationalist can do, tunneled a hole through the Chesterton fence of the FDA</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-8-144660269" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>If Lumina had the good sense of Hillman (who, to be clear, I don’t think is a scientific saint either), they at least would have sold the version of the GMO bacteria that had a self-destruct button, </span><a href="https://sci-hub.gupiaoq.com/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03316.x" rel="">AJ2M</a><span>, which I think was the last strain Hillman created. That one was designed to be vulnerable to chlorhexidine and to require an exogenous amino acid, d-alanine, to function. If the d-alanine stopped being provided, the bacteria died, assuming it didn’t acquire any mutations in the meantime that let it keep surviving.</span></p><p>But Lumina didn’t do that, even though I and, I assume others, told them to do that. They sold the earlier version of the probiotic without a kill-switch, which means that the cat is out of the bag and is probably giving overly credulous rationalists diarrhea as we speak. So, at the very least, Lumina needs to:</p><p>1) Stop selling the probiotic and refund everyone who’s bought it so far</p><p>2) Do research into which antibiotics and what course of antibiotics will completely remove BCS3L-1</p><p>3) Message everyone who’s bought BCS3L-1 with information on how to test if they still have it and how to rid them themselves of it if they do</p><p>4) Fund people’s doctors’ visits to rid themselves of BCS3L-1</p><p><span>Or, you know, they could also do the typical Bay Area thing and keep tunneling along regardless of what damage they leave in their wake. After all, as every dentist knows, one person’s hole is another person’s business opportunity</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9-144660269" href="https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity#footnote-9-144660269" target="_self" rel="">9</a></span><span>.</span></p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/please-dont-take-luminas-anticavity?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Like this post?

<p>When brothers Thomas and John Knoll began designing and writing an image editing program in the late 1980s, they could not have imagined that they would be adding a word to the dictionary.</p>



<div id="attachment_9140"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9140" src="https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photoshop-source-code-thomas-knoll.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="300"></p><p id="caption-attachment-9140">Thomas Knoll</p></div> <div id="attachment_9133"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9133" src="https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photoshop-source-code-john-knoll.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="300"></p><p id="caption-attachment-9133">John Knoll</p></div>




<p>Thomas Knoll, a PhD student in computer vision at the University of Michigan, had written a program in 1987 to display and modify digital images. His brother John, working at the movie visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic, found it useful for editing photos, but it wasn’t intended to be a product. Thomas said, “We developed it originally for our own personal use…it was a lot a fun to do.”</p>
<p>Gradually the program, called “Display”, became more sophisticated. In the summer of 1988 they realized that it indeed could be a credible commercial product. They renamed it “Photoshop” and began to search for a company to distribute it. About 200 copies of version 0.87 were bundled by slide scanner manufacturer Barneyscan as “Barneyscan XP”.</p>
<p>The fate of Photoshop was sealed when Adobe, encouraged by its art director Russell Brown, decided to buy a license to distribute an enhanced version of Photoshop. The deal was finalized in April 1989, and version 1.0 started shipping early in 1990.</p>
<p>Over the next ten years, more than 3 million copies of Photoshop were sold.</p>



<div id="attachment_9132"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9132" src="https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photoshop-source-code-box-and-disk.jpg" alt="" width="789" height="369"></p><p id="caption-attachment-9132">The box and disk for the original version of Photoshop on Mac.</p></div>




<p>That first version of Photoshop was written primarily in Pascal for the Apple Macintosh, with some machine language for the underlying Motorola 68000 microprocessor where execution efficiency was important. It wasn’t the effort of a huge team. Thomas said, “For version 1, I was the only engineer, and for version 2, we had two engineers.” While Thomas worked on the base application program, John wrote many of the image-processing plug-ins.</p>

<p>With the permission of Adobe Systems Inc., the Computer History Museum is pleased to make available, for non-commercial use, the source code to the 1990 version 1.0.1 of Photoshop. All the code is here with the exception of the MacApp applications library that was licensed from Apple. There are 179 files in the zipped folder, comprising about 128,000 lines of mostly uncommented but well-structured code. By line count, about 75% of the code is in Pascal, about 15% is in 68000 assembler language, and the rest is data of various sorts.</p>

<h2>Commentary on the source code</h2>
<p>Software architect Grady Booch is the Chief Scientist for Software Engineering at IBM Research Almaden and a trustee of the Computer History Museum. He offers the following observations about the Photoshop source code:</p>
<ul>
	<li>“Opening the files that constituted the source code for Photoshop 1.0, I felt a bit like Howard Carter as he first breached the tomb of King Tutankhamen. What wonders awaited me?</li>
	<li>I was not disappointed by what I found. Indeed, it was a marvelous journey to open up the cunning machinery of an application I’d first used over 20 years ago.</li>
	<li>Architecturally, this is a very well-structured system. There’s a consistent separation of interface and abstraction, and the design decisions made to componentize those abstractions – with generally one major type for each combination of interface and implementation – were easy to follow.</li>
	<li>The abstractions are quite mature. The consistent naming, the granularity of methods, the almost breathtaking simplicity of the implementations because each type was so well abstracted, all combine to make it easy to discern the texture of the system.</li>
	<li>Having the opportunity to examine Photoshop’s current architecture, I believe I see fundamental structures that have persisted, though certainly in more evolved forms, in the modern implementation. Tiles, filters, abstractions for virtual memory (to attend to images far larger than display buffers or main memory could normally handle) are all there in the first version. Yet it had just over 100,000 lines of code, compared to well over 10 million in the current version! Then and now, much of the code is related to input/output and the myriad of file formats that Photoshop has to attend to.</li>
	<li>There are only a few comments in the version 1.0 source code, most of which are associated with assembly language snippets. That said, the lack of comments is simply not an issue. This code is so literate, so easy to read, that comments might even have gotten in the way.</li>
	<li>It is delightful to find historical vestiges of the time: code to attend to Andy Herzfield’s software for the Thunderscan scanner, support of early TARGA raster graphics file types, and even a few passing references to Barneyscan lie scattered about in the code. These are very small elements of the overall code base, but their appearance reminds me that no code is an island.</li>
	<li>This is the kind of code I aspire to write.”</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is the kind of code we all can learn from. Software source code is the literature of computer scientists, and it deserves to be studied and appreciated. Enjoy a view of Photoshop from the inside.</p>

        <div>
             
                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span>&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;today announced new accessibility features coming later this year, including Eye Tracking, a way for users with physical disabilities to control iPad or iPhone with their eyes. Additionally, Music Haptics will offer a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music using the Taptic Engine in iPhone; Vocal Shortcuts will allow users to perform tasks by making a custom sound; Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness when using iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle; and more accessibility features will come to visionOS. These features combine the power of Apple hardware and software, harnessing Apple silicon, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to further Apple’s decades-long commitment to designing products for everyone.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“Each year, we break new ground when it comes to accessibility,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These new features will make an impact in the lives of a wide range of users, providing new ways to communicate, control their devices, and move through the world.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2><strong>Eye Tracking Comes to iPad and iPhone</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Powered by artificial intelligence, Eye Tracking gives users a built-in option for navigating iPad and iPhone with just their eyes. Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn’t shared with Apple.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Eye Tracking works across iPadOS and iOS apps, and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2><strong>Music Haptics Makes Songs More Accessible</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Music Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.

                 <h2><strong>New Features for a Wide Range of Speech</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>With Vocal Shortcuts, iPhone and iPad users can assign custom utterances that Siri can understand to launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks. Listen for Atypical Speech, another new feature, gives users an option for enhancing speech recognition for a wider range of speech. Listen for Atypical Speech uses on-device machine learning to recognize user speech patterns. Designed for users with acquired or progressive conditions that affect speech, such as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or stroke, these features provide a new level of customization and control, building on features introduced in iOS 17 for users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak.

                 <h2><strong>Vehicle Motion Cues Can Help Reduce Motion Sickness</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Vehicle Motion Cues is a new experience for iPhone and iPad that can help reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles. Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle. With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.

With Voice Control, users can navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice. With Sound Recognition, drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing can turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens. For users who are colorblind, Color Filters make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use, with additional visual accessibility features including Bold Text and Large Text.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>This year, accessibility features coming to visionOS will include systemwide Live Captions to help everyone — including users who are deaf or hard of hearing — follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps. With Live Captions for FaceTime in visionOS, more users can easily enjoy the unique experience of connecting and collaborating using their Persona. Apple Vision Pro will add the capability to move captions using the window bar during Apple Immersive Video, as well as support for additional Made for iPhone hearing devices and cochlear hearing processors. Updates for vision accessibility will include the addition of Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights for users who have low vision, or those who want to avoid bright lights and frequent flashing.

                 <div>These features join the dozens of accessibility features already available in Apple Vision Pro, which offers a flexible input system and an intuitive interface designed with a wide range of users in mind. Features such as VoiceOver, Zoom, and Color Filters can also provide users who are blind or have low vision access to spatial computing, while features such as Guided Access can support users with cognitive disabilities. Users can control Vision Pro with any combination of their eyes, hands, or voice, with accessibility features including Switch Control, Sound Actions, and Dwell Control that can also help those with physical disabilities.

                 <div>“Apple Vision Pro is without a doubt the most accessible technology I’ve ever used,” said Ryan Hudson-Peralta, a Detroit-based product designer, accessibility consultant, and cofounder of Equal Accessibility LLC. “As someone born without hands and unable to walk, I know the world was not designed with me in mind, so it’s been incredible to see that visionOS just works. It’s a testament to the power and importance of accessible and inclusive design.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>What if you set out to make the worst website you possibly could? So poorly designed and full of frustrating patterns that users would not only hate the experience of using this website, but would also come to hate your company. Could we make a web experience so terrible that it would express how much our company hated our users? </p><p>As a long-time Internet addict, I've encountered my fair share of terrible websites. Instagram where now half my feed is advertisements for stupid t-shirts and the other half is empty black space. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="604" height="758" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image.png 604w"><figcaption><span>Who in the fuck would ever wear this</span></figcaption></figure><p>Or ARNGREN.net which is like if a newspaper ad threw up on my screen. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="816" height="684" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-1.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-1.png 816w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But Instagram still occasionally shows me pictures of people I follow and ultimately the stuff on ARNGREN is so cool I still want to buy it regardless of the layout. </p><p>No, I believe it is the crack team at Broadcom that have nailed it for the worst website in existence. </p><h3 id="lured-in-with-free-vmware">Lured in with free VMware </h3><p>So through social media I discovered this blog post from VMware announcing that their popular virtualization software is free for personal use now. <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2024/05/14/vmware-desktop-hypervisor-pro-apps-now-available-for-personal-use/" rel="noreferrer">You can read that here. </a> Great, I used VMware Fusion before and it was ok and maybe it will let me run Windows on an ARM Mac. Probably not but let's try it out and see. </p><blockquote>This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac, Windows or Linux computer can do so <strong><em>for free</em></strong> simply by registering and downloading the latest build from the new download portal located at <a href="http://support.broadcom.com/">support.broadcom.com</a>. With the new commercial model, we have reduced our product group offerings down to a single SKU (VCF-DH-PRO) for users who require commercial use licensing. This simplification eliminates 40+ other SKUs and makes quoting and purchasing VMware Desktop Hypervisor apps, Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro, easier than ever. The new Desktop Hypervisor app subscription can be purchased from any Broadcom Advantage partner.</blockquote><p>I don't want to register at support.broadcom.com but it looks like I don't have a choice as this is the screen on the VMware site. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1118" height="453" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-2.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-2.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-2.png 1118w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now this is where alarm bells start going crazy in my head. Nothing about this notice makes sense. "The store will be moving to a new domain". So it's...not...down for maintenance but actually is just gone? Or is it actually coming back? Because then you say "store will be shutdown" (just a quick note, you want "the store" and "will be shutting down on April 30th 2024"). Also why don't you just redirect to the new domain? What is happening here?</p><h3 id="broadcom">Broadcom</h3><p>So then I go to support.broadcom.com which is where I was told to register and make an account. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1552" height="1039" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-3.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-3.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-3.png 1552w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Never a <em>great sign</em> when there's a link to an 11 page PDF of how to navigate your website. That's the "Learn how to navigate Broadcom Support" link. You can download that killer doc here: <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/documents/d/ecx/broadcom-support-portal-getting-started-guide">https://support.broadcom.com/documents/d/ecx/broadcom-support-portal-getting-started-guide</a></p><p> Alright let's register. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1373" height="746" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-4.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-4.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-4.png 1373w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>First the sentence "Enhance your skills through multiple self-service avenues by creating your Broadcom Account" leaps off the page as just pure corporate nonsense. I've also never seen a less useful CAPTCHA, it looks like it is from 1998 and any modern text recognition software would defeat it. In fact the Mac text recognition in Preview defeats 3 of the 4 characters with no additional work:</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="412" height="173"></figure><p>So completely pointless and user hostile. Scoring lots of points for the worst website ever. I'm also going to give some additional points for "Ask our chatbot for assistance", an idea so revolting normally I'd just give up on the entire idea. But of course I'm curious, so I click on the link for the "Ask our chatbot" and.....</p><p><strong>It takes me back to the main page. </strong></p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1471" height="1026" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-6.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-6.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-6.png 1471w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Slow clap Broadcom. Imagine being a customer that is so frustrated with your support portal that you actually click "Ask a chatbot" and the web developers at Broadcom come by and karate chop you right in the throat. Bravo. Now in Broadcom's defense in the corner IS a chatbot icon so I kinda see what happened here. Let's ask it a question. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="349" height="595"></figure><p>I didn't say hello. I don't know why it decided I said hello to it. But in response to VMware it gives me this: </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="325" height="545"></figure><p>Did the chatbot just tell me to go fuck myself? Why did you make a chatbot if all you do is select a word from a list and it returns the link to the support doc? Would I like to "Type a Query"?? WHAT IS A CHATBOT IF NOT TYPING QUERIES? </p><figure><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1708837337_65" alt="Radio | Thanks! I Hate It" loading="lazy" width="700" height="700"></figure><h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3><p>I fill in the AI-proof CAPTCHA and hit next, only to be greeted with the following screen for 30 seconds. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="639" height="607" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-9.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-9.png 639w"></figure><p>Finally I'm allowed to make my user account. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-10.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="674" height="359" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-10.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-10.png 674w"></figure><p>Um....alright....seems like overkill Broadcom but you know what this is your show. I have 1Password so this won't be a problem. It's not letting me copy/paste from 1Password into this field but if I do Command + \ it seems to let me insert. Then I get this. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="673" height="385" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-11.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-11.png 673w"></figure><p>What are you doing to me Broadcom. Did I....wrong you in some way? I don't understand what is happening. Ok well I refresh the page, try again and it works this time. Except I can't copy/paste into the Confirm Password field. </p><p>I mean they can't expect me to type out the impossibly complicated password they just had me generate right? Except they have and they've added a check to ensure that I don't disable Javascript and treat it like a normal HTML form. </p><p>Hey front-end folks, just a quick note. Never ever ever ever ever mess with my browser. It's not yours, it's mine. I'm letting you use it for free to render your bloated sites. Don't do this to me. I get to copy paste whatever I want whenever I want. When you get your own browser you can do whatever you want but while you are living in my house under my rules I get to copy/paste whenever I goddamn feel like it. </p><h3 id="quickly-losing-enthusiasm-for-the-idea-of-vmware">Quickly losing enthusiasm for the idea of VMware</h3><p>So after pulling up the password and typing it in, I'm treated to this absolutely baffling screen. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="459" height="982"></figure><p>Do I need those? I feel like I might need those. eStore at least sounds like something I might want. I don't really want Public Semiconductors Case Management but I guess that one comes in the box. 44 seconds of this icon later </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="353" height="270"></figure><p>I'm treated to the following. </p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="585" height="749"></figure><p>Broadcom, you clever bastards. Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in. Tricking users into thinking a link is going to help them and then telling them to get fucked by advising them to contact your sales rep? Genius. </p><p>So then I hit cancel and get bounced back to......you guessed it!</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1269" height="950" srcset="https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-16.png 600w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-16.png 1000w, https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-16.png 1269w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Except I'm not even logged into my newly created account. So then I go to login with my new credentials and I <em>finally</em> make it to my customer portal. Well no first they need to redirect me <strong>back </strong>to the Broadcom Support main page again with new icons.</p><figure><img src="https://matduggan.com/content/images/2024/05/image-17.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="556" height="142"></figure><p>Apparently my name was too long to show and instead of fixing that or only showing first name Broadcom wanted to ensure the disrespect continued and sorta trail off.

<p>Over the past two weeks, UniSuper, an Australian superannuation fund, faced every cloud user’s nightmare: their cloud provider deleted their data. From May 2nd to 13th, UniSuper experienced a major outage and in several updates <a href="https://www.unisuper.com.au/contact-us/outage-update">blamed Google Cloud</a> for the incident.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The disruption of UniSuper services was caused by a combination of rare issues at Google Cloud that resulted in an inadvertent misconfiguration during the provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud, which triggered a previously unknown software bug that impacted UniSuper’s systems. This was an unprecedented occurrence, and measures have been taken to ensure this issue does not happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This culminated in a <a href="https://www.unisuper.com.au/about-us/media-centre/2024/a-joint-statement-from-unisuper-and-google-cloud">press release</a>, jointly signed by Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian. They make it sound like an exotic, one-of-a-kind bug in Google Cloud, though after some research, I’m not entirely convinced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian has confirmed that the disruption arose from an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.</p>
<p>This is an isolated, ‘one-of-a-kind occurrence’ that has never before occurred with any of Google Cloud’s clients globally. This should not have happened. Google Cloud has identified the events that led to this disruption and taken measures to ensure this does not happen again.</p>
<p>UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss. However, when the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription occurred, it caused deletion across both of these geographies.</p>
<p>Restoring UniSuper’s Private Cloud instance has called for an incredible amount of focus, effort, and partnership between our teams to enable an extensive recovery of all the core systems. The dedication and collaboration between UniSuper and Google Cloud has led to an extensive recovery of our Private Cloud which includes hundreds of virtual machines, databases and applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The press release uses vague language, obscuring the technical details of what happened. Given the lack of precision, I assumed this was written solely by UniSuper. Gergely Orosz <a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1788531368701346100">checked</a> with Google Cloud, and they confirmed that this was an official joint statement.</p>
<p>Given the few details provided, I did more research to try to understand what exactly happened.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-deleted">What was deleted?</h2>
<p>Google Cloud doesn’t have a resource called a “Subscription”; the closest concept would probably be a “Billing Account.” While Google has a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you wouldn’t describe it as an instance, and deleting a VPC doesn’t seem like it would have the drastic effects described.</p>
<p>However, if you research UniSuper’s Google Cloud migration, you will see that they use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine?hl=en">Google Cloud VMWare Engine</a> (GCVE). From <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/unisuper-60-percent-complete-in-cloud-shift-596583">June 2023</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The superannuation fund has shifted almost all non-production workloads out of its data centres and into Google Cloud so far.</p>
<p><strong>UniSuper used the Google VMware Engine (GCVE) managed service</strong> and engaged partner Kasna to assist with the migration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GCVE has a resource called a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/concepts-private-cloud">private cloud</a>. A private cloud contains the hosts, management server, storage, and networking for a <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Provider-Stack/index.html">VMware stack</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.privateClouds/delete">API method</a> for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/private-clouds/howto-delete-private-cloud#delete_a_private_cloud">deleting a private cloud</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A PrivateCloud resource scheduled for deletion has PrivateCloud.state set to DELETED and expireTime set to the time when deletion is final and can no longer be reversed. The delete operation is marked as done as soon as the PrivateCloud is successfully scheduled for deletion (this also applies when delayHours is set to zero), and the operation is not kept in pending state until PrivateCloud is purged. PrivateCloud can be restored using privateClouds.undelete method before the expireTime elapses. <strong>When expireTime is reached, deletion is final and all private cloud resources are irreversibly removed and billing stops.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All private cloud resources being irreversibly removed sounds a lot like the outage that UniSuper had. Some people have said that Google deleted their entire Google Cloud account. This seems less likely to me because Google has a number of safeguards and delays when <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#shutting_down_projects">deleting projects</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: You can recover most resources if you restore a project within the 30-day period. Some services have delays in restoring and you might need to wait some time for services to be restored. Some resources, such as Cloud Storage or Pub/Sub resources, are deleted much sooner. These resources might not be fully recoverable even if you restore the project within the 30-day period.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-did-everything-get-deleted">How did everything get deleted?</h2>
<p>UniSuper’s press release says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss. However, when the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription occurred, it caused deletion across both of these geographies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the language here is frustratingly vague and passive but implies that Google Cloud deleted multiple independent private clouds in separate regions. Google Cloud doesn’t have a “geography”; it has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/about/locations">zones and regions</a>. At first read, it sounds like they are describing a multi-region setup. Google Cloud has two Australian regions, Sydney and Melbourne, which would make sense.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the docs, though, GCVE offers two kinds of private clouds: a standard private cloud hosted in a single zone or a “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/private-clouds/howto-create-stretched-private-cloud">stretched private cloud</a>”. A stretched private cloud runs in a single region across two zones, with a third zone as a witness zone for failover. A close reading of the press release doesn’t rule out UniSuper having a single stretched private cloud running in a single region.</p>
<p>So we either have a single stretched private cloud being deleted or two separate private clouds being deleted. A single stretched private cloud seems more likely to me, but I can’t be definitive.</p>
<h2 id="how-was-it-deleted">How was it deleted?</h2>
<p>So we come to the big question: How were the private cloud(s) deleted? The press release makes heroic use of the passive voice to obscure the actors: “an unprecedented sequence of events whereby an inadvertent misconfiguration during provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud services ultimately resulted in the deletion of UniSuper’s Private Cloud subscription.”</p>
<p>Based on my experiences with Google Cloud’s professional services team, they, and presumably their partners, recommend Terraform for defining infrastructure as code. This leads to several possible interpretations of this sentence:</p>
<ol>
<li>UniSuper ran a <code>terraform apply</code> with Terraform code that was “misconfigured”. This triggered a bug in Google Cloud, and Google Cloud accidentally deleted the private cloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what UniSuper has implied or stated throughout the outage.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>UniSuper ran a <code>terraform apply</code> with a bad configuration or perhaps a <code>terraform destroy</code> with the prod <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files">tfvar file</a>. The Terraform plan showed “delete private cloud,” and the operator approved it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automation errors like this happen every day, although they aren’t usually this catastrophic. This seems more plausible to me than a rare one-in-a-million bug that only affected UniSuper.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>UniSuper ran an automation script provided by Google Cloud’s professional services team with a bug. A misconfiguration caused the script to go off the rails. The operator was asked whether to delete the production private cloud, and they said yes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find this less plausible, but it is one way to interpret Google Cloud as being at fault for what sounds like a customer error in automation.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-it-was-a-google-cloud-bug">Maybe it was a Google Cloud bug?</h2>
<p>There are a few holes in my theory that this was primarily UniSuper’s fault:</p>
<ol>
<li>On <a href="https://www.unisuper.com.au/contact-us/outage-update">Tuesday, 7 May</a>, UniSuper attributed a statement to Google Cloud in which Google Cloud admitted fault for the outage:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The disruption of UniSuper services was caused by a combination of rare issues at Google Cloud that resulted in an inadvertent misconfiguration during the provisioning of UniSuper’s Private Cloud, which triggered a previously unknown software bug that impacted UniSuper’s systems. This was an unprecedented occurrence, and measures have been taken to ensure this issue does not happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Thomas Kurian (apparently) signed off on a joint statement with UniSuper. This statement is less accusatory than UniSuper’s other statements but doesn’t clarify which party was at fault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Cloud hasn’t released any pushback to the story, either directly or through proxies in the media.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Why would Google Cloud not respond to this story if it was UniSuper’s fault? It’s hard to say, but putting out a competing statement blaming or contradicting your customer is a bad look with that customer and <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1789061633865597309">with all future customers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given how little detail was communicated, it is difficult to make a conclusive statement about what happened, though I personally suspect UniSuper operator error was a large factor. Hopefully, <a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/">APRA</a>, Australia’s superannuation regulator, will investigate further and release a public report with more details.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently got back into the development of an open source game I released last summer, <em><a href="https://plbrault.com/blog-posts/i-created-the-nerdierst-game-ever-en/">You're the OS!</a></em>. It is a browser game, written in Python and compiled to WebAssembly, in which, as the title indicates, you are the operating system of a computer. As such, you have to manage processes, memory and I/O events.</p>
<p>In case you haven't played the game, here is a very short summary of its core mechanics: you have some CPU cores, and you have a list of processes with varying levels of starvation, and you have to make them take turns on CPU cores and make sure none of them starves.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="A glimpse of the game" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/youre-the-os.png">
</p>
<p>Recently, I added a power-up to the game: after 6 minutes of playing, you get a <code>Sort</code> button that, when clicked, sorts idle processes in decreasing order of starvation. I decided that the game would show the sorting algorithm being executed, by moving around processes as it happens. The sorting algorithm I wanted to use is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a>. In order for it to work like I wanted, there was 2 problems to overcome:</p>
<p>1 - This is a game, with a main loop that completely redraws everything on the screen 60 times per second. Therefore, it was not just a matter of writing a Quicksort function that performs an animation between each recursion. I needed to somehow create a function that performs a single step of the algorithm, then gives back control to the main loop (which ironically sounds just like an OS' preemptive scheduling) for the duration of the animation frames, before being executed again from where it was interrupted.</p>
<p>2 - Just to make it more complicated, the list can change <em>while</em> it is being sorted, as processes can be killed, assigned to a CPU core, or removed from a CPU core.</p>
<p>Now, I want to share a comment from my code, detailing the solution that I came up with. I am quite proud of my solution, but not because it is particularly clever — on the contrary, <strong>I like it precisely because it is dumb</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This method creates the visual illusion that the next recursion of the quicksort algorithm is performed on the idle processes. In reality, the algorithm is always performed from the beginning, and stops as soon as a recursion that actually changes the array has happened. This way, the intended in-game result is achieved while avoiding the need to keep track of the algorithm's state, and a correct end result is ensured even when the idle process list changes between recursions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To try and better explain what the comment means, here is the code of my Quicksort function that stops as soon as an actual change to the array is detected:</p>

<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>simulate_next_sort_step</span>(<span>arr</span>: [<span>Process</span>]):
    <span># Standard Quicksort operations</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>len</span>(<span>arr</span>) <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>arr</span>
    <span>pivot</span> = <span>arr</span>[<span>len</span>(<span>arr</span>) <span>//</span> <span>2</span>]
    <span>left</span> = [<span>process</span> <span>for</span> <span>process</span> <span>in</span> <span>arr</span> <span>if</span> <span>process</span>.<span>sort_key</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>pivot</span>.<span>sort_key</span>]
    <span>middle</span> = [<span>process</span> <span>for</span> <span>process</span> <span>in</span> <span>arr</span> <span>if</span> <span>process</span>.<span>sort_key</span> <span>==</span> <span>pivot</span>.<span>sort_key</span>]
    <span>right</span> = [<span>process</span> <span>for</span> <span>process</span> <span>in</span> <span>arr</span> <span>if</span> <span>process</span>.<span>sort_key</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>pivot</span>.<span>sort_key</span>]

    <span>""" The magic happens here: we proceed to the next recursion only if
        the current one didn't actually change anything. """</span>
    <span>if</span> (<span>left</span> <span>+</span> <span>middle</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span>) <span>==</span> <span>arr</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>simulate_next_sort_step</span>(<span>left</span>) <span>+</span> <span>middle</span> <span>+</span> <span>simulate_next_sort_step</span>(<span>right</span>)
    <span>return</span> <span>left</span> <span>+</span> <span>middle</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You see, I realized along the way that the premise of my first problem described above was mistaken: my need was not, in fact, to implement a function that only executes the next recursion in the quicksort algorithm. My need was to implement an animation that <em>pretends</em> to only execute the next recursion in the quicksort algorithm. My solution does exactly that, in a stateless manner. It is a stupid, inefficient solution — but it is a solution that works, and completely avoids the corner case stated in my second problem: if the content of the array changes along the way, it will naturally cause the illusion of backtracking in the algorithm.</p>
<p>Of course, I could have gone through the trouble of actually figuring out a version of Quicksort that resumes from the previous function call and only executes one recursion. This would have been way more efficient, algorithmically speaking. But it would have also been way more complex, would have produced code that was harder to understand, and would have required addressing corner cases.</p>
<p>The thing is: I did not need the efficiency. This is a terrible implementation of Quicksort, but that terribleness does not really make a dent in the game's performance, knowing that the number of processes that need to be sorted at all times will never exceed 42 — which is a lot for the players of my game, but is nothing for an actual computer.</p>
<p>This solution that I came up with is a testament to the KISS principle (<em>"Keep It Simple, Stupid"</em>). It is also a good reminder that part of finding a good solution to a problem is to make sure that the problem is correctly identified.</p></div></div>]]></description>

It still gets mods to this day.</p><p>Recompiled ports aren't quite the same as decompiled ports like the SM64 PC port in this context, but both will run natively on PC and thus be able to <em>truly</em> maximize performance and effect accuracy to the original hardware while still providing the PC-expected enhancements that come with emulation. &nbsp;N64Recomp is basically the best of both worlds, and since manually decompiling N64 games takes years of labor from one or more people, a tool to more efficiently recompile them into a quickly playable-on-PC state is a godsend for preservationists everywhere.</p><p>A tool like this also ensures that old classics that aren't currently receiving the attention of big mainstream hits remain playable well into the future in an ideal state. A Twitter post by Dario, who makes the RT64 plugin leveraged by N64Recomp and some N64 emulators, highlights this.</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My friend Wiseguy's been working in secret for a year on a tool to make PC ports of N64 games without complete decompilations.

They randomly assigned students at eight junior high schools in Los Angeles to complete one of two anti-drug programs:</span></p></div><div><p><span>A) A “Social” program that was all about resisting negative influences and fostering good friendships</span><br><span>B) An “Emotion” program that was all about managing bad feelings</span><br><span>or</span><br><span>C) No program at all</span></p><p><span>The researchers surveyed the 2,863 participating students three times: just before the programs started, and 12 and 24 months after the programs ended. (They also took saliva samples to keep students honest.) The programs themselves lasted for 12 weeks.</span></p><p><span>In the Emotion program, students did things like:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>Compliment each other to improve their self-esteem</p></li><li><p>Set goals for themselves and think about how drugs interfere with those goals</p></li><li><p>Learn strategies for emotion regulation like deep breathing and muscle relaxation</p></li><li><p>Practice being assertive and saying no to drugs in role-plays</p></li><li><p>Make a videotaped commitment to stay drug-free</p></li></ul><div><p><span>Some of this stuff seems a bit dated now, sure, and the video thing sounds a little creepy. But mostly it looks reasonable—couldn’t hurt, right?</span></p><p><span>Except it </span><em>did </em><span>hurt. Students who did the Emotion program ended up smoking </span><em>more </em><span>cigarettes and </span><em>more </em><span>weed and drinking </span><em>more </em><span>alcohol than students who received no program at all. Which is to say: researchers came into schools in Los Angeles and ran a drug prevention program that caused a bunch of seventh-graders to </span><em>do more drugs</em></p><p><span>(Best of all, the name of this program was Project SMART.)</span></p><p><span>What about the kids in the Social program? Basically bupkis.

You can have a PhD and good intentions. You can have money and buy-in. You can do a bunch of reasonable things to prevent a problem that everyone agrees is bad.

But that’s okay—making iPhones is also hard, and we seem to have nailed that one.</span></p><p><span>What really screws us is that it’s </span><em>surprisingly </em><span>hard to change people. We cook up schemes that seem like they should definitely work, then they don’t work, and this doesn’t chasten us or dim our enthusiasm for future schemes. Hansen et al., after accidentally causing seventh-graders to smoke, don’t end their paper with a long reverie on their hubris. They write a few self-exculpatory paragraphs and move on to the next project.</span></p><p><span>The problem is that our </span><a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/on-the-importance-of-staring-directly" rel="">illusion of explanatory depth</a><span> is so deep when it comes to human behavior that we never realize how little we understand, which prevents us from ever learning more. Nobody thinks they can whip up an iPhone in their garage over the weekend, but most people think they know how to save the children, fix the schools, reform the prisons, overhaul healthcare, repair politics, restore civility, and bring about world peace. Perhaps that’s why we have iPhones and we don’t have any of those other things.</span></p></div><div><p><span>This myth of the easily-malleable human is so widespread and so deeply believed that it borders on delusion. Once you see it, though, it can make sense of some things that otherwise seem psychotic.</span></p><p><span>For example, in the US, anybody who does academic research on humans or animals has to undergo ethics training first. That sounds reasonable, until you realize the “training” is just PowerPoint slides that you click through as fast as you can, and then you get asked questions like:</span></p><p><strong><span>Which of these represents responsible treatment of research subjects?</span><br></strong><span>A) Poking them in the eye</span><br><span>B) Using the internet to discover their weaknesses</span><br><span>C) Running them over with a forklift</span><br><span>D) Treating them with respect</span></p><p><span>And then there are a few questions like:</span></p><p><strong><span>Subsection 41b.46 of the 1972 Research Reform Act stipulates which of the following?</span><br></strong><span>A) Paragraph 17 of the 1971 Research Reform Act is null and void</span><br><span>B) Principal Investigators are not allowed to be listed as Co-Principal Investigators</span><br><span>C) Conflicts of interest must be reported on Form 99-F</span><br><span>D) Any research expenditures greater than $100 must be done via certified check</span></p><p><span>If you fail the exam, you just retake it until you pass.

Like when a conservative Christian senator sponsors a bill that’s like “Let’s Make It Illegal to Be Horny” and then gets caught at a brothel wearing a diaper and nipple clamps. That’s the level of hypocrisy we’re dealing with here. If you claim to care about preventing sexual harassment and then you’re out here asking whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a “county” law, you </span><em>do not </em><span>care about preventing sexual harassment.</span></p><p><span>I understand these trainings exist solely for the purposes of ass-covering. If you get sued because one of your employees, say, </span><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/1/7/professor-accused-of-rules-violation-professor/" rel="">sticks a research participant with a dirty needle</a><span>, you can go, “Hey, don’t blame us! We made them do an ethics training!”</span></p><p><span>But why does this ass-covering work? I don’t mean legally; I don’t care if this is all because of Subsection 31a of the Let’s Make Things Worse Act of 1986, or because of the Supreme Court decision in </span><em>Buttmunch v. Fartmeister </em><span>or whatever. I mean </span><em>why do we allow it</em><span>? Anybody who has to suffer through these trainings knows that they’re stupid and useless. But when those same people are sitting in the jury box, they nod and say, “Well, you can’t blame the company, they made their employees do an ethics training.” </span><em>This </em><span>is the hypocrisy that really makes no sense—it’s hypocrisy on top of hypocrisy, a nipple-clamp on a nipple-clamp.</span></p><p><span>I think we accept this ass-covering because we believe that it’s </span><em>possible</em><span>, and even </span><em>easy</em><span>, to mass-produce the improvement of humans. We think we can turn sex pests into good citizens via PowerPoint presentation. When we see those PowerPoints up close, of course, we go, “Oh no, not </span><em>these </em><span>PowerPoints. Some other PowerPoints, the ones that actually work.”</span></p><p><span>But are no PowerPoints that work. You cannot plonk someone in front of a computer screen for an hour and expect them to become a better person. Well-meaning researchers have tried way, way harder than that and gotten way, way less.</span></p></div><p>There are lots of reasons why we are continually surprised by how hard it is to change people, but there are three particularly nefarious ones that deserve closer inspection.</p><div><p><span>We perceive ourselves in full 4000K HD with Dolby Atmos Surround Sound, but when we perceive each other, it’s like we’re watching a VHS tape that someone made by using a Motorola Razr phone c. 2007 to record the screen on the back of an airplane seat.</span></p><p><span>Psychologists call this “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_distance" rel="">psychological distance</a><span>”: the further something is from me, the less detail it has in my imagination. So we are profoundly aware of how hard it would be to change ourselves, but only dimly aware of everything it would take to change someone else. You’re already kinda fuzzy anyway, so can’t you just be kinda fuzzy in a different way instead?</span></p><p><span>Here’s an example. I’m a weakling, a real beta boy with limited upper body strength.

So far, they have </span><a href="https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=acc5cec4-865f-434f-916e-99f043d57352%40redis" rel="">failed</a><span> to do that. And they’ve tried lots of stuff:</span></p><ul><li><p>Helping people set a goal to not be biased</p></li><li><p>Lecturing them about how great multiculturalism is</p></li><li><p>Telling them a story that counters their stereotypes (“Imagine a White guy attacks you and throws you in his trunk, and then a Black guy shows up and saves the day!”)</p></li><li><p>Making people play a virtual dodgeball game where all of their teammates are courteous Black players and all of their opponents are mean nasty White players</p></li><li><p>Showing them a bunch of pictures of Black faces with the word “GOOD” written next to them</p></li></ul><p>Some of these interventions changed people’s biases in the moment, but none of the effects lasted beyond 24 hours. And of course they didn’t! As soon as participants leave the lab, they go right back into the world that massaged those biases into the folds of their brains in the first place. You can’t permanently change implicit biases with 15 minutes of screentime, just like you can’t spray someone with a hose and expect them to stay wet forever.</p><p><span>This is part of why changing people is so surprisingly hard—no matter how much you focus on the person in front of you, you’ll never appreciate the million tiny influences that made them who they are and that keep them that way. If you really want to make someone different, you might have to change the TV they watch, the music they listen to, the things they learn in school, the friends they hang out with, the role models they look up to, etc., and if you do all that, congratulations, you’ve started what we call a </span><em>cult</em><span>. Which, unlike social scientists, do have a pretty good track record of changing people.</span></p><p>Most people’s theories of human behavior are just never gonna be tested, and so their hypotheses can be both wrong and immortal. For example, if you think the solution to political polarization is to drug Congress with magic mushrooms, then a) nobody’s ever going to prove you wrong, and b) I think I know which anti-drug program you got in high school.</p><p>On top of this, we’re all running our own tiny-N, p-hacked studies and then slathering the results in confirmation bias:</p><ul><li><p><span>“My kid does better when we feed him raw beef and read him </span><em>Ulysses</em><span>, so that’s what all schools should do, and the fact that this also happens to fit my personal and political aesthetics is merely a coincidence.”</span></p></li><li><p>“I gave my religion’s holy book to a person who was struggling and now they’re doing better, which is proof my religion is true.”</p></li><li><p>“Some famous CEOs were mean to their employees and got good results, so I should do that too, which is convenient because I am a jerk.”</p></li></ul><p>These itsy-bitsy confounded little pseudo-studies are more convincing to us than any “official” experiments precisely because they unfold before our own eyes. On the one hand, that’s fair—“official” experiments are so poor on average that you should consider them guilty until proven innocent. But doing low-quality uncontrolled social science in your own backyard is a good way to increase your convictions without increasing your evidence.</p><p><span>Even when there is reasonably good data, our hypotheses about how humans work are often so vague that they can withstand any attempts at falsification. Okay, so </span><em>this </em><span>emotions-based anti-drug intervention didn’t succeed, but maybe that’s because the instructors weren’t motivated enough, or it didn’t go on long enough, or they used the wrong kind of deep breathing technique, or they should have targeted fifth-graders instead of seventh-graders, etc., on and on, forever. If you can only think of all these critiques and exceptions after the fact, however, you at least have to admit you didn’t really know what you were talking about in the first place.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-144595148" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/how-to-get-7th-graders-to-smoke#footnote-3-144595148" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>The philosopher Michael Strevens </span><a href="https://www.strevens.org/scientia/" rel="">argues</a><span> that science requires humans to adopt an “alien mindset”—you have to ignore common sense, the wisdom of the ancients, the literal word of God, etc. Why would anyone toss out everything they know and instead try to learn things by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Redi" rel="">putting rotten meat in a jar</a><span>? Science took so long to develop, Strevens says, because it seemed </span><em>stupid</em><span>.</span></p><p>I say: we must become even stupider. If all of our intuitions, theories, and knowledge cause us to run programs that make tweens do more drugs—well, then, we oughta ditch our intuitions, theories, and knowledge!</p><div><p><span>Sufficiently stupid people would look at </span><a href="http://sexualharassmenttraining.com/" rel="">SexualHarassmentTraining.com</a><span> and ask, “Wait, how does this work? You show people walls of text and then ask them multiple choice questions and then they don’t sexually harass each other anymore?” They would wonder whether an imaginary dodgeball game could really make people less racist. They might question whether a couple deep-breathing exercises are enough to stop seventh graders from doing shots at a party.</span></p><p><span>It’s important to cultivate that kind ignorance, because every single person on Earth is at least a part-time people-changer. We want to raise our kids to be kind. We want to earn our boss’s respect. We would like our spouse to stop playing the “road trip playlist” that’s just a 10-hour loop of “Dreams” by The Cranberries and “Dreams” by Fleetwood Mac. We’ll never have large-N, preregistered, multi-site RCTs that can tell us how to do these things. We have to make our best guesses, but we also have to treat those guesses with enough skepticism that we notice when we guess wrong, so we can guess differently next time.</span></p><p><span>Some people are supposed to be </span><em>professional</em><span> people-changers, and so they carry a greater burden of proof and a sacred set of responsibilities. When you have the power to compel people to do things, you should be able to prove that your compulsions make people better off. It’s not enough to say, “Hey, I’m just doing stuff that everybody would agree is intuitive and reasonable,” because, as we’ve seen, intuitive and reasonable stuff often </span><em>hurts people</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>We can’t expect every well-meaning program to work. We know so little about how to help people that sometimes we’re going to screw it up, in which case our responsibility is to figure out what we did wrong. What we cannot do is accidentally turn tweens into binge-drinkers and then keep right on going as if nothing happened.</span></p><p><span>This is a thorny problem, but I know exactly how to solve it. I’m just waiting for the IRB to approve my application to run people over with a forklift.</span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

	CORVALLIS, Ore. – Today’s rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide increase is 10 times faster than at any other point in the past 50,000 years, researchers have found through a detailed chemical analysis of ancient Antarctic ice.</p>
<p>
	The findings, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provide important new understanding of abrupt climate change periods in Earth’s past and offer new insight into the potential impacts of climate change today.</p>
<p>
	“Studying the past teaches us how today is different. The rate of CO2 change today really is unprecedented,” said Kathleen Wendt, an assistant professor in Oregon State University’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and the study’s lead author.</p>
<p>
	“Our research identified the fastest rates of past natural CO2 rise ever observed, and the rate occurring today, largely driven by human emissions, is 10 times higher.”</p>
<p>
	Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is a greenhouse gas that occurs naturally in the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, it contributes to warming of the climate due to the greenhouse effect. In the past, the levels have fluctuated due to ice age cycles and other natural causes, but today they are rising because of human emissions.</p>
<p>
	Ice that built up in Antarctic over hundreds of thousands of years includes ancient atmospheric gasses trapped in air bubbles. Scientists use samples of that ice, collected by drilling cores up to 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) deep, to analyze the trace chemicals and build records of past climate. The U.S. National Science Foundation supported the ice core drilling and the chemical analysis used in the study.</p>
<p>
	Previous research showed that during the last ice age, which ended about 10,000 years ago, there were several periods where carbon dioxide levels appeared to jump much higher than the average. But those measurements were not detailed enough to reveal the full nature of the rapid changes, limiting scientists’ ability to understand what was occurring, Wendt said.</p>
<p>
	“You probably wouldn’t expect to see that in the dead of the last ice age,” she said. “But our interest was piqued, and we wanted to go back to those periods and conduct measurements at greater detail to find out what was happening.”</p>
<p>
	Using samples from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core, Wendt and colleagues investigated what was occurring during those periods. They identified a pattern that showed that these jumps in carbon dioxide occurred alongside North Atlantic cold intervals known as Heinrich Events that are associated with abrupt climate shifts around the world.</p>
<p>
	“These Heinrich Events are truly remarkable,” said <a href="https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/christo-buizert">Christo Buizert</a>, an associate professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and co-author of the study. “We think they are caused by a dramatic collapse of the North American ice sheet. This sets into motion a chain reaction that involves changes to the tropical monsoons, the Southern hemisphere westerly winds and these large burps of CO2 coming out of the oceans.”</p>
<p>
	During the largest of the natural rises, carbon dioxide increased by about 14 parts per million in 55 years. And the jumps occurred about once every 7,000 years or so. At today’s rates, that magnitude of increase takes only 5 to 6 years.</p>
<p>
	Evidence suggests that during past periods of natural carbon dioxide rise, the westerly winds that play an important role in the circulation of the deep ocean were also strengthening, leading to a rapid release of CO2 from the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>
	Other research has suggested that these westerlies will strengthen over the next century due to climate change. The new findings suggest that if that occurs, it will reduce the Southern Ocean’s capacity to absorb human-generated carbon dioxide, the researchers noted.</p>
<p>
	“We rely on the Southern Ocean to take up part of the carbon dioxide we emit, but rapidly increasing southerly winds weaken its ability to do so,” Wendt said.</p>
<p>
	Additional coauthors include Ed Brook, Kyle Niezgoda and Michael Kalk of Oregon State; Christoph Nehrbass-Ahles of the University of Bern in Switzerland and the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom; Thomas Stocker, Jochen Schmitt, Hubertus Fischer and Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern; Laurie Menviel of the University of New South Wales in Australia; James Rae of the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom; Juan Muglia of Argentina; David Ferreira of the University of Reading in the United Kingdom and Shaun Marcott of University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>

Licence for Terraform and other products, instead of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/?ref=thestack.technology"><u>MPL 2.0</u></a> that it previously used.

One of the limitation we had was the handling of primitive constructs from the standard library of Rust, like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or_default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Option::unwrap_or_default</a> or all other primitive functions. For each of these functions, we had to make a Coq definition to represent its behavior. This is both tedious and error prone.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, we worked on the translation of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">core</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alloc</a> crates of Rust using <code>coq-of-rust</code>. These are very large code bases, with a lot of unsafe or advanced Rust code. We present what we did to have a "best effort" translation of these crates. The resulting translation is in the following folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust/blob/main/CoqOfRust/alloc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoqOfRust/alloc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust/blob/main/CoqOfRust/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoqOfRust/core</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-run-">Initial run 🐥<a href="#initial-run-" aria-label="Direct link to Initial run 🐥" title="Direct link to Initial run 🐥">​</a></h2>
<p>An initial run of <code>coq-of-rust</code> on the <code>alloc</code> and <code>core</code> crates of Rust generated us two files of a few hundred thousands lines of Coq corresponding to the whole translation of these crates. This is a first good news, as it means the tool runs of these large code bases. However the generated Coq code does not compile, even if the errors are very rare (one every few thousands lines).</p>
<p>To get an idea, here is the size of the input Rust code as given by the <code>cloc</code> command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alloc</code>: 26,299 lines of Rust code</li>
<li><code>core</code>: 54,192 lines of Rust code</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that this code uses macros that we expand in our translation, the actual size that we have to translate is even bigger.</p>
<h2 id="splitting-the-generated-code-">Splitting the generated code 🪓<a href="#splitting-the-generated-code-" aria-label="Direct link to Splitting the generated code 🪓" title="Direct link to Splitting the generated code 🪓">​</a></h2>
<p>The main change we made was to split the output generated by <code>coq-of-rust</code> with one file for each input Rust file. This is possible because our translation is insensitive to the order of definitions and context-free. So, even if there are typically cyclic dependencies between the files in Rust, something that is forbidden in Coq, we can still split them.</p>
<p>We get the following sizes as output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alloc</code>: 54 Coq files, 171,783 lines of Coq code</li>
<li><code>core</code>: 190 Coq files, 592,065 lines of Coq code</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantages of having the code split are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is easier to read and navigate in the generated code</li>
<li>it is easier to compile as we can parallelize the compilation</li>
<li>it is easier to debug as we can focus on one file at a time</li>
<li>it is easier to ignore files that do not compile</li>
<li>it will be easier to maintain, as it is easier to follow the diff of a single file</li>
</ul>

<p>We had some bugs related to the collisions between module names. These can occur when we choose a name for the module for an <code>impl</code> block. We fixed these by adding more information in the module names to make them more unique, like the <code>where</code> clauses that were missing. For example, for the implementation of the <code>Default</code> trait for the <code>Mapping</code> type:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#[derive(Default)]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Mapping</span><span>&lt;</span><span>K</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>V</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>// ...</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>we were generating the following Coq code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Module</span><span> Impl_core_default_Default_for_dns_Mapping_K_V</span><span>.</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>(* ...trait implementation ... *)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>End</span><span> Impl_core_default_Default_for_dns_Mapping_K_V</span><span>.</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We now generate:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Module</span><span> Impl_core_default_Default_where_core_default_Default_K_where_core_default_Default_V_for_dns_Mapping_K_V</span><span>.</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>(* ... *)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>with a module name that includes the <code>where</code> clauses of the <code>impl</code> block, stating that both <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> should implement the <code>Default</code> trait.</p>
<p>Here is the list of files that do not compile in Coq, as of today:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alloc/boxed.v</code></li>
<li><code>core/any.v</code></li>
<li><code>core/array/mod.v</code></li>
<li><code>core/cmp/bytewise.v</code></li>
<li><code>core/error.v</code></li>
<li><code>core/escape.v</code></li>
<li><code>core/iter/adapters/flatten.v</code></li>
<li><code>core/net/ip_addr.v</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This represents 4% of the files. Note that in the files that compile there are some unhandled Rust constructs that are axiomatized, so this does not give the whole picture of what we do not support.</p>
<h2 id="example-">Example 🔎<a href="#example-" aria-label="Direct link to Example 🔎" title="Direct link to Example 🔎">​</a></h2>
<p>Here is the source code of the <code>unwrap_or_default</code> method for the <code>Option</code> type:</p>

<p>We prove that it is equivalent to the simpler functional code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Definition</span><span> unwrap_or_default </span><span>{</span><span>T </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Set</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>{</span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> core</span><span>.</span><span>simulations</span><span>.</span><span>default</span><span>.</span><span>Default</span><span>.</span><span>Trait T</span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>(</span><span>self </span><span>:</span><span> Self T</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    T </span><span>:=</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>match</span><span> self </span><span>with</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> None </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> core</span><span>.</span><span>simulations</span><span>.</span><span>default</span><span>.</span><span>Default</span><span>.</span><span>default </span><span>(</span><span>Self </span><span>:=</span><span> T</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> Some x </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> x</span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>end</span><span>.</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This simpler definition is what we use when verifying code. The proof of equivalence is in <a href="https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust/blob/main/CoqOfRust/core/proofs/option.v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoqOfRust/core/proofs/option.v</a>. In case the original source code changes, we are sure to capture these changes thanks to our proof. Because the translation of the <code>core</code> library was done automatically, we trust the generated definitions more than definitions that would be done by hand. However, there can still be mistakes or incompleteness in <code>coq-of-rust</code>, so we still need to check at proof time that the code makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>We can now work on the verification of Rust programs with more trust in our formalization of the standard library. Our next target is to simplify our proof process, which is still tedious. In particular, showing that simulations are equivalent to the original Rust code requires doing the name resolution, introduction of high-level types, and removal of the side-effects. We would like to split these steps.</p>

<p>(Published: 2017-11-11, Last update: 2018-01-07)</p>
<p><strong>The following analysis was performed on a S8 data line locator which replied to the hidden SMS command for version query (<code>*3646655*</code>) with:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Ver=MTK6261M.T16.17.01.10
build=2017/01/10 17:33</code></pre>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A while back Joe Fitz tweeted about the <em>S8 data line locator</em><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. He referred to it as “Trickle down espionage” due to its reminiscence of NSA spying equipment.</p>
<p>The <em>S8 data line locator</em> is a GSM listening and location device hidden inside the plug of a standard USB data/charging cable. It supports the 850, 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz GSM frequencies.</p>
<p>Its core idea is very similar to the COTTONMOUTH product line by the NSA/CSS <span>[1]</span> in which an RF device is hidden inside a USB plug. Those hidden devices are referred to as implants.</p>
<p>The device itself is marketed as a location tracker usable in cars, where a thief would not be able to identify the USB cable as a location tracking device. Its malicious use-cases can, however, not be denied. Especially since it features no GPS making its location reporting very coarse (1.57 km deviation in my tests). It can, e.g., be called to listen to a live audio feed from a small microphone within the device, as well as programmed to call back if the sound level surpasses a 45 dB threshold. The fact that the device can be repackaged in its sliding case, after configuring it, i.e.&nbsp;inserting a SIM, without any noticeable marks to the packaging suggests its use-case: covert espionage.</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/00_packaging.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/00_packaging.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator sliding case packaging."></a></p>
<h2 id="s8-data-line-locator-capabilities">S8 data line locator capabilities</h2>
<p>The S8 data line locator has several eavesdropping, espionage and spying capabilities. A SMS message log could look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_00_cmds.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_00_cmds.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator hidden commands."></a></p>
<h3 id="listen-in">Listen in</h3>
<p>Calling the S8 data line locator for 10 seconds establishes a call and allows you to listen to the microphone feed from the device.</p>
<h3 id="call-back">Call back</h3>
<p>Sending <code>1111</code> via SMS to the device enables voice activated call back. It is acknowledged via the following SMS reply:</p>
<pre><code>DT: Set voice monitoring, voice callback and sound sensitivity:400</code></pre>
<p>Once the audio level goes above 40 dB the device calls back the number that send the <code>1111</code> command.</p>
<p>Sending <code>0000</code> disables the audio triggered call back. It is replied by:</p>
<pre><code>DT: Voice monitoring cancelled successfully.</code></pre>
<h3 id="query-location">Query location</h3>
<p>Accoding to the manual sending ‘dw’ via SMS to the device yields a reply SMS with the location. This reply is in the form:</p>
<pre><code>Loc:Street, ZIP City, Country
http://gpsui.net/u/xxxx Battery: 100%</code></pre>
<p>The ‘xxxx’ are replaced with characters ‘0-9,A-Z,a-z’ and the <code>Street, ZIP City, Country</code> line with the appropriate street, ZIP, city and country. The link to http://gpsui.net can be accessed without authorization. It forwards to Google maps.</p>
<p>The location was never more accurate than 1.57 km off.</p>
<p><strong>During the query the device will use a mobile data connection to an unknown endpoint (presumably gpsui.net). This is confirmed by a “MMS/Internet” charge by my provider. My provider does not discern MMS and Internet, but it is save to assume there is an Internet connection established during location query.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This issue was the stepping stone for this analysis. Because the device sends unknown data to an unknown third party it can not - at least with a clear conscious - be used in, e.g., a penetration test. You simply can not use a potentially pre-owned tool.</strong></p>
<p>I therefore tried to analyze and eliminate this phone-home “feature”.</p>

<p>To gain access to the devices innards we first tear of the metal shield of the USB connector: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_00_teardown.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_00_teardown.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator removing USB connector shield."></a></p>
<p>Next, we remove the plastic cover: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_03_teardown.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/04_03_teardown.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator removing USB connector shield."></a></p>
<h2 id="chips">Chips</h2>
<p>After opening the device we can identify the chips:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/06_02_chipid.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/06_02_chipid.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator board with MT6261MA and RDA 6625e chips."></a></p>
<p>It features:</p>
<ul>
<li>MediaTek MT6261MA: Low budget chip often used in cheap Chinese smartwatches. No official documentation nor information about the chip is available from MediaTek.</li>
<li>RDA 6626e: “a high-power, high-efficiency quad-band front-end Module […] designed for GSM850, EGSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900 handheld digital cellular equipment.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>
<p>So far I could identify 3 different avenues to connect to the device:</p>
<h3 id="usb-passthrough">USB (passthrough)</h3>
<p>The USB A-connector and the Micro-B cable are not connected to the MT6261MA. They merely pass the signal from one to the other:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_00_meter.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_00_meter.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator USB passthrough."></a></p>
<h3 id="uart">UART</h3>
<p>The next connection is a UART:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_02_meter.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_02_meter.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator UART."></a></p>
<p>Interfacing with it yields, approximately 3 seconds after booting the device:</p>

<p>However, the output stops there. Input to the device is ignored.</p>
<p>It is likely there exist a different firmware version that accepts AT modem commands<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The boot banner of that alternate firmware references “ZhiPu”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> (some file names of the FAT12 in the firmware flash of my device contain this string as well, so the device firmware is likely related to that other firmware).</p>

<h3 id="usb-mtk">USB (MTK)</h3>
<p>The DP and DM pads on the USB connector are not connected to the D+ and D- lines of the USB connector. However, the V and GND pads are. The DP and DM pads are instead routed to the MT6261MA processor as illustrated here:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_01_meter.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/07_01_meter.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator MTK USB."></a></p>
<p>Next, a USB cable must be soldered to these connectors as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/09_usb.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/09_usb.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator MTK USB soldered."></a></p>
<p>The device will then be recognized as an MediaTek phone USB endpoint with the following data:</p>
<p><code>ID 0e8d:0003 MediaTek Inc. MT6227 phone</code></p>
<p>This is often called the “MTK boot repair”, “MTK DM DP flash”, etc. It will allow us to interface with the device and dump the firmware ROM and flash.</p>
<h2 id="dumping-firmware">Dumping firmware</h2>
<p>To dump the firmware I use the open source Fernvale research OS <span>[2]</span>. It was initially targeted for the MT6260 processor. It has, however, been ported to the MT6261 and also works on the MT6261MA.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-and-building-fernlys-mt6261-branch">Obtaining and building fernly’s MT6261 branch</h2>
<p>A suitable fork of fernly by Urja “urjaman” Rannikko can be obtained and build as follows:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/urjaman/fernly
git clone https://github.com/robertfoss/setup_codesourcery.git
sudo setup_codesourcery/setup.sh
/usr/local/bin/codesourcery-arm-2014.05.sh
cd fernly
git checkout fernly6261
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-
exit
cp 95-fernvale-simple.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/.</code></pre>
<h2 id="dumping-rom">Dumping ROM</h2>
<p>To dump the flash we run:</p>
<pre><code>echo "data = [" &gt; rom.py
fernly/build/fernly-usb-loader /dev/fernvale fernly/build/dump-rom-usb.bin &gt;&gt; rom.py
echo "
]
f = open('rom.bin','wb')
for s in data:
  f.write(chr(int(s,16)))
f.close()
" &gt;&gt; rom.py
python rom.py</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>rom.bin</code> will now (at least according to the fernly repository documentation) contain the devices ROM.</p>
<h2 id="dumping-flash">Dumping flash</h2>
<p>To dump the flash of the device we need to patch flashrom as follows:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom
cd flashrom/
git checkout c8305e1dee66cd69bd8fca38bff2c8bf32924306
patch -p0 &lt; ../fernly/flashrom-fernvale.patch
# manually fix Makefile.rej to complete patching</code></pre>
<p>The patch does not cleanly apply so you need to fix the rejected <code>Makefile</code> (<code>Makefile.rej</code>) manually yourself.</p>
<p>Once this was done we can first load the fernly firmware into the devices RAM via:</p>
<pre><code>fernly/build/fernly-usb-loader -w /dev/fernvale fernly/build/stage1.bin fernly/build/firmware.bin</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can use the <code>fernvale_spi</code> programmer we patched into flashrom.</p>
<p>We first let it recognize the flash via:</p>
<pre><code>flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale</code></pre>
<p>And then read the flash via:</p>
<pre><code>flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale -c "MX25L3205(A)" --read flash.dat</code></pre>
<p><code>flash.dat</code> will now contain the devices flash memory.</p>
<h2 id="writing-flash-attempt">Writing flash attempt</h2>
<p>Writing the flash can be performed via:</p>
<pre><code>flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale -c "MX25L3205(A)" --write flash.dat</code></pre>
<p>However, the flash seems to be block protected and the block protect bits can not be disabled by flashrom. I have not (yet) found a way to disable the block protect.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-device">Alternative device</h4>
<pre><code>$ flashrom/flashrom --programmer fernvale_spi:dev=/dev/fernvale

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Mostly for my personal education I did some more analysis then the obligatory firmware dump.</p>
<h2 id="sim-sniffing-via-simtrace">SIM sniffing (via SIMtrace)</h2>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/02_simtrace.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/02_simtrace.jpg" alt="SIM sniffing against S8 data line locator via SIMtrace."></a></p>
<p>First, I sniffed the communication between the device and the SIM. Interestingly, it accessed all records of the telephone book and SMS storage. More specifically it accesses the following files, which are not needed to provide the services rendered by the device itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADF
<ul>
<li>EF(ECC)</li>
<li>EF(EXT2)</li>
<li>EF(SMS)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DF(TELECOM)
<ul>
<li>DF(PHONEBOOK)
<ul>
<li>EF(ADN)</li>
<li>EF(ANRA1)</li>
<li>EF(SMS)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Other SIM accesses seems to be normal.</p>
<p>This is probably not an elaborate scheme to harvest phone numbers and send them to China, but rather the way the default manufactured SIM code was implemented and it was never trimmed down to the needs of this device. Nevertheless, I found it interesting seeing how the device is accessing virtually everything on the SIM.</p>
<h2 id="gprs-sniffing-attempt-via-openbts">GPRS sniffing attempt (via OpenBTS)</h2>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/03_000_openbts.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/03_000_openbts.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator connected to OpenBTS."></a></p>
<p>Next, I tried to sniff the Internet traffic to figure out what is send to whom via the mobile data connection. To this end, I used a Ettus B100 with OpenBTS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the S8 data line locator did not connect to the GPRS. This caused the following alternative response to the <code>dw</code> location command:</p>
<pre><code>Loc:Please link:http://gpsui.net/smap.php?lac=1000&amp;cellid=10&amp;c=901&amp;n=70&amp;v=7100 Battery:67%</code></pre>
<h2 id="flash-contents">Flash contents</h2>
<p>The most interesting things could be found in the dumped flash.</p>
<h3 id="os">OS</h3>
<p>Strings in the <code>flash.dat</code> suggest the device is probably running Nucleus RTOS:</p>
<pre><code>$ strings -a flash.dat

<p>Other strings that may help identify the OS are:</p>

<h3 id="fat12-filesystems">FAT12 filesystems (?)</h3>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In my original write up I missed the flash translation layer, hence the FAT12 filesystem was corrupted. Thanks to Bjoern Kerler (<a href="https://twitter.com/viperbjk">@viperbjk</a>) for pointing this out to me. I will work on descrambling the flash and update once I have it working.</p>
<p>For the time being here is my original try at extracting the files from the file system:</p>
<p>Searching the <code>flash.dat</code> for the FAT12 file systems that are supposedly present in on MediaTek phones, we get:</p>

<p>However, two of the partitions do not appear to be valid FAT12 file systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ fls -o 5646 flash.dat -f fat12

$ fls -o 5826 flash.dat -f fat12

$ fls -o 5853 flash.dat -f fat12

<p>And the middle FAT12 block seems to be corrupted as well, i.e.&nbsp;only orphan files:</p>
<pre><code>$ fls -o 5826 flash.dat -rp -f fat12

<p>An attempt was made to extract the files:</p>
<pre><code>fls -o 5826 flash.dat -Frp -f fat12 | while read line; do
    path=$(echo "$line" | awk -F':' '{print $2}')
    mkdir -p $(dirname $path);
    icat -o 5826 flash.dat $(echo "$line" | grep -oE "[0-9]+" | head -n1) &gt; $path
done</code></pre>
<p>But most files are empty. The results are also very inconsistent, i.e., when changing SIM cards there are significant changes to the files listed by The Sleuthkit. This indicates that those are either not FAT12 partitions or a modified FAT12 variant.</p>
<p>Again as stated at the start of this section I’m missing the flash translation layer (FTL). There are proprietary tools which can do the FTL descrambling for you.</p>
<p>But to keep this whole writeup open source, further analysis was done using hexdump.</p>

<p>The flash also contained some configuration data. First, the IMSI of the inserted SIM and the number that is used to remote control the device could be found in the flash:</p>

<p>In the above flash segment you can also see a reference to <code>gpsui.net</code>. This is presumably the remote server which is contacted to turn the MCC, MNC, LAI and CID codes into street, city and country information as well as the link to gpsui.net which forwards to Google maps. However, because writing to the flash could not be achieved this hypothesis could not be confirmed.</p>

<p>Eventually, there was a small find potentially making this effort worthwhile. Searching the <code>flash.dat</code> for the <code>dw</code>,<code>1111</code> and <code>0000</code> commands reveals more hidden commands:</p>

<p>However, most of those commands do not function correctly. It seems the devices firmware is shared among several such location tracking and listening devices, e.g., there are commands referring to LEDs and a TF card, both of which this device do no feature, however, other devices available online do.</p>
<p>An incomplete list of the found commands and there replies is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>help</code>: replies with the following commands:
<ul>
<li><code>dw</code>: Locate</li>
<li><code>qqq</code>: Device binding</li>

<li><code>*3646655*</code>: queries for version information</li>
<li><code>*reboot*</code>: reboots the device</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly the reply strings could not be found in the flash in plaintext. This suggests that some of the data is compressed.</p>
<p>The message log of me trying some of the found hidden commands to populate the above list is as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_01_cmds.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_01_cmds.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator hidden commands."></a></p>
<p>It seems that we can use <code>esioaddr</code> to change the address used to lock up the location information. However, no connection to a given domain nor IP is actually made. The device will simply report <code>the addr invalid</code> in the location report.</p>
<p>The <code>server</code> command sets a different server. Changing it does not result in <code>the addr invalid</code> responses, as can be seen from this second message log:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_14_cmds.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/10_14_cmds.jpg" alt="S8 data line locator hidden commands."></a></p>
<h2 id="provider-call-logs-and-itemized-bill">Provider call logs and itemized bill</h2>
<p>Because the GPRS sniffing failed I resort to the billing of my provider to further analyze the communication habits of the S8 data line locator.</p>
<p>Obviously reply SMS are billed. More interesting is the Internet access patterns.</p>
<h3 id="dw-or-loc-commands-and-during-idle"><code>dw</code> or <code>loc</code> commands and during idle</h3>
<p>During location queries the device will use “MMS/Internet” service. The following is a segment in which first repeated location queries were performed, then the devices was left idle:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_00_provider_logs.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_00_provider_logs.jpg" alt="Provider call logs and itemized bill during location queries."></a></p>
<p>Even during idle the device sometimes uses the “MMS/Internet” service.</p>
<p>Even though I deactivated all tracking features that I may have activated during my previous testing, I can not be 100 % sure that this is not something that I activated, maybe while stumbling through the gpsui.net website. However, I regardless of whether I activated this “feature” or not, I do not want it and would like to know what data is actually send and how to deactivate it.</p>
<h2 id="gpsui.net">gpsui.net</h2>
<p>Going deeper into the gpsui.net website would probably result in a new writeup in itself. It is a very big surveillance hub, just replace the xxxx in http://gpsui.net/u/xxxx with some letters and numbers and you can see random people’s locations.</p>
<p>The website also makes a reference to ZhiPu:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/12_gpsui.net.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/12_gpsui.net.jpg" alt="gpsui.net"></a></p>
<p>It seems this is the company that makes these trackers.</p>
<p>You can get your credentials for login by texting <code>aqb</code> to your S8 data line monitor. The username as well as the password are 6 digit numbers. They are also located in the flash right before the IMSI.</p>
<p>The web interface allows access to several features, which may or may not work as I’m not interested in them and hence not tested all of them:</p>
<h3 id="interface">Interface</h3>
<p>The plain interface after login looks like this: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_00_interface.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_00_interface.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: Interface"></a></p>
<p>I panned the map into the ocean to hide my location. The location is pinpointed on the map by a little car and a pop up containing the GPS data and date of the last location update.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>You can change various settings: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_01_setting.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_01_setting.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: settings"></a></p>
<h3 id="alarms">Alarms</h3>
<p>You can setup alarms: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_02_alarm.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_02_alarm.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: alarms"></a></p>
<h3 id="real-time-location-tracking">Real time location tracking</h3>
<p>You can enable real time location tracking: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_03_rtloc.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_03_rtloc.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: real time location"></a></p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Interestingly, the web interface allows to playback past location queries, as can be seen here: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_04_history.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_04_history.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: history"></a></p>
<p>I find this particularity disturbing because in the original manual of the S8 data line locator there is no mention of the login credentials nor a way to get them. Also I did not expect a location query history to be stored somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="fence">Fence</h3>
<p>It also allows to set a geo fence: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_05_fence.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_05_fence.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: fence"></a></p>
<h3 id="push-commands">Push commands</h3>
<p>Next, it allows you to push command to the device: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_06_push_cmd.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_06_push_cmd.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: push commands"></a></p>
<p>This means anyone with access to your gpsui.net login credentials can control your device. A device which original packaging nor manual make any reference to said website.</p>
<h3 id="management">Management</h3>
<p>You can also add your fleet of devices into one account for simplified management: <a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_07_mgnmt.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/13_07_mgnmt.jpg" alt="gpsui.net: management"></a></p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>After publishing this write up, Vangelis Stykas (<a href="https://twitter.com/evstykas">@evstykas</a>) found a bunch of Insecure Direct Object References with Authorization bypass through user-controlled key vulnerabilities leading to Horizontal escalation of privilege (one user can view/modify information of all other 615,817 accounts) in gpsui.net.</p>
<p>So my initial suspicions about gpsui.net were correct: you do not want your data to be send there.</p>
<p>We then also looked at some other (GPS) location tracking web services. What we found was mildly concerning and you can read about it here: <a href="https://0x0.li/trackmageddon/">https://0x0.li/trackmageddon/</a></p>
<p>I just want to point out here that a normal user is (at least as far as I know) never informed about the login credentials to the above website.</p>
<p>Neither is the user informed that the location queries are logged and stored there. Nor that the device can be remote controlled from there.</p>
<h2 id="detection">Detection</h2>
<p>When sending data the S8 data line locator can be detected with a CC308+ (a cheap Chinese RF detector):</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/01_cc308+.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/01_cc308+.jpg" alt="CC308+ detecting the S8 data line locator."></a></p>
<p>The S8 data line locator seems to be badly shielded. A location request via the <code>dw</code> command causes noticeable electronic noise by the device. It seems in general to cause all sorts of RF interference.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>While I did not (yet) succeed with my original goal to disable the mobile data phone home “feature’, it was nevertheless a fun exercise and hopefully someone finds this useful or at least educational.</p>
<p>Future work needs to be done on several things:</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>I was not able yet to write new firmware via flashrom because I was not able to disable block protection on the flash, yet. Maybe a different avenue for flashing new firmware could be the SPFlash tool<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and/or the Flash tool. However, that would not be open source. <strong>If you are able to flash your S8 data line locator please contact me with details!</strong></p>
<p>Further, I tried to capture the GPRS data connection of the device, but was unable to do so. It would not use GPRS when connected to my network. Currently, I do not know how the APN is configured. The SIM trace does not indicate that the EF(ACL) is ever accessed. However, as I found the correct APN configuration stored in the devices flash, this suggests the device acquires this information via a setup SMS by the service provider.</p>
<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<p>Dremel the board smaller, e.g., you don’t need the USB connector. This way the S8 data line locator could be turned into a “modular” bug that could be placed where ever there is a 5 V 1 A power source.</p>
<h2 id="other-people-working-on-this">Other people working on this</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dmxinajeansuit">@dmxinajeansuit</a>: <a href="http://n0.lol/em/s8">http://n0.lol/em/s8</a></p>
<h2 id="appendix-fuck-up">Appendix: Fuck up</h2>
<p>No writeup would be complete without at least one fuck up. So here it is:</p>
<p>While using the S8 data line locator with OpenBTS I provisioned imaginary numbers. When switching SIM cards I forgot to turn of the voice activated callback.</p>
<p>So long story short, some guy with the number 3333333 listend in on me for 2 minutes:</p>
<p><a href="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_01_provider_logs.jpg"><img src="https://ha.cking.ch/s8_data_line_locator/images/11_01_provider_logs.jpg" alt="Provider call log fail."></a></p>
<p>The number appears to be some sort of “service” number, hence it was an expensive call. But more importantly I did not notice this until I reviewed the logs!</p>
<p>So my resume on these little hardware espionage implants: <strong>They are stealthy and dangerous as fuck!</strong></p>
<h2 id="appendix-video">Appendix: Video</h2>

			<p><span data-contrast="auto">What comes after repealing parking mandates? Lots of newly legal homes. Studies from two cities observed that in the years following reform, </span><span data-contrast="auto">60 to 70 percent of new homes would previously have been illegal to build.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The new data add to the heap of evidence that parking mandates—local rules that ban new homes and businesses unless they have a pre-determined number of off-street parking spaces—are a binding constraint on housing construction. While only a few buildings opted out of providing parking entirely, most new homes in the studies ultimately benefited from the increased flexibility.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It isn’t surprising,” said researcher C. J. Gabbe, who authored one of the studies. According to Gabbe, homebuilders have been saying for a long time that demand for off-street parking was lower than what zoning rules required.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Both of these cities’ policy changes provided a natural experiment for measuring the effects of parking policy.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It’s impossible, really, to tie a specific code change to changes in the market,” explained Brennan Staley, a strategic advisor for Seattle’s Office of Planning and Community Development. Other local regulations, housing prices, and international finance markets all play a part in the real estate market. Michael Hubner, who works on long range planning in Seattle, agreed: “It’s very difficult to point to a causal relationship.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What is clear to Hubner is that the market chose to use the flexibility the city began offering. Not just on the margins, but by a lot. During the first five years after Seattle’s reform, a total of 35,388 new homes in Seattle ended up benefiting from the freedom to not build excess parking. Today, those homes account for 9.4 percent of the city’s entire housing stock.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Staley pointed out other benefits of the flexible code. “It’s not just the supply of those units that may be increased, but also that there are cheaper units because they didn’t have parking,” he said. One parking space can add </span><a href="https://www.reinventingparking.org/2015/06/how-much-does-one-parking-spot-add-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">over $200</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to monthly rents.

Seattle researchers estimated that at $30,000 per parking space, builders collectively saved $537 million in expenses that would have been passed on to future tenants.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In Seattle, whose reforms were concentrated in the most urban parts of the city, new buildings provided 40 percent less parking than would have been required before the reform.&nbsp;While that sounds like a dramatic drop, the change merely right-sized parking to match existing demand. In fact, it was exactly in line with a separate 2012 study that had observed 40 percent of the parking spaces in King County, where Seattle is located, </span><a href="https://metro.kingcounty.gov/programs-projects/right-size-parking/pdf/rsp-final-report-8-2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">never get used</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The 2020 study of Seattle also found reason to believe that parking flexibility would be useful in other parts of town, too. Forty-three percent of buildings in Seattle still subject to parking mandates built the minimum number of spaces required, suggesting that these projects might have opted to build more homes per parking space if allowed. That also suggests that an unknown number of homes would exist today if not for the parking mandates still in place.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">For most cities, the chilling effects of parking mandates remain largely invisible. Few builders end up taking on the risk and expense of requesting a variance from zoning codes. But thanks to these vanguard cities, the significance of parking reform is finally coming to light.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Far from affecting just a handful of buildings, these studies suggest that a wide array of housing projects would use flexibility around parking minimums if given the opportunity. For cities and states searching for solutions to their own housing shortages, eliminating parking mandates is a simple action that seems likely to help create a lot of new homes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

However, Google barred her from sharing her own content.</p>



<p data-experiment="{&quot;widget&quot;:true}">“You cannot share this item because it has been flagged as inappropriate,” read a pop-up when she tried to share her work. Those who already had access to Renee’s work on Google Docs were told “You no longer have permission to view this document. If you believe this is an error, contact the document owner,” through a pop-up message.</p><!--$--><!--/$-->

<p data-experiment="{&quot;widget&quot;:true}">Since Renee’s work is for artistic purposes, it shouldn’t technically go against Google’s guidelines. Wired also reports that Renee is not alone in getting blocked from sharing her work. </p>

<p data-experiment="{&quot;widget&quot;:true}">Similar incidents were reported back in 2017, when Google started locking users out of their content for violating its policy. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an old Indian parable, six blind men each touch a different part of an elephant. They disagree about what the elephant must look like: Is it smooth or rough? Is it like a snake (so thinks the man touching the trunk) or a fan (as the man touching the ear proposes)? If the blind men had combined their insights, they might have been able to give a correct account of the nature of the elephant. Instead, they end up fighting.</p>
<p>For decades, topologists have hoped to avoid falling into a similar trap. They thought they could characterize mathematical shapes by synthesizing numerous local measurements. But newly discovered, paradoxically curved spaces show that this isn’t always possible. “Things can be much more wild than what we thought,” said <a href="https://cvgmt.sns.it/person/2687/">Elia Bruè</a> of Bocconi University in Italy, who worked with two other mathematicians to demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Topologists stretch and compress the shapes they study. An infinitely thin rubber band, from a topological perspective, is equivalent to a circle, because you can easily deform it into a circular shape. Topologists tend to characterize shapes according to their global properties: Do they have holes, like a doughnut? Do they go on forever, like an infinite plane, or are they “compact” like the surface of a sphere? Do their “straight” lines go on indefinitely — making them what mathematicians call “complete” — or are there dead ends?</p>
<p>But as with the elephant in the parable, it can be hard to directly perceive the global nature of topological shapes. And so mathematicians want to understand their relationship to local geometric properties, like curvature. What can you say about a shape’s global topology, given information about how it curves at every point?</p>
<p>In 1968, <a href="https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~jack/">John Milnor</a>, a renowned mathematician then at Princeton University, conjectured that an average sense of a complete shape’s curvature was enough to tell us that it couldn’t have infinitely many holes. For the next 50 years, many results supported his claim. “You were tempted to believe it was true, because it was true in so many realistic cases,” said <a href="https://math.nyu.edu/people/profiles/CHEEGER_Jeff.html">Jeff Cheeger</a> of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. “And how in God’s name could you construct a counterexample to it?”</p>
<p>In this area of mathematics, said <a href="https://www.math.utoronto.ca/vtk/">Vitali Kapovitch</a> of the University of Toronto, “the Milnor conjecture was probably the biggest open problem.”</p>
<p>And so in 2020, Bruè and two colleagues set out to prove it. They ended up <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15347">finding a counterexample instead</a> — and built an entirely new kind of topological shape in the process. “It’s fantastic work,” Cheeger said. “A landmark.”</p>
<h2><strong>A Holey Grail of Topology</strong></h2>
<p>To understand Milnor’s conjecture, it helps to first consider how topologists and geometers think about curvature.</p>
<p>Both study manifolds — spaces that look flat when you zoom in on them. A tiny ant on the surface of a sphere, doughnut or other two-dimensional manifold will perceive its immediate neighborhood to be no different from a two-dimensional plane. But if the ant moves a little bit in any direction, it might notice that the space begins to shift, or curve. The idea of a locally flat manifold generalizes easily into higher dimensions. But curvature is tougher to define.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the simplest case: a one-dimensional object such as a circle. Surprisingly, these one-dimensional spaces cannot, in a mathematical sense, be intrinsically curved. A one-dimensional geometer walking along a circle, unable to perceive more than one dimension, would think she was traveling in a straight line — and would be surprised to find herself retracing her steps.</p>
<p>But if you embed a circle in a two-dimensional plane, it’s apparent that it has constant, positive extrinsic curvature. (The relevant distinction here is between intrinsic and extrinsic curvature: what you can see if you’re stuck inside the space, versus what you can see from outside it.)</p>
<p>Smaller circles bend more quickly as you move around them, and therefore have higher extrinsic curvature; bigger circles have lower curvature. (A straight line, in this sense, is like an infinitely big circle. Its curvature is zero, indicating that it’s completely flat.) We can also apply this definition to more complicated shapes that have changing curvature, by considering how big a circle you would need to match the shape at any given point. In this way, curvature is a local property: Every point on a manifold has an associated curvature.</p>
<p>For a surface — a two-dimensional manifold — there are many ways to place circles so that they match the surface’s curves. At a given point, you can measure curvature in any direction by placing an appropriately sized circle in that direction. But, surprisingly, it’s possible to define the surface’s curvature at that point with just one number. If you find the directions that give you the biggest and smallest curvature values, and multiply those values together, you get a number called the Gaussian curvature. This number summarizes information about how the surface bends in a useful way. Even more surprisingly, the Gaussian curvature turns out to be an intrinsic property: It doesn’t depend on any higher-dimensional background space the surface might be placed into. In this sense, paradoxically, cylinders are not intrinsically curved, though spheres are.</p>

<p>I discovered a genius online. Just look at <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22Jodie+Chiffey%22">all her accomplishments</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jodie is a cross-functional 3D designer and blogger. She has special interests in open source 3D printing for R&amp;D and has spent a lot of time at different projects across the globe to learn more about 3D printing. Most of what she has learned is from hands-on experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey is a blogger, and mom who loves nothing more than testing out the latest grills, gadgets, and outdoor cooking tech. As passionate about food as she is about family, Jodie loves spending time outdoors and is always the one found hovering over the grill at parties, camping trips, and local community events.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie discovered her passion for grilling when she realized how much filler she was able to eliminate from her diet by grilling. So, she began to devote herself to learning more about grilling and mastering her grilling technique. Now, she spends most of her time outdoors grilling non-processed foods and enjoying fresh food on her plate.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Mellifluent Performer at Guitar Space - Jodie fell in love with the guitar at a young age, but has hit a lot of bumps in the road with her journey. She knows all of the frustrations that come with learning the instrument without any formal lessons. But, she pushed through all of those challenges and she’s now here to teach other people too. If you’re looking for advice that’ll stick with you for a lifetime, Jodie’s here to share everything she knows. (mattnote: also lol at “Mellifluent” —&nbsp;ESL spam disease slipping in there)</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey loves the outdoors. If you aren’t sure where to find her, check the nearest dirt trail. She loves being outdoors and spends a good deal of time reviewing products like clothing, footwear, and other outdoor gear.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie is a full-time blogger who reviews a lot of the products for us. She writes many of our backpacking gear reviews, outdoor skills advice, and information, and helps visitors find the best destinations for backpacking, camping, hiking, and a lot more.</p></li>
<li><p>If Jodie’s friends have a travel or outdoors question, they know who to ask and that’s why we featured on our website. Now you can get the same great advice her friends enjoy, so you know where to go and what gear to take with you.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Travel Lover at RV Pioneers- Jodie Chiffey enjoys the outdoors. She goes mountain biking and loves spending time in nature and what better way to get there than to go in an RV? She shares her information here on RV Pioneers.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie knows quite a bit about beer and brewing it. From different types of hops and how they will affect your brew to her own opinion on various craft brews on the market. Jodie isn’t afraid to bring you her opinion on a new brew here at Beertannica, along with helping you decide if an ingredient or beer is the one for you. Her comprehensive guides will answer all your questions and more!</p></li>
<li><p>As a fellow business owner and business strategist, Jodie shares valuable insight into the strategies and tactics business owners can use to increase their growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie’s run through a lot of shoes. After all, she’s a competitive racer! She understands all of the important features of an ideal running shoe and the biomechanics of the feet of different kinds of runners. You’ll be surprised to learn that Jodie doesn’t have a degree or diploma in athletic shoes; she’s just passionate about them and owns more than fifty pairs of running shoes herself. She’s dedicated her life to studying athletic shoes in detail and writing about them.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie has been a certified personal trainer for several years now and has a passion for wellness, health, fitness like no other. She’s been educating herself on nutrition since she was in high school. His boyfriend is a professional herbalist and food healer, so she takes the health and wellness discussions into the homefront. She uses and tests health products, protein supplements personally and shares her insights on topics such as protein, diets, muscle recovery, muscle building, supplements, and naturally-sourced products.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie is a nutrition and health expert who owns over 50 pairs of athletic shoes and puts them to good use. She is always looking for a new healthy recipe, loves juicing and tests new products at home, and reports back to us here at Alt Protein. Jodie’s articles and recipes can also be found on her successful blog called The Juice Chief.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey understands how frustrating it can be to sort your way through long pieces of boring content just to try to get a simple explanation of the digital topic you’re looking to learn about. That’s why she’s here to break down all of the complex topics, to help you learn, understand, and grow in your own digital life. She wants to be there to give you all of the information you need to know to make your own personal decisions in regards to the digital topics you’re bringing into your life!</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Jodie is an avid traveler who loves camping and hiking. Why do you love mountain biking? I’ve had two separate passions for quite a long time - cycling and hiking. Whenever I was planning to spend some time outdoors, I had to decide which one to choose. It all made perfect sense when I discovered mountain biking, a beautiful blend of both of my favorite activities with the added value of adrenaline. What is your budget bike pick? If I were looking for a budget-friendly bike these days, I would undoubtedly go with GT Aggressor Expert. It’s super comfortable and lots of fun to ride. Nevertheless, Giant has some great entry-level mountain bikes these days too. What is your splurge bike pick? If I had an endless budget, I would probably buy a Santa Cruz 5010 - ideally in the exclusive X01 AXS RSV Carbon CC configuration. It’s one of the best bicycles I have had the chance to ride so far. What’s your favorite trail that you’ve ridden? Last summer, I enjoyed some tremendous single trails in the Austrian Alps around Nassfeld. Short but spicy Yannick Trail was probably my favorite. It was pretty demanding, and the views were truly priceless.</p></li>
<li><p>Jodie Chiffey - Jodie Chiffey spends a lot of time helping people figure out how to get the perfect yard. With so many variants from climate, soil type, to the amount of rainfall, she researches and helps Turf and Till readers choose the best products for their needs. Why are you giving advice on Turf and Till? After spending three and a half years transforming my yard from a generic underestimated wasteland into the green haven of my dreams, I have felt two contradictory emotions: relief and sadness. I have realized that I will miss all the research, consideration, and hard work and started looking for new ways to approach this topic and make it a permanent part of my life. That was when I started helping others to fulfill their landscape-related dreams too. Since then, I have worked on numerous exciting projects and gained valuable experience. I see writing for Turf and Till as a natural continuation of my work in this field. Moreover, it is also an excellent opportunity to give back to the online community that has taught me a lot in my beginnings. What is your favorite part of landscaping? My favorite part is turning a blueprint into a reality. I am a huge overthinker, so planning is the most exciting yet also the most demanding and frustrating part of every project for me. When I am finally satisfied with the plan and can watch it turn into a real landscape, someone’s garden, or yard, it is the most gratifying moment I know. If you had to give one piece of advice to someone fixing up their yard, what would it be? Don’t be afraid to think big. There is always space for downgrades and compromises later, but don’t settle with any of it before you even start. If I earned a dollar for each “impossible” idea I have seen turning into a reality, I would be very rich by now.</p></li>

<p>of course it’s just a huge affiliate link bot farm network. There are a dozen sites with “Jodie Chiffey” as primary author each with dozens of pages about “The Top 10 X For Y!” each with low effort summaries and affiliate links everywhere polluting tons of search results.</p>
<p>also, these “media companies” are two examples out of hundreds or thousands operating to manipulate global search results at scale for low-effort-low-return pennies-per-click ad or affiliate revenue. We’re going to need cryptographically authenticated proof-of-utility to be indexed by search engines fairly soon (or maybe not? who cares? google is happy to <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/">pollute the world with search garbage</a> because more garbage means more ads means more google revenue and google is nothing without its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/alphabet-issues-first-ever-dividend-70-billion-buyback.html">$70 billion per year stock buyback program</a>).</p>
<p>Also if you haven’t searched for tech help over the past couple years, there are hundreds of fake “tech blog” sites doing the same thing: a site appearing as if it’s “a personal blog,” but having thousands of “helpful” pages in 300 different topic areas half scraped from github issues and half auto-generated. Also, by pure coincidence I’m sure, each page has 50 google ads or it bounces direct to spyware install sites when you navigate away. Each one of those sites is an “expert” in 100 different projects, platforms, programming languages, and strategies, yet they all are written from a first person “it’s just my blog lol!” point of view.</p>
<p>Curiously, each of these sites has the exact same layout, looks driven from the same CMS, has the same headers and footers, has the same navigation everywhere, has the same vapid FAQs (“Mountain Biking Tips: WEAR A HELMET!!”), all copied across thousands of sites all ranking in the top results for common queries to every day questions…</p>
<p>of course, this garbage is also flooding youtube as well with new emotionless and storyless and zero-personality autogenerated near-human voices all over the place:</p>

<p>people talk a lot about “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6L07VdZO4o">dead internet theory</a>” and how everything is becoming bots and scams and advertising bait, but those aren’t automatic outcomes. The “dead internet” is a process of <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ClicBot/comments/1chlcnk/from_debt_to_wealth_my_personal_finance_success/">direct information platform exploitation</a> by manipulative people operating on unchecked-and-unauthenticated platforms drawn to running scams due to their life circumstances (we’re ignoring the other branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_web_brigades">politically controlled “information warfare”</a> scams for now). Bot/scam/advertising/affiliate manipulation is born from usually living in low income societies where the most logical upward trajectory is just exploiting and manipulating high income people and societies who aren’t their own people (much like how a good way to stop spyware is changing your windows locale to russia because russian spyware firms don’t attack their own). Who cares if you make a million fake websites and destroy the information coherency of the planet if it earns you a passive $3 per day?</p>
<p>The only future of the internet is, sadly, proof-of-person and proof-of-residence on every public network interaction. There’s no going back to “high trust anonymous internet” when half the world is willing to exploit the other half. We end up with real time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y82KJWFdWZw">global access</a> from “low trust low income max exploitation because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ScammerPayback/videos">who is going to stop us</a>” wankers to “high trust high income low questioning” societies and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-a-pig-butchering-scam-heres-how-to-avoid-falling-victim-to-one">everything falls apart</a>.</p>
<p>the net of a million million lies is upon us and only you can prevent information fires.</p>

<p>A good friend of mine, <a href="http://blog.abodit.com/">Ian</a>, recently forwarded me an internet joke.   The headline was something like:</p>

<p>Ian’s messages made me chuckle.  Then, later the same day, I read this <a href="http://xkcd.com/1105/">XKCD cartoon</a>.  The merging of these two humorous topics created the seed for this article.</p>

<p>There are 10,000 possible combinations that the digits 0-9 can be arranged to form a 4-digit pin code.  Out of these ten thousand codes, which is the least commonly used? </p>

<p>Which of these pin codes is the <span color="gold">most</span> predictable?</p>

<p>If you had to make predication about what the least commonly used 4-digit PIN is, what would be your guess?</p>

<p>This tangentially relates to the XKCD cartoon.  In Randall’s cartoon, the perpetrator’s plan backfired because his selected license plate was so unique that it was very memorable.  What is the least memorable license plate?  Ask any spy you know (snigger) what the best way to blend into a crowd is.  Their answer will be not stand out, to appear “normal”, and not be notable in any way.</p>

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>This article is <b>not</b> intended to be a hacker bible, or to be used as a utility, resource, or tool to help would-be thieves perform nefarious actions.  I will only disclose data sufficient to make my points, and will try to avoid giving specific data outside of the obvious examples.  I do not want to be an enabler for script-kiddies.   Please do not email me asking for the database I used; if you do, you will be wasting your time as I’m not going to respond.  I’m not going to sell, donate or release the source data – don’t ask!</p>

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Obviously, I don’t have access to a credit card PIN number database.  Instead I’m going to use a proxy.  I’m going to use data condensed from released/exposed/discovered password tables and security breaches.</p>

<h3>Soap Box – Password Database Exposures</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Over the years, there have been numerous password table security breaches:  Some very high profile, some low profile, but all embarrassing (and many exceedingly expensive; both in direct fines and indirect loss of business through erosion of trust and reputation). </p>
<p>Fool me once, well, no, even that’s not really acceptable, but fool me twice …  I’ll go even further: <b>Any</b> developer who stores the password table of their database in clear text  should be so mortified by this lack of security that they should not be sleeping at night until they fix it.  Ignoring the fact that you should never have ever coded it this way, you have an <u>obligation</u> to learn from these past breaches.</p>
<p>If you work for a company and are knowledgeable that your customer database is <i>“protected”</i> by such lightweight security then run, don’t walk, to your CEO/Presidents office, pound on the door and insist (s)he puts out a mandate to fix the matter with extreme prejudice.  Don’t leave until you get an affirmative response. Badger, badger then badger them again. Make yourself a proverbial thorn in their side.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to sell my services as a consultant here (though if you are interested, my rates are very reasonable compared to the cost of legal defense, potential FTC sanctions, class action suits, shareholder backlash,  fines, loss of reputation and business …)  There are plenty of security experts in the industry who can help you (if you need help filtering them and don’t have referrals, someone who has CISSP qualifications is a good place to start).</p>
<p><span><span color="black">&nbsp;<b>Bottom line</b>&nbsp;</span></span> Security strengthens with layers, and the simple application of encryption on your database table can help protect your customer’s data if this table is exposed.  It does not defend against all possible attacks, but it does nothing but good things.  What possible reason is there store things in clear-text? </p>

<h3>Back to the data</h3>

<p>By combining the exposed password databases I’ve encountered, and filtering the results to just those rows that are exactly four digits long <span color="gold">[0-9]</span> the output is a database of all the four digit character combinations that people have used as their account passwords.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Given that users have a free choice for their password, if users select a four digit password to their online account, it’s not a stretch to use this as a proxy for four digit PIN codes.</p>

<h2>The Data</h2>

<p>I was able to find almost <i>3.4 million</i> four digit passwords.   Every single one of the of the 10,000 combinations of digits from <span color="gold">0000</span> through to <span color="gold">9999</span> were represented in the dataset.</p>

</tbody></table>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>… nearly 11% of the 3.4 million passwords are <span>&nbsp;1234&nbsp;</span> <i>!!!</i></p></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>The next most popular 4-digit PIN in use is <span>&nbsp;1111&nbsp;</span>  with over 6% of passwords being this.</p>
<p>In third place is <span>&nbsp;0000&nbsp;</span> with almost 2%.</p>
<p>A table of the top 20 found passwords in shown at the right.  A staggering <span color="gold">26.83%</span> of all passwords could be guessed by attempting these 20 combinations!</p>

<p>(Statistically, with 10,000 possible combination, if passwords were uniformly randomly distributed, we would expect the these twenty passwords to account for just 0.2% of the total, not the 26.83% encountered)</p>

<p>Looking more closely at the top few records, all the usual suspects are present <span>&nbsp;1111&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;2222&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;3333&nbsp;</span> … <span>&nbsp;9999&nbsp;</span> as well as <span>&nbsp;1212&nbsp;</span> and (snigger) <span>&nbsp;6969&nbsp;</span>.</p>
<p>It’s not a surprise to see patterns like <span>&nbsp;1122&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;1313&nbsp;</span> occurring high up in the list, nor <span>&nbsp;4321&nbsp;</span> or <span>&nbsp;1010&nbsp;</span>.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;2001&nbsp;</span> makes an appearance at #19. <span>&nbsp;1984&nbsp;</span> follows not far behind in position #26, and James Bond fans may be interested to know <span>&nbsp;0007&nbsp;</span> is found between the two of them in position #23 (another variant <span>&nbsp;0070&nbsp;</span> follows not much further behind at #28).</p>

<p>The first “puzzling” password I encountered was <span>&nbsp;2580&nbsp;</span> in position #22.   What is the significance of these digits? Why should so many people select this code to make it appear so high up the list?</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td rowspan="2"><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/keypad.png"></td>
<td colspan="2">
<p>Then I realized that <span>&nbsp;2580&nbsp;</span>is a straight down the middle of a telephone keypad!</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p> (Interestingly, this is very compelling evidence confirming the hypothesis that a 4-digit password list is a great proxy for a PIN number database.  If you look at the numeric keypad on a PC-keyboard you’ll see that 2580 is slightly more awkward to type on the PC than a phone because the order of keys on a keyboard is the inverted.  Cash machines and other terminals that take credit cards use a phone style numeric pads.  It appears that many people have an easy to type/remember PIN number for their credit card and are re-using the same four digits for their online passwords, where the <i>"straight down the middle"</i> mnemonic no longer applies).</p></td>

</tbody></table>

<p>(Another fascinating piece of trivia is that people seem to prefer even numbers over odd, and codes like <span>&nbsp;2468&nbsp;</span> occur higher than a odd number equivalent, such as <span>&nbsp;1357&nbsp;</span>).</p>

<h2>Cumulative Frequency</h2>

<p>As noted above, the more popular password selections dominate the frequency tables.  The most popular PIN code of <span>&nbsp;1234&nbsp;</span> is more popular than the <i>lowest 4,200 codes combined!</i></p>
<p>That's right, you might be able to crack over 10% of all codes with one guess!  Expanding this, you could get 20% by using just five numbers!</p>
<p>Below is a cumulative frequency graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/c.png"></p><p>Statistically, <i>one third</i> of all codes can be guessed by trying just 61 distinct combinations!</p>
<p>The 50% cumulative chance threshold is passed at just 426 codes (far less than the 5,000 that a random uniformly distribution would predict).  Paranoid yet?</p>

<h2>Bottom of the pile</h2>

<p>OK, we've investigated most frequently used PINS and found they tend to be predictable and easy to remember, let's turn for a second to the bottom of the pile.</p>
<p> What are the least "interesting" (least used) PINS?</p>
<p>In my dataset the answer is <span>&nbsp;8068&nbsp;</span> with just 25 occurrences in 3.4 million (this equates to 0.000744%, far, far fewer than random distribution would predict, and five orders of magnitude behind the most popular choice).</p>

<h2>Memorable Years</h2>

<p>Many of the high frequency PIN numbers can be interpreted as years, <i>e.g.</i>  <span>&nbsp;1967&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;1956&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;1937&nbsp;</span> … It appears that many people use a year of birth (or possibly an anniversary) as their PIN. This will certainly help them remember their code, but it greatly increases its predictability.</p>

<p>Just look at the stats: Every single <span>&nbsp;19??&nbsp;</span> combination can be found in the <i>top fifth</i> of the dataset!</p>
<p>Below is a plot of this in graphical format.  In this chart, each <span color="yellow">yellow</span> line represents a PIN number that starts <span>&nbsp;19??&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/c2.png"></p><p>If all the passwords were uniformly distributed, there should be no significant difference between the frequency of occurrence of, <i>for instance</i>, <span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> and any other PIN ending in seventy two <span>&nbsp;??72&nbsp;</span>.  However, as we shall see, this is not the case at all.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> occurs in ordinal position #76 (with a frequency 0.099363%).  Here’s a histogram for the occurrences of all <span>&nbsp;??72&nbsp;</span> probabilities.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/r.png"></p><p>You can clearly see the spike at <span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> (with smaller spikes at <span>&nbsp;7272&nbsp;</span>  and <span>&nbsp;1472&nbsp;</span>)</p>
<p>If you calculate the ratio of the peak of <span>&nbsp;1972&nbsp;</span> to the average of all the other <span>&nbsp;??72&nbsp;</span> PINS you get the ratio of <span color="gold">&nbsp;<b>22:1</b></span></p>
<p>PINS starting with <span>&nbsp;19??&nbsp;</span> are much more likley to occur. Of course, it’s not just 1972.  Here is plot of the ratio of <span color="gold">19</span> to <span color="gold">non-19</span> for all hundred combinations.  Along the x-axis are all the combinations of last two digits �XX, and for each of these the ratio of the 19XX to average of all the other ??XX occurrences has been calculated.  Here’s the chart:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/r2.png"></p><p>It's a pretty good approximation for a demographic chart! (suggested by the red-dashed trend line) which would probably allow a fair estimation of the ages (years of birth) of the people using the various websites. (Of course, hackers invert this strategy and use the age of a target to try and give information to guess a user's PIN.  Looking at this graph, this might give them up to a <i>40x</i> advantage!)</p>
<p>Just about all the ratios are above <span color="gold">1.0</span>.  The noteable exceptions are <span>&nbsp;??34&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;??00&nbsp;</span> (which are easy to explain, since the massive popularity of <span>&nbsp;1234&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;0000&nbsp;</span> dwarf <span>&nbsp;1934&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;1900&nbsp;</span>respectively).  Simiarly <span>&nbsp;33&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;44&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;55&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;66&nbsp;</span> … are lower than expected as the quad codes like <span>&nbsp;3333&nbsp;</span> mask out even the <span>&nbsp;1933&nbsp;</span> boost.</p>
<p>There are also spikes in the graph corresponding to the popular PINS of <span>&nbsp;1919&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;1984&nbsp;</span> and <span>&nbsp;1999&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I love pretty ways to graphically vizualize data.  Pictures really do paint thousands of words.</p>
<p>Another interesting way to visualize the PIN data is in this grid plot of the distribution.  In this heatmap, the x-axis depicts the left two digits from <span color="gold">[00]</span> to <span color="gold">[99]</span> and the y-axis depicts the right two digits from <span color="gold">[00]</span> to <span color="gold">[99]</span>.  The bottom left is <span>&nbsp;0000&nbsp;</span> and the top right is <span>&nbsp;9999&nbsp;</span>.</p>
<p>Color is used to represent frequency.  The higher frequency occurences are yellow to white hot, and the lower frequency occurences are red, through dark red to black.</p>
<p><span><span color="black">&nbsp;<b>Geek Note</b>&nbsp;</span></span> The scaling is logarithmic.</p>
</td>

<p>You could look at this plot all day!</p>
<p>The bright line for the leading diagonal shows the repeated couplets that people love to use for their PIN numbers <span>&nbsp;0000&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;0101&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;0202&nbsp;</span> …
<span>&nbsp;5454&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;5555&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;5656&nbsp;</span>
…
<span>&nbsp;9898&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;9999&nbsp;</span>.</p>
<p>Every eleventh dot on the leading diagonal is brighter corresponding to the quad numbers
<i>e.g.</i> <span>&nbsp;4444&nbsp;</span> <span>&nbsp;5555&nbsp;</span>.  Here is a larger scale version:</p>

<p>The lighter areas corresponding to couplets of numbers that are close to each other.  For some reason, people don't like to select pairs of numbers that have larger numerical gaps between them.

<h2>More than four</h2>

<p>The purpose of this posting was to investigate patterns and frequency of four digit PIN numbers.  However, the database I collected also has <i>all-numeric</i> password of different lengths.  It's worth taking a quick look at these too.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/pl.png"></p><p>I found close to 7 million all-numeric passwords.  Approximately half of these were the four-digit codes we've just examined.</p>
<p>Six digit codes are the next most popular length, followed eight.</p>
<p>I hope, hope that the people who have passwords of nine digits long are <u>not</u> using their Social Security Numbers!</p>
<p>Below are the top 20 passwords for the various lengths, along with their share of their same-size namespace.</p>

<h3>Some interesting observations (and a little speculation)</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;For five digit passwords, users appear to have <i>even less</i> imagination in selecting their codes (22.8% select 12345).  All the usual suspects occur, but a new addition is the puerile addition in position #20 of the concatenation of 420 and 69.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;For six digit password, again 696969 appears highly.  Also of note is 159753 (a "X" mark over the numeric keypad).  James Bond returns with 007007.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;For seven digits, the standby of 1234567 is a much lower frequency (though still the top).  I speculate that this is because many people may be using their telephone number (without area code) as a seven digit password.  Telephone numbers are fairly distinct, and already memorized, so when a seven digit code is needed, they spring to mind easily.  The higher frequency of usage of telephone numbers reduces the need to use imagination (or lack thereof) and select something else.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Is Jenny there?  The fouth most popular seven digit password is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/867-5309/Jenny">8675309</a> (It's a popular 80's song).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Eight digit passwords are just as expected.  Lots of pattern, and lots of repetition.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Common nine digit passwords also follow patterns and repetition. 789456123 appears as an easy <i>"Along the top, middle and bottom of the keypad"</i> 147258369 is related in the vertical direction (and other variants appear high up). Again we get a 420 moment with 420420420, and also the shaken, not stirred, but repeated 007007007 returns.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Interestingly for ten digits 1029384756 appears (alternating ascending/descending digits), as well as the odd/even 1357924680.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/key.gif">&nbsp;Hurrah for math!  In position #17 of the ten digit password list we get 3141592654 (The first few digits of <i>Pi</i>)</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>Since publishing this article, it's been brought to my attention that, of course, in addition to anniversary years, many people encapsulate dates in the format MMDD (such as birthdays …) for their PIN codes.</p>
<p>This clearly explains the lower left corner where, if you look at the heatmap, there is a huge contrast change at the height of around 30-31 (the number of days in a month), extending to 12 on the x-axis. (Thanks to <b>zero79</b> for first pointing this out).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/mmdd.png"></p><p>Many people also asked the significance of 1004 in the four character PIN table.  This comes from Korean speakers.  When spoken, "1004" is <i>cheonsa</i> (cheon = 1000, sa=4).</p>
<p>"Cheonsa" also happens to be the Korean word for <i>Angel</i>.</p>
