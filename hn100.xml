<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="autonomous-zero-day-discovery-in-one-of-the-most-scrutinized-codebases-in-the-world"><strong>Autonomous zero-day discovery in one of the most scrutinized codebases in the world</strong></h2><p>AISLE's autonomous analyzer found all 12 CVEs in the January 2026 coordinated release of OpenSSL, the open-source cryptographic library that underpins a substantial proportion of the world’s secure communications. Some of these vulnerabilities had persisted in OpenSSL code for decades, evading the notice of thousands of security researchers.</p><p>Finding a genuine security flaw in OpenSSL is extraordinarily difficult. Even a single accepted vulnerability represents a rare achievement. The library's maturity and the community's vigilance make new discoveries exceptionally uncommon. This makes the January 2026 release an important milestone for autonomous security systems. As Tomáš Mráz, CTO of the OpenSSL Foundation, says,</p><p>“One of the most important sources of the security of the OpenSSL Library and open source projects overall is independent research. This release is fixing 12 security issues, all disclosed to us by AISLE. We appreciate the high quality of the reports and their constructive collaboration with us throughout the remediation.”</p><p>In this article, we’ll give an overview of our discoveries and explain why we think this is a watershed moment for AI-powered software security. </p><h2 id="the-discoveries">The Discoveries</h2><p>The AISLE Research Team started hunting for OpenSSL vulnerabilities with our autonomous analyzer in August 2025. You can read about the three discoveries we made in Q3 of 2025 <a href="https://aisle.com/blog/aisle-discovers-three-of-the-four-openssl-vulnerabilities-of-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. All of our discoveries were reported through responsible disclosure and resolved through coordinated releases with the OpenSSL project.</p><h3 id="high-and-moderate-severity-cves">High and Moderate Severity CVEs</h3><ul><li value="1"><strong>CVE-2025-15467: Stack Buffer Overflow in CMS AuthEnvelopedData Parsing (High):</strong> A vulnerability with the potential to enable remote code execution under specific conditions   </li><li value="2"><strong>CVE-2025-11187</strong>: <strong>PBMAC1 Parameter Validation in PKCS#12 (Moderate):</strong> Missing validation that could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow</li></ul><h3 id="low-severity-cves">Low Severity CVEs</h3><ul><li value="1"><strong>CVE-2025-15468</strong>: Crash in QUIC protocol cipher handling  </li><li value="2"><strong>CVE-2025-15469</strong>: Silent truncation bug affecting post-quantum signature algorithms (ML-DSA)  </li><li value="3"><strong>CVE-2025-66199</strong>: Memory exhaustion via TLS 1.3 certificate compression  </li><li value="4"><strong>CVE-2025-68160</strong>: Memory corruption in line-buffering (affects code back to OpenSSL 1.0.2)  </li><li value="5"><strong>CVE-2025-69418</strong>: Encryption flaw in OCB mode on hardware-accelerated paths  </li><li value="6"><strong>CVE-2025-69419</strong>: Memory corruption in PKCS#12 character encoding  </li><li value="7"><strong>CVE-2025-69420</strong>: Crash in TimeStamp Response verification  </li><li value="8"><strong>CVE-2025-69421</strong>: Crash in PKCS#12 decryption  </li><li value="9"><strong>CVE-2026-22795</strong>: Crash in PKCS#12 parsing  </li><li value="10"><strong>CVE-2026-22796</strong>: Crash in PKCS#7 signature verification (affects code back to OpenSSL 1.0.2)</li></ul><p>AISLE’s analyzer also recommended fixes which were incorporated directly into OpenSSL for 5 of the 12 CVEs.</p><h2 id="beyond-cves-catching-bugs-before-they-ship">Beyond CVEs: Catching Bugs Before They Ship</h2><p>In addition to the 12 CVEs, <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aopenssl%2Fopenssl+aisle&amp;type=pullrequests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 findings</a> were never assigned a designation. In each case, AISLE detected the issue, reported it to the maintainers, and the fix was merged <strong>before the vulnerable code ever appeared in a release</strong>.</p><h2 id="by-integrating-autonomous-analysis-directly-into-development-workflows-security-issues-were-identified-and-resolved-before-they-reached-users-that-is-our-goal-preventing-vulnerabilities-not-merely-patching-them-after-deployment">By integrating autonomous analysis directly into development workflows, security issues were identified and resolved before they reached users. That is our goal: preventing vulnerabilities, not merely patching them after deployment.</h2><h2 id="what-this-means">What This Means</h2><p>OpenSSL represents one of the most deployed, battle-tested, and carefully maintained open-source projects in existence. The fact that 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities could still be found there, including issues dating back to 1998, suggests that manual review faces significant limits, even in mature, heavily audited codebases.</p><p>Human reviewers are constrained by time, attention, and the sheer volume of code in modern systems. Traditional static analysis catches certain bug classes but struggles with complex logic errors and timing-dependent issues. By contrast, autonomous AI-driven analysis operates at a different scale. It can examine code paths and edge cases that would take human reviewers months to cover, and it runs continuously rather than periodically.</p><p>This doesn't mean that AI can replace human expertise. The OpenSSL maintainers' deep knowledge of the codebase was essential for validating findings and developing robust fixes. But it does change the SLA of security. When autonomous discovery is paired with responsible disclosure, it <strong>collapses the time-to-remediation</strong> for the entire ecosystem.</p><p>The 12 OpenSSL vulnerabilities we identified, spanning 8+ subsystems from CMS to QUIC to post-quantum signatures, represent a milestone in our (admittedly ambitious) mission: moving from reactive patching to securing the software foundation that modern civilization depends on.</p><h2 id="collaboration-with-openssl">Collaboration with OpenSSL</h2><p>From the moment our system flagged these anomalies, we approached this as a partnership with the OpenSSL community. We submitted detailed technical reports through their coordinated security reporting process, including complete reproduction steps, root cause analysis, and concrete patch proposals. In each case, our proposed fixes either informed or were directly adopted by the OpenSSL team.</p><p>As Matt Caswell, Executive Director of the OpenSSL Foundation, said, “Keeping widely deployed cryptography secure requires tight coordination between maintainers and researchers. We appreciate AISLE's responsible disclosures and the quality of their engagement across these issues." </p><p>The OpenSSL team's responsiveness was exceptional. Under the leadership of Tomáš Mráz, the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) at the OpenSSL Foundation, the maintainers engaged technically at every stage: validating findings, refining patches, coordinating releases across multiple branches, and synchronizing with downstream distributions.</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><ul><li value="1"><a href="https://aisle.com/blog/aisle-discovers-three-of-the-four-openssl-vulnerabilities-of-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AISLE's detailed technical analysis of the Q3 2025 discoveries</a>  </li><li value="2"><a href="https://openssl-library.org/news/vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSSL Security Advisories</a></li></ul><p>For questions about AISLE's autonomous analyzer, reach out to us at <a href="https://aisle.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#19717c7575765978706a757c377a7674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-cfemail="670f020b0b0827060e140b024904080a">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.  </p><p><em>Our appreciation goes to Tomáš Mráz, Matt Caswell, Neil Horman, and the OpenSSL team for their collaboration throughout this process.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     <p>Hello! One of my favourite things is starting to learn an
Old Boring Technology that I’ve never tried before but that has been around for
20+ years. It feels really good when every problem I’m ever going to have has
been solved already 1000 times and I can just get stuff done easily.</p>
<p>I’ve thought it would be cool to learn a popular web framework like
Rails or Django or Laravel for a long time, but I’d never really managed to
make it happen. But I started learning Django to make a website a few months
back, I’ve been liking it so far, and here are a few quick notes!</p>
<h3 id="less-magic-than-rails">
    <a href="#less-magic-than-rails">
      less magic than Rails
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I spent some time <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/11/09/day-1--a-little-rails-/">trying to learn Rails</a> in 2020,
and while it was cool and I really wanted to like Rails (the Ruby community is great!),
I found that if I left my Rails project alone for months, when I came
back to it it was hard for me to remember how to get anything done because
(for example) if it says <code>resources :topics</code> in your <code>routes.rb</code>, on its own
that doesn’t tell you where the <code>topics</code> routes are configured, you need to
remember or look up the convention.</p>
<p>Being able to abandon a project for months or years and then come back to it is
really important to me (that’s how all my projects work!), and Django feels easier
to me because things are more explicit.</p>
<p>In my small Django project it feels like I just have 5 main files (other
than the settings files): <code>urls.py</code>, <code>models.py</code>, <code>views.py</code>, <code>admin.py</code>, and
<code>tests.py</code>, and if I want to know where something else is (like an HTML template)
is then it’s usually explicitly referenced from one of those files.</p>
<h3 id="a-built-in-admin">
    <a href="#a-built-in-admin">
      a built-in admin
    </a>
</h3>
<p>For this project I wanted to have an admin interface to manually edit or view
some of the data in the database. Django has a really nice built-in admin
interface, and I can customize it with just a little bit of code.</p>
<p>For example, here’s part of one of my admin classes, which sets up which fields
to display in the “list” view,  which field to search on, and how to order them
by default.</p>
<pre><code>@admin.register(Zine)
class ZineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["name", "publication_date", "free", "slug", "image_preview"]
    search_fields = ["name", "slug"]
    readonly_fields = ["image_preview"]
    ordering = ["-publication_date"]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="it-s-fun-to-have-an-orm">
    <a href="#it-s-fun-to-have-an-orm">
      it’s fun to have an ORM
    </a>
</h3>
<p>In the past my attitude has been “ORMs? Who needs them? I can just write my own SQL queries!”.
I’ve been enjoying Django’s ORM so far though, and I think it’s cool how Django
uses <code>__</code> to represent a <code>JOIN</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>Zine.objects
    .exclude(product__order__email_hash=email_hash)
</code></pre>
<p>This query involves 5 tables: <code>zines</code>, <code>zine_products</code>, <code>products</code>, <code>order_products</code>, and <code>orders</code>.
To make this work I just had to tell Django that there’s a <code>ManyToManyField</code>
relating “orders” and “products”, and another <code>ManyToManyField</code> relating
“zines”, and “products”, so that it knows how to connect <code>zines</code>, <code>orders</code>, <code>products</code>.</p>
<p>I definitely <em>could</em> write that query, but writing <code>product__order__email_hash</code> is
a lot less typing, it feels a lot easier to read, and honestly I think it would
take me a little while to figure out how to construct the query
(which needs to do a few other things than just those joins).</p>
<p>I have zero concern about the performance of my ORM-generated queries so I’m
pretty excited about ORMs for now, though I’m sure I’ll find things to be
frustrated with eventually.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-migrations">
    <a href="#automatic-migrations">
      automatic migrations!
    </a>
</h3>
<p>The other great thing about the ORM is migrations!</p>
<p>If I add, delete, or change a field in <code>models.py</code>, Django will automatically
generate a migration script like <code>migrations/0006_delete_imageblob.py</code>.</p>
<p>I assume that I could edit those scripts if I wanted, but so far I’ve just
been running the generated scripts with no change and it’s been going great. It
really feels like magic.</p>
<p>I’m realizing that being able to do migrations easily is important for me right
now because I’m changing my data model fairly often as I figure out how I want
it to work.</p>
<h3 id="i-like-the-docs">
    <a href="#i-like-the-docs">
      I like the docs
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I had a bad habit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMw1QTP2no">never reading the documentation</a>
but I’ve been really enjoying the parts of Django’s docs that I’ve read so far.
This isn’t by accident: Jacob Kaplan-Moss has a
<a href="https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2011/pycon-2011--writing-great-documentation.html">talk from PyCon 2011</a>
on Django’s documentation culture.</p>
<p>For example the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/db/models/">intro to models</a>
lists the most important common fields you might want to set when using the ORM.</p>
<h3 id="using-sqlite">
    <a href="#using-sqlite">
      using sqlite
    </a>
</h3>
<p>After having a bad experience trying to operate Postgres and not being able to
understand what was going on, I decided to run all of my small websites with
SQLite instead. It’s been going way better, and I love being able to backup by
just doing a <code>VACUUM INTO</code> and then copying the resulting single file.</p>
<p>I’ve been following <a href="https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production">these instructions</a>
for using SQLite with Django in production.</p>
<p>I think it should be fine because I’m expecting the site to have a few hundred
writes per day at most, much less than <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">Mess with DNS</a>
which has a lot more of writes and has been working well (though the writes are
split across 3 different SQLite databases).</p>
<h3 id="built-in-email-and-more">
    <a href="#built-in-email-and-more">
      built in email (and more)
    </a>
</h3>
<p>Django seems to be very “batteries-included”, which I love – if I want CSRF
protection, or a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>, or I want to send email, it’s all
in there!</p>
<p>For example, I wanted to save the emails Django sends to a file in dev mode (so
that it didn’t send real email to real people), which was just a little bit
of configuration.</p>
<p>I just put this <code>settings/dev.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / "emails"
</code></pre>
<p>and then set up the production email like this in <code>settings/production.py</code></p>
<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.whatever.com"
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "xxxx"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('EMAIL_API_KEY')
</code></pre>
<p>That made me feel like if I want some other basic website feature, there’s
likely to be an easy way to do it built into Django already.</p>
<h3 id="the-settings-file-still-feels-like-a-lot">
    <a href="#the-settings-file-still-feels-like-a-lot">
      the settings file still feels like a lot
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I’m still a bit intimidated by the <code>settings.py</code> file: Django’s settings system
works by setting a bunch of global variables in a file, and I feel a bit
stressed about… what if I make a typo in the name of one of those variables?
How will I know? What if I type <code>WSGI_APPLICATOIN = "config.wsgi.application"</code>
instead of <code>WSGI_APPLICATION</code>?</p>
<p>I guess I’ve gotten used to having a Python language server tell me when I’ve
made a typo and so now it feels a bit disorienting when I can’t rely on the
language server support.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-for-now">
    <a href="#that-s-all-for-now">
      that’s all for now!
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I haven’t really successfully used an actual web framework for a project before
(right now almost all of my websites are either a single Go binary or static
sites), so I’m interested in seeing how it goes!</p>
<p>There’s still lots for me to learn about, I still haven’t really gotten into
Django’s form validation tooling or authentication systems.</p>
<p>Thanks to Marco Rogers for convincing me to give ORMs a chance.</p>
<p>(we’re still experimenting with the comments-on-Mastodon system! <a href="https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115969229107460589">Here are the comments on Mastodon</a>! tell me your favourite Django feature!)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Two crypto thieves decided to settle an argument over who was wealthier by screensharing as they transferred crypto between wallets to prove ownership. In doing so, one of them — known online as "Lick" — revealed a wallet address that crypto sleuth zachxbt quickly tied to the theft of around $90&nbsp;million from US government wallets containing seized crypto assets, including a <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=possible-us-government-theft" target="_blank">$20&nbsp;million theft zachxbt reported in October 2024</a>.<p>zachxbt has alleged that "Lick" is a man named John Daghita. After reporting Daghita's identity, "Lick" appeared to try to scrub his Telegram account, then <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/glossary#dusting" target="_blank">dusted</a> zachxbt's public crypto wallet from one of the theft addresses.</p><p>Daghitia is reportedly the son of Dean Daghita, the owner of Command Services &amp; Support (CMDSS). In October 2024, CMDSS landed a contract with the US Marshals to manage seized crypto assets, which is still active. After zachxbt linked the younger Daghita to his father and CMDSS, CMDSS also scrubbed its online presence. Around that time, Lick began trolling zachxbt again, and later sent 0.6767&nbsp;ETH (~$1,900) of the stolen funds to zachxbt.</p><p>CMDSS' website boasts that they are "a proven provider of mission-critical services to the Department of Defense and Department of Justice".</p></span></p><ul><li><a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2014685263327351116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Tweet thread by zachxbt</span></a><span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2026-01-23-0/0">[archive]</a></span></li><li><a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2015430549846777964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Tweet thread by zachxbt</span></a><span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2026-01-23-0/1">[archive]</a></span></li><li><a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/81fc28c4-3f1c-a300-4e38-8616bb76adff-P/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Command Services &amp; Support, Inc.</span></a><span>, USASpending.gov</span><span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260127023607/https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/81fc28c4-3f1c-a300-4e38-8616bb76adff-P/latest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[archive]</a></span></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><p>I keep designing physical parts for <a href="https://muni.works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our robots</a>. Motor mounts, sensor brackets, wheel hubs. Every time, the workflow is the same: open a GUI CAD program, click around for an hour, export an STL, realize the bolt pattern is 2mm off, repeat.</p>
<p>I wanted to write my parts the way I write firmware. In <span>Rust</span>. With types. With version control. With the ability to change one number and regenerate everything.</p>
<p>So I built <a href="https://vcad.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vcad</a>.</p>
<!--$?--><template id="B:0"></template><pre><code>cargo add vcad
</code></pre><!--/$-->

<h2>The idea</h2>
<p>A part is just geometry with a name. You create primitives, combine them with boolean operations, and export. That's it.</p>

<h2>Why Rust</h2>
<p>The geometry engine is <a href="https://github.com/elalish/manifold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">manifold</a>, which guarantees watertight meshes from boolean operations. The Rust bindings give us zero-cost abstractions over the C++ core — the operator overloads compile down to direct manifold calls. No garbage collection pauses. No floating point surprises from a scripting layer.</p>
<p>But honestly, the main reason is <span>the toolchain</span>. <code>cargo test</code> runs 21 unit tests that verify volumes, surface areas, bounding boxes, and export round-trips. <code>cargo clippy</code> catches issues before they become parts with holes in the wrong place. Types prevent you from passing a radius where a diameter was expected.</p>
<p>CAD files <em>should</em> be code. Code has tests, reviews, diffs, and CI. An STL file has... bytes.</p>
<!-- -->
<h2>Built for agents</h2>
<p>One thing I care about that most CAD tools don't: vcad is designed to be used by <span>AI coding agents</span>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ecto/vcad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">README</a> has full API tables, a cookbook with copy-pasteable recipes, and a section on <a href="https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Blender MCP</a> integration. An agent can read the docs, generate a part, export it, import it into Blender, position a camera, and render a preview — all in one conversation.</p>
<p>Every render in this post was made that way. Claude generated the geometry with vcad, imported each STL/GLB into Blender via MCP, set up studio lighting, and rendered to PNG. No human touched Blender.</p>
<p>The feedback loop is: describe a part → code generates → mesh exports → render previews → iterate. All in the terminal.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> turns almost any phone or tablet into a low-frequency
radio transmitter broadcasting a time signal that can synchronize most
radio-controlled (“atomic”) clocks and watches.</p>
<p dir="auto">Real time signal broadcasts are limited in geographic range and notoriously
prone to interference in urban areas, so many such clocks end up never actually
using their self-setting functionality. <strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> may allow
setting such clocks when/where a suitable signal is not otherwise available.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li><strong>Network time</strong>: Derives the current time from the network using an NTP-like

<li><strong>Location-agnostic</strong>: Supports applying an offset to the transmitted time of
±24 hours from the present.</li>
<li><strong>BST/CEST/DST-aware</strong>: Transmits daylight saving time information for DCF77,
MSF, and WWVB.</li>
<li><strong>Leap second-aware</strong>: Transmits a DUT1 offset for MSF and WWVB.</li>
<li><strong>Client-side, browser-based</strong>: Runs entirely in the browser; no
installation, no signup, no data collection.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Requirements</h2><a id="user-content-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: Requirements" href="#requirements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The hard requirements of note are browser WebAssembly support and DAC support
for ≥44.1 KHz PCM. Almost any device running a browser from ≥2019 should
work.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, as of early 2024, <strong>Safari on iOS</strong> and <strong>Firefox on Android</strong> have
multiple breaking issues and <strong>will not work</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For other devices, <strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> works best with a
<strong>built-in speaker</strong> of a <strong>phone or tablet</strong>. See

<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Choose emulator settings.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The most important setting is which time station to emulate. Certain settings
are only available for certain stations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Clocks (or watches) that support more than one station may prefer one of them
over the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Choose any clock settings and place the clock into sync mode.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">If your clock has them, try to choose station and/or time zone settings that
make sense for your location.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most clocks provide a way to force a synchronization attempt. You will
probably have to navigate menus and/or press physical buttons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Position the speaker as close as possible to the clock’s antenna.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">The transmission range is quite short, so positioning is crucial. Some
experimentation will probably be required, especially if you’re unsure where
the antenna is.</p>
<p dir="auto">The volume should be set so that the clock picks up the cleanest signal.
Usually, this occurs at or near the maximum possible volume.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Time Station Emulator</strong> generates an audio waveform intentionally crafted to
create, when played back through consumer-grade audio hardware, the right kind
of RF noise to be mistaken for a time station broadcast.</p>
<p dir="auto">Specifically, given a fundamental carrier frequency used by a real time station,
it generates and modulates the highest odd-numbered subharmonic that also falls
below the Nyquist frequencies of common playback sample rates.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the higher-frequency harmonics inevitably created by any real-world DAC
during playback will then be the original fundamental, which should leak to the
environment as a short-range radio transmission via the ad-hoc antenna formed by
the physical wires and circuit traces in the audio output path.</p>

It looks the same." loading="lazy" width="693" height="374"></p><p>Interestingly though, on Firefox for Android, the browser does a full page zoom. But that's very different to text scaling.</p><p>And that's not great, because <a href="https://appt.org/en/stats/font-size">research by Appt</a> shows around 37% of Android users and 34% of iOS users have changed their system-level text scale factor from the default. And web developers currently have no way to respect that.</p><p>The new <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tag is here to fix that. Just like how the <code>&lt;meta name=viewport&gt;</code> tag tells the browser that your website is designed to work for small viewport sizes, the <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tells the browser, 'Hey, I've designed my website to still work if the user increases their OS text size.'</p><p>The plan is: once you have <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> on your page, the text will respect the user's text size preference.</p><p>Here's how the BBC website looks with <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code>.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2026-01-27-meta-scale-bbc-homepage.png" alt="Screenshot of the BBC homepage on a mobile sized viewport using the meta tag. All of the text is double the size." loading="lazy" width="1066" height="800"></p><h2 id="heading-why-do-i-have-to-enable-it-why-can't-browsers-do-it-anyway">Why do I have to enable it? Why can't browsers do it anyway?<a href="#heading-why-do-i-have-to-enable-it-why-can't-browsers-do-it-anyway"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>This can't be enabled everywhere. Trust me. It would be a bad idea.</p><p>Users of desktop browsers can already increase a website's text size, but it's a hidden feature these days. Here's what happens if someone doubles the text size on LinkedIn in Firefox.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2026-01-27-linkedin.png" alt="Screenshot of LinkedIn with 200% text scaling. A lot of text is squashed and truncated in the navigation bar and on someone's post." loading="lazy" width="1588" height="1002"></p><p>It's a car crash. And I don't mean to single out LinkedIn. There are many examples. In fact, most of our websites probably would look something like this.</p><p>And this is just on large desktop viewports. Imagine what would happen if we enabled this on mobile devices!</p><p>Even on smaller viewports, users should be able to increase the text size up to 200% without having to horizontally scroll. The relevant WCAG 2.2 guidelines are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow">1.4.10 Reflow</a>.</p><p>So that is why it's necessary for us to opt-in. Just like how from 2008 – when the first smartphones came out – it was necessary for us to opt-in to supporting mobile viewports.</p><h2 id="heading-how-do-i-support-text-scaling-on-my-website">How do I support text scaling on my website?<a href="#heading-how-do-i-support-text-scaling-on-my-website"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>You shouldn't wait for all browsers to support <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> before you support text scaling. It's something we all should be supporting anyway but probably haven't been testing for. Desktop browsers have recently been hiding their text sizing features in favour of zoom. And we've all probably been testing zoom instead.</p><p>Zoom increases everything, including images, padding, margins, gaps. <em>Everything.</em> And that's regardless of whether you're using <code>em</code> units or <code>px</code> units.</p><p>True text scaling is different. It only changes the default font size.</p><p>You've probably been taught a best practice similar to this: always use font-relative length units in your CSS, like <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>, not absolute units like <code>px</code> or <code>cm</code>. If you use <code>px</code> units, your website won't support text resizing.</p><p>That is mostly true, but it doesn't mean you can <em>never</em> use <code>px</code> units.</p><p>These are my three basic tips for supporting text scaling.</p><h3 id="heading-tip-1:-don't-override-the-initial-font-size">Tip 1: Don't override the initial font size<a href="#heading-tip-1:-don't-override-the-initial-font-size"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The default font size comes from the initial value of the CSS <code>font-size</code> property. If an author doesn't specify a size, the initial <code>font-size</code> is <code>medium</code>. But what is <code>medium</code>? Typically it's 16px. But on desktop browsers, users can change it to whatever they want.</p><p>This is ultimately what the <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tag does: when the tag is present and once browsers support it, mobile users will be able to change the default font size as well.</p><p>So if you override the default font size, the <code>&lt;meta name=text-scale&gt;</code> tag will have no effect.</p><pre><code><span><span>&lt;!-- 👎 Don't do this --&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text-scale<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>scale<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br><span>  <span>:root</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 16px<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Ideally, don't touch it. Or use percentage values to modify it.</p><h3 id="heading-tip-2:-only-use-font-relative-units-for-content">Tip 2: Only use font-relative units for content<a href="#heading-tip-2:-only-use-font-relative-units-for-content"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Text scaling doesn't need to replicate zoom. If you use font-relative units like <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> everywhere that you set a length, everything will scale up the same way as browser zoom.</p><p>Instead, only use font-relative units on things like text, images and icons. You don't need to use it on properties like <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code> or <code>gap</code>.</p><p>If you do that, there's more room for the content, which is especially important on portrait mobile devices.</p><p>What about <code>border-width</code>, though? I think borders generally count as content, but you need to think of the use case. A button or text box border should get thicker, but a divider line between list items is arguably aesthetic and you could define its width using <code>px</code> units.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2026-01-27-scale-content-not-spacing.png" alt="Screenshot of the CBBC website with text scaled by 200%. The text and images are larger but the padding and gaps are the same." loading="lazy" width="1588" height="1002"></p><h3 id="heading-tip-3:-test-test-test">Tip 3: Test, test, test<a href="#heading-tip-3:-test-test-test"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Try to simulate a user on a cheap smartphone who has doubled their text scale.</p><p>On a desktop browser, open the viewport tester in the dev tools and set the viewport to 320px width. Then, change the text scale to 200%. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/css-env-1/explainers/env-preferred-text-scale.md#ua-level-font-setting">See the <code>env(preferred-text-scale)</code> explainer for how to do that in each browser.</a></p><p>If you do that, you'll quickly see the problem areas. Think about how to adapt your layout to fit very large text.</p><h2 id="heading-what's-next">What's next?<a href="#heading-what's-next"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>There's more to think about, but I hope that's enough to get you started!</p><p>Hopefully the other browsers will start to support it later in the year, but I've not heard any information about it.</p><p>There is one problem we're still thinking about: how do we get large text to scale at a lower rate than body text. It's great that the body text can scale up from 16px to 32px, but does heading text need to scale up from 32px to 64px? It's already huge. If you have any thoughts, please do let me know!</p><p>I'll be talking more about this at <a href="https://cssday.nl/">CSS Day 2026 in June.</a> I hope to see you there! And I'm sure there will be more documentation published about text scaling later in the year. I think it's an area we're all lacking experience with after relying on browser zoom to keep us going for so long.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>One thing I've learnt from movie production is actually what separates professional from amateur quality is in the audio itself. Have you thought about implementing personaplex from NVDIA or other voice models that can both talk and listen at the same time?</p><p>Currently the conversation still feels too STT-LLM-TTS that I think a lot of the voice agents suffer from (Seems like only Sesame and NVDIA so far have nailed the natural conversation flow). Still, crazy good work train your own diffusion models, I remember taking a look at the latest literature on diffusion and was mind blown by the advances in last years or so since u-net architecture days.</p><p>EDIT: I see that the primary focus is on video generation not audio.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46786768"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46786768" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46786768&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46783600"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>This is a good point on audio. Our main priority so far has been reducing latency. In service of that, we were deep in the process of integrating Hume's two-way S2S voice model instead of ElevenLabs. But then we realized that ElevenLabs had made their STT-LLM-TTS pipeline way faster in the past month and left it at that. See our measurements here (they're super interesting): <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18kq2JKAsSahJ6yn5IJ9gCDf15y7Hje0U0Mn5qVettlg/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18kq2JKAsSahJ6yn5IJ9g...</a></p><p>But, to your point, there are many benefits of two-way S2S voice beyond just speed.</p><p>Using our LiveKit integration you can use LemonSlice with any voice provider you like. The current S2S providers LiveKit offers include OpenAI, Gemini, and Grok and I'm sure they'll add Personaplex soon.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46787511"><td></td></tr><tr id="46793321"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46793321" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46793321&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46783600"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I asked the Spanish tutor if he/it was familiar with the terms seseo[0] and ceceo[1] and he said it wasn't, which surprised me. Ideally it would be possible to choose which Spanish dialect to practise as mainland Spain pronunciation is very different to Latin America. In general it didn't convince me it was really hearing how I was pronouncing words, an important part of learning a language. I would say the tutor is useful for intermediate and advanced speakers but not beginners due to this and the speed at which he speaks.</p><p>At one point subtitles written in pseudo Chinese characters were shown; I can send a screenshot if this is useful.</p><p>The latency was slightly distracting, and as others have commented the NVIDIA Personaplex demos [2] are very impressive in this regard.</p><p>In general, a very positive experience, thank you.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_Spanish_coronal_fricatives#Seseo" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_Spanis...</a>

The administration’s opponents have used group text chats to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, share photos of suspected ICE vehicles and raise awareness for neighbors. In June, administration officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/iceblock-app-ice-agent-sightings-tops-app-store-white-house-backlash-rcna216327" target="_blank">criticized ICEBlock</a>, an app designed to share information about ICE sightings. Apple <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/apple-removes-iceblock-app-criticism-trump-administration-rcna235333" target="_blank">removed the app</a> from its app store in October, prompting a lawsuit <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/iceblock-developer-sues-trump-administration-app-removal-apple-store-rcna248045" target="_blank">from the app’s developer</a> alleging the administration unlawfully pressured Apple to remove it. </p><p id="anchor-00f834">In the past few days, the group text chats — especially those on the encrypted messaging app Signal — have drawn attention from right-wing media. On Saturday, Cam Higby, a conservative journalist based near Seattle, said in a thread on X that he had “infiltrated” Signal groups from around Minneapolis that he alleged were obstructing law enforcement. His thread, which got <a href="https://x.com/camhigby/status/2015093523733733474" target="_blank">20 million views</a>, focused on how the groups share such information as the license plate numbers of suspected federal vehicles. NBC News has not verified Higby’s claims.</p><p id="anchor-80b9bf">Patel said he got the idea for the investigation from Higby.</p><p id="anchor-33975a">“As soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,” he said. “We immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat — being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country — if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.”</p><p id="anchor-b23e67">The Signal Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates the Signal app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p id="anchor-32952d">Signal, which is considered one of the most secure chat apps, is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/signal-app-used-hegseth-can-leave-door-open-hackers-rcna197956" target="_blank">a go-to resource</a> for people concerned about privacy.  It is perhaps best known as the app Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used to share <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-inspector-general-investigation-signalgate-complete-rcna247030" target="_blank">sensitive military information</a> last year in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist.</p><p id="anchor-9d0775">In the Twin Cities, Signal group chats have been a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-school-patrols-ice-immigration-surge-rcna254477" target="_blank">standard part of toolkits</a> — along with walkie-talkies and whistles — used by activists, parents and neighborhood-watch members who have organized as volunteers to warn families about immigration enforcement activities by relaying real-time information, especially near schools. Patrol volunteers have said that, with <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/ice-minnesota-how-many-feds-minnesota" target="_blank">more than 3,000</a> federal immigration agents in Minnesota, they are motivated by a desire to protect parents, children and school staff members who are not U.S. citizens.</p><p id="anchor-c5ebe7">Patel did not say which laws he thought Minnesota residents may have violated. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no further information to provide.</p><p id="anchor-2e2534">The announcement seemed likely to have implications for the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech. Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement officers as they carry out their official responsibilities.</p><p id="anchor-3ecfcf">“The ability of everyday citizens to hold government agents to account, by observing them and advocating for change, is what has distinguished the American experiment with democracy from authoritarian regimes around the world,” Abdo said in an email.</p><p id="anchor-29aaea">“Unless the FBI has evidence of a crime, and not just evidence of activity the Constitution protects, it should stand down,” he said.</p><p id="anchor-2fc1ab">Patel acknowledged in the interview with Johnson that an investigation into group text chats would raise free speech concerns and said the FBI <a href="https://youtu.be/MwG5jS0cL9E?si=ue_6WtIujZzYbrWV&amp;t=279" target="_blank">would “balance” the rights</a> guaranteed by the First and Second amendments with what he said were potential violations of federal law.</p><p id="anchor-5ee288">“Now, we will balance the First and Second amendment constantly, but we have to let the community know that we will not tolerate acts of violence and an escalation and a violation of the federal code,” he said. The Second Amendment <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-second-amendment-rights-minneapolis-shooting-rcna255784" target="_blank">could be at issue</a> because Alex Pretti, the nurse shot and killed by a federal agent Saturday in Minneapolis, was permitted to carry a gun in public and had one with him.</p><p id="anchor-153bf9">Terr, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the government does not get to “balance” the First Amendment against its other interests.</p><p id="anchor-ef9959">“The Constitution takes precedence over any conflicting state or federal law, and over any official’s desire to suppress speech they dislike,” he said in his email.</p><p id="anchor-e709cd">He added: “There is a First Amendment exception for speech intended and likely to provoke imminent unlawful action, but that doesn’t apply to just any speech the government claims puts officials in harm’s way. By contrast, if individuals are threatening federal agents or conspiring to physically harm them, that is illegal. But conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a specific crime and a substantial step toward carrying it out.”</p><p id="anchor-e530b0">Patel also said the FBI had made “substantial progress” in an investigation into groups and people responsible for funding resistance to immigration enforcement. He alleged that the protests and neighborhood monitoring are “not happening organically” but did not immediately provide evidence.</p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p>David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Ryan J.

<p>The Department of Homeland Security now says that two weeks of critical surveillance footage from within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview detention center wasn’t actually lost in a “system crash,” but rather, was never recorded in the first place. It is also arguing that, had the footage been recorded, it would be irrelevant because prisoner living conditions have improved since the time it was supposed to be recorded.</p><p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/223855-ice-broadview/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">The filings</a>, made by U.S. attorneys on behalf of Greg Bovino, Kristi Noem, and other DHS officials, are the latest in an ongoing class action lawsuit against the U.S. government filed by detainees at the Chicago-area ICE detention center. The people suing the government in this case argue that they were held in <a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>subhuman, illegal conditions at Broadview</u></a>: “They are denied sufficient food and water […] the temperatures are extreme and uncomfortable […] the physical conditions are filthy, with poor sanitation, clogged toilets, and blood, human fluids, and insects in the sinks and the floor […] federal officers who patrol Broadview under Defendants’ authority are abusive and cruel,” their complaint reads in part.</p><p>As we <a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>have reported</u></a>, the plaintiffs’ lawyers have been trying to get the government to produce nearly two weeks worth of surveillance footage from inside the detention center from between October 20 and October 31, 2025, which was a critical period where ICE was detaining people en masse in Chicago. The government first said that the footage had been “irretrievably destroyed,” but that it was working with its vendor, a one-person company called Five by Five, to try to recover it. In a later filing, it <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-says-critical-evidence-in-broadview-abuse-case-was-lost-in-system-crash-a-day-after-it-was-sued/"><u>said that the footage was lost due to a nonspecific</u></a> “system crash.”&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents">https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46783017">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><div><p>Over the past year, coding agents have transformed how developers write, test, and maintain software. These systems can debug, refactor, and even submit pull requests—fundamentally changing what software development looks like. Yet despite this progress, most coding agents share the same constraints: they're closed, expensive to train, and difficult to study or adapt to private codebases.</p><p><strong>Ai2 Open Coding Agents</strong> change that. Today we’re releasing not just a collection of strong open coding models, but a training method that makes building your own coding agent for any codebase – for example, your personal codebase or an internal codebase at your organization – remarkably accessible for tasks including code generation, code review, debugging, maintenance, and code explanation.</p><p>Closed models haven't seen your internal code, so they don't know it—custom data pipelines, internal APIs, specific org conventions, and so on. Training on your private data teaches them, but generating synthetic training data from private codebases that works for agents has been challenging and cost-prohibitive. Our method makes it easy—reproducing the performance of the previously best open-source model costs ~$400 of compute, or up to $12,000 for performance that rivals the best industry models of the same size. This puts the full recipe within reach for labs and small teams.&nbsp;</p><p>Resource constraints drove us to maximize efficiency at every stage, from data quality to inference costs to model selection. The result: we match SWE-smith, a synthetic data method, at 57× lower cost and SkyRL, an open-source reinforcement learning (RL) system, at 26× lower cost.</p><p>The first release in our Open Coding Agents family is <strong>SERA</strong> (Soft-verified Efficient Repository Agents). The strongest – SERA-32B – solves 54.2% of SWE-Bench Verified problems,&nbsp; surpassing prior open-source state-of-the-art coding models of comparable sizes and context lengths while requiring only 40 GPU days (or fewer) to train on a cluster of 2 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs or NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs. SERA models are optimized and compatible with Claude Code out of the box. With our fine-tuning method, you can specialize them to your own codebase including your full engineering stack and conventions quickly and at low cost.</p><p>We collaborated with NVIDIA to optimize SERA inference for their accelerated infrastructure, ensuring researchers and developers can get the most out of these models in production environments. Early benchmarks are promising: running in BF16 precision on 4xH100 GPUs, SERA achieves approximately 1,950 peak output tokens per second with a 16k context window. At FP8 precision, SERA reaches 3,700 peak output tokens per second—a higher throughput at almost negligible accuracy drop. On next-generation Blackwell 4xB200 systems running in NVFP4, SERA scales further to around 8,600 peak output tokens per second.</p><p>Every component of this release is open – models, Claude Code integration, and training recipes – and can be launched with a single line of code, making it easy to use even for those without LLM training experience. We're also releasing state-of-the-art training data so researchers can inspect what worked and push it further, and conduct deep science while avoiding the many stumbling blocks, dead ends, and other roadblocks typical of coding agents.</p><p>One result we're especially excited about: SERA uniquely enables adapting to private datasets like internal codebases, and we see evidence that a smaller, open model can replicate and possibly even exceed the performance of a more capable "teacher" coding agent in these setups. For example, SERA-32B can surpass its 110B parameter teacher (GLM-4.5-Air) on codebases like Django and Sympy after training on just 8,000 samples at a cost of $1,300.&nbsp;</p><p>Accessible open models can now inherit strong agentic behavior through a simple, reproducible pipeline—no large-scale RL infrastructure or engineering team required. Case in point, SERA was built largely by a single Ai2 researcher.</p><h3>The challenge: specializing agents to your data</h3><p>If you’re a small to mid-sized business or independent developer, you probably have code that works with customer data in ways no public model has ever seen. Training on that data would help, but generating agent-ready synthetic data from private codebases has been the hard part. The holy grail would be a method that yields state-of-the-art training data for any codebase, with minimal setup and clear evidence that the tuned model is actually learning agentic behavior versus fragile heuristics.</p><p>We tackle this challenge with our new post-training approach that achieves state-of-the-art open-source results on SWE-Bench at a fraction of the typical training costs. Two innovations make it both inexpensive and effective:</p><ul><li><strong>Soft-verified generation (SVG).</strong> Synthetic training data generation, which is key to training a strong coding agent, is usually done by generating pairs of code examples that have both incorrect and corrected code. From these examples, the coding agent can learn how to transform incorrect code into correct code by generating a patch with line-by-line code changes. Usually, these examples need to be carefully tested to ensure that they’re actually correct. In SVG, our main finding is that patches don’t need to be correct to be helpful for coding. Just like different code can lead to the same, correct solution, with SVG we generate synthetic training data by having patches that are only partially correct. This removes the need to thoroughly test for full correctness, which in turn alleviates the need for complex infrastructure for testing and costly generation of precise examples. We demonstrate that this soft-verified data scales exactly like "hard-verified" training data.</li><li><strong>Scaling with a bug-type menu.</strong> To diversify data without becoming bottlenecked on finding real bugs, we draw from a taxonomy of 51 common bug patterns identified in prior analyses. For each function in a repository, we can generate multiple distinct bug-style prompts—so a repo with thousands of functions can yield tens of thousands of varied agentic trajectories at low cost.</li><li><strong>High simulated workflow fidelity. </strong>A key finding is that high-quality synthetic training data should mirror the workflow of a developer rather than the precise details of correct code. This means correct coding data is less important than data that reflects how a developer works on a problem. Combined with SVG, this insight enables repository training<em>: </em>generating training data for any code repository, making it straightforward to scale synthetic data generation massively.</li></ul><p>Together, these innovations mean that if you or your organization has a private codebase, you can use SERA to fine-tune a small model to strong performance on your data—easily and affordably. Instead of designing a complicated RL pipeline and test harness for every new task setting, you generate targeted synthetic data and run a straightforward supervised fine-tuning (SFT) job.</p><h3>State-of-the-art performance, accessible hardware</h3><p>Using SERA, we've developed a family of models ranging from 8B to 32B parameters, all built on Qwen3 and trained up to 32K context length with the help of various teacher models. We expect the same recipe to keep improving as we scale to larger backbones and context lengths, but the key point is that the current pipeline is already cheap and feasible for anyone to run, customize, and iterate on today—opening up wide access and endless possibilities for future research.</p><p>Our efficient technique enabled highly precise science. By keeping costs low, we could systematically disentangle the many factors that have made comparisons between agentic systems unreliable. This rigorous methodology drove rapid iteration, leading us from soft-verified generation to the full SERA approach.&nbsp;</p><p>When we align inference conditions for fair comparison, SERA performs competitively with leading open coding agents. At 32K context, <strong>SERA-32B</strong> achieves 49.5% ± 1.9% on SWE-Bench Verified, comparable to Devstral Small 2 (50.0% ± 1.3%) and GLM-4.5-Air (50.5% ± 1.3%). At 64K context, SERA-32B reaches 54.2% ± 1.4%—competitive with longer-context baselines.&nbsp;</p><p>Strong closed-weight coding agents like Devstral Small 2 are an important point of comparison. When we control for key variables, SERA-32B comes close: within ~0.5 points at 32K and ~4.9 points at 64K compared to Devstral Small 2 despite SERA being pure SFT and not trained beyond 32K tokens, both of which disadvantage longer-context evaluation.&nbsp;</p><p>We also explored how teacher strength affects results. GLM-4.6 yields our best numbers, but GLM-4.5-Air gets surprisingly close at lower cost. The gap between teachers becomes most meaningful in higher-compute regimes—suggesting that depending on your budget and target performance, a weaker (and cheaper) teacher can be the better overall choice, especially for early iterations.</p><p>To validate our synthetic data generation strategy, we tested repository-specific specialization on Django, SymPy, and Sphinx—the three largest repositories in SWE-Bench. Because these have actual test instances, we can quantify how well specialization works in practice. This serves as a proxy for the downstream use case we care most about: adapting to private codebases that may lack comprehensive tests or follow nonstandard structures.</p><p>The results are promising. Our specialized models – trained on 8,000 synthetic trajectories per repository – consistently match and often exceed the performance of the 100B+ parameter models we used as teachers. At 32K context, the specialized models achieve 52.23% on Django and 51.11% on SymPy, compared to GLM-4.5-Air's 51.20% and 48.89%. The gains are most pronounced on Django and SymPy, which together account for over 60% of all SWE-Bench problems.</p><p>These results highlight two crucial advantages of our method. First, specialization pays off: a 32B model fine-tuned to a specific codebase can match or surpass a 100B+ general-purpose teacher, delivering comparable performance at one-third the size with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and reduced operational costs. Second, simplicity scales: our SFT-only pipeline on an open base model is now competitive with heavily engineered, large-team efforts. Together, these findings lower the barrier to entry for researchers, make results easier to reproduce, and turn agentic coding progress into something the whole community can validate and build on.</p><h3>Built for developers and researchers</h3><p>Our release package includes everything needed to reproduce, test, and build on SERA—a lightweight deployment requiring just two lines of code to launch an inference server. We've also developed a setup script and inference optimizations that make SERA directly compatible with Claude Code.</p><figure><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View Getting started with SERA in Claude Code on YouTube" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=LfLIi4ZR_jA"><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://allenai.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLfLIi4ZR_jA%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span><svg><use href="#play-svg"></use></svg></span></span></a></p></figure><p>A key difference from closed-weight systems is our commitment to openness and reproducibility:</p><ul><li>We release <strong>models, code, all generated agent data, and a full recipe to generate your own data</strong> so anyone can reproduce our results or customize them to new domains.&nbsp;</li><li>Our training pipeline is <strong>intentionally simple</strong>—standard SFT on trajectories with no custom RL infrastructure needed.&nbsp;</li><li>The total cost to reproduce performance levels of the best previous open-source result only is <strong>roughly $400</strong> on commodity cloud GPUs, more than 25 times cheaper than many existing approaches that require complex distributed setups and still fall short on performance.</li><li>The total cost to reproduce top open-weight models in industry, such as Devstral Small 2, is <strong>only $12,000</strong>.</li></ul><p>We believe bringing the cost of replicating strong coding agents down to a few hundred dollars will unlock research that simply wasn't possible before.

              <h2>What Happened</h2>
              <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/security/114866/hackers-steal-limited-data-on-20-of-soundcloud-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundCloud announced it had discovered unauthorised activity on its platform</a>. The incident allowed an attacker to map publicly available SoundCloud profile data to email addresses for approximately 20% of its users. The impacted data included 30M unique email addresses, names, usernames, avatars, follower and following counts and, in some cases, the user’s country. The attackers later attempted to extort SoundCloud before publicly releasing the data the following month.</p>

            <p>We, the Xfce team are excited to share some great news!</p>

            <p>After careful consideration, we’ve decided on a meaningful way to use the generous donations from our community: funding longtime Xfce core developer <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/kelnos" target="_blank">Brian Tarricone</a> to create xfwl4, a brand-new Wayland compositor for Xfce.</p>

            <p>This initiative will utilize a significant portion of the project’s donated funds, but we believe it’s an important investment in Xfce’s future.</p>
 
            <p>The goal is, that xfwl4 will offer the same functionality and behavior as xfwm4 does, or as much as possible considering the differences between X11 and Wayland. Using xfwl4 should feel just like using xfwm4 on X11. We even plan to reuse the existing xfwm4 configuration dialogs and xfconf settings to ensure a seamless transition.</p>

            <p>Xfwl4 will not be based on the existing xfwm4 code. Instead, it will be written from scratch in rust, using <a href="https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/" target="_blank">smithay</a> building blocks.</p>

            <h3>Why doing a rewrite?</h3>

            <p>The first attempt at creating an Xfce Wayland compositor involved modifying the existing xfwm4 code to support both X11 and Wayland in parallel. However, this approach turned out to be the wrong path forward for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Xfwm4 is architected in a way that makes it very difficult to put the window management behavior behind generic interfaces that don't include X11 specifics.</li>
              <li>Refactoring Xfwm4 is risky, since it might introduce new bugs to X11. Having two parallel code bases will allow for rapid development and experimentation with the Wayland compositor, with zero risk to break xfwm4.</li>
              <li>Some X11 window management concepts just aren't available or supported by Wayland protocols at this time, and dealing with those differences can be difficult in an X11-first code base.</li>
              <li>Using the existing codebase would require us to use C and wlroots, even if a better alternative is available.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why to base xfwl4 on smithay?</h3>

            <p>Once the decision to write a compositor from scratch was done, the next major question was: Which Wayland support library to use as a base? In order to find an answer on that question Brian evaluated wlroots and smithay. The decision to use smithay as a base was done for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>            
              <li>smithay supports most/all official Wayland protocol extensions, as well as the wlroots protocols and some KDE protocols.</li>
              <li>smithay has no high level abstraction, as wlroots has. However, it allows for very deep customization of the graphics and input pipeline, as well as all aspects of Wayland protocol and desktop/shell handling.</li>
              <li>smithay has great documentation.</li>
              <li>Using rust makes it easier to avoid memory related bugs and decreases the chances of crashes, something that should never happen for a Wayland compositor.</li>
              <li>Rather subjective: Brian has a strong preference to write code in rust over writing code in C.</li>
              <li>wlroots is written in C, in a way which makes it very difficult to write <a href="https://way-cooler.org/blog/2019/04/29/rewriting-way-cooler-in-c.html" target="_blank">wlroots rust bindings</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Scope of the project</h3>

            <p>Besides getting feature parity with xfwm4, the xfwl4 project scope includes as well some other related tasks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Major changes to session-startup will be required, since on Wayland the compositor has to be the root of the session instead of xfce4-session.</li>
              <li>Support for the xdg-session-management protocol is another goal.</li>
              <li>As well support for XWayland is part of the roadmap.</li>
              <li>The build system of the Xfce CI container will need to be upgraded in order to support building rust code via meson.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Brian has already started work on the project, so stay tuned for the first development release of xfwl4, which we hope to share around mid-year.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Just for the fun of it, I thought I'd embark on a week-long quest to
generate millions of tokens and millions of lines of source code to
create one basic browser that can render HTML and CSS (no JS tho), and
hopefully I could use this to receive even more VC investments.</p>
<p>But then I remembered that I have something even better: a human
brain! It is usually better than any machine at coordinating and
thinking through things, so let's see if we can hack something together,
one human brain and one LLM agent brain!</p>
<p><video src="https://emsh.cat/content/one-human-one-agent-one-browser.webm" controls=""><a href="https://emsh.cat/content/one-human-one-agent-one-browser.webm">Demonstration of
one-agent-one-browser running with a bunch of different websites on
Linux/X11</a></video></p>
<p>The above might look like a simple .webm video, but it's actually a
highly sophisticated and advanced browser that was super hard to build,
encoded as pixels in a video file! Wowzers.</p>
<h2 id="day-1---starting-out">Day 1 - Starting out</h2>
<p>For extra fun when building this, I set these requirements for myself
and the agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have three days to build it</li>
<li>Not a single 3rd party Rust library/dependency allowed</li>
<li>Allowed to use anything (commonly) provided out of the box on the OS
it runs on</li>
<li>Should run on Windows, macOS and common Linux distributions</li>
<li>Should be able to render some websites, most importantly, my own
blog and Hacker News, should be easy right?</li>
<li>The codebase can always compile and be built</li>
<li>The codebase should be readable by a human, although code quality
isn't the top concern</li>
</ul>
<p>So with these things in mind, I set out on the journal to build a
browser "from scratch". I started with something really based, being
able to just render "Hello World". Then to be able to render some nested
tags. Added the ability of taking screenshots so the agent could use
that. Added specifications for HTML/CSS (which I think the agent never
used :| ), and tried to nail down the requirements for the agent to use.
Also started doing "regression" or "E2E" tests with the screenshotting
feature, so we could compare to some baseline images and so on. Added
the ability to click on links just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>After about a day together with Codex, I had something that could via
X11 and cURL, fetch and render websites when run, and the Cargo.lock is
empty. It was about 7500 lines long in total at that point, split across
files with all of them under 1000 lines long (which was a stated
requirement, so not a surprise).</p>
<h2 id="day-2---moving-on">Day 2 - Moving On</h2>
<p>Second day I got annoyed by the tests spawning windows while I was
doing other stuff, so added a --headless flag too. Did some fixes for
resizing the window, various compatibility fixes, some performance
issues and improved the font/text rendering a bunch. Workflow was
basically to pick a website, share a screenshot of the website without
JavaScript, ask Codex to replicate it following our instructions. Most
of the time was the agent doing work by itself, and me checking in when
it notifies me it was done.</p>
<h2 id="day-3---polish--cross-platform--day-4">Day 3 - Polish &amp;
Cross-platform (+ day 4)</h2>
<p>Third day we made large changes, lots of new features and a bunch of
new features supported. More regression tests, fixing performance
issues, fixing crashes and whatnot. Also added scrolling because this is
a mother fucking browser, it has to be able to scroll. Added some debug
logs too because that'll look cool in the demonstration video above, and
also added support for the back button because it was annoying to start
from scratch if I clicked the wrong link while testing.</p>
<p>At the end of the third day we also added starting support for macOS,
and managed to get a window to open, and the tests to pass. Seems to
work OK :) Once we had that working, we also added Windows support,
basically the same process, just another platform after all.</p>
<p>Then the fourth day (whaaaat?) was basically polish, fixing CI for
all three platforms, making it pass and finally cutting a release based
on what got built in CI. Still all within 72 hours (3 days * 24 hours,
which obviously this is how you count days).</p>
<h2 id="the-results-after-3-days-70-hours">The results after ~3 days
(~70 hours)</h2>
<p>And here it is, in all its glory, made in ~20K lines of code and
under 72 hours of total elapsed time from first commit to last:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser"><img src="https://emsh.cat/content/one-agent-one-browser-hn.png" alt="Screenshot of one-agent-one-browser running on X11"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could try compiling it yourself (zero Rust dependencies, so it's
really fast :) ), or you can find binaries built on CI
here:<br><small><a href="https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser/releases"><span>https://github.com/embedding-shapes/one-agent-one-browser/releases</span></a></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can clone the repository, build it and try it out for yourself.
It's not great, I wouldn't even say it's good, but it works, and
demonstrates that one person with one agent can build a browser from
scratch.</p>
<p>This is what the "lines of code" count ended up being after all was
said and done, including support for three OSes:</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>One human using one agent seems far more effective than one human
using thousands of agents</li>
<li>One agent can work on a single codebase for hours, making real
progress on ambitious projects</li>
<li>This could probably scale to multiple humans too, each equipped with
their own agent, imagine what we could achieve!</li>
<li>Sometimes slower is faster and also better</li>
<li>The human who drives the agent might matter more than how the agents
work and are set up, the judge is still out on this one</li>
</ul>
<p>If one person with one agent can produce equal or better results than
"hundreds of agents for weeks", then the answer to the question: "Can we
scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem?", probably
has a more pessimistic answer than some expected.</p>

<span id="cb3-16"><span>+</span></span>
<span id="cb3-17"><span>+For extra fun when building this, I set these requirements for myself and the agent:</span></span>

<span id="cb3-22"><span>+- Should run on Windows, macOS and common Linux distributions</span></span>
<span id="cb3-23"><span>+- Should be able to render some websites, most importantly, my own blog and Hacker News, should be easy right?</span></span>
<span id="cb3-24"><span>+- The codebase can always compile and be built</span></span>
<span id="cb3-25"><span>+- The codebase should be readable by a human, although code quality isn't the top concern</span></span>

<span id="cb3-142"><span>+## Takeaways</span></span>
<span id="cb3-143"><span>+</span></span>
<span id="cb3-144"><span>+- One human using one agent seems far more effective than one human using thousands of agents</span></span>
<span id="cb3-145"><span>+- One agent can work on a single codebase for hours, making real progress on ambitious projects</span></span>
<span id="cb3-146"><span>+- This could probably scale to multiple humans too, each equiped with their own agent, imagine what we could achieve!</span></span>
<span id="cb3-147"><span>+- Sometimes slower is faster and also better</span></span>
<span id="cb3-148"><span>+- The human who drives the agent might matter more than how the agents work and are setup, the judge is still out on this one</span></span>
<span id="cb3-149"><span>+</span></span>
<span id="cb3-150"><span>+If one person with one agent can produce equal or better results than "hundreds of agents for weeks", then the answer to the question: "Can we scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem?", probably has a more pessimistic answer than some expected. </span></span></code></pre></div>
